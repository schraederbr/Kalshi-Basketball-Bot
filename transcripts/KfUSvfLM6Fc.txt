in the basket and he said you know you have to decide are you going to change something he said no were not going to change anything were just going to do what we do Clemson wins the tip Chase Hunter handling the point guard responsibilities for the Tigers were going to have his hands full all evening long having to deal with Kihei Clark on the perimeter Evan Galloway attacking the basket unable to finish strong defensive stand for Virginia in the first possession and Galloway likes to drive the ball to the basket and so Virginia they did a nice job to prevent him from getting to all the way to the goal without helping theyre going to need to do that because Clemsons on a threepoint tear as well and Dan thats new for Galloway we watched him a season ago at Boston College and he was simply a threepoint shooter hes expanded his game this season oh what a pass another one of the areas of concern for Virginia missing chip shots Point Blank layups this time it turns into an opportunity for Hunter Tyson unable to finish on the three but the offensive rebound for PJ Hall wait how often has Tony Bennett and his staff seen that in the last couple of Virginia games that is an easy layup and the Cavaliers just miss how much of it do you feel is Virginia thinking about it at this point I know Tony Bennett said he didnt want to talk to his teams about it to lose confidence as Ian shefflin is unable to connect from three but how much do you think is in Virginias mind well I think its in Virginias mind but that time I think Franklin just expected to get more pressure these Clemson guys were big and he was trying to make sure he didnt get his shot blocked Applause TA Clark Eugene Gardner in his spot right along that Baseline where hes normally automatic unable to finish for Van benopause coming up with the offensive rebound a second chance opportunity for Virginia Applause boy Corey a Vander plus misses a wide open three Franklin misses the layup Gardner misses short on a shot that he makes 80 percent of the time now thats the kind of thing that can get into your head if youre the Virginia Cavaliers well one thing that Virginia has heard a lot of is they get the turnover Reese Beekman getting out in transition Applause its one thing theyve heard a lot about is their shooting Rose as of late it continues with Armon Franklin unable to finish with the three in the corner but another Second Chance opportunity for Virginia thank you Gardner looking for the foul there and again PJ Hall inside is so big and so strong Gardner is a wide body too but all is every bit is wide and is strong and as athletic DJ Hall one of the best athletes in the ACC especially on the front Ford Hunter Tyson missing off the top of the Kia right now these two teams both struggling from the field Clemson 004 Virginia 05 to start this game of course were scoreless already close to three minutes having been played thats a nice job by Galloway hes six for three and a half must be hard for Clark to shoot over him thats a tough shot again you can say thats a mislayup but thats a very very tough shot it is that Kihei Clark getting in amongst the trees unable to finish the layup and right now the student section still standing waiting for the first points of this game to be scored by either team but of course theyll sit down when the whos get a bucket getting to the freethrow line who have the opportunity for two the foul on Ben bandeploss in the painted area and the chance for our first points of this game to happen at the freethrow line and Ryan Dunn at the scores table ready to check in for Tony Bennetts wahoo Music now shuffling is a guy hes a 68 freethrow shooter at conference play but this is a guy they dont run any plays for him they dont really throw him the ball but if he can score six or eight points get six or eight rebounds hes a very good passer he can be a key to this Clemson team and he has played very well during this hot stretch that theyre on well hes done something no one else has been able to do in this game which is four points right now so two points for chef and as he checks out RJ Godfrey stepping in for him they totally changed their look with Godfrey hes much more athletic uh shefflin is a little bit more of a banger Applause TA Clark from three unable to get it to go down look a little bit like he hesitated on that shot he should be taken to Virginia oh of seven from the field to start the game Applause Cavaliers theres no question theyre playing really well on the defensive end again this is a Clemson team that has scored 90 points 90 plus points two games in a row and three of their last four now that is not over and back no it is youre allowed to throw the ball in the back court he never possessed it in the front floor not a popular decision here however its the right play and of course the fans here will think that was the wrong decision and it ends up with Brevin Galloway knocking down to three and knocking down the three Cory under heavy pressure that was not an open shot Applause Gardner wont hesitate still unable to get it to go right now Virginia trailing 50 anything got to drive the ball to the basket I believe so that they have to get their guys Kihei Clark Reese beating the getting downhill and then they can play inside out make plays for their teammates as well a nice fire from Hunter up top to Galloway gets a painted area but denied by Ryan Dunn and done with the finish on the alleyoop the first bucket for Virginia and the foul happens in great fashion and Corey that brings us to our first break of the game and that gives us an opportunity to pause and remember Susie checks in comes up with a block shot and turns it into points on the other end of the floor Corey were sitting here at half court and were right behind Kihei Clark and he throws that pass and the first thought in my mind is what is he doing wheres that ball going and Ryan Dunn comes flying in that was a very impressive play if thats going to be your first point so thats a pretty good way to get them some styleport to Ryan Dunn trying to complete threepoint plays able to do so not much scoring in the first five minutes of this game thus far 53 Clemson leads Virginia but Kihei Clark continues to put pressure on Chase Hunter thats something in my opinion Dan that hes going to have to do this entire game not allow Chase Hunter the company bring the basketball I agree with you Corey Chase Hunter is actually a converted point guard and hes played the position very well throughout the year but this is a real challenge for him tonight Raymond Galloway attacking Reese Beekman unable to get it to go but Godfrey with the offensive rebound attempt doesnt go Virginia with numbers trying to get out in transition interesting to see Virginia not playing a little faster with the scoring struggles trying to get some easy baskets and its tough going to be tough to do that against Clemson because they are not a team that rebounds the ball offensively they like to get back nice fine from Beekman to Arman Franco whos able to finish on the layup on the interior and just like that weve got a tie at five beautiful pass by Reese beef Clemson theyre not sending anybody to the board there may be one guy and the other four fall back they do not want to give up any easy baskets theyre not a defense thats going to get a lot of steals similar defensive coaches Styles between these two coaches as Jaden Gardner tacks the basket picks up the foul against PJ Hall will be his first this is a really nice job by Beekman to drive in and draw the defense and nobody sees Franklin and see Franklin is playing out there hes playing against the bigger guy hes matched up against Hunter Tyson and Tyson just lost him in that traffic trying to help out one of the best things for a guard especially a guy who shoots the basketball from Beyond the arc S Arman Franklin does is to see a layup go in early absolutely get some points on the board build some confidence for you moving forward and its its interesting Hunter Tyson has four or five inches on Armon Franklin but Tyson does not play offensively inside so the Cavaliers like everybody else does can afford to guard him with a smaller guy Virginia on a 70 run after getting behind Five to zero and after the pressure we saw kieh Clark putting on Chase Hunter Brad Brownell goes to of course Chases younger brother Dylan to bring to allow him to handle the basketball I think he he might be a little bit more of a traditional point guard but he doesnt shoot it anywhere well anywhere near as well as his brother no he does not but he is that traditional point guard but turns it over Reese Beekman out on the break in the Finish thats what were talking about Corey playing against a bigger guy who doesnt really play the way a guard does out on the perimeter you see Rhys Beekman of course Virginias best perimeter Defender taking on the challenge of guarding Hunter Tyson although he gives up a couple of inches Chase Hunter off the mark from three but the offensive rebound by PJ Hall who finishes with some Authority thats Beekman and McNeely over there trying to block out PJ Hall and I can tell you thats a losing proposition youve seen that movie before Im sure PJ Hall is so athletic and so strong Dan hes a kid he was a gymnast as a young a young person he can kick his foot well above his head as we see Reese Beekman lining up at three knocking it down shooting close to 37 percent from Beyond the threepoint Arc this season well as a team in the last six games the Cavaliers are shooting only 28 percent from Beyond The Arc and thats after they shot 38 in their first 21 games so you know Tony Bennett is relaxing a little bit and also this crowd has relaxed a little bit well hey look you think about Virginia right now the last two games those two losses coming in both on the road at Boston College and North Carolina you have to believe that the whos are happy to be back at jpj in front of their friends and family and of course those who support the program Applause figured youd see kafaro tonight against this big Clemson lineup Clemsons physical and of course when you think physical you think Francisco caffrel he has to be one the guy stepping in there and of course Tony Bennett trusts him especially on the defensive end of the floor another stop for Virginia another turnover Reese Beekman getting out of transition but Virginia will slow it down Kia Clark recognizing nothing on The Possession Mark Beekman made that steal but the guy who made the play was done guns had an impact early in this game Dan call That You Dont See often a threesecond call on Virginia one cathero has to go up but get a shot on the board absolutely but heres that steal were talking about Dunn creates some problems Beekman capitalizes the Cavaliers turning off defense into offense and so they have to leave skills in the game and Reese Speakman has converted a couple of baskets here Kihei Clark nice penetration Beekman very confidently hitting that threepoint shot and Corey the Cavaliers confidence has started to roll you see there started over eight and have made their last four now thats still only 33 but its a lot better than zero its much better than zero and you consider the start of this game it took Virginia close to four minutes to score their first field goal but now seem to have something working for them offensively but again youve heard talk about is being created by their defense once again kie a Clark putting the pressure on Chase Hunter outside Clemson having to start his defense much further out on the perimeter because of Virginias defensive pressure under Tyson Off the Mark good pressure against that shot and thats done flying out there again this is an interesting lineup the Cavaliers have in the game youre not sure they practice much with this one but at this point Tony Bennett trying to get anything going team Murray getting into the game as well Applause that was a bad pass if he makes a good pass I think Clark has a threepoint shot was that a bad pass because of the recipient his ankles he throws it in his shooting pocket now the pass to caparo he doesnt want to shoot the ball but he made a nice pass to get rid of it so a hockey assistant absolutely on that possession Virginia now two for five from Beyond the threepoint Arc Galloway trying to split the Trap Hunter Tyson lines up another one unable to get it to go and Hunter Tysons had a tough time getting it going offensively here to start this game then hes hanging out around the threepoint line I think he needs to try to take the ball to the basket Applause last season Hunter Tyson started the game with three threepointers against Virginia in this building in a game that Clemson won by double figures so hes had success here but not early Ryan Dunn coming over the offensive rebound the putback and so far hes been the guys been a Difference Maker for me absolutely how about that Corey he has the ball right next to the basket he throws the ball to the corner and he gets it right back on an air ball so Dunns doing everything right welcome to basketball in 2023 they give up layups with threepoint attempts but yet find a way to score the twos Virginia with a 10point lead Music we could have caught you on grounds back in the mid 70s wow we oh our hair was all puffed out everywhere we didnt wear hats ah okay okay so the the hair it was actually your hat couldnt get them on I think Brad Brown Now is really upset with his guys the way theyre executing on offense theyre just not moving and moving the ball Louisiana Hall lines up a three Banks it in and weve seen that from PJ before and also seen the shrug afterwards but youre talking about a young man who is 10 of 20 on his last threepointers now 11 for 21 as hes shooting the basketball extremely well as of late Isaac Emily off the mark that was a basket Clemson desperately needed just as Virginias first couple of baskets settled him down lets see if that settles the Tigers down a little bit on offense inside to PJ Hall of course going up against the very physical Francisco Cafaro who picks up the foul thats all thats a hard matchup for cathero because PJ Hall can match his strength and as you pointed out Corey Cafaro cant match PJ Halls athleticism no theyre very few bigs in the ACC and college basketball that can match PJ Halls athleticism Tony Bennett recognizing that going to Bennett vandepos Jaden Gardner back in the lineup but a big hand for Ryan Dunn and capro as theyve led the charge Virginia taking this lead nice hands by Bennett vandepost McNeely on the break goes to the euro to finish I didnt know what he was going to do there Corey but that was some move Tyson was lining him up and never got a chance to try to block him hes a hall taking on Bennett menopause attacking Durham once again showing off his athleticism in the finish and PJ Hall comes into this game scooting 65 from the field over his last eight games hes playing great basketball and he just apologized to the referee for yelling at him so hes polite as well Applause of course you would recognize that as the gentleman that you are and also he didnt want the rough Matt out so but the Cavaliers again they have played very well on defense and Beetle just not be strong enough with the buff look at this I dont know is that can that be a Euro Step that look like a Scandinavian oh youre going to go specifically to Scandinavia that was that was really different Applause of course Scandinavia is part of Europe so it all flies Ill Ill let Ill refer to you on the geography with that one this is a tough matchup from if you see the Trap coming immediately with PJ Hall catching it will leave an open opportunity for Hunter Tyson who still is unable to get it to go from Beyond The Arc Hunter Tyson now over four in this game and oh for five excuse me oh for five from Beyond the 30 a Cavaliers dodged a bullet there because Tyson will make many more of those in her Miss Applause third turnover for Virginia Applause one of the things youve seen from Brad Brownell is Hunter Tyson lines up another and gets a friendly bounce here the compounds of jpj to knock down his first three just a matter of time its really hard to leave him and the way Cavaliers play defensively somebody and you react back to them but if Hunter Tyson gets that much time on a three hes going to make most of them well you know I can appreciate the fact that hes over five and still lines it up confidently hes tame very unable to finish this is another layup for Virginia with the whos holding a fourpoint lead 720 remaining here in the first half look at those numbers 56 from the field 37 rebounds a game the CIS turnover ratio off the charts now they havent done that today theyve got four turnovers in this game and Virginia theyre all steals which means the Cavaliers have gotten a chance to get out and run which is why the Cavaliers at this point are credited with a seven to nothing advantage in Fast Break points how often do you see that on a Virginia stat sheet well you know Virginia actually held North Carolinas scoreless on Fast Break points on Saturday which doesnt happen often well one of the things Virginias done great a great job of in this game is turning defense into offense where the offense was struggling they got some easy ones getting out in transition to continue to play stingy defense against Chase Hunter and again Reese Beekman getting the job done has been steals early now its a block thats the same thing this is steel Corey tip the ball to one of your teammates you get a chance to go nice job by Clemson getting back on defense foreign Franklin attacking the basket is able to get there finishing with the left hand and Franklin has been much more aggressive getting downhill attacking the basket as of late not relying as much on the threes now wow you do that you create openings for yourself shooting threes that was a nice bond from Chase Hunter Cross Court to Josh Beadle was unable to knock it down and Clemson struggling from Beyond a threepoint Arc we talked about how great theyve been shooting coming in but that has not been the case here tonight camping in conference play Beatles only a 21 threepoint shooter just doesnt look like hes shooting the ball with a lot of confidence to make Corey well Van de Plazas plane banged up of course you know hes close to my age which means that hes been playing college basketball for a long time but Ben van implies has played being banged up a little bit you know Virginia started off eight now made eight of their last 12 and getting good looks on the offensive end of the floor thats one of these Beekman in my opinion needs to look at taking after already knocking down 13 in this game Applause possession turns out in a turnover and an opportunity a threepoint play for Chase Hunter who comes up with the steal and turns it into a bucket on the other end of the floor sport Ryan the ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins tomorrow at Greensboro Coliseum with every matchup above the championship game right here on acc Network and the ESPN app our first round coverage begins at 12 30 Eastern with the nothing but net crew Applause of course hanging out with my goddamn Bonner who actually coached in the ACC tournament the Virginia Womens many years a night when I coached the Virginia women we didnt have an ACC for women really thats correct we played a state tournament against other schools from Virginia there was no womens ACC wow Im not gonna date you on that one Im not going to even mention the fact that you have been doing this for 43 years on television well let that go Applause Kevin Galloway attacking once again another blocked shot from Reese Beekman this time unable to keep it in bounds but still denying an opportunity defensively Corey the Virginia Defense has been intense tonight its extremely impressive Clemson has had to battle for everything theyve gotten then when you look at this Virginia Defense its not as good as the Virginia but defenses have been traditionally but their offense has covered up those deficiencies the majority of the year shot clock down to five seconds Chase Hunters had to deal with Kihei Clark all evening long Kihei with a great defensive play but Ian Chapel coming up with the loose ball in the second chance and thats what shuffling does he just hangs around and he gets loose balls he gets offensive rebounds that was a great defensive stand by Virginia bad luck there but Clemson keeps battling Applause Chase Hunter getting it getting his hands on the basketball and that will go to Clemson but thats really good help by the Clemson Tigers it was not a very good pass to Gardner Kihei Clark threw that one into traffic coaches always tell you dont throw the ball into trouble and Kihei threw it into trouble there and they ended up losing the ball so the Cavaliers with another turnover they have forced turnovers Cory but they have committed him as well they have five turnovers for Virginia who only averaged theyre on the eighth and they saw excuse me a little under nine the three oclock picks up some steal and attacks the basket wow but a great block getting back by Ben Middlebrooks not allowing that to happen Cavaliers one of the best in the country at not turning the ball over and again thats a funny looking pass by Kihei Clark and Alex Hemingway getting on the floor after it with Reverend Galloway turns it right back over great Hustle by Armon Franklin not allowing the easy attempt for Hunter Hunter Tyson Cavalier defense bails them out again its not often you see a Virginia team have a couple of possessions in a row with such poor passing continue with five turnovers in the last five minutes uncharacteristic for the hoos especially here on their home court Franklin put three in the corner is good Virginia extending the lead to five and Galloway was right there that was not bad defense by Galloway nice job by middle Brooks the force to pass out and thats just one if Franklins gonna make that Clemsons going to have a problem but we mentioned earlier Franklin getting a layup seeing the ball go through it opens up things for you on the perimeter Chase Hunter trying to get by Kihei Clark once again great Hands by Kihei Clark and Hunter did everything he needs to do to get to the rim just unable to get the shot too much dribbling and his teammates are standing around watching him dribble move the ball Move Yourself and if youre going to try to play oneonone out there with Kihei Clark thats a bad idea that is not going to be a battle youre going to win often but Jaden Gardner Off the Mark unable to finish not add any more cushion to this lead for Virginia Clemson with the opportunity here offensively doing it without PJ Hall the nice fine for Middlebrooks to Tyson whos able to score the layup under the basket nice give and go action the oldest play in the game of basketball and theres Tyson using he doesnt have quite the size advantage against Dunn but he got inside I dont think Hemingway can go on he had Croc attacking the basket the foul unable to finish it off for the Kia clock being aggressive Virginia holding on to a threepoint lead to Clemson Tigers not going away here to jpj so they dont win across from us the section across from us they sit down okay thats those are students and friends and family but the who crew the band they do not sit down even though I look up and now theyre standing up they sit down during timeouts well I I think thats they need to be more committed than that well they text they emailed me and said they never sit down so again just how much influence did you have around here the people on the The Who crew are emailing you hahaha an opportunity to do accpm here in the building earlier today Mark Packer Taylor Tannenbaum visiting jpj first time Mark Packers ever been in jbj really jpjs been here hes been here a while a bunch of great guests on the show earlier today as PJ Hall gets in there and Im not speaking of myself I am talking of course Carla Williams Ralph Sampson and of course the great job Sean Grisham up there John Grisham yeah I mean Jason Williford actually was on early associate head coach for the University of Virginia Ryan Dunn whos off to a great start in this game three of three from the field eight points to lead Virginia and scoring early in the basket as PJ Hall picks up his second foul a hall is athletic but I dont know that he can stay with Don if Dunns going to try to drive by him out on the perimeter yeah very few guys who can defend Ryan Dunn especially when you talk about his athleticism in a different match up here because Brad rondella going with Paul guarding done and Tyson on benevanaphos who gets to the basket and gets the and one opportunity posting up Brevin Galloway and you know thats not something that vanderplas does a lot of hes not really comfortable with that postup game but hes got a tremendous size advantage against Galloway and theres nothing Galloway can do thats a nice move now of course vanderplas really struggles from the line but when you have a mustache like that does it really matter how long yes okay I was just checking now that you talk about how people looked in the 70s thats the 70s look right there but remember I did mention were closest in age a nice find from Galloway to Hunter Tyson the easy bucket Virginia scrambling defensively trying to take away the passing Lane and they just got spread out and when Vander plus got knocked off balance the Cavaliers had no way to cover everybody if you can leave somebody alone though I wouldnt leave Hunter Tyson alone no hes not the guy to leave alone playing great basketballs Kihei Clark lines up a three unable to knock it down what a Play What a play and the Clemson bench wants that off of gun while he was out of bounds no done done left to court inbounds this is an air ball and Don is going to go up hes inbounds and the ball is out of bounds when it touches something out of bounds now yes it did bounce off PJ Hall and hit done but PJ Hall was already out of bounds and by rule its out of bounds when it touches the first thing out of bounds and since its BJ Hall its Virginia ball only 12 seconds left on the shot clock thats why I like hanging out with you so you break down the stuff that I really dont know the rules on I just make it a attacking the basket Arman Franklin unable to finish Franklin getting involved in the mix and thats going to stay with Virginia Alex Hemingway out of bounds and right now Hunter Tyson getting his team together allowing them to know they knew they stopped right now Brad Brownell and Tony Bennett will have an opportunity to talk to their teams here during the timeout and when you think about Hunter Couture missing a chunk of the middle of this season that really derailed the Hokies Midway through Applause we talked about Clemson and how hot they were with their season low in points in the first half is 23 and theyve had that in the Boston College game that they lost so the Cavalier defense has been outstanding here in the first half against the hot team the five second difference between the shot clock and a game clock Applause Im on Franklin 43 gets a great look at it unable to finish Hunter Tyson with the rebound four seconds remaining Tyson gets up a good look but unable to finish it Virginia 151 when leading at the half and Clemson has won seven games this season and when trailing at the half so stick around wouldnt have been able to get out and go that has really helped them they have a seven to two advantage in Fast Break points as McNeely scores here and of course weve got a fivepoint game the Virginias shooting 357 from the field and theyre shooting the best percentage right now Clemson had just over 32 but this Clemson team has seven comeback wins after trailing at halftime so far from over here as we start the second half looked like an offensive rebound opportunity there for Gardner unable to Corral it and Clemson with opportunity here to make it a one possession game now Virginia doesnt want to have another scoring drought they went almost five minutes without scoring in the first half they dont want to start the second half the same way Applause DJ Hall backing down and then vanderbloss and is able to finish through the contact but how about that court he lost the ball on the way up but hes still able to control it and guide it into the basket and Dan one thing youve done a lot of Clemson games you know that PJ Hall had offseason surges two actually two offseason surgeries hes just now getting his legs Underneath Him becoming the player that we saw from Solomons last year well theres no question about that and thats one of the things that at this time of the year were talking about your net and your quad ones and quad fours and all that kind of stuff and Clemson had two bad losses they lost to South Carolina and they lost to Loyola Chicago and in both of those games PJ Hall wasnt healthy and so PJ Hall healthy this is a much different Clemson team now of course they lost the Louisville the other night but they didnt score and Louisville made a lot of shots heres what were talking about and theyve got four quad one wins but the metrics the the analytics the net doesnt like them and you see Joe lunardi has them as the first four out and theyre number 72 overall I remember 68 teams go so theyre close of course as we get down to under five seconds on the shot clock Virginia is one of the best in the country the Enterprise coming up with the offensive rebound the put back Second Chance points once again not something that hes known for but uncharacteristically coming up with the offensive rebound the putback from dominating a much smaller player Chase Hunter six foot three and vanderplas just used his size and strength to go right around him DJ Hall Once Again faking the handoff attacking the basket unable to finish that time vanderpost standing his ground defensively and he got some help Beekman came over and I think really bothered them we go back to your conversation regarding Clemson Kentucky has that same bad loss against South Carolina but it doesnt seem to be held against them the same way as being held against the Tigers Applause well if you can understand that thing you explain oh no they certainly dont you have been my goto on everything NCAA tournament for 30 years now my friend thats the first basket of the game for Jaden Gardner and for Virginia to be ahead by seven with that being the first basket of the game for the guy whos carried him basically is really a positive sign for the Cavaliers absolutely Gardner coming off a doubledouble 19 points 12 rebounds at North Carolina on Saturday and as you mentioned hes been their guy offensively for the last few years PJ Hall has been the guy offensively to start in the second half of Clemson boy that that is some Play Again by PJ Hall but the guy who made that play was Chase Hunter he stopped trying to dribble the ball oneonone against Kihei Clark hes driving the ball and passing it thank you some heavy English wow on that were from Jaden Gardner and of course the flex afterwards just showing off the guns a little bit but check out the English on this one then wow this is a play where this is just the strength of Gardner I dont know how he got that in the basket because its strength against strength and thats BJ Halls third personal foul and maybe thats the best way for the Cavaliers to handle him get him on the bench yeah thats the only way theyve been able to handle PJ Hall and most teams have been able to handle PJ Hall as of late but Jaden Gardner who started the game 04 has now made his last two field goal attempts but unable to finish at the free throw line and that wasnt a confident free throw he was chasing him and left his hands you know sometimes I think Corey guys dont shoot free throws well because they dont want to go to the free throw line I think a good freethrow shooter has to want to go to the line did you ever go through that as a player yeah absolutely not me anytime to score give it to me Ill take it free throw line shots bad shots no matter what Ill take it under Tyson on the drive gets to the midrange pulls up unable to finish but great job defensively by Armon Franklin not allowing him to get to the paint stayed in front of him but again Hunter Tyson isnt looking to drive the ball of the basket he wants to shoot that pullup jump shot but thats really good defense by Franklin lets see if Tyson can guard Franklin that pocket pass to Gardner weve seen him miss a couple of those thats normally money in the bank for Jaden Gardner but unable to finish on that possession Music Franklin I think has had some difficulty on the offensive end shooting over Hunter Tyson so thats a pretty good matchup between those two yeah great matchup between those 200 Tyson of course a guy thats an ACC Player of the Year candidate as well as their first team whereas Greece Beekman comes up with another steal and the fell hole a great block by Chase Hunter getting back not allowing Reese Beekman to have the dump but thats one where maybe Beekman needs to take it underneath to avoid that because Hunter can really get up honor for the three on the other end unable to finish it but thats one where you get the right to come down to take any shot you want after that defensive play what do you think that Brad Brownell might disagree with you but that chase Hunter has uh you know hes really struggled offensively and hes got an open shot theres no reason for him not to take it and Applause once again backing down goes to the fade away unable to finish Gardner getting involved with the offensive rebound and his effort forces Hunter Tyson to lose that off of his leg how about this block Corey you think you have a dunk youre going against another guard I mean through the ball right to him and Beekman figures hes got a dunk but what a great job right now playing to try to get one of those top four seeds in the NCAA yeah youd like to get a double buy when youre in a situation like Virginia in the ACC tournament you dont need to play extra games to build up your resume their resume is fine now this recent tough streak theyve had have knocked him down to the fourth number four seed they had been up on the two line there according to our Joe lunardi so theyd like to get things back in gear here and of course much respect to Joey brackets but Ive been talking to you youve been informing me about the NCAA tournament for the last 14 years that Ive been in TV we used to have our conversations at the ACC tournament when you would tell me how things work so now tell me how this works with Clemson theyre 135 right now in the ACC which of course people are dragging through the mud but its still a very good conference this season this Clemson team right now not in the field according to Joey brackets what do they need to do moving forward they just need to win games Corey its very simple they have put themselves in a position where they can be considered uh and if they just they just need to win games this is an important game for them today but I think that they they have to win out in the regular season and win a couple of games in the ACC tournament there are other teams playing in other tournaments you just dont know how the results are going to go so you just keep playing and try to win as many games as you can well for those of you out there listening both Clemson and Virginia fans as gardeners unable to finish but there goes poppy Francisco kakaro coming up with the offensive rebound and the second chance opportunity at the free throw line and I was mentioning people out there Clemson Virginia they should pay to listen sit down and listen to Dan Bonner breakdown how things work with the NCAA tournament you have called the NCAA tournament for how long now uh this is the one coming up will be my 37th 37th you know let me just remind you that was well before the science of Bracketology you know we didnt have this stuff going on 37 years ago well if you really want to know how the NCAA tournament Works hang out with Dan Bonner for a while you will feel much smarter because of it now I dont know that hanging out with me makes anybody feel smarter but what I will tell you I can tell you for certain right now nobody is in the NCAA tournament you know we talk about whos in and whos out wrong nobodys in right at the moment now there are some teams that are out uh because teams have already lost in conference tournaments some teams did not qualify for their conference tournament theres a few teams that are still uh theyre in that transition period so there are some teams that are out but I can guarantee you that at this point nobody is in because they have the opportunity to play in their conference tournaments and win that automatic qualifier you say very few teams are out as well well if you still if you still have a chance to play in your conference tournament youre not out because no matter how strange it can be and theres a big three by Franklin who expected Virginia Tech to win the ACC tournament last year I dont believe anyone expected it going in except for Mike young and his Squad but they was able to get it done in representing the ACC in the NCAA tournament as the automatic qualifier a year ago and of course next week we will see all 15 ACC teams getting involved in Greensboro to try to make that happen as the pass from Middlebrook to Alex Hemingway a little bit high and now the eighth turnover for Clemson and Clemson I mean Corey theyve only scored four points in the second half and weve played seven minutes and that is a really nice looking shot by Franklin you saw that Hunter Tyson was there but not close enough I mean Tyson with his height Advantage its hard for Franklin to shoot over him so nice job by Franklin to create some space to get that shot off and we both know how important it is for Franklin to get and make quality shots for Virginia hes their leading scorer on the season as Franklin gets it a free throw line the midrange pullup is good and Brad Brown now calls time out because he knows that Arman Franklin is a guy who can get hot is that there are no elite team I personally feel that when Virginias making shots they can absolutely beat Corey theres no question about that these guys I mean this is a Clemson team coming in here thats scored more than 90 points two games in a row theyre on Pace to score 40 and Armon Franklin has started to heat up for the Cavaliers the way Virginia plays defense will keep them in any game they play if they make shots they can beat anybody if they dont make shots well the other team anybody can beat them but this Tony Bennett team has a chance to be an elite team and Corey Ill tell you something I think that Duke is coming on you know they were not a very offensively explosive team early in the year I think theyre becoming more explosive offensively you know NC State they got whacked by Clemson the other day but that is a dangerous team and you know Miami has a really good team I mean look at the guys Miami has there are four guys on that Miami team that might make one of the all ACC teams they can put points on board that lost to Florida State as a head scratcher but I think there are teams in the ACC that if they get in the NCAA tournament depending on matchups they can go away and I believe that thats the point that you know Ive really been trying to make regarding the ACC with so many different styles of plays PJ Hall goes to the jump up and is able to finish the first points in the last four and a half minutes for Clemson but with so many different styles coaching Styles play of play for these ACC teams It prepares you for the NCAA tournament so when you get to the NCAA tournament most teams havent seen all the different styles at the ACC team see which is part of the reason why you have so much success three ACC teams in the elite eight of season to go and and Corey the teams are better than the metrics say they are yes the teams at the bottom of the ACC have struggled this year but the teams at the top of the ACC I think can compete with anybody in the country sauce Beetle to the basket the nice finish with the left hand off the glass Beetle hasnt been a big time scorer for the Tigers but a timely basket there and a little bit of nervousness here on the part of the Virginia fans the you know reclemson as you mentioned before they have made a specialty of making comebacks Isaac merely lining up the three knocking it down keeping the Tigers at Bay a big basket as you mentioned the crowd here starting to get a little nervous with Clemson scoring on the last two possessions that was a strong answer from the first year but what a nice job dribbling away from the defense into that shot lots of times when a guy relocates its hard for him to make the shotgun McNeely another Tyson going to work in the painted area going against a strong Defender and Ryan Dunn theyre still able to get the bucket and again Hunter Tyson doesnt do a lot of that but when he does he can be pretty good and he doesnt really have much of a size advantage against Dunn Applause really lines up another three knocks it down that actually will be a twopointer Doug sermon saying his foot was on the line and he did that with a catch and shoot no dribble there Applause some versatility Alex Hemingway trying to return the favor knocks down to three on the wing off of the dribble penetration by Hunter Tyson Tyson trying to fire up his team he mostly right now quieting the Virginia crowd well they made their last four I mean they were really struggling to shoot the ball shooting only 30 percent but four in a row thatll get everybodys attention and heres an offensive foul against capital Applause Music Virginia holding on to a 10point lead 953 here back at jpj damn weve had a bit of an offensive explosion here in the second half well compared to the first half each of the teams Corey shooting 50 percent Clemson 612 Virginia 7 for 14 the Cavaliers have knocked down two threes as well now Brad Brownell guys we they can put points on the board so the Cavaliers theyve got to continue to score its hard to hold this Clemson team down for the entire game owner Tyson continues to encourage his team youre talking about a fifth year the alltime leader in games played for the Clemson Tigers as Clemson goes inside to PJ Hall whos unable to finish got a good look just unable to get it to go benvenopause standing his ground youre right it was close Corey but it was very well contested by vanderplas nice five for Kihei Clark to Isaac McNeely the finish the foul opportunity for the and one a dime by Kihei on great cut by McNeil and again I thought where the heck is he throwing that ball really nice job by McNeely I mean hes not even in the picture and Kihei Clark finds him and the other thing Kihei Clark has done a nice job passing the ball he you know was a little loose with the ball early a couple of times hes now got four assists but he has been matched up against Chase Hunter and Hunter has only scored two points hes only made one field goal yeah and thats of course you know God is coming into averaging over 14 points per game so one of the main cause of the offense for Clemson as Tyson is able to line up a three and knock it down and as you mentioned then Clemson starting to find something offensively 12 points now for Hunter Tyson again Tyson is a guy youve mentioned a couple times hes certainly a candidate for ACC player of the year and he blocked the shot that time it looked like Beetle might have got away with one on that as Chase Hunter attacks the Baskin is able to finish rarely do you see anyone beating Virginia coast to coast and getting a layup well they got to lay up because they got the blocked shot and they kept it alive and that can be the same thing as a turnover and so here Clemson here they come Applause good look for Kihei Clark wide open lines up to three unable to knock it down but the offensive rebound and put back from Jaden Gardner but the passing by Virginia made Clemson scramble so the guy inside trying to block out Gardner was Chase Hunter and thats just a mismatch and then one of the things that weve seen from Virginia of course Tony Bennett played a lot of their threeman triangle offense throughout the last stretch but theyre going a little bit back to what they call sides now the Mover blocker action running in those dropping those pocket passes as well DJ Hall back to the basket the jump Hook is good and as you mentioned before thats a tough matchup for Bennett vanderplas to be able to guard PJ Hall down low Clemson after that scoring drought now made Seven of their last eight field goal attention DJ Hall does such a great does a great job getting the ball very close to the basket and he shoots it quickly so you dont have time to double team him and he doesnt have to take two or three dribbles to get in positions hey Clark finding Gardner in his patented midrange spot this time Jayden Gardner able to knock it down and its really beginning to hurt to Clemson defense if they cant stay in front of Kihei Clark Galloways been very quiet too Applause Music well we talked about Jaden Gardner he didnt score in the first half but he has been one of the offensive cogs here in the second to put back and then the jump shot the Cavaliers keep the lead the hot 28point Victory against NC State on Saturday so playing very good basketball he and Chase Hunter combined but the job defensively that KIA Clark and Reese Beekman have done on these guards have been spectacular here on their home floor this is this is an elite defensive team particularly Elite defensively in the backcourt PJ Hall with another opportunity and Virginia will bring the trap on this possession ends up as a turnover on that inbounds pass Corey he caught the ball much further away from the basket than he wanted to and when he has to move toward the basket and dribble the ball that gives the Cavaliers a chance to trap and force the turnover and then whenever Clemson has been in trouble throughout this game theyve gone to PJ Hall coming out of the timeout Tony Bennett drawing up the Trap and making sure they got the basketball out of his hands Reese Beekman with the midrange pullup well Virginia fans its great to see reach Beekman being more aggressive on the offensive end Virginia needs offense from Kihei Clark and from Reese Beekman and thats an awful lot to ask because youre asking those guys to do so much on the defensive end but this Cavalier team I think to be successful in postseason play has to get offense from Beekman and Clark Josh Beetle attacking the basket a little bit of a push off there with the right hand however the bucket is good Josh beat away strong second half here for the Tigers one of those guys thats sort of a fast twitch hes got a little bit of Wiggle to him and when he puts the ball down hes going to the basket not a great outside shooter I like the wiggle Im a fan of you saying wiggle I can see you and Wally Walker getting the wiggle on back in the day is that the way it went out no no there was no wiggle on that team Reese Beekman to Jayden Gardner once again Gardner in his spot now 12 points all here in the second half for Jayden Gardner foreign Applause you might get away with that down inside but not out there in front of God and everybody Applause the nothing but net crew will be at Greensboro Coliseum again this year for the ACC womens basketball tournament with pre and post game shows for every game plus accpm will be there again tomorrow coverage begins at four Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app thats a little bit of frustration by Chase Hunter he drove into the lane Corey but I mean he got met by five guys with Chase Hunter of course when you finally get past Kihei Clark or Reese Beekman and Venom youve got resistance at The Rim hes not the first guard to be frustrated here at jpj he took his life In His Hands there hes trying to take the ball from Gardner he picked up the foul lucky he didnt get a broken nose Applause Beekman to Kihei Clark unable to Corral that one but gets it back Jaden Gardner once again in the midrange unable to get it to go down but Bennett vanderpost on the offensive rebound and an opportunity for two at the free throw line its been a strong second half for bandoplas as well and again the Corey what you see the ball moving in player Movement by Virginia when that shot goes up vanderplas is battling against Chase Hunter on the inside and Virginia doing a great job on the offensive boards they have 11 of them today theyre season high is 12 Applause reminder to fans to download the ACC threepoint challenge app presented by New York Life to help benefit the local Boys and Girls Club score points for your school and after the tournament the local Boys and Girls Club will receive a donation from New York Life based on their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking Josh Beetle once again on the attack Kihei Clark with the great hands weve seen that from PA Clark multiple times throughout this game well Kihei Clark was putting pressure on him and took the pressure away and Beetle fell down the Beatles In the game to try to relieve the pressure off of Chase Hunter so that he can deal with Kihei Clark Beetle trying to deal with the family plots down low he didnt have much luck there so the good news is vanderplas got fouled the bad news is hes going to the freethrow line has struggled from the line has not been his strong suit has it been the strong suit for this Virginia team as of late shooting their lowest free throw percentage since believe it or not the national championship team in 2019 so maybe its a good sign for Virginia that theyre not a great freethrow shooting team this year Applause has now missed all four of his free throws you know thats an interesting stat that you have to worry about I just I just dont think you can have a lot of success if you cant make free throws in key situations much much smaller margin of error for this Virginia team than it was for the team in 2019 is PJ Hall goes to the hook shot once again is able to finish it off 17 points on the interior for PJ Hall as he and Hunter Tyson have answered the Bell against this Virginia Defense Applause Franklin hesitated a minute and that allowed the taller player to cover him up and prevent him shooting the three Jayden Garner going to the fade away unable to get it to go chase Hunter trying to get Clemson in transition to see if he can find something Virginia does a great job getting back but no one close enough to Hunter Tyson as hes able to knock down a three Applause Virginia still leads by seven Virginia possibly than this play right here the block by Ryan Dunn and then Dunn runs the court and finishes at the basket that was Virginias first basket of the game they went almost five minutes without scoring so no more bigger than that for the Cavaliers although theyre going to be facing some now because then vanderplas is out of the game Virginia in the 11 and so Tony Bennett is looking to have better freethrow Shooters but Ryan Dunns freethrow numbers are very little better than Ben vanderplump yeah Ryan Dunn on the floor now and I believe a lot of that was in order to try to slow down Applause Hunter Tyson who has gotten it going here in the second half most likely well see Jaden Gardner matched up with PJ Hall on the block with van imposs out of the game Applause Thompson doing a really nice job switching out on Franklin preventing him from getting the three three Beekman unable to knock down the three even though he got a great look Hunter Tyson who leads the ACC in third nationally in defensive rebounds comes up with the board and right now Clemson trying to cut into the seven point lead three here makes it very interesting Applause Balls got to go to PJ Hall doesnt it I agree Hunter Tyson lines up the three unable to get it yet down but I agree with you wholeheartedly Dan if youre Clemson youve got to find a way to get PJ Hall the basketball Virginia has not been able to defend him this entire game Im not saying he needs to shoot it but Virginia is going to bring some pressure and he has a chance to pass to an open player Applause foreign Applause Franklin with the three unable to get it to go down but theres a lot of contact under the basket theyre going to get in shefflin for pushing off Jayden Garner got great excuse me Ryan Dunn great position on the inside there trying to come up with a second chance opportunity Brad Brown now is shaking his head and I think that thats just the athleticism of Ryan Dunn I think hes surprised Ian Sheffield and they got tangled up well you mentioned earlier its difficult for anyone trying to match up with Ryan Dunn Virginia from the line tonight eight of 13 Dunn steps up knocks down a big free throw right now and rarely does it get quiet in this building but the way things have gone for Tony Bennett and his Squad lately during free throws it is extremely quiet Dunn finishes off both free throws at the line you want to play at the end of tight games you go you show your coach you can make free throws Chase Hunter trying to feed PJ Hall on the interior mom Franklin was forgive me done was right there tried to thread the needle with two Virginia defenders in the area how active and effective has done been tonight in the first moment they put him in the game and he made an early entrance into the game yes Tony Bennett got Ben benapos out early got Ryan Dunn in and hes been effective his entire time on the floor four Cavaliers have scored in double figures and interesting two of them are done in McNeely so Tony Bennett getting great play off his bench weve seen that before this year but it happened to be in the second game of the season versus Monmouth were both done and McNeely were in double figures in that game Tyson going to the fall away is going to get the contact in the foul Ryan Dunn will pick up the foul theyre trying to defend that attempt from Hunter Tyson thats one of those plays Corey where you get your hand up but you dont jump you know Hunter Tyson has fallen away if he can make that 17 foot fall away you know good for him he steps back and you just dont jump you put your hand up but you jump and you slap him on the wrist foreign Galloway backed in the game now and theyre you gotta get you got to find him theyve got three guards in the game at the moment and you know Galloway is going to be looking to shoot the three and that puts Hunter Tyson at that Forest bottle for us where you know hes dangerous and normally a matchup problem for opposing teams as he calmly knocks down two free throws here in front of the who crew not happy because theres no bacon to be worn the Cavaliers have three guards in the game as well so theyre trying to match up 17 points now for Tyson you know the bacon giveaway I really like you know thats you know what uh what is it North Carolina they give away potato chips and uh someplace else that I guess NC State could give away fast food chicken and those those are certainly important items on the food chain but I think the highest of the food groups is bacon so everyone loves bacon right yeah so heres Dunn back to the line missing on the front end of the one and one for Ryan Dunn there Virginia 10 of 16 from the freethrow line Chase Hunter still not able to get anything going Hunter Tyson lining up thats a tough shot give Brian Dunn a lot of credit defensively defending that that time he stayed just a little bit away he jumped but he kept his hands straight up he didnt lower Isaac newly now checking in for Dunn Tony Bennett going with his ball handlers and free throw shooters on the floor now four guards again I I think that youre not really worried about Hunter Tyson feeding you shooting twos by posting up you want to hang on to the ball and you want to make free throws Applause near turnover great effort by Hunter Tyson but unable to figure it out the officials Doug sermon blowing the whistles to see if that will be a shot clock reset or did Hunter Tyson actually possess that basketball well I think Hunter Tyson possessed the basketball but Virginia did not recover it until it got in the front court so I think thats what theyre looking at should the shot clock have reset to 30 or should it have reset to 20 and right at the moment its at 16 so the way the the shot clock operator has to reset it to 20 so I think thats the issue Hunter Tyson got the ball and I thought he possessed it and dribbled it but lets take a look here and see Hunter Tyson smacks it away nope he never he never had the ball yeah I believe that shot clock will be lower never resetting 16 seconds on the shot clock great crew on hand here tonight Doug sermons Ron Gruber Pat Driscoll see Tyson slapped the ball away but he never possessed the ball and it went into the backcourt and so Kihei Clark recovered it but Virginia never lost possession of the ball so the shot clock should not have reset and 16 is the right time you know I thought it was reset it to 20 or reset it to 30 but Tyson never possessed it great effort once again but also great effort by kieh Clark who didnt want another turnover to his credit so gets over there comes up with the loose ball Applause Virginia right now not recognizing someone has to shoot your basketball Applause foreign Applause Tyson attacking the basket finds Chase hunter in the corner knocks down to three and just like that its a fourpoint game 332 remaining Tyson finally fouls Kihei Clark 26 seconds remaining all right so thats the 10th team foul on Clemson so hell get hell get two free throws but again if youre going to hang on to the ball like this at the end of the game Corey you got to make shots at the end of the shot clock or you have to make free throws or both then you go back to the last possession Arman Franklin had a wide open threepointer with six seconds remaining on the shot clock as kieh Clark misses the first free throw and he didnt take that look Virginia doesnt get a good look on that last possession allowing Clemson to get down into transition get the three yay Clark knocks down the second one a fivepoint lead right now youre Clemson you dont need the three right no you dont need the three youll take it if you can get it you certainly dont want to turn it over great job defensively once again Reese Beekman answering the challenge guarding Brevin Galloway we talked about Brevin Galloway coming into this game coming off a careerhigh 28 points but he has struggled here tonight Dan wow hes trying to force it there hes got Beekman on him and hes got Kihei Clark stepping in you take the ball you jump stop and you pass it thats a force right there and the tigers are going to pay for it if the a clock now making his second straight free throw sixpoint game this one right here will make it a three possession game if hes able to get it to go and now you do need a three and you need it fast seven Galloway for three unable to get it PJ Hall the offensive rebound wasting time thats one youve got to kick out PJ Hall is able to get it to go but only 51 seconds remaining on the clock if you dont kick it out youre going to shoot it right away yeah exactly yeah that thing to dribble around killed a little more precious time than Brad Brownell would have liked to have seen what eight straight games this will be nine straight game okay yes Applause and Virginia has such a great record under Tony Bennett when they get to 70 and thats exactly what we were talking about earlier get an opportunity to see our guy will Durham of course you normally on your Wednesday nights are hanging out with Western we replace West with will tonight Wes and I and usually on our Tuesday nights when were down in Clemson we you know will comes to dinner with us and gets his dad to buy him dinner and give him money I tell you what thats a pretty good deal absolutely it is were working hard for Brad Brownell and his team trying to pick up full course see if they can come up with a steal here and if not well have to foul immediately Dylan Hunter fouling Isaac McNeely McNeely an opportunity to go to the freethrow line and pretty much ice this with 36 seconds remaining well McNeely hadnt been to the line much in conference play but hes eight out of 10 with Tony Bennett absolutely trusts him he has him in there at this stage of the game and wants him to be the guy going to the freethrow line the first year with an opportunity to make an impression on his coach as you mentioned before one way to get more minutes late crunch time is to go and make your free throws when they matter most now particularly on a team that doesnt make his free throws 11 points now for McNeely make that 12 knocking down both free throws and making a seven point game Chase Hunters fling at the end of the game is off the mark and I want to tell you Dan Bonner this has been a blast for me this has been fun hopefully well get to do it again soon well it really was a good time
