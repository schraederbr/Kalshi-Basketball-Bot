overal and the Bears have had a full week off and I think both sides will welcome the full week off scott considering how much travel theyve taken on this year yeah it does take a toll I know madon said he gave his team both off Sunday and Monday theyve had a great week of practice I was at Stanfords practice yesterday high energy Im looking for good good things from both squads tonight jayen Blakes the grad transfer from duke missing the three and Reus petrius the rebound for Cal well thats something Cal does really well they chew blast not only on the defensive end especially the offensive end betrus is a master of getting on the offens of glass they lead the ACC in offensive rebounding at over 13 a game shot clock down to 10 Monty Soko for Cal the gr transfer from Michigan State coko lobs it over Maxim Renault and then Reno lost the rebound out of bounds will stay at this end and it goes back to Cal very unfortunate fantastic defense that time by the Cardinal but Blakes and R nos battling for the ball they fumbled it out of bounds how about r no he switched on to Joon black Shure and stayed right with him thats one thing hes a big man but hes not a stiff he uses his life really well Jia cers strips the ball and then he lost the ball looking to attack and Cal counters with a freshman jerem Maya Wilkinson Wilkinson attacks and the rebound Ryan agarwall for the Cardinal well I like that by r no stayed long and Tall without foul short on the three and the rebound Falls to Andre St yakovich for the Bears Im a little surpris Cardinal coming out jacking up these three two long shots in a turnover to start the game midrange jumper missed by St yakovich and Stanford will slow it up we 90 seconds in still looking for points yeah I see coach Smith over there screaming at is true take the ball inside little high pick and roll trying to get Rena down on that block he loves so Music much loose ball to Steel Jeremiah Wilkinson will race in and the games first points belong to Cal the steel and bucket for Wilkinson and Kyle Smith an early timeout yeah a quick timeout but he needed his team two turnovers and two bad threes to start this gamey look at this one more time its just a dribble handoff you lose control the basketball and in Wilkerson hes a thief in basketball shorts hes like a blur the other end he makes him pay Applause a minute 47 in and Kyle Smith takes his 30 second timeout trying to settle his guys down yeah absolutely hes look at their start they havent been you know playing against live competition in seven days just wants calm him down say hey lets just get back to doing what we do best and this is his high pick and for with his bread and butter but they got to get re Rayo the ball down on the Block and now you get ramped up for a rivalry game Reno forced out still plenty of time on the shot clock oziah sers had space had a good look and theyre playing volleyball underneath and Jeremiah Wilkinson the shortest guy in the court comes away with it for Applause C Mar Soko couldnt have control of the basketball and Stanford brings it back the other way with Jaylen Music Blakes Donovan young and he was out of bounds and another lost possession for the Cardinal very sloppy to start this basketball game what is that three turnovers now a number of questionable shots from on the outside theyve got nothing in that painted area no drives No post UPS this is not Cardinal start that they wanted and the first time around when these two teams played in early December at Cal it was the inaugural ACC game for both teams Stanford won at 8981 it was a high scoring game and both teams shot it extremely well jovon black Shir the tip in Reus petritis thats what he does almost three offensive rebounds a game in ACC play he has been an absolute beast on the boards got to put a body on him cannot jump with it doesnt look like hes the multi athletic player and then he just goes and grabs it for the weak side and the putb missed by Donovan young and here comes petritis three on two for Cal Applause out of bounds 14 on the shot clock for California yeah you see anytime Andre stovic catches that basketball their emphasis in their film study yesterday was to make him play in the crowd they want him to see a body or two all Music times here is to yakovich lining up a three and cof to a seven nothing lead on Stanford wow Ill tell you what that was good offense good execution of their Baseline out of bounds play so yovich is coming off a nice basketball game he had struggled for a little bit but he had 22 at Georgia Tech when he knocked in four threepoint shots hes had 10 20po games this season and a couple of 30point games last year was a freshman had a solid opening season at college basketball for the Cardinal and for Jared Hass who was coaching Stanford last year as dakovich averaged eight points a game last year for the Cardinal yeah and how that defense right there inside by sissoko he comes out of his position comes across and swats that one away keeping the card they stuck on zero I love when the big guys come over and get those block shots I never would have suspected that was that your best defense coming over on the help side yeah I got I got PL I got plenty of blocks but also plenty of fouls they called on me at the ACC I would they accs alltime foul leader thats something Jordan never did off the inbound Max Reno breaks the seal for the Cardinal you cant keep the big guy shut down forever beautiful execution by his uh the Baseline out of bounds play by coach Smith ends with a high percentage dunk for r no lets see if thats the play that gets the Cardinal Applause Music going Andre dakovich fouled on the drive and thats on the Freshman Donovan young of the Cardinal but slow start for Stanford and Mark Matson will take this for Cal well when youre struggling to score what do you do you get the ball to the best college s in Call of basketball for the slam Duncan I love this one out here by sto yakovich knocking it down Applause toity it was nice basketball leg and Applause and basketball Applause e Cal the early 72 lead on Stanford and tonight honoring the College Basketball Hall of Famer longtime Stanford coach the Cardinal alltime winning his leader who also happened to coach across the bay at Cal one of the unique things about this rivalry 18 years at Stanford six at Cal and one of his standout players for the Cardinal none other than Cal head coach Mark Madson yeah hey coach still looks good and look at these highlights on mson he was just a beast in college basketball so strong rebounder use his length around the basket its going to be weird for Madson to come back here though as a as the Cal coach first off before we get to Mark Madson the highlights hes dunking on Duke that had to bring a smile I love that Im still smiling over here love to see anybody dunk on Duke but went into the Stanford Hall of Fame hes still among the top 10 alltime rebounders in Stanford history and one more shot for Andre St yakovich who has the distinction of playing now in both sides of his rivalry and he goes one for two from the line yeah 82 or surprised he even missed one hes locked in he knocked in that triple normally the triples go in the free throws go in as well lets see the Stanfords got to get themselves going here one of seven from the field three turnovers 0 or three from the threepoint range Jaylen Blakes going inside for the Cardinal well thats what they need right their last two buckets high percentage shots a dunk and then a little right hand Hook from 6 feet right in front of the basket so starting to pick up their inside attack jovon blackshire has it knocked away and a loose ball here come the Cardinal Reno underneath and a foul and bodies went crashing St yakovich down Maxim Reno down also Donovan Young and the foul was on Andre St yakovich of Cal sending Max team r0 to the foul line well thats what Stanford needed right they were struggling to score from the outside I mention 0 of3 to start the game then they go inside for two buckets then they get a steal or off in transition you got the big fella at The Rim trying to slam down another dunk so I think Cardinals start to find their balance offensively 78 foul shooter R now and one more coming ESPN big Monday triple header he got William comes North Carolina Tar Hills and Florida State start us off at 7 Eastern followed by terrific match up a couple of top 10 teams in the Big 12 number five Houston had a good win at home with game day in Houston today taking on Texas Tech the ninth ranked Red Raiders after Houston beat Iowa State earlier today then we cap at another big 12 match up in Boulder number 23 Kansas who bounced back after taking a big loss at BYU on Wednesday night they got it going again against against Oklahoma State today and Bill self will bring the jhawks out to Boulder to take on a KU grad former Kansas jhawk Tad Bole the coach of the Buffs is Andre sakovich offensive rebound Reus petritis to the line and as you talked about already Scott cow so good on the offensive glass yeah and that was a big emphasis yesterday when I was at the Cal the Stanford practice talking about getting these guys off of the offensive glass putting a body and moving them away from the basket so far P trus has gotten two offensive rebounds in the early part of this game second foul on the Freshman Donovan young and Rus petritis 76 foul shooter missing and C A Team 76 both teams shoot it extremely well from the line but Cal just one for three from the stripes so far yeah I mean theyre theyre number one and free throws made almost 17 a game and we seen them miss two early ones here if youre coach Madson you got to like the start of your basketball squad here right youre up nine to5 youre getting on the offensive glass youre doing a great job defensively Max SE R know with the left hand and the tip Ryan agarwall wouldnt go and Reus petritis pulls it down for Cal well right knows got that you know left should right shoulder turn turn to that left hand jump hook now that one had a little bit more range on it than he probably what he would have liked H but nice job getting inside again Wilkinson way off but Cal keeps it Applause alive and a block jayen Blakes the foul thatll send St yakovich back to the line oh it looked like Blakes had pretty good position he was waiting on sty yakovich you dont really see in the black and blue big excuse me the ACC here theyre going inside there you tell me if Blakes is not set looked like he was sitting down there with a cup of coffee and a donut waiting waiting on sto yakovich I even think St yakovich thought it was going to be on him got away with one there that seemed to be a big break for C yakovich now one for three from the line considering if it wasnt charged that would have been St yakovich his second Applause foul well they definitely avoided one c a break a first free throw was a little a little off kter so stovich has dropped two free throw that did not find the range here but theyre still theyll take that 10 five Advantage here still got Stamford discombobulated offensively SE yakovich has five of Cals 10 Jaylen Blakes curls off the screen and the pullup Jumper by Blakes oh nice on Rhythm coming off a mansiz screen by his big man ray no there was not a Defender within 5T of Blakes when he knocked that down and a miscommunication and Lee Dort throws it away and thats a turnover on Cal cant have those unforced errors when youre struggling youve lost three in a row and I love this one right here just that big screen just laid out the defender Blakes had all day to line up that free throw line jumper but youve lost three in a row you just cant have unfor stairs right youre on the road against your rival you got to be sharp High post to Maxim Reno he goes Baseline at rles out and sakovich rips it down for Cal a big battle down low underneath I like to see the big sevenfooters playing with true strength around the basket and Maxim Reno denies Andre St yakovich how about that length you know sto yakovich in their first match up they blocked five of his shots then Jeremiah Wilkinson climbed the ladder and took the rebound Music Applause away Wilkinson attacks and the Freshman missing inside last Touch by Cal were going the other way its a Stanford ball well great job by sasoko getting on the glass that 260 lb frame look at that shoulders look at those biceps telling me hes not flexing underneath but he made the cinal rule of putting that ball down when you got that thing chained up under you know your chin flare those elbows out and me thats why you push that sled around all summer long in the weight room so you can go back up with power but does a golden bear break a cardinal rule well you know what thats pretty good did I say that yeah I tell you what hes got hes got hes got that great body just use that power Maxim Reno the running hook well sokos got the strength into size but Reno right now is showing his agility to get to open spots away from sasoko where he can throw his little right and left hand Applause hooks Jon blackshire here DJ Campbell denied another block for maxim Renault and then Campbell missed the jumper and Renault pulls it down for the Cardinal the big man is showing why hes one of the top centers in the country doing it on both ends I love the first block shot then stays with it challenges the second shot Alters that and then grabs the board Monty Soko goes up over for everybody to pull the rebound down sooko said hey Williams look at my rebound ability snatch that one out about the 11th Applause Music Applause Music floor Jon blackshire shot clock rolling down on a step back three and the rebound tip free and Benny Keeler saves it for Stanford I love Benny keer hes that guy that you need on your squad I dont care if its a high school college other Pros hes a dirt worker does all the little things to help the team win and the rebound tip free and Jeremiah Wilkinson claims it for the golden bears knocked away from blackshire chismar racing up the floor and Stanford has their first lead oh the live ball turnover theyve had two of them that have led to easy opportunities for Stanford and that one there makes it a lead sh just when Cal you thought that they had Stanfords number and they had them under control and collared here the live ball turnovers and points in the paint have really hurt him six nothing Run for the Cardinal C has missed their last seven shots from the field yeah Stanfords tighten up the defense M Soko had it stripped oh I think aara came over and got a piece of that Maxim Reno again launching a three this one goes for Reno how good is that its that a little brush green for OAR he takes the ball to the middle two Defenders go with them leaves Reno the 31 shooter free to fire from behind the arc and he Strokes it clean and true eight for Reno and a 9 nothing Stanford run def Cs gone over four and a half minutes without scoring and DJ Campbell all the way to the bucket ends the drought for the Golden Bears well thats what they needed right to something to the basket theyve been trying to get these little midrange jumpers have been getting blocked or not finding the the mark this time take it all the way to the rack and get that high percentage shot and an offensive foul Chism Oar called for the charge and Kyle Smith visibly animated and frustrated at the other end Applause well when you want to get the the momentum you got to get turnovers and thats exactly what Stanfords been able to do here in his first half I love that one there and then aara drive it to the middle kick it back out to your stud and let him knock it down Music win Music every two Applause Music Music Music Music Music w Music Music well that is Maxim Renos mom Vanessa who made the treack from Paris all the way from France to the Bay Area to come support her son whos one of the top players in the country this what pregame mom and son we got to love that right there man playing in front of your mama you think theres a direct flight from Paris to San Francisco for sure there is yeah got in I got a chance to talk to her a little before the game said her husbands going to be joining on Wednesday for the games on Wednesday and Saturday thats a proud mama right there and her son is off to a fantastic start in this game as well eight points uh hes got a threepoint shot he can play inside he can play outside I just love his game three block shots already for maxim REO and the last time around against Cal Stanford in the 8981 win Rena had 20 points hit four threes five block shots in that game yeah hes a quick starter he had 16 first half points in their loss that look at another turnover by Gillard a steal by Benny giler as Andre St yakovich threw it right to him and he might have been having flashbacks from practice last year I dont drive coach Matson crazy you team struggle a little bit you get timeout go on the floor and you turn the basketball over and your first pass Aiden camman backing his way in Benny geler leans in we get to the line first foul on jovon blackshire well it makes me smile I had a chance in practice yesterday gilers High School coach was in the gym I was talking to him I said I just absolutely love the way you have coached up geler hes just a guy that just you know walked on earned a scholarship now hes out here hes one of the first players Off the Bench for Coach Smith one more for geler who was starting earlier this year started each of the first six games for Stanford and the Cardinal kind of adjusting things toward the end of the nonconference and Benny geler started coming off the bench for Kyle Smith as geler goes one for two from the line dealing with an illness the flu got him pretty good A couple of weeks ago and now starting to feel like hes back in rhythm again deep three Andre sto yakovich offensive rebound Spencer Mahoney and the red shirt freshman misses inside but Kyle gets it again and another connection between these two programs Spencer Mahoney red shirted for Kyle Smith at Washington State last year and then transferred to Cal when Kyle Smith left the Cougars to take the Standford jum well Im impressed by the way the guys in the yellow shirts get on that offensive glass I know they didnt get a bucket on that possession but you get two or three cracks at it over the course of 40 minutes youre going to do okay Chisum oara launching a three not necessarily known for that but 42 and his limited opportunities yeah oar is one of the guys I asked the sports for nation director about before the basketball game and just said hey tell me about this guy he said hey hell do a little bit of everything tonight you just watch Applause shot clock inside 10 m Soko backing his way in and he left that short and Ryan agarwall saves it for the Cardinal well nice job limiting Cardinal the California to just one shot in a rebound going go a little pick and roll here with deer Fe C have no F there you look Music homeless shot clock down to five and a whistle off the ball yeah I think it was on Mahoney a little too physical on the post up there with oara first on Spencer Mahoney but Stanford from down seven early theyre up six Music Music Stand St saman Bier in the building I know I doubt know in the top 25 NCAA PO he got with the 9000 was to be the1 season or3 Samantha rece Samantha Applause WI e Music with Scott Williams and our ESPN crew Roxy bernsteen with you Maples Pavilion on the farm where Stanford leads Cal 1812 and the Cardinal got a 132 run but their defense is really stepped up the last 5 S minutes yeah see the 13 to2 run but look at the defense one of last 13 field goals for the Golden Bears and Cal overall just 19 from the field they are four for 21 basketball and a Cardinal ball in the Baseline here foul was on Spencer Mahoney of the Golden Bears before the timeout Maximo eight points to lead all scores Andre St yakovich has five to lead Cal osiah sers on a step back three that one rles out and Jeremiah Wilkinson another rebound thats already four rebounds for Wilkinson as re is petritis missing everything on a three yeah when youre one to 13 youre coming out of a timeout I I know its its a transition after a quick rebound but firing up a three out of the corner when youre not on good balance is not exactly the shot you want and some concern for maxim Reno thats why theyve stopped play here and he seems to be in a little discomfort if its his hip or his back hes walking real gingerly hes got a tear in those white tights and theres a little banging underneath so after letting them bang hard for 14 minutes I think the officials are starting to try to clean things up a little bit here and theyre starting to call some of these contact fouls away from the ball first on MAR Soko look at raino once again sliding those Nikes it looked like his his his foot lands on top of one of his teammates there Sellers and he just kind of tweaked his ankle and CS rips the ball away Reus petritis who leads C and Steels this year with another theft this is whos got to get going Wilkerson hes averaged about over 20 points in his last three games hes got to get and the pullup Jumper by Jeremiah Wilkinson who averages 14 a half per game and as the season has gone on hes become more and more of a factor for Mark Madson yeah the ACC you mentioned it since hes got the last eight basketball games hes averaging over 20 points in the ACC osiah sers drains a three his first three of the night and thats an area where Cal has really struggled this year is defending the three yeah one of the worst in college basketball but when you got a big body seven footer set in the screen like that giving you a clean look its a lot easier to knock him down Ryan agall pokes it free Wilkinson gets it back and a foul has been called and Ryan Agarwal in disbelief I the fouls on him well agal almost had the steal cleanly and I dont know if it was sissoko one of the cow players jumped on the floor and tried to gain an advantage but I think theyre calling agall theyre going to the monitor here thats terrible and not exactly sure what was called on the floor it appeared there was a foul on Ryan agerwal so it is under review which number the foul is on and theyre trying to determine which Stanford player the foul was on you tell me if you see a foul here after all the banging theyve been letting going on here in the first half of this game you dont to tell me thats a foul official got to pick it up theyve called a foul actually on Monty Soko of Cal so initially they pointed at agar wall of Stanford and now its on M Soko of Cal well I dont like to argue with the officials or disagree with the officials on air but at this one thats is hard for me to figure out why this is just not a a just two grown men or two young men try trying to trying to play the game of basketball the way its supposed to be played sometimes the officials just say say hey we made a mistake lets jump it up in the center here that was in your day nobody wants to admit theyre ever wrong anymore second foul on Soko and Lee door takes over thats a kicking violation on Rus petrius well good thing stays with Stanford good thing patrus kick it because Renault had his Defender right on his back about 10 feet from the basket and he was just getting ready to operate if that inbound excuse me if that entry pass would have found him after a sluggish start St stf for asserting themselves here inside 5 minutes to go until halftime they double Maxim Renault and its stripped out of bounds by Reus petritis and itll stay with the Cardinal 11 on the shot CL I think Madson had had enough of Renault working them out down low he said were going to bring the double team uh on Reno and see if we cant create a a turnover and at the very least lets get the ball up out of his hands a Stanford team thats been very good at home this year 132 including 6 and one in the ACC wake four is the only ACC team thats come into Maples in one as thats the largest lead now for the Cardinal courtesy of oziah sers yeah Roxy that wasnt exactly the cleanest offensive possession but sers figured out a away made a little left shoulder turn a little right hand Hook off of that left block and a foul its on Benny giler thats the first on Applause ER I dont think that was in the act of shooting so I think thats just going to be on the Baseline out of bounds thats the fifth team foul on the Cardinal and the officials you can see after not blowing the whistles very much at all the first 10 12 14 minutes of this game now all of a sudden they uh they want to try to call everything try to clean this thing up so nothing gets out of hand here in the second half it is a rivalry game a rivalry game you let him play let him Music bang osiah sers called for the hand check and thats the first on sellers team foul number six the next one will put Cal into the bonus and a cal team thats trying to get things turned around again the heartbreaking Lo at Georgia Tech last Saturday theyve lost four out of five and a deflection it stays with Cal yeah petrius ran into a row block underneath there by Maxine Reno he was long and tall and he thought he was going to you know get Reno to bite on the pump fake the young man stayed down he had to try to kick it back out to the corner theyre lucky they end up with possession of this basketball tough spot to inbound for DJ Applause Campbell Lee D back in as well in and dork goes to the basket that was a big man putting a lot of beef down there even the 240 lound r no couldnt handle all that muscle along the Baseline osiah sers backs out for a three yeah C the Blakes missed a wide openen play or I think it was agal right underneath the basket skipped it to the corner with an air ball DJ Campbell fumbles it away and that goes off of DJ Campbell and it belongs to Stanford with three and a half to go until halftime in Maples Stanford up 2316 on California in this ACC yes the ACC matchup private two inss in the fact that 30 AP only separ where Beal its tremendous such a b the good job with this program Stanford fans stford students basketall football its a big part of college life its what you do its just you know but when people team Applause Music for Applause Music Applause air Applause go Applause C Tom Ill relay the message to Mark Madson for you I like hey I like that as a bit a fellow big anytime you can go inside for high percentage buckets I mean youre stuck on 16 points with three and a half minutes to go nothings working for you from the outside you got to bang him inside and a foul out top then its on foul and that is their sixth team foul first on lead Dort the transfer from Vanderbilt the next one will put Stanford into the bonus the Cardinal led by as many as nine and theyve equaled that largest lead as Jaylen Blakes cuts to the basket Blakes with the tricky dribble he rejected the screen the screen had him coming off to the right Cal had him played coming off to the right he went back to the left smart move by Blakes he found a lane to the basket I could have gotten my big butt through then Lee Dort throws it away I thought he was throwing it to me you were open my my hands went up like that was coming my direction I was ready to catch and shoot baby eight Cal turnover yeah theyve been real sloppy with the basketball here in this first half you know theyve been getting on the offensive glass I got s0 boards only four points to show for it thats a long two from osiah sers and Lee Dort had the rebound lost it but its picked up by Jeremiah Wilkinson Yeah just something to keep an eye on here big fell no normally he goes after those rebounds hes maybe favoring that left ankle a little bit that was in his space where he could have made an attempt on it and he didnt really make a play on that rebound something to watch second foul on jayen Blakes and a one and one for Jeremiah Wilkinson whos an 80 foul shooter in Maxim Reno trying to walk it off but maybe you know getting yourself to the free throw line when youre struggling offensively youre used to score 20 points a game now all of a sudden you get to the free throw line get a chance to work on your stroke another missed free throw for Cal theyre just three for seven from the line and its good foul shooters that have been missing free throws like you said theres some nerves in a rivalry game Maxim Reno left it short Cal claims the rebound he threw his hands in the air like you got to be kidding me thats one of my favorite shots left hand hook right in front of the Applause basket Spencer Mahoney Applause Music and Maxim Reno the rebound for the Cardinal wow theyre just getting nothing you got to give credit where credit is due this Standford defense is doing its darn thing here doing a nice job on Wilkinson not letting him get off that launch pad the other thing Cal offensively has just one assist tonight and Renault throws up a wild shot but kept Alive by sellers still 10 on the shot clock this match inside Applause Benny giler deep three and the long rebound to Jeremiah Wilkinson who looks to race up the floor Wilkinson Glides in Coast to Coast like a blur down that left that left side of the floor he just went all the way to the basket he leads Cal with six Maxim Reno three well he said he went inside for a bucket he couldnt get one down low though why not step out here behind the yor knock down my second three right largest lead for Stanford Andre sto yakovich clears some space look look at R now hes letting seven seconds burn off this game clock so there only be a a a small differential between the game clock in the shot clock so they can get the last shot of the of the half mark Madson was trying to get a timeout and he was looking to save as much time on the clock remaining in the half because you know the old two for one right hes going to have some time thats why he was looking for the timeout he was animated and frustrated none of the officials recognized he wanted the timeout well after this after a score in the first half the clock does not stop so raino being craft he realizes theres about a 10c differential between the shot clock and the game clock he just talks tying his shoe the officials let him do it and the game clock keeps ticking now theres only a 34 second differential between the game clock and the shot clock which means EXA essentially Stanford can play for the last shot of the half thats the Mad Dog we used to see on the floor here in Maples Pavilion yeah Markus living about it he would have had a full 10 seconds to get his team last shot of the half the difference is the old Mad Dog could take it out physically on somebody youre absolutely right we Leed have some battles in the NBA he was a rough neither one of us had much skill we just had to go and beat the heck out of each other at least you understood your role we did know that hey he wrode at the two championships with the Lakers and I rode Jordans cail for three and Stanford throws it away and Cal will have one last crack at it here with 136 to go and Mark Matson now will get that timeout the officials stopped the clock previously now Madson takes that use it or lose it timeout 30 second timeout for the Golden Bears looking for one last shot to make it closer heading into the half 136 left in the half and Cal can play for the last shot of the half after Stanford turns the ball over and for as much as Cal has struggled here in the first half under 30 shooting from the floor they have an opportunity to make this a six or even a fivepoint game here heading to the locker room yeah theyd be real happy with a bucket here with 13o seconds uh 6 seconds to go and this is one you put the ball in your hands your two best players Wilkinson and sto yakovich Aiden camon blocks the shot of Wilkinson theres still 38 left in the Applause half get that we out here Lee door cuts to the basket off the inbound and thatll take us to halftime and a lift for Cal as much as they struggled offensively that last buck sto yakovich and Wilkinson want to try to get off the launch pad quickly here in this second half and a whistle thats the third foul on Donovan young just 20 seconds into the second half well officials really started blowing their whistles in the second part of that first half and trying to clean this thing up a little bit the game was played at a very black and blue style of play and they didnt want things to get out of control here and theyre starting to Blow That Whistle early and often they actually called it on Blakes and thats the third on Jaylen Blakes and not on Donovan Young Who now has two fouls but thats a problem for Kyle Smith with Jaylen Blakes now on the bench with three fouls and thats an over and back and a turnover on Cal to start the second half yeah weve seen that out of Cal a few times just kind of miscommunication throwing the ball over here in the front row or throwing it right to a a Stamford Defender that one there by Javon uh blackshire hes a sixth year graduate you got to be sure with that basketball ninth Cal turnover and a kicking violation and speaking of violations we should point out late in the first half when Mark Matson was so upset the officials did give a delay of game warning to Stanford before inbounding the ball with about 36 seconds left in the half and so the next one becomes a technical foul if they get another delay of game oiah celis with a shot clock winding down the fallway jumper that goes over the top of the backboard out of bounds and were going the other way well I see some good defense out of cow lets give them some credit there on that possession the big fella got a defensive slant would not let the smaller offensive player beat him to the basket made him shoot over outstretched hand is exactly the way you teach it Jeremiah Wilkinson the pullup jumper Ryan agarwall the rebound for the Cardinal agarwall I like this kid he was out here right you know two hours before the Cardinals even had their shoot around he willed out the the shot doctor and start getting some shots up on his own and hell get to the foul line its on jovon blackshire of Cal the second foul on the Golden Bears point guard in agar wall couple of shots 80 from the stripe this year well yeah I love one hardworking dudes you know put it in the lab put in the practice and then they can take it onto the court during the games and see some success and he just realized hey I got a size Advantage a weight Advantage let me just back a little Defender right up underneath the basket couldnt get the free throw to go ABC NBA Sunday showcase double headers as Jaylen Brunson and the Knicks are in Boston to square off against Jason Tatum Jaylen Brown the Celtics at one Eastern then its step Jimmy Butler the new combo for the Warriors Tak it on Kyrie in the Mavs coverage tips NBA Countdown 1230 Eastern on ABC one for two at the line for agar wall see this is where Javon black sure has got to be get a little bit better hes got to start gaining his Advantage by taking some guys off the dribble Drive making Defenders have to help so he can find his Shooters open looks on the perimeter second foul and Benny Music Giller Joon blackshire the pullup jumper and Maxim Reno of the inside position grabs the rebound for Stanford yeah he just thats what we didnt see in the first half on some of those rebound attempts and just getting rebounds outside your position Renault has it blocked and agarwall fouled will go back to the line for Stanford and thats foul number three on blackshire just four offensive rebounds in that first half for Stanford and that time a Agarwal he just went right behind his Defender cuz he had to come over and try to challenge that shot by Maxine Ray these guys are well coached I really like the culture that uh Mike Smith is developing here in his first year as the Cardinals head coach EXC me Kyle Smith last years Pack 12 Coach of the Year when he was at Washington State Mike Smith was a guy played against in high school was went on in the former BYU stand out BYU stand out they playing for the Boston Celtics old Alma Mo was in action last night in the CIF Championship they dropped the heartbreaker 4745 shout out to Wilson High School down in Southern California you know we wi we won a state championship in 86 over in Oakland the Coliseum yeah Reed is petritis Music spinning DJ Campbell launching a three and thats way off and Benny geler the rebound for Stanford seemed like there were seven guys in white shirt out there just closing out running guys off shots challenging shots excellent defense oiah sers and one well they got that rebound and it never seemed as though Cal was ever to get set defensively and they just kept putting the pressure with screens and moving the ball and I love this one right here you just get that ball down below the painted air everybodys eyes go to it that nice movement without the basketball by and he gets an open look at basket sers with seven tonight sparkling 87 from the line this year and Stanford has now got their largest lead of the Applause night sellers is one of those guys that has made a huge improvement from where he was the fifth biggest jump in the ACC from points per game from one year to the next and the problem that sellers had at USC last year as the teardrop wouldnt go for Rus petritis Lee Dort the offensive rebound Dort goes back up and misses and geler claims it for Stanford but sellers was stuck there was a log Jam of guys Isaiah CER bronny James Kobe Johnson were all at USC last year yeah 52 points last year and almost 14 a game here this season and thats a travel DJ Campbell gives it away yeah and I didnt I didnt like that last threepointer by Agarwal felt like he just hadnt gotten one up in a while and he rushed down into that that threein transition but boy does this kid get it done defensively so hasnt had the big game offensively that hes kind of accustomed to but hes doing all the things on the defensive end and just to get back to sellers they also had Boogie Ellis at USC last year so there wasnt that much playing time to go around and sellers couldnt crack the rotation Ryan agarwall to the bucket well hes hes got you know live legs lots of energy you see it on both ends of the floor defensively and then theyre just gutting them inside right now theyre just taking everything to the basket eight nothing run for Stanford in and out for Jeremiah Wilkinson another rebound by raino after one re offensive rebound by Dort it is most been one and done here in the second half as the Cardinal now have their largest lead of this basketball game looking to add to it Cal jumped out to a seven nothing lead they only have 15 points since and still looking to get points here in the second half Reus petrius the rebound yeah not enough air under that shot by sers DJ Campbell the first points for Cal since halftime well they needed that one there a good clean look kicked it ahead ball only hit the floor once on that trip down the floor and nothing but a three from the right side so good execution of your transition Music offense Donovan young and Jeremiah Wilkinson strips it away and saves it for Cal boy they love Andre yovic here dont they theyre giving it to him how about gers hes come back and rebounded like two or three sh uh balls that have bounced long and snatched them up before the Golden Bears have been able to grab him you telling me hes not locked in wants this Victory foul on cal Its Stanford up 11 coming up the man whos being honored tonight here at Maples he coached both teams in this rivalry Mike Montgomery joins us next hes sitting over there I didnt see him when I went up to the rest Zachs going to get him okay good yeah Zs getting okay no no Im not going he Music he here he comes Applause okay oh yeah put the put the button on he Co good good to see you coach what did I do with my button you got your button there it is its up underneath my monitor there Music I dont know how to oh yeah I for no I know all about that I know all right e was fitting tonight with cow play and Stanford that theyre honoring Mike Montgomery with success at both schools taking Stanford to a final four winning four conference championships with the Cardinal winning a conference Championship at Cal the alltime winning is coach in Stanford history with the St of the Golden State Warriors in between and the College Basketball Hall of Famer Mike Montgomery joins us and how cool is this for you to be honored tonight well it it really has been a great day uh of course this got Eric revano fingerprints all over it but uh theyve done a really nice job I mean theyve really G out of the way a lot of the players have showed up and you know crowds good this is way crowd should be all the time in my opinion and uh so it makes you feel good to be recognized you know we I had a great run here I loved it it loved it at Cal uh we had success so you know come back and have people kind of remember who you are makes you feel good I bet three 3 win Seasons you took the team to the final four what was most special about your time here in at Stanford I think the quality of the people that that we had a chance to deal with you know they were just such good kids and you know we werent we werent always better than everybody from a standpoint of talent but they played so hard and so well together that it really made it fun so boy stovich hes getting uh they got hes getting raspberries isnt he as you would expect what did you think was going to happen yeah no question yeah this is really a physical game both teams really getting after it defensively thats Cals really having a hard time getting good shots Stanfords working hard on defense for you and you watch this Stanford program now and Kyle Smith trying to get it back going again what do you see with Stanford basketball well I think Kyles a really good coach hes won every place hes been he knows how to win he knows what it takes to win Stanford is very unselfish they really dont have anybody looking to get theirs you know they know Rena is the key to this whole thing but you take a guy like Benny geler you know walk on from Golden Hills hes defending his tail off out there hes into Cals guards and Cals guards dont like that Ryan agarwall of three all eight for agarwall since halftime and Stanfords opened up a 12point lead back to double digits and on the other side you coached a cal one of your former players who had a phenomenal career for you here at Stanford Mark Matson leading Cal what have you seen from him in his transition now in your two well he hes some toughness you know he brings a little bit of the NBA game to them and I dont know talentwise whether you know that open style and guys theyre having a hard time getting good shots you theyre driving in and theyre not getting good shots off so uh Mark will get it going hes a really good coach and hes very well respected hes just such a genuine person that I think hell get it going but uh right now thats the best shot that you know Cals gotten in a long time so I mean its still the ball game Cs in this and they just got to find a way to get some open shots and theyre just not getting them right now coach have seen a number of of uh other coaches in college basketball now have decided to retire or leave the game because of some of the nil and the the transport portal what what are your thoughts on the way the college game has changed over the years well its not my cup of tea either I mean I know I know Tony Tony Bennett for example he was at Washington State and I knew his dad and it it completely made sense for Tony to make that decision its just he wasnt comfortable with it its not who he is you know I think laraa same thing a little bit at Miami although jimm 75 so it makes more sense that he might think that way and youre going to see some others do the same thing you know its its sort of it is pay for play and you just got to buy into it you got to not fight it you got to go with the flow and hope that the university feels good about that and still try to keep a modom of disciplined and team and spirit and all that sort of stuff so well see I I its too bad that gone that way I dont think its sustainable I think its going to cause a lot of the Olympic sports to be cut and go away because they have so much money theyre theyre being spent on other sports but uh therell be another iteration here in a year or two and then therell be one after that and hopefully in the not too distant future itll all settle down and theyll figure out what they want to do we need guard rails and theyve had a hard time with that in a court of law uh coming to that conclusion and being able to pull that off Hall of Famer Mike Montgomery with us here at Stanford now one more shot for josah sers and getting back to Mark mson when you watch him Coach the way he runs his program do you see some of what you did in him well of course Mark we were very physical and because we couldnt match up quickness wise with some other people so we were very physical he knew what he needed to do well and he told me one time he says I played in the NBA because you taught me how to get angles and how to duck and score inside because I couldnt shoot it so as as Mark starts to get more Talent andoko the follow slam big transfer from Michigan St quite a physical specimen but I think youll see a little bit of trademark of what we did youre seeing a lot more five out just on ball pick and roll spacing than than you used to cuz people dont cuz the transfer portal kids arent here you know they dont stay all of a sudden you got a new lineup every year so its really hard to teach like we were able to do it but Mark will get it going hes got hes improved each year last year they were better than the year before theyre better this year and I think youll continue to see that for Mark the kids love him cuz hes genuine I I I was saying earlier that Mark and I both had no skills we had to be out there beating each other love to congrats B happy for you thanks my pleasure all right all the favor Mike m come on come on give me give me some dab all right well Im no Bill Walton but what the heck was good to Music Applause Music Applause Applause we get going on right here lets this right heres Applause Music Applause you our thanks to Mike Montgomery for joining us and he coached up both sides of the Rivalry Mark Matt played on one side coaching of the other Jared H played at Cal coached at Stanford now of course on our team here at ESPN right there is Mike Montgomery as the Stanford coach the Cal head coach but were not done the current football coach for the Cardinal Troy Taylor a former Cal quarterback Andre St yakovich playing in this game played for Stanford last year and we believe is the only player that has played on both sides of the Rivalry then you also we showed you mark Matson the womens basketball coach at Cal Shan Smith played for Tara Vander here at Stanford and shes done a great job revitalizing the Cal Womens program the current baseball coach here at Stanford David eser who was on the 1990 or 1988 College World Series team for the Cardinal nobody wants to leave the Bay Area they just want to stay in the Bay Area played at Stanford coached at Cal for years and now is back at his alma mater there is Tara Vander who is here tonight to come pay respects to Mike Montgomery 1216 wins thats getting it done theres been some assisted coaches that have worked at both schools like Timo whos in the ACC Jeff Wilburn Who the head coach at the University of Denver Charles Payne whos a scout now in the NBA coached on both sides so there is some history would that happen at Carolina somebody going to Duke I couldnt have seemed like uh somebody that played at Carolina going over and being the head coach at Duke the way madsons played at Stanford and now was the head coach at Cal that that would be too shocking you dont think like Wes Miller would ever go coach at Duke no West wouldnt do that I dont think so West doing a terrific job at Cincinnati right now largest lead of the game for Stanford mty sissoko has it ripped out of bounds were going the other way just to add to the Rivalry so we keep praising Benny giler in the job that hes doing tonight uhhuh his girlfriend Sophia St okay now thats going too far I think they made a movie about that didnt they Julio Roberts Ryan agarwall the drop off and the finger roll by Aiden camon wow this is starting to get a little ugly now it seems as though Stamford is having their way inside at the free throw line getting high percentage shots largest lead of the game now up by 17 and in cruise control six in a row for the Cardinal to push the lead out to 177 but Cal just cant get looks 29 and the other problem for Mark Matson is there theres not a lot of sharing of the ball Cal has only three assists tonight hey the Hall of Famer coach Mike Montgomery he he came over here and he he prais the job defensively that Kyle Smith and Company had his team locked in here to a defensive game plan and they are executing it to Perfection theyve not Lov Wilkinson or sto yakovich really get hot at any particular time and and hurt Applause them one more for Jeremiah Wilkinson our ESPN big Monday triple header 7 Eastern on Monday SC Carolina Tar Hills taking on Florida State followed by a couple of Big 12 matchups a top 10 match up between number five Houston number nine Texas Tech we cap the night and Boulder with number number 23 Kansas and the Buffs s on the Buffs Buffs are hot Buffs got a big win today much needed win for Tad Bole in the Buffs as Wilkinson goes one for two from the line Jaylen Blakes and the Fall Away from Blakes and the rebound Andre sto yakovich for Music Cal and Blakes crashes through the screen those players and thats the fourth foul in Blakes as both he and Soko went down yeah those legs really got tangled up there Blakes came up gimpy I had to get tangled up like that you better call the paramedics and get me up off the court because they really got tangled like a pretzel yeah this just a couple strong young men banging into one another and both of them lost their balance this one the lower part of their legs it looks like say zoko lands on Blakes right leg and his knee just goes into a funky position the bonus so one and one for Soko 69 from the line for M Soko and hell get one more shot gr transfer from Michigan State graduated as you look at Blakes the grad transfer from duke to Stanford but Soko got his degree in environmental Sciences played four years for Tom ISO and taking advantage of the extra year and hes at out yeah you play for Coach hiso you know how to play the game of basketball he does he does his role real well he sets good screen for his Shooters and he rebounds that basketball steel for Jeremiah Wilkinson Reus petrius blows the layup and Stanford pulls it down Ill tell you what even when good things happen to Cal they get a steal and a and a shot at the rim and they cant get it to go sometimes it just be like that as as they say in the park just one of those nights Aiden camon and a foul will put sers at the line as stamfords in the bonus yeah Cals just been playing defense without sliding their feet lot of reaching already the eighth team foul here we still got 10 minutes to play in this second half one and one for sers and the bonus for oziah sers now four for four at the line so just one game this week theyve had a whole week off and its been certainly a big adjustment for both K and Stanford moving to the ACC and the extended travel that they are dealing with and I I think both teams welcomed having a full week off since playing on the East Coast last Saturday let me ask you a question do you think that week is kind of thrown Cal off Rhythm though theyre not used to taking a full seven days off between games they have not ever been get able to get offensively on balance Jeremiah Wilkinson Nails a three I I think theres something to that in trying to find that game speed and rhythm again cal putting some full court pressure on yeah man you try to get some live ball turnovers and doing a nice job pressuring here in the back court maybe its just try to speed up Stanford a little bit Benny keer hoists the three knocks one down Benny geler three well geler was that one bright spot Off the Bench for Duke he went for 14 points off the bench in that blowoff loss to the Blue Devils on Saturday so he knocked down a couple threes in that one knocks down another one here Ryan agarwall a foul and that will put Soko at the line and gilers had some big games for Stanford this year earlier this year he put up 20 and a game against Cal State Fullerton hitting six threes I love this one in transition because agar Walls always got his head and his eyes up and nobody just picked up geler on that left side they left him all alone and and gerer says hey youre going to leave me that open Im going to knock it down two shots for coko back to the line four points tonight and one more for Soko an incredible story where isoko over the years that nil has been in the game of college basketball and youve probably heard the story before but if you havt about M Soko all the nil money that hes received he sends it back to his home back in Molly to help the community the village where hes from help schools irrigation hes doing anything he can to help his community what a phenomenal young man Mar Soko is I love that he has that gear in Applause him I like that fact that Madson has put on this little full cord action of this press hes got his guys more engaged here not only in the in the back court but here in the uh front Court as well theyre getting deflections theyre getting steals theyre playing good chest toest defense and they they still got a lot of time left in this just under 9 minutes to play they can make a run here and they get another steal Here Comes Jeremiah Wilkinson darting up the floor Wilkinson and one strong finish by the freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson and he will go back to the line leads Cal with 12 points tonight and you talked about it Scott hes got to get involved if Cals going to make a push well this Golden Bear is like a golden blur this twice now he has taken the basketball from one in to the other and Stanford has not been able to match his speed and hes gotten buckets at the basket twice this one an opportunity for the old uh fashioned threepoint play second on Ryan wall and Wilkinson gets the free throw to roll through well once was a comfortable 17point lead is down to 11 now and trying to get another turnover and the press that Mark Matson is put on has seemed to bother Stanford not this time as Aiden camon will get a couple of free throws well camon runs the floor exceptionally well and when youre selling out and doing full court pressure you got two guys on the ball 90 ft from defending your basket it leaves an easy opportunity for that big to run right down the middle of the floor what hes been taught since about the fourth grade and he just and then Ray knows got such great Court Vision he finds him in stride camon just a 50 foul shooter and one more for the redir Freshman from Andover Massachusetts and he missed both even though he got a couple of free throws turns into an empty possession and Cal can get it to single digits well and and and you get the ball back quickly right so its almost like a turnover that he misses both of those free throws and you got a chance now to cut this thing like you say a single digits open look knocked down Christian Tuckers first points of the night and for Tucker only his seventh made threepointer the season and callus trimmed it to eight an eight nothing run well you got to love the way Cal is staying with it it hasnt been pretty basketball with him but all of a sudden theyre putting him up and knocking him down Music Music 3 Music Music Music Music e Music h Music so heres the bottom seven right now of the ACC we showed you the top half of the league when we came on the air tonight but Cals making sure that they stack up some wins here toward the end of the season to guarantee themselves a spot at the ACC tournament yeah and think they definitely got to keep the pace here and Syracuse getting a big win today moved up to 5 and 11 and Boston College Boston College getting getting on the board so yeah this is important for them to to F not I dont know if they can come back and win this game but they got to start playing with a little bit more sense of urgency a little more momentum a little bit more togetherness TR of Rhythm and flow to their offense theyll have a tough week ahead with SMU coming to town and Boston College as well well this full court pressure has put some I guess Jitters into the Stanford and theyre doing a nice job speeding the Cardinal up to a pace that they havent played all game long and its thrown them off balance offensively Maxim Reno too strong on the three and mon Soko up over everybody for the rebound sooko soared high for that ball he wanted to make sure he got that rebound and Jaylen Blakes back in the game for Stanford with just inside 8 minutes to go and his four fouls so Kyle Smith letting you know how what he thinks of this period of time where its critical to stop the bleeding because Cal keeps coming and the bears from 17 down have cut it to six wow wow what an impressive drive by Wilkinson thats twice now once Coast to Coast that one in the half court set this man has been able to get himself right to the front of the basket nobody in Stanford can stop him 15 for Jeremiah Wilkinson now again for three Maxim Reno that one rims out DJ Campbell the rebound well Reno is bombing from the outside he has not scored this half Wilkinson missing a three and then Benny geler secures the rebound for Stanford they got to go back to their High pick and roll roll roll raino down on that right block where hes best to let him operate from there on the other end when CS got the ball because Blakes is playing with four fouls deflected thats why Stanford can go get in the back court would you attack jayen Blakes absolutely 100 hes vital to their end of game situation scenarios his ability to shoot the free throw right now they just got to find a bucket they Stanford is just really struggling offensively Andre do yakovich isolated against Ryan agarwall and a foul on the shot rather before the shot but free throws with c and the bonis for to yakovich its on Ryan agarwall but the Golden Bears are coming 10 nothing run for Cal from 17 down theyve trimmed it to six and going to the line FCS Music youra Music Music Music w e e Music well Jayla Blakes not the only one hooping in the Blakes family michaa Blakes went for an SEC record 55 for Vandy against Auburn one of the elite scorers in the womens college game she has been fantastic is an absolute bucket anytime that she steps on the floor she followed that one up on Thursday with a uh 37 point efforts Im Excuse me 34 Point effort made Seven of 12 threes Im sure theyll be talking about her on college game day tomorrow 1100 am eastern 8 Pacific on ESPN theyll be for Raleigh and the triple header on ESPN NC State Notre Dame in noon Eastern followed by Carolina in Louisville and then in the SEC its LSU and Kentucky the triple header of womens Hoops what a day of womens Hoops on ESPN Andre St yakovich hits both and its now a fourpoint game inside 6 and a half minutes to go well that 17point lead has just dissipated is a 18 to five run Stanford has come Music unglued Maxim Reno out of the double team Benny giler tried to make him pay for the double team Monty Soko pulls it down I dont understand the first 10 minutes in the half everything for Stanford was inside those last four minutes all theyre doing is bombing away from the outside and its a twopoint game Andre sto yakovich again 24 points in the paint with a majority of those coming here in the last 4 minutes its like Stanfords rolled out the red carpet for the Cardinals to say hey drive it to the middle and a foul and Mark bson trying to say its on Stamford and it is he gets the call an offensive foul for an elbow and a hook on Maxim Reno yeah and Coach Smith is not arguing that whatsoever R knows right arm comes up awfully high right there see that right arm comes up right around the back of the in the neck of Soko easy call for the officials Mark Matson wants him to look at the monitor feeling there was an elbow to the head and one of the officials to look at the Monitor and they said no there was no elbow to the Head were playing on Jeremiah Wilkinson Applause hes been the Catalyst for Cal along with sto yakovich to fuel this comeback the hands of Jaylen Blakes forcing a cal turnover yeah a little too much penetration by Tucker got down there cardinal could strip that basketball away Applause go go go and a foul its on Monty sasoko for a push and thats the fourth on sasoko and free throws for maxim Reno yes so sooko doesnt like it but thats the right call theyve been calling that ever since about the 3minute mark of the first half and a 32 timeout for Cal 5250 from 17 down C has cut it to two and Mark Madson still upset about the previous call where he felt Soko took an elbow to the Head well yeah and he took the elbow from Stanfords best player so Madson is trying to sell the officials that he wants them to go to the Monitor and see if that was a flag foul a blow to the above the shoulders I dont think the officials are going to buy what hes selling well they cant go back to it now heres what Mark Matson is talking about it had to be done at the time and thats what hes talking about why he wanted them to go to the monitor I I dont see anything there that would have upgraded the foul yeah yeah Mark Mark is saying he led with the elbow he he he led he kind of pushed back with his arm not his elbow it wasnt bent and it wasnt thrown at the kidss head and matsons probably saying trust me I speak from Laughter experience well listen it itd be a huge loss obviously if R now wasnt available for the final five minutes of this basketball game and Madson knows it had have been Billy Benny geler hitting somebody I dont think Matson would have burned one of his 30 second timeouts to go talk to the officials one more for Reno me Mike Montgomery used to say about Mark Madson hes the kind of guy that hed battle with you and pop you in the nose and maybe break your nose but hed be the first guy to go run and get a tow to help you clean it up yeah help you clean up the blood on and then guess what you get back to action he need to do it again def couple of much needed free throws for Stanford Andre sto yakovich missing and long rebound trickles out Jeremiah wilin had it had it knocked free and Stanford controls go Reno go St isolated let go the step back from Maxim Reno well just flashing the footwork down on that left Baseline nice job takes his time surveys the defense I talked about his court Vision his foot work his accuracy that was just a beautiful play there by raino Christian Tucker and Benny keer the rebound for Stanford Benny giler how many boards is this for the bidy keer now I got him with four or five six rebounds for the one of the smallest guys on the floor double foul has been called on both Maxim Reno his secondo thats his fifth yeah thats Soko fouls out with 353 to go thats a big loss for cow the starting big man is done for the night the double foul 353 to go Maxim Reno Max this is a big time move there a big time move from a big time player one of the top players in college basketball showing out for his mama along the Baseline and there she is look at Vanessas going crazy she loves Music it 26 stanfordcom Applause e well you dont think this rivalry means something K and Stanford this was 30 years ago OSI the bear and the Stanford tree getting in a fight right here at Maples Pavilion when you first showed me I thought this was stays but they really going after each other thats serious and oh wait it gets even more more serious they had pulled himart and then they had to cop pull oy away and in this game we just had a couple of big guys battling Monty Soko and Maxim Reno and they got the double foul and the double foul which is the fifth personal RIS fouled out or correction Soko has fouled out its the second personal on Renault and because of the double foul that go to the arrow and the alternating possession its a stord ball 21 on the shot clock well its a shame because they the loss of Soko their best rebound and their best interior Defender and their best shot blocker and now Lee Dort has the challenge of Reno and its on Lee Dort Reno going back to the line well Reno just posted down on that left block and as the ball was swung from the left side to the center to the right side he just followed the ball and kept Dort on his back it put so much pressure on Dort he start pushing from behind because he did not want to get posted too low to the basket because he realizes hes given up length so he commits a personal foul double bonus two shots for Reno and he rolls the first one in next Saturday the Cardinal on acc Network part of the middle game of a triple header as they host Andy enfields SMU Mustangs right here here at Maples Pavilion coverage begins at 5 Eastern to Pacific on the ACC Network NC State Georgia Tech SMU Stanford wrap it up Florida State at Cameron indor take on Duke as Reno hits B Duke is hot they hung 110 points on the Eline today with seven players and double Figures its a freight train that is rolling down the tracks Cal cut it to two and now Stanford has pushed it back out to eight and Jeremiah Wilkinson will get free throws youing well they were starting to lose touch here with under three and a half to play and Wilkinson does a nice job hes been going to that basket relentlessly here in this second half and he just gets that big right shoulder you know right into the chest of the defender draws that contact and then that little Lefty just flips it up on glass to make sure the officials blow that list fourth foul and Benny geler Jeremiah Wilkinson and he struggled at the line and 80 Center on the year is two for five tonight yeah his third Miss and that one there seemed like he was shooting with all arms never got his lower body engaged lets see if he bends those knees and tries to engage that lower body here on his second attempt missed both first one was short second one went long over corrected right plenty of time in the lab this week to work on the shot the game The Stroke from the free throw line and tell you what right now the Cardinal theyre playing a little better in the second half but theyre still shooting sub 40 in the second half osiah sers and the rebound knocked free last Touch by Stanford and it belongs to Cal well the Baseline official wasnt sure which way to go she was so close to the action she deferred to the official out at half court Im not quite sure he knew he just said hey lets give it to the guys of the yellow Music Wilkinson tries to turn the corner and jayen Blakes is fouled out he cant believe it well jayb DRS does a pretty good slide job sliding those feet like I said but when youre the aggressive player offensively with the basketball and you get contact into shooting motion officials are going to give you that call nine times that out of 10 and and Blakes is in really good legal guarding position but Wilkinson goes inside and draws the contact he doesnt fade away from the contact he goes against the contact and thats where the officials are going to blow the whistle every time its just a smart crafty play by that young freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson back to the line and he hits the first one more for Wilkinson leads Cal with 16 Andre St yakovich with 11 Max SE Reno 17 to lead Stanford tonight 12 for oziah sers as Wilkinson hits both free Music throws Benny Keeler has some space and Andre St yakovich the rebound for Cal well I think thats exactly what Cal needed a quick shot from long distance so they could get back on the offensive end and a foul now Benny geler has fouled out both Stanford point guards are done Blakes just F out now giler is done and that puts an awkward position for the Cardinal and and Kyle Smith but how you manage the final 229 without your point guards and Coach Smith hands on hips trying to figure out where he wants to go with the substitution hes going to use as much of his time that is allotted to figure out who he wants to get to this game and hes going to come back big going to put the pressure on Sellers and agarwall to handle the basketball and a timeout for Cal with 229 to go Stanford 58 California 52 but its an interesting situation and a scary predicament right now for Stanford considering the two point guards youve relied on jayen Blakes and Benny geler have both fouled out of this game now they had to deal with it recently in terms of not having either one of those guys available for games when geler was out with an illness was dealing with the flu and also Jaya Blakes was dealing with a hand injury so they have some experience in dealing with not having each point guard well one thing they can do is Maxim Reno is pretty good ball handler himself he do some of that hes a big outlet Target to be able to bail it to so maybe you try to keep the ball off the floor not so much with the point guard dribbling it up and you move it up with the pass and thats what Stanfords got to figure out the final 229 Cal was down 17 they fought their way back into this game what has been the key for Cal to get back in Cs been taking the ball to the basket right theyre doing a better job defensively all the easy buckets that Stanford was getting inside in the first 10 minutes of the second half they have eliminated all of those now all of a sudden Cs been the aggressive team taking the ball to the basket Wilkinson taking it in P sto yakovich going going inside and heres what youre talking about Scott with what Cal has done to get back in well its been sometimes Coast to Coast Wilkinsons on his live ball turnover nobody stops the basketball he just goes right down the left side of this floor like a blurt all the way to the basket the an one thats a mismatch with raino on him he gives him a strong left hand drive to the basket doesnt take away his strength and I love that one by sto yakovich coming off off of that screen gains an advantage so theyve been the more aggressive team in the second half and thats why they got this thing down to a sixpoint game rattles in for sto yakovich 12 points for sto yakovich tonight they talk about sto yakovich being an 82 shooter its always a little tougher when the crowds into it but hes so calm he just knocked in two and we got ourselves a fourpoint ball game here this is going to get fun its been fun Stanford has a twoonone if they want it and they back it away with Donovan young nice smart play by Donovan young the high handoff wasnt there he didnt try to force something around the rim he can burn a little game clock throw it into R note and let him operate now he can get himself fouled he goes to the free throw line pass deflected Aiden camon comes away with it camon over to Reno and the rebound pulled down by calp petritis ahead Jeremiah Wilkinson launching a three pulled down and petrius cleans it up and its a twopoint game wow what is going on I do not think renel realized that the G the shot clock had reset he forced a left hand hook Donovan young missing ripped away by Aiden Music Cam and then Cal steals it but a whistle and it was they point to the shot clock here with a minute and a half to go well the ball did hit the rim on the shot attempt but I do it was reset to 22nd so afterwards there would have been three seconds that would have come off of that shot clock I think the officials have may have made a AK here Im not sure if they knew that that ball hit the rim our officiating crew Bill Covington Jr with Mark schner and Jenna Reno and theyre going to the monitor here now were saying that may it may not have hit the rim and the officials could be correct in that the shot clock should have been reset and check in two things one what youre talking about scottt did it hit the rim because if it did hit the rim they put 20 back up on the shot clock as Stanford had it in the front court and then was the shot clock reset properly was what theyre checking lets see if this shot goes up here he go goes into the corner of the rim right there yes and it clearly hit the rim hit the rim clearly hit the Rim Yeah it it bounced off the backboard then hit the right side of the rim and Cammy came over here and snatched that thing up so I do believe it is correct in terms of you reset the shot clock to 20 Stanford had possession Poss yeah in a bad way and I think thats what made Mark Matson so upset like hey we got we got we lost the ball but we put a good trap on them there was a chance we were going to get the basketball back in the official stop the play and DJ Campbell did end up with it but it was probably after the whistle so they reset it to 30 and they should not have it should have gone to 20 on the the reset after the shot hit the rim and now the table the scores table set it to 30 because it appeared to them and Cal had it is my guess oh as a change of possession possibly yeah then it would have gone to 30 right on the change of possession from Stanford to Cal but maybe they saying they didnt have clean possession that it should have only been reset to to 20 seconds go Stanford and Kell now getting upset because Stanfords just practicing some shots while theyre idly Waiting by for this to get sorted out at the monitor thats the way rivalry games are supposed to be right when we were up by 17 it just didnt feel right its supposed to be a one possession game up in here tonight and theres a lot of cow fans that made the track to Maples Pavilion tonight the home of the Stanford Cardinal and both sides are making some noise right now in a rivalry game thats its a twopoint game with 90 seconds to play you got to love this right I mean the whole pep band the cheerleaders the fans the student body everybody is into this thing and you can tell the coaches are sweating through their through their uh jumpers over there look you experienced Duke Carolina youre getting a taste of Cal Stanford tonight its wonderful I love it I a big smile on my face when you play in a game like this this is one of the things that you remember for the rest of your life how did did you do against Stanford how did you do against Cal how did you do against Duke well we won three of my four times when we went to Cameron Indoor but problem was we lost two of the four games at home so we did better at Cameron than we actually did defend in our own home court still trying to get this correct trying to get the shot clock and the game clock correct here and again the reset when Dort had possession thats why they put it to 30 but Stanford ripped it away so theyre trying to check the clock well I always like it when the officials go to the monitor to try to make sure they get it correct I just dont like when they spend three four and five minutes over there this game has been too good the flow of the college basketball game is so good so they deemed that Cal had possession thats why he went to 30 and thats why the shot clock is going to 25 Im not sure if he had possession long enough but in their mind he did thats why theres 25 on the shot clock for the Cardinal well thats some extra time that the Cardinal get to burn off that game clock and I didnt realize its only a two possession game but as long as you got the lead under two minutes you wanted that clock is you know you you want that thing to be your friend not your enemy after the extended break Maxim Reno calling for the ball go Ryan agarwall three I was just getting ready to say without their point guards theyre not able to get any penetration below the free throw line and Ryan agell the guy that was out here 3 hours before the shoot around working on his shot by himself with the shot doctor knocks in a big triple and a foul and jeremi Wilkinson is Music down and hell get to the line with 55 seconds you can bet that little freshmans going to get up hes not leaving this game with under a minutes to play he took a pretty good good blow on that jump shot but that shot by agall Boy does that show some guts to take that shot thats situation look at Wilkerson right here see if he gets any cont oh his when he when he landed his head goes back into the knee of one of the Stanford players but this shot right here by Ryan AG I love when good things happen to hard working people and agal put in the work earlier today and he knocked it down what happened on that first free throw he made it okay no doubt this freshman this freshmans got some Moxy too agar wall of all 11 since half time and Wilkinson hits both makes it a one possession game and 13 of Wilkinsons 19 coming here in the second half and a timeout with 55 seconds to play and defensively if youre Cal Scott how do you play this well you have 55 seconds right youre only down by one possession theres no reason to foul and put them on the line you know theyre shooting two free throws you dont want to fall behind by two two possessions play solid defense theyve been putting that little backcourt trap on they probably do that again theyre without Blakes without geler try to turn turn him over in the back court see if you can get a live ball turnover and if not you fall back and you play great defense agarwall hit a tough shot but they never got any penetration they didnt get the ball into a good position for Reno to operate down on the Block keep in mind for Stanford both their point guards Jaylen Blakes Benny geler have fouled out monoko the big man for Cal has thats fouled out of this game yeah if youre Stamper you want to get the ball down to raino with about 10 seconds down on this right block or maybe the left block is where hes been operating most of this game heres that full court pressure we talked about Agarwal got bad situation there against the sideline with two Defenders on them the sideline working as a third Defender he had no place to pass that ball he had to burn another Stanford timeout so Stanford has one time out left Cal is out of timeouts on a tie up it belongs to Cal as the top seven this is what Stanford is in the middle of Stanford needs to win to keep Pace with yma maters North Carolina won earlier today should they end in a tie Stanford would have the edge in the tiebreaker because they won at the dean doome against Carolina but a critical week for Stanford with Boston College coming in and then SMU and the Mustangs are coming West to the Bay Area there the coaching staffs in familiar ground Andy Enfield longtime coach at USC knows exactly what hes getting into with K and Stanford although Kyle Smith at his first year at Stanford but Andy knows him well having coached against him when he was at Washington State yeah its you know and thats exactly what Co Smith wants like just just finishing that that top part where you can get the Buy in the first round of that ACC tournament I believe its the first what n teams uh will get at least a one one game by I was just looking at Ray nos body language coming out of that timeout there looks like hes poised under control realizing Im about to go to work right here we can get the ball over half court look at this ball knock free Cal steals it DJ Campbell and a foul what get C the line with 462 seconds well Madson got exactly what he wanted he slapped that pressure on in the back court and CAD Stanford coughed the basketball up Ray knows out here at half court I think hes got to get more involved closer to that threepoint line to be a big outlet for his teammates DJ Campbell seven points tonight 78 foul Shooter two shots fourth foul in oiah Music Applause sers well very crucial that Stanford gets this rebound should Campbell miss this free throw and then they got to get the ball in cleanly and get it over half court Campbell missed both and the rebound cows got it Andre St yakovich down the lane and one for sto yakovich well its very rarely the shot that beats you its the rebound sometimes that is the most dangerous that time petrius we talked about him being a offensive Master on the on the glass he gets almost three rebounds off offensive rebounds per game in the ACC and he just out works right no to the excuse me CAM to the basketball and then look at sto yovich son of a NBA basketball player takes it hard to the rack handles the contact the concentration and the Finish chance to tie it up from the line tie game 42 Applause seconds and this pressure has really bothered Stanford Ryan agarwall breaks it looks to attack agarwall Lee Dort blocks the shot out of Bounds at the Stamford ball and agarwall comes up Applause hobbling agal seems to be okay it almost like his shoe came dislodged a little bit he had to get his shoe back on but how about the defense at the point of attack here by Dort he stays nice and high and swats that thing away Applause oiah sers Jeremiah Wilkinson climbs the ladder to block the Applause shot well I understand running your Baseline out of bounds play for a high percentage shot but he was well guarded I was surprised he sellers even went up with that shot Lee Dort the foul Reno to the line thats the last thing you wanted to do dordan he you know youre in the double bonus with every foul you had him a good 14t away from the basket just hold what you got right there that extra little bump with the thigh into the back of side of rno is what he gets whistled for the foul look at that just that little bump there and its going to send rno to the free throw line right five for six from the line tonight 78 on the year yeah hes been shooting 90 AC C play and Stanford reclaims the lead one more shot for Max R and keep in mind Cal is out of timeouts Stanford has one remaining yeah but I think Cal knows what to do get the ball in the hands of Wilkerson let him penetrate to the let Wilkerson let him penetrate to the basket if he gets stopped youre going to have to bring a second Defender over then hes got to do the job to find the open guy hopefully it be sto yakovich if youre Mark Madson let him knock in a three here and Renault Nails both the clock has stopped and thats why they have stopped play our officiating crew recognizing that and now the clock continues to run theyre going to have to go to the monitor to get this figured out again figure out the right time I remember coach Smith just throwing his hands in the air like come on clock operator get this thing right Mark mson will take this he doesnt have a timeout so this gives him an opportunity to drop a play great great observation yes man so much for so much for the home court advantage for Stanford but then again youre talking about somebody whos in the Stanford Hall of Fame coaching Cal yeah well maybe somebody the scores table remembers Mad Dog from his days the Cardinal in white exactly what Madson needed here to be able to draw this one up and and they put the ball in the hands of sto ovich theres only about a n 19 seconds between the shot clock and the game clock after they probably get it all straightened out so theyre going to put the ball in the hands of sto yakovich their their leading score and and see if he can operate something for himself or one of his teammates its been Wilkinson and stakich that have carried Cal back into this game they were 17 down here in the second half and they tied it and now after the maxim Reno free throws Stanford clinging to a twopoint lead C has had two games that have gone down to the wire and ended up in in overtime I wouldnt be surprised if if if Mattson the NBA philosophy is when you got a chance to try to win the game at the end with a three you go ahead and shoot the three if youre at home you try to tie the game but on the road he might try to shoot the three so they the clock stopped they need to get it corrected which they did to 272 the problem is they didnt reset the shot clock the shot clock and the game clock were very close to each other but now theres a 5second differential yeah thats where Im thats where I was thrown there was a 19 second differential between shot clock and game clock and now its showing 12 seconds now they have it to 26 they got it right okay so 12 second differential so essentially Cal can hold for the final shot try to win this thing at the buzzer would you look to do it that way or are you looking for the best shot you can get at the doesnt matter when if if I can get the ball in the hands of Wilkinson let him drive to the basket I like him attacking the basket with a chance to try to finish it at the at the bucket or get to the foul line if not lets toy yovic crack up a three and try to win this thing St yakovich against sers whos playing with four fouls St yakovich the Miss and the rebound Reno well Reno battled two guys in yellow shirts underneath there one of the top rebounders in the country flexing his musles underneath and got that rebound now hes got to go to the line and make two free throws hes been shooting 45 of 50 in ACC play from the free throw line look at this good job by Sailors playing without fouling sto yakovich and look at that right no he just screamed with a Rebel Yell lets go now hes got to calm those motion that nerve that adrenaline and knocked down two freebies seven for eight from the line tonight for maxim Reno 16 12 seconds and Reno put Stanford up three hes shooting at the basket with his mom sitting just left of the uh of the hoop and when he made that first one she threw both of her arms up in Jubilation his 15th 20point game of the season this one to make it a twopossession game remember Cs got no timeouts they got to race this to the other end uhoh he missed it they left the door open would you foul if youre Stanford no too much time on the clock Jeremiah Wilkinson trying to create a look heres Wilkinson for three and the rebound tipped around and osiah sers has it for Stanford and that with 7 seconds remaining should do it well Wilkinson got a good look he just couldnt get it to go good defense the last two possessions by Stanford they stayed nice and long challenged shooters and did not foul kep Cal off of that free throw line what a game this one more time Agarwal out there challenges high does not foul just front rim and off sers shooting two and that should do it now fourpoint game sellers a perfect six for six from the line well theyll break that two game losing streak and it wasnt pretty theres some things to tighten up for the next time they hit hit the court but theyre going to take this Victory and a big one over the rivals and Stanford hangs on they blew all of a seven
