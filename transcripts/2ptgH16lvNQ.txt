to 75 R Forest went to pit on Wednesday and lost 7772 struggled in threepoint shots they were just six of 22 opening tip controlled by Syracuse and wers had the lead in a couple of those Road games at NC State at Double figure leads that have just just evaporated fact wake has lost four straight road games opening shot and a miss from Chris Bell and here is Hil trying to cross it over draws a lot of defensive attention hes been limited unfortunately with that right wrist injury this is Carr and now Reed poked away and reather it poked away for a second time and were going to stay at this end of the floor with nine to shoot for weight well you talked to the Syracuse people and Malik Brown has really probably been their most consistent player this year really a terrific oneonone Defender especially in the post Applause Adrien ay taking over for the legend Jim beheim after 47 years as the head coach of the orange program deep in the shot talk for Carr launching a three you know a really proficient threepoint shooter just under 40 and at 611 he can see over people and get that just about anytime he wants scores over 14 points per game seven rebounds per game 11th in the conference for Carr who gets us started in score ing mits able to hang on shot clock dwindles down to Applause 10 Bell trying to answer with the three side Rim boy Miller hes been their best threepoint shooter this year and uh but but has been kind of spotty in the last four Applause games so Min has picked up the foul mic as Miller was bringing it up the court and not a great you know a really cheap foul and and booy Miller just kind of stopped short mince ran into him so just kind of yeah he stopped short it was his mov and he ran in he got picked up a cheap foul and something that Mintz cant afford to get right now Judah Mintz 18 and a half points per game top scorer for this orange team look for Wake Force to really build a wall with him and and try to get the ball out of his hands keep him from going downhill R try to get it the car for the rim Bender for Wake well you know Fon Reed is really he hes talented he plays a a great high low game and uh car shows the ability to go inside and outside Justin Taylor got it right back he lines up a three Syracuse Mike has a team 13th in the conference in threepoint shooting 33 yeah and thats what wake is going to do theyre going to really pack it in they want to keep every body in front and uh somebody high up in the section 104 was open there I dont even think the Gman could have got to that one its just you know two things there was no pressure on the pass up top and then a good seal you know underneath so really really good offense that time on the high low and not great defense Syracuse that won 11 in a row mik in that Series against Boston College TI of the loss on Tuesday Chestnut Hill this is Bell turning and missing and Reed and thats a thats a match up that goes back to the old Big East Applause days Salis had it knocked away and this is what Syracuse does Tom this theyre theyre one of the best in the league at stealing the basketball and forcing turnover thats their game thats how they produce points yeah that all started with the play of Benny Williams number 13 into the lineup with the orange up ahead to Bell so Syracuse on the board early on first half Reed trying to back his way down on Benny Williams who will pick up the personal foul now you notice too that he didnt go right away he looked there was no double team coming so took his time and then drew the foul so you know great play by Reed not in a real hurry right there lets see if you know if he gets the ball in the low box takes a look and then makes his move Salis down the lane you really under control two foot jump stop takes the charge out of and you know out of play challenge at The Rim Carr was there denies Malik Brown and here comes CIS he had it knocked Away by minz hustles to the basket and no one can get back to stop the jam from Min youve got to be really careful around this team with the basketball you cant make iffy passes uh you know both their guards are long at 64 and thats an offensive foul on Reed mince went flying Mike minz is second in the conference and Steals and he shows us exactly why right here they are long and rangey out front they have active hands and uh this is theyre very opportunistic and you know early on they were really out of sorts and two steals two quick baskets and all of a sudden theyre right back in two diens the sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland and oakill Academy in Virginia 51 straight starts in an orange uniform Marsh comes up with it and Marsh has not had much time at all this year so itpr surprising seeing him on the floor just his eighth game of the season Parker Frederickson is also under the lineup for wake in white black and old gold hildr had it bounce off of his hands toward the Syracuse bench and out of bounds well take a timeout from Winston Salem with the deakes in front of the orange on the CW we dont just have everything we have your thing it is the 15th alltime meeting between these two programs Syracuse leads the way 11 to3 and they have split their last four meetings that included the last game of the regular season which turned out to be Jim bims final regular season game at the Dome mic we were there for it a win by the orange and then Wake Forest in the tournament just a few days later eliminated the orange at the ACC tournament and you know looking back on it you had the sense that that you know that that might have been the last game um and and you know and and talking to Jim kind of leading up to that he never really wanted to do this long farewell thing and he he wanted to do what Roy kind of Roy Williams did he said all right Im you know like a blackjack viewer you know Im out you know good luck spinning cand now hes a big TV star oh yeah staging screen Sy kept it alive with Williams trying to get it to mince almost into the back court plenty of time on a shot clock already five weight turnovers so uh mint stepping into a three for Jud Music Min I mean there are some things with Syracuse that youre going to live with and I think a three from Judah mince is going to be one of them mince was two of seven on threepoint tries at Boston College and at 18 points tied for the team team lead hes now made 23s on the season doesnt take a whole lot of them does like to get to the free throw line hildr dribbling Clinic over the top and the clearance from Malik Brown yeah you know hes hes more hes much more effective the closer in he gets but clearly hampered by that Applause Music Applause rist wide up the intended target from cop so wake at the first five points of the game Syracuse has come back to tie us up at seven it is Wake basketball and uh coach rer did not like that particular shot so were going to sit down and talk about it chatting with the sophomore quader Copeland from Philadelphia Pennsylvania who averages about 8 and A2 points per game and has only made six threes on the season but you know you look at his BC line nine points seven rebounds seven assists I mean its not far off a purple double too strong from boy Miller Miller Another transfer Edition for Wake fors from Central Michigan that ball coughed up by the orange a lot of unforced turnovers in this game by both teams hildr ran into Brown one but you know just the thing with Hil though even with his diminished offensive capabilities hes one of their best defenders and uh you know Steve for said he cant he cant afford to take him off the floor and uh heres a guy that theyre desperately trying to work back into the lineup deari Monsanto back in playing in his fourth game hes coming back from the the injury that he suffered late in the season last year his first game back was a home game against Louisville he made four three pointers in that game in fact that was the last win and home win for Wake Forest and the officials are going to talk about this Mike Jamie lucky Clarence Armstrong Mark Schnur in charge of the action the evening in Winston Salem Applause it was the shot clock should it was supposed to been reset wasnt reset on the offensive rebound now youve got well you and this is one thing that Adrian arre talked about was their these two snipers out on the floor and call them in uh in Frederickson and Monsanto theyre threepoint Specialists and uh he wants them covered late in the shot clock for hildr shook the defender and put it in thats a great save by him with shot clock on his back Salis active defending on mins got Marsh in the air found it open teammate in Williams see again those are youre going to live with those percentages one of five now kendrickson from the corner free ball from the corner pocket hes taken five twopoint baskets on the year hes made four of them 83 of 88 field goal attempts by Frederickson have been threepoint attempts I think he just picked up the foul mik yeah the on the reach but uh this is this is what he does and uh actually Steve for called he said one hes one of the best P Shooters hes ever had freshman from Bixby Oklahoma 63 and 195 lb was only one of six at pit this week threepoint attempts no surprise and we got here he was one of the he was the first guy out here working on his jump shot front rim from Mintz you can see just if you can keep Syracuse in the half court I just tried for a little bit too much right there Reed probably would have been better served to come down with that one and go back up strong thats 7 ft 240 hanging on the rim here at Joel Applause Coliseum Salis wide open for a three and he held the Finish Timeout on the court nobody stepped up to stop the basketball that guy is the most important one on the floor so he decided to Tee It Up Wake Forest now three of four on threepoint attempts Hunter Salis knocks it down this Sunday its rivalry week on CW womens Hoops Miami looks to steal a victory on the road against rival Florida State and the highscoring seminal ahead of Duke Clemson it was a big win for Virginia on the road Clemsons now lost six of their last nine to slide back into the lower half Virginia has won six in a row they at 8 and three conference play and its Williams with a Monster Jam really thats the kind of thats kind of execution you love to see coming out of a timeout Denny Williams the Junior from Buoy Maryland better production last couple games for him 95 rebounds since he been spotty a little bit this year on Santo misses hildr preserving The Possession finds an open Monsanto from the corner well so far this year in his return every shot has been a three and uh he certainly has given himself a chance coming into this game M down the lane and he lays it in well you can see everybody lifted for Syracuse that time driving Lanes wide open and there was no support there was no Gap support that time for we four on Santo not bashful couple of bounces and comes off fight for the loose ball hilr on Santo testing that knee trying to drop it low to Reed t on the shot clock kick from Frederickson Monsanto from the corner boy its a good result but without poopy Miller out on the floor tom theres uh it is a little ragged out there right now for Wake Forest but end result three points one of four on threepoint chances for deari Monsanto had been seven of 14 from Beyond The Arc prior to tonight in his three previous games off the the injury this is really a fascinating lineup out there right now for the weight fors Salis you got four basically four perimeter scorers in Reed all of a sudden this game has sped up accelerating towards the N9 minute Mark of our first half wormy jinsky are outstanding ACC basketball on the CW crew with you from M saor Copan this time he hits the Applause Mark I need it was just a little couple of friendly words from Adrian arrey over on the sideline so the seventh May three of the season for quader Copeland found his comfort zone at the other end of the floor this is Reed against two Defenders Copeland came over to help Mintz theyre going to get Copeland and his Applause Applause first youre watching ACC basketball in the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve so glad that youre with us on a Saturday night Winston Salem North Carolina one thing I will note Tom for the for the viewers that uh under Adrian arrey theyre playing a lot more manto man this year as opposed to the two3 zone that Jim beims but on underneath out of bounds they will Zone so another foul picked up there by Copeland so thats a quick two and thats also the fifth team foul so wake for is close to in the bonus shooting Adrien arri a standout player in the early 90s in an orange uniform for 12 years as a Syracuse assistant prior to taking over for Jim bahim shot clocks at five Gman Miller miscommunication with Reed it looked like again wles try to throw these home run lobs and that one just ill advised Six turn overs for Wake Forest in the first half the Orange shooting 33 as a team and only down by six Taylor Copelands got nowhere to go shot clock is at five Taylor trying to work the Baseline tough turnaround Fall Away Reed pulled it down had it taken away and then went for the big block Copeland went down carry was in there as Applause well lot of contact on the takeway by Copeland but once that Reed want to make sure that he was going to finish on the play so thats two on Reed Copelands at the free throw line 69 from the stripe on the season for quader Copeland Marsh returning to the lineup with Reed and the two personal fouls to that wake Bench been some very interesting lineups out there for seve force in the first half we Forest Matthew Marsh is seeing action in just his eighth game this season he averages Mike 19 points 31 rebounds hes only attempted nine shots all season he should but he shoots like 80 for his career albe it in relative proximity to the rim details details detail Carr triple teamed found Salis when youre triple teams couple people are bound to be open good find though out of Applause that double figures for Salis with 10 Copeland with the scoop Marsh the block Wake On The Run into the Applause corner inside of 7 and 12 minutes to go in the half this is Miller tough shot and fouled as he hit the Applause deck Hunter Salis the open man and hes got another three point turnovers and points off those turnovers for Syracuse kept them a little bit close in this game Wake Forest so far in the first half Mike 50 6 from the floor as a teen the orange 30 Kevin bopy Miller sophore from Chicago Illinois at the free throw line these are wakes first free throws of the game and Syracuse has only been there two times well that is a rarity boopy shoots 85 from the free throw line seventh in the ACC well this this team is one of the top in the nation and uh weve got some weve got two of the best in the country in this conference wake for is just about right about 80 as a team which is extraordinary yeah second in the conference Mike third in thetion from the stripe as a team for the demon DS Syracuse that might have been the difference Mike at Boston College this week from the free throw line the orange in that game against the Eagles just seven of 14 on free throws shot clock down to seven starling Rises up well and thats how about this 6 and A2 minutes to go in the game and thats starlings first field goal attempt of the game has not even been a part of the offense and hes a double digit score mik almost 13 points per game for number two in Orange they look for marsh hes able to gra and lay it in W they were very fortunate on that play I that was kind of an iffy decision and um Marsh able to keep it alive and convert all it takes is one basket to get to his season average for Matthew Marsh the Junior from Cornwall England whistle stops Music play so Miller has picked up the foul for w Forest his first Steve Forbes is in his fourth year the first year on the bench for Adrien autrey I got to watch him play Mike AA ston in the early 90s in the dome under coach beheim fantastic player still one of the alltime assist Applause leaders still a lot of orange over on the bench Jerry Mima there as well family tree is on travel part of the 03 National Championship team for Syracuse wa Forest on the other hand Mike trying to get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2017 you can see that Marsh as far as scoring is concerned it has been a while early December bonus production from number Applause 33 Miller around the edge over the taller defender in Taylor pretty nice job by Taylor to shut him off and make him settle for a tough fallway Taylor squares up for the three thats just two of eight now for the orange and threes and hild beats everybody to the rim well and you know what with a guy with an injured hand like that you bail him out by trying for a steal outside and then give him a free run to the rim 80 run the largest lead of the half for Wake Forest Taylor with a quick First Step Carr trying to recover and he bumped Applause him heres the look I mean right here you go that you just wave at it right there theres nobody in to pick up theres no real shot blocker per se I mean you know Malik Brown you know is you know can in a pinch but no real presence in there for Syracuse Taylor behind the line still a little bit off the Mark hes shooting Syracuse out of this game right now 32 threepoint shooter on the season for Justin Taylor for the sophomore from Charlottesville Virginia hildr driving again the spin Copeland was ready to defend it and see that thats again with the the way hes shooting he turns right back into the defense and that was an easier block but a good defensive Play Taylor tries the other side once again its off the mark over 5 minutes without a field goal for Syracuse Salis the other way the basket will not count foul on the floor so wake is into the bonus one and Applause one starling picked up the foul his first Monsanto back into the lineup hes got a three in the game Taylor is really struggled hes out of the game now he really struggled from three in ACC play but Salis that you know again those long rebounds off the Miss threes and he had a good Rush up the floor Tuesday on inside the NFL the match up for the big game is set the guys take a look at the keys to victory for both the 49ers and Chiefs inside the NFL Super Bowl Edition Tuesday 87 Central only on the CW cant even imagine what Las Vegas is going to be Applause like the drrive continues for the Applause Music Applause orange Starling step happen behind the line in front of the wig bench for three yeah in this last four plus minutes they desperately need him to get going how about Miller stepping on the accelerator at the other end right you want to try to force him to go left I mean make him go to his off hand but he he beats you with his off hand and finishes this is mitz and he rises up over Miller and hits it well at 64 hes going to have that Advantage quickly to the other end for Miller and with his speed you know Miller able to not not afraid to go inside against a taller back court get your stopwatch out Mike 325 and rolling to go in our first half weight by Applause 14 Williams lost it on the way up to the Monsanto remember wake had a 10point lead Mike earlier this week and gave it up at pit hit traveling violation and so when we come back the orange will have the basketball win has the lead on its own floor CW thats nine yeah early on uh opportunistic doing it off of his defense getting Steals and uh Silas has been perfect from the field four four two of two from behind the arc so their big big scores have showed up and uh its been uh its been nice balanced scoring for Wake Forest and uh really Syracuse is looking for that second guy Starling has been quiet but did step up and hit that last three Starling has one of the three made threepointers in the game for the orange on 11 tries I think so early early wake is you know mission accomplished keeping Syracuse off the free throw line you know mince is shooting a high percentage but not drawing fouls and there and they will stay theyre going to jump him with the big guy and get the ball out of his hands inside of the cham for brown theyll live with that play if if they can get the ball out of mins hands theyll live with that to a certain degree after the jam the orange have made their last three shot attempts wake has made Seven of its last nine and shooting close to 60 in the first half as a team Carr around Brown offensive foul extended the left arm trying to get to the rim heres the look I mean you can you can see car was really just extended way out on the floor help a little bit late getting there a good find inside but down this end there was really nobody inside in the lane sometimes if there were bodies in there you can get away with that play but clearly that left arm was extended good call Jamie lucky and so both both Reed and Carr have two personals Marsh back in mitz goes right by him tries to spin it in and then Brown tried to get up on the cylinder and theyre going to get the orange for basket interference I dont know how that one didnt go in sort of a counterclockwise spin here Mike yeah like a lot of my puts back in the day then it was round trying to get a piece of it so wake with the basketball and the lead mince tried to anticipate Miller spins and hits seven points three of five shooting bopy Applause Miller mince the Copeland lost it in the paint to hildr he scraps with Williams good technical foul now might be on Benny Williams I dont know who the call was on there was an initial call on the fight for the loose ball so well get this sorted out heres the sequence as William strips it away from hildr then just kind of sends the ball over the Applause Music Baseline so they announced cordier copelan for the foul which would be his third personal and and then Williams for the tech and just those unnecessary cheap points that he cant be throwing away on the road and uh you know its there are small things but we characteristically missing a couple of free throws leaving some points there at the free throw Applause Music line yeah being confirmed that the technical foul there you see Benny Williams picking it up and now hildr to the free throw line Taylor set the check Music Applause in missing the front end of the one and one for hildr and as I always say after that first technical everybody behave out of the the floor because that second te can come pretty easily from the corner fouled in the act of shooting Chris Bell and and really an unnecessary foul by Monsanto and hes really working back into shape and the thing with him Tom is that with his with that injury he cant really guard out on the wing and Steve Forbes is forced to play him more at the four position playing a bigger body hes he cant react as he normally would against a quicker player so Chris Bell is at the line hes only attempted 14 free throws this season and made 10 of them and now 11 coming up on the Subaru halftime report from Winston Salem first half stats and highlights and well check in on the first event of the season for live golf its all coming up on the Subaru halftime report see to me Chris bell falls into the scary category because hes capable hes had three 20po games this year but his last four 12 points Five Points 13 points two points so hes capable of a big night hes also capable of Disappearing he averages double digits just over 10 per game how about the work by hild at the other end for Wick Forest hes done some pretty good offensive work in this game ild now has six points Mintz on the drive Applause Music fouled first on hildr and I make that point about Bell because in The Scouting Report you have to prepare like hes going to be on you know you cant you cant just roll a dice and say all right hes going to be off tonight speaking of Las Vegas there you go on my mind mince at the line 77 is the best free throw shooter for the orange we told you about his robust free throw numbers Mike third in the nation in total attempted free throws yeah and that that is hes he has taken almost half of Syracuses attempts as a team double figures now for the 20th time this season for Judah minz after the free throws hes attempted 187 free throws on the season hildr head of steam cuff was defending Hilter just came in and picked up a foul double bonus now for Applause him 453 seconds to go in our first half as we told you at the top of the broadcast Steve Forbes team is 11 and0 add that with the last two years Mike when they went 10 and0 at home theyve won 11 straight home games for the first time since 1999 and struggles from the line for hild Mike thats uncharacteristic 84 and eighth in the conference from the free throw line for Hilton four of eight now as you know for the half first game of the season against Elon hildr went for 30 three points a career high in the most by any weight player this Applause season now 30 seconds to go in the half thats cuff workor in the Baseline taken away by hildr up ahead Monsanto T Salis on the business end of the Alle so much for holding it for the last shot but uh Adrian arer going to use that timeout set up a last play with 195 Applause Music left great look ahead right here just I mean the ball just hit the ball and floor one time on that break I mean this this took all of about 3 seconds to get up the floor for a dunk now the largest lead of the game for Wake if you thought growing up was hard try doing in the 80s catch an all new episode of The CW original comedy son of a crit Thursdays at a new time 98 Central only on the CW stream for free now on the CW app man I did it in the 60s kicking at Old School in Winston Salem largest lead right now that guy had man hand he did tell you what when they flung open the doors to open the building the students stampeded into the building yep in an orderly fashion to get to their seats behind the basket to our left broadcast position off to the left we are Courtside CW Courtside Saturday at Night final seconds Mintz against two Defenders got the shot away and hit it with about two seconds on the Applause clock so a bucket late for Judah men who has thir the guy they need to get going is Fon Reed uh had foul issues in the first half only played eight minutes has not scored only took one point uh one shot this is Carr try to muscle his way inside for two really dont have any answer for him and he knocked down a three early in the game had a couple of good post possessions seven points now for Andrew Carr senior from Westchester Pennsylvania thats Starling yeah conversely thats who Syracuse had to get going so no surprise getting the ball in his hands and letting him get some early shots its just 34 as a team shooting in that first half for the orange Starling after that jumper now has five touch foul thatll be against Taylor number five in Orange well that time he tried to front car a little bit too aggressively getting the foul so thats the first on Taylor Miller thats what they were working on he took the ball out of bounds and uh they worked on that in practice him stepping right in and being the guy eventually was going to shoot the ball for three had a decent look at Applause it Taylor one dribble and the shot in Rhythm for two yeah but again I think its thats the better choice they were able to drive him off the threepoint line and make that a long twopoint shot first points of the game for Justin Taylor averages just over five per game for the orange but early on in the second half better offensive execution for Syracuse and and uh wideopen driving lane for poopy Miller he now has nine after the drive and layup Taylor at the other end for three hit the deck after the release and rip the ropes for Syracuse maybe that uh that midrange jump shot was the thing he needed to get him in Rhythm that was under duress came close to getting a maybe a fourpoint play last five points for the orange coming from number five out to challenge car shock lock down to six for Miller gets away from a couple of Defenders Salis is open makes no mistake and Miller he made that play he he split the he split the Trap that time somehow kept his dribble alive and you know Salas was basically playing horse three for three on threepoint shot Salis Bell couldnt connect Salis has 18 points to lead all scorers in our Music game Miller sharp angle around Min calculating the angle off the backboard with the scoop for boopy double digits Mike with 11 I dont know how he got that up I you know I thought he was going to drop that off to read underneath but it finished with his left hand as well 19 times this season double figures for Miller Taylor pumps up another three hildr over the top of the board and run tried to get around Mintz impeded his progress and picks up the foul so for mince that is his second remember he picked up an early foul in the first Music half great conversation this afternoon at the shoot around with Adrien arrey taking over for a legend smooth transition though former player Carr ran into a roadblock Salis for the style points that was deflected into the back court and Reed was the one who kept that alive nice Applause play hrth goes the other way hangs and scores count the bucket and hes going to the line well you know what time when your right wrist is bothering you finish with your left and uh this was just a great take goes inside absorbs the contact great finish underneath just refused to scream that time they were playing to drive middle and he the W just the Baseline was wide open and looked like he got raped across the nose a little bit so Brown committed the foul hildr at the line for the old school threepoint play again 84 of the Season top 10 of the ACC from the Music strike well and you know and we and we fail to note too that hes got nine rebounds in this game rattles home from Applause Taylor thats now eight points in a couple of Threes this half and Taylor has not been shy about shooting the ball in this game he leads them in field goal attempts with nine two of seven on threepointers for Taylor trying to defend Salis yeah this a guy who comes in averaging Five Points a game car of the block once again imposes his will puts it over the front rim Syracuse not coming in in double teaming those wakes post guys are having oneonone play inside mince with a lightning quick move then it got knocked away from Copeland back to Mintz pass in tight quarters deflected by Marsh getting significant minutes tonight for the demon deakes up 5538 will step aside on the SE tournament be Kansas and depal lost to Houston to be eliminated from the tournament in 84 when they went 23 and9 used to give Johnny Dawkins fits and Johnny always used to say when you didnt see him you know you were in trouble well they had Mugsy in 84 and we got boopy in 2024 for Wake trying to defend minz he tosses that one into the front row Applause so hildr on his own mic almost as many rebounds as the orange well I mean right now wake shooting 67 from the floor there only been 11 rebounds in the game thats true to be had so hildr and there will be no rebound on that shot for three for hild well we we talked about it over I mean across the board wake is an elite shooting team 12 points now for hildr this season theyre fourth in the conference overall in shooting plus theyre on their home floor where they have not lost this season 11 and0 Copeland cut off tried to go behind the back and Marsh anticipated and deflected out of bounds I mean I you know I really think you know they cant let up obviously at home but I think for wake in the second half of the season its going to be solving things on the road if they can do that then uh you know theyre going to be a factor in the league so thats Miller and Marsh and Carr coming out saw Reed and Frederickson join the lineup along with Monsanto MCE with the shot clock almost Applause empty Salis was the nearest Defender yeah no reason for him to to fight on that PK Music fake right here just you know keep your feet keep your hand keep a hand up challenge the shot its going to be a tough shot Applause anyway you that that that may be the thing that that drives me crazy the most is you know when when you bite on a pump fake on a jump shot like that youre not going to block it anyway just trying to determine Mike how many free throws is entitled to from that line look well yeah because you go up right there and it just you couldnt see where he actually left the floor Music Applause from so look right from behind the back door it looks like his toe is on the line there and it looks like two from that view Clarence Armstrong is over at the replay machine and it looks like in in getting the contact it looks like he went over the line tough to see Mark Schnur has joined Clarence Armstrong at the scorers table tomorrow on CW womens Hoops Peter Rivals Collide as the Hurricanes pay a visit to Tallahasse to take on the seminal Miami and Florida State tomorrow special time 1100 am eastern 800 am Pacific only on the CW Miamis won two in a row Florida state is 102 on their home floor and they Collide tomorrow on the CW I think kenon they decided was it was two free throws or there will be two free throws coming but a little side a good side story for Wake Forest is that deari monsano has gotten some good extended Port time here today and you know Steve Forbes told us it would be situational there would be depending on you know who he could guard how he feel how the game went and uh but but so far you know this is its going to be good for him to get in some Rhythm out there get his conditioning up especially in the game you know the sleeve on the left leg Monsanto played N9 minutes of the game against Pittsburgh which was a loss on the road on Wednesday for Wake Forest a game in which they led by 10 points so maybe thats why Gman was wondering how this might turn out as the Hustle by Taylor its going to pay off and monsano kind of gave up on the play I was afraid to touch it but a good smart play by Taylor to finish it off Taylors up into double figures Mike hes got Tenny almost poked that one away from Monsanto that one you you take the turnover grab it if anything and just stop the play deflected by mitz twoonone action with Copeland and Copeland will go in for the double fisted Rim rocker and Steve Forbes wants a Timeout on the Wake side of sense his team falling asleep a little bit right there so he wants to get their Music attention they got his attention by giving up the basketball and a quick Four Points by the orange Steel by minz the feed to Copeland but a slam for the C and prior to our game many of you saw NC State defeat Georgia Tech that was in Raleigh 7976 this is game two of CW Courtside Saturday Mintz goes down on the Applause Music inbounds Judah men leads the orange with 13 points take a look at this here Applause Mike just it was he was guarding Hildreth and on the separation I couldnt he couldnt see anything you saw the right arm come up and through Applause referees are going to take a look at it yeah there was no foul called initially on the play mic they are reviewing the video for potential flagrant Music foul and it was hildr who was trying to get to the inbounds pass got tangled up with mints you see right here watch the right arm right there is where the contact takes Applause place now the thing that for you know with the contact or you know what what waake now is theyre going to you know the pressure is going to be there and and boopy Miller not on the floor so its you know thats the thing theyre going to have to deal with the referees are having real issues trying to see anything here well we got Jamie lucky and Mark Schnur conversing they are not noticing anything on the replay mik Mark Schnur coming over to talk to Gman just to get a clarification again the key terminology is was it excessive was it extreme did it warrant a flagrant file and they say no right yeah theyre going to know and theyre going to get but they do get a new 10 seconds to get it across the the half court line so inadvertent contact by hildr against Mintz and the good thing is Mintz appears to be okay part of the fullcourt pressure hild tried to Chisel his way through the double punches it up to Salis Monsanto unloads for a three wow that that possession had disaster written all over it and it ends up in a May three second three of the game on Santo and the Hustle by hildr broke the double team Mike and then punched It Forward Malik Brown gets a offensive foul oh watch this this is a turnover waiting right here s the heads up play the Good find right Applause here incredible Applause finish second three of the game mons sento and again this is just his fourth game back from a significant knee injury the late stages of the season a year ago deari Monsanto Richard senior from Hook Pines Florida this is Reed gave it up perimeter work shot clock to five Salis met in midair mind you by Malik Brown and all this work is being done with Reed having yet to score in this game and only has taken one shot attempt not really forcing things does have six rebounds two assists so doing other things out on the floor so wake following up that 64 Mike their best shooting half of the Season you saw what theyve done so far in the second half 8 of Music 10 Peter Carrey comes in for brown with the four personals Taylor whos been a scoring spark also comes out of the lineup for the orange Applause biggest lead of the night right here Salis has 20 points what a reliable scorer he is for this team 10th time this year 20 points or more in a Game Hunter Salis to transfer from Gonzaga good AC of Hands by Sal that time 9 seconds on the shot clock you know they give coaches all sorts of awards I they got to come up with something for portal well success because Steve for its the Steve Forbes award yeah hes hes got to be right at the top of the list Alis Williams yeah player of the year two seasons Applause Music Applause ago Starling through some traffic and congestion seven points for Starling and all seven of those have been really tough he is not at anything easy inside of 12 minutes to go in our second half Tom wormy Mike jinsky and our outstanding production crew with you from Winston Salem with the shot clock at six taken away from Fon Reed mince to tough catch ill advised pass no room for him to catch Min just trying to stop Miller who was going one on three and thats a 16 foul for the orange get a big hole in the road it againsts wake 1141 to go in our second half this Sunday its rivalry week on CW womens Hoops Miami looks to steal a victory on the road against rival Florida State and the highscoring seals its a good defensive team North Carolina rebounding after their loss on the road at Georgia Tech which by the way Mike for Damon St those two home wins they theyve beaten Duke and North Carolina at home this season Armando Bott by the way Mike 25 points 10 boards Harrison Ingram 21 points 13 boards in the North Carolina win against visiting Duke theyll play again at the end of the season cars at the line and uh you know its interesting Steve forb talking about that Carolina team today you you see what you see what kind of offensive team that that Wake Forest is and he said we couldnt score there and they scored 63 points against North Carolina and it wasnt it wasnt even a game uh that thats a good thats a very very good North Carolina team they theyre theyre a team that could be ranked number one that hasnt been ranked number one in the country this year and youre talking about wake Mike they are number one in scoring as a team in ACC play about 78 and a half points per game they are they are extremely efficient this evening without one of their top scores having a game at all and E Reed First missing five attempts for the orange wake has also made its last four shot attempts this is Starling right in the face of the defender Frederickson double digits for Starling and 10 points Salis chases it down Carr wants to harvest a threepointer W just in transition I think this is a very difficult team to put any pressure on especially with Miller I havent seen many guys who are fast and and good with the basketball as he is especially and you get Solace whos a solid back ball handler as well nine made threes in the game for Wake thats Copeland on the inside Salis and Carr converging on him defensively Applause Music consider that Wake Forest bike since the 2122 season 42 and5 is their home record and again theyve started 10 and0 and this year 11 and0 the last three seasons at home well and also we we touched that at the beginning then even though theyre there right now they for all intents and purposes have kept Syracuse off the free throw line still 10 and a half minutes to go in the game but they defended without Applause fouling that was just the 10th attempted free throw in the game for the orange skillfully Applause broken Salis bothered Miller Scoops it up takes it right to the rim what we talking about you hes giving away a lot of some size but he is really strong and that was a tough finish through contact and he now has 13 points 19 times this season double digit scoring for Miller theyre attacking their pressure to score theyre just not satisfied getting it over half court Copeland open for a three Salis challenged car the rebound they try to rip it away from him with Williams and carry and this the thing too you know Syracuse is not a great offensive rebounding team heres the look pretty good strength through that double team and right there I mean he just goes right through a bigger guy and finishes you know last season Miller only played four games Mike because of injury spent two years in the program at Central Michigan his first year in awake Forest uniform and he is an impact transfer without a doubt well you got you got starters on this team theyre Play Everybodys playing over 30 minutes a game just about and nobody complaining about playing time now you know how is that going to how is that going to do over the course of the Season you know we well see and you know weve weve seen a bunch of different lineups here this evening for for Wake Force guys whove gotten minutes that havent played in a while Andrew Carr now has 16 points what above his season average just a shade over 14 Copeland on the drive lost it out of Applause bounds turning into a frustrating evening for coach arrey and the orange on the Applause road overall they are two and four away from the Dome and one and four in conference play they almost were able to separate that basketball for car they did it went out of bounds off of Syracuse and see its 610 hes he can be an automatic Outlet coming in good pressure release just like wake has been good at home Mike Syracuse been good at the Dome theyre 10 and one this season on their home floor Jim beheim Court only lost to Florida State and the sizable Advantage right now for wake and it appears that they are well on their way to 12 and0 at home this year Mike and you talked about the group with the five ACC wins both of these teams are in that group and it looks like wake is going to six ACC wins and theyve put on an impressive performance shooting the basketball tonight well and and the reason I say that that somebodys got to separate is because none of them really have an outstanding nonconference record so you know they theyve got to make some inroads in conference Applause so Miller didnt get it over the mid Court strip in time he tried the demon Deeks are going to be on the road at Georgia Tech home game against NC State and then two in a row on the road Duke and Virginia orange have three straight home games coming up Mike Louisville Clemson and North Carolina at the Dome Music Williams the cutter was Mintz gave it to Copeland tough shot nine points for Applause Copeland that was Reed and Copeland fighting for position on the entry pass SP one and one and uh but going forward its going to be the double bonus for way course that was 19 foul so the fourth on Copeland will put Reed at the free throw line and as you mentioned Mike he has not scored tonight does have six rebounds hes only attempted one Applause shot good big man free throw shooter 89 on the season Fon Reed for the Junior from Richmond Virginia check out the CWs brand new hit series that critics are calling fresh and fiery and a damn good time watch wild cards this Monday 98 Central or stream free anytime on the CW app Lake Forest has certainly been fresh and fiery tonight on their home floor doing the job both ends on the floor they allowed pit to score 50 points in the second half of that loss on Wednesday not going to be the case Applause tonight Miller was defending second on booy Miller wow there was there were some better threepoint shooting for the pit Panthers in that game in the second half wish leget really lit them up that was a tough matchup for them Music Williams fouled on the Applause Music drive so thats a third on Carr so I think this is the one hope that Syracuse has that they can make this game extremely ugly for the last Applause 8 but that being said if they in a free throw shooting contest technically weight should have the big Advantage at 80 and second best in the conference you would think that wouldnt be the prettiest TV in the world but Carr spins it tried to adjust in midair Miller is there to clean it up you know I dont you dont normally like your point guard hanging around the offensive glass but uh that was a pretty good cleanup 15 points for Miller we saw him go for a careerhigh 27 in the overtime win against Miami on this court a couple of weeks ago Frederickson Applause money that that was another pass they got away with that turned into a good result result 10 made threes in the game on 15 attempts Mike that is 67 from Beyond The Arc that wins a lot of games tom outrageous I mean they were already the third best threepoint shooting team and then its Miller again inside time out on the court wake rolling 7 and A2 minutes to go in our second half this is CW Courtside Saturday represented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years thats right 10 m threes by the deeps tonight and you know a lot of them have been in in scramble mode almost off of almost missed you know turnovers and uh some of them under duress just you seen a big basket at home you I think really the uh you know the good news for for Wake Forest fans is you know youre looking for even better stuff is the game that hildr is having offensively you know he had been struggling so much offensively but five of seven for him hes got a double double in this game 12 points 10 rebounds five of seven shooting his first double double of the Season Mike second of his career he also has a triple double and that came in the 2022 23 season at home against Hampton with 14 Points 11 boards and 10 assists Williams still scrapping on the offensive glass for Benny Williams its only two other players by the way who have triple doubles at wake Tim Duncan yes and hes the other one weve already named him yeah player of the yearis Music absolutely old school threepoint play for Williams well yeah when you get a triple double with blocks youre doing some work shout out to my Center Compadre Miller couldnt use the English to spin it in how about the other in the drive Copeland and a steel Starling fouled and to the line for Starling and Benny Williams actually made that play there was a monsant was open down the floor they were looking deep but he blocked it little turnaround so in addition to that play by Starling hes made a couple of threepointers in the game on two tries made four threes Mike and scored 18 points to tie for the team lead at Boston College this Applause week sophomore from Baldwinsville New York in the Syracuse area in a transfer from noted a that we noted at the top of the Music broadcast so Salis comes in Frederickson out Salis leads everybody Mike with his 20 in fact he is one of four wake players to get the double digits Syracuse went on an 80 run in 18 seconds yeah over that last Applause sequence so the lead is 21 with 650 to Applause go and Copeland just picked up his fifth Applause personal so quader copel disqualified with a fifth personal foul 11 points in the game Mike four of eight shooting and that included a three well and this is where you know for Wake Force the F the defending without fouling really becomes critical you know just you dont want to give them you dont want to bail them out with any situation you dont want to stop the clock make it a tough shot go and get the rebound if they make a tough shot you know fine get it in take it up the floor Applause 21 points for Salis so far hes made all his threepointers tonight three of three Reed off the Miss and now Miller so sales has 47 made threes this season thats the most for Wake man lightning quick poopy Miller I mean how many layups has he scored yeah and just again spread out no real shot blocker right there and you you underestimate how fast he can get to the rim Round Shot bounced out swatted out of bounds and stays with Syracuse right here I mean its just that initial burst of speed and he can finish with either hand thats the beauty of of you know he can go with his left or his right he and his teammates trying to stop a two game losing streak and see how balanced they have been throughout the season and tonight and thats with Reed only two points Williams catching release stop me if youve heard it before no Im he going to beat everybody down the Applause floor 21 for Applause Miller told you the last time we were in the house he went for a career high 27 and OT against Miami he just picked up the foul too I think he may request CW and our and our outstanding production crew to come back for another game here comes boopy buckets style points too remember the orange had buddy buckets few years ago now wake has boopy buckets HTH got bumped over zealous defending by Brown hildr as Mike mentioned with the double double tonight and thats going to be the fifth on Malik Brown hell be the second orange player to foul out Peter Carrys going to come Applause in so Brown m a struggle just two points and one 104 Applause shooting did lead him with the eight rebounds its amazing there have only been there only been 19 available rebounds in the game for cuse well and six and six and six of those have been missed free throws by Wake Forest which is uncharacteristic and wake is shooting 70 as a team the building record is 702 at one point WG was above that at 707 they 705 right now there you Applause go math class with jinsky Reed hell back his way in on carry he cant get any closer I dont know where he was backing into Applause 711 Tom okay youll give you keeping an eye it to bucket update were going to the update desk with jinsky the market closes in five four 4 minutes and 57 seconds what what a defensive play by Carr not letting up at all Miller eyes for the rim this time he finds Applause Music Sal Hunter Salis four for four from threepoint distance to the dismay of the folks who have made the trip from Central New York to watch their orange so earlier we mentioned that the deakes have not been back to the tournament since 2017 Mike heres what theyve done so far this season including their net ranking NCAA evaluation tool of 50 yeah theres work to do there for sure T and and again I I think the majority of it in the second half is going to be on the road in the ACC and that thats where theyve got to show a lot you know some big Improvement and this is this has been an offensive clinic this evening and thats what probably this may be one of their worst free throw shooting performances of the year but from the field unbelievable like theyve got to find a way to transition this out on the Applause road and they only went six of 22 on threepointers at Applause pit tonight they are 11 of 16 and that computes the 69 you know the the interesting thing Steve Forbes was was talking us today about this that at home their opponents average 13 free throw attempts per game on the road 26 and that is a thats a strange disparity you know thats not just three or four thats double and he says a lot of that is in the second half its transition points and free throw attempts that have been a real problem for them theyve been just two and four in their last six games and as I mentioned on a two game losing streak it appears that it is going to end tonight against the orange with 4 and 12 minutes to go and of the Applause line Peter carry the sophomore from Sunderland Massachusetts distracted by Miss Swift in the background I think I know where shes going to be next Sunday where isnt she although I think she has to travel from Japan oh yeah no problem yeah I dont think thats going to be our guys on inside the NFL will break it down for you what is it I mean I think theres going to be a whole generation of kids who want to grow up being tight ends in the NFL or pop singers one of the two if youre a young lady youre going want to grow up being a pop singer if youre a young man you want to grow up being a tight end I mean between you know with gronowski and now Kelsey I mean its just you Applause know Im sure itll be exciting and as I mentioned our guys on inside the NFL will break it down for you probably going to be the most watched Super Bowl of all time I cant I cannot I mean Brock P the last pick and you know I cant but I cant go against I cant go against mahom I cant tough to do I cant you know that the 49ers have won a Super Bowl since the mid 90s does that seem possible was obviously the Chiefs have a couple Mahomes Starling not to digress too much but this wake performance tonight might could be historical as we go inside of four minutes just I it just one of the one of the great shooting performances Ive seen somehow Reed shovel it to the corner in Applause Salis Applause so well well check on possession when we come back 94 61 Reed and the DS when youre great your game does the talk visit progressivecom yeah Syracuse has done a lot of looking at the back of BL Millers uniform because he has just been an overdrive through the whole game 10 of 14 from the field 21 points for him five rebounds three assists hes been fabulous 14 points in the second half time theres a chance that he and his teammates can hit 1009 for the last time they did that and Mike is keeping an eye on that percentage the building record is 702 by wake field goal shooting cuff for three you know the and the one thing too I mean if if Steve Forbes you know coach youre going look at something youre going to grind and youre going to have something to get on your team about a third of Syracuses points have been off turnovers so and again taking care of the ball especially some of the caress turnovers that wake has had you clean those up and this is about as good a game as you can play I think they knew that the orange might be able to do that they forced 21 turnovers against BC which created 18 18 points although they lost by five thats their strength and its one of the categories where they do you know theyre very highly ranked in the lead too strong for carry Carr hits the deck and saves it to Reed all right final two and a half minutes of this one Reed why Applause not and percentage plummets to Music 688 Starling the jumper so wake led by 14 points at halftime Mike they limited the orange to just 28 points in the first half and now as we hit the twominute threshold wake has put 94 on the board make it 96 thanks to Music Applause Reed hes got eight this team really is I mean theyve got size theyve got threepoint shooting theyve got good guard play all of those points for Reed coming in the second half Williams a twisting turn away tough angle 24 points in the game for Salis leading scorer another Music three and it comes from the bench of bro zunka his first May three of the Season perfect from the floor sophomore from Italy Genoa right Mike Gena Northwest Italy sophomore guard 66200 and Jet Al with that threepointer just think the salami transfer from UCLA played 22 games in that program season ago we got some major league substitutions coming so maybe at halftime Mike coach forp said remember what happened to that 10point lead on the road at pit on Wednesday dont let that happen again right remember remember they had you and you touched on an eightpoint run in uh like 20 seconds and he called a quick timeout right there and uh fron is coming in Mike Miller just went out how about 21 points for Bry Miller got one of my my home country men in Marcus Maran from Denmark in our games on the CW Miller has scored 48 points Williams offensive glass kobre in particular 54 seconds to go so coach Forbes is on his way to his 64th win on the Wake bench his 362nd overall as a head coach Coach of the Year back in 2022 in the ACCC they won 19 games last year Mike and this one is going to give them 14 wins Jam at the other end flying Chris Applause Bell Marcus Maran as Mike mentioned is into the game number one for wake fredericksons in Applause there bounces off for Aaron Clark The Freshman from eastn Pennsylvania man I am scrambling with the roster right now let Im sure thats the way wake like it although Mike theyre going to come up short of 100 and what about the field goal percentage Mike whats it going to be 66 its not going to be good enough the building record stands at 702 for field goal percentage 9970 the demon daks
