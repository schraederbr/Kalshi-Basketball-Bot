the three also reads the floor like a guard in there triple handoff action these two teams can fill it up 80 points a game for Miami 75 for Virginia Tech hurricanes in the Hokies played three weeks ago it was a close game throughout that Miami won by nine will jump it up with North Chad omear in Grant basily and it will be the hurricane to control it Jamie Lucky Patch Driscoll Perry oglesiar officials tonight and first possession of the game goes to the highest scoring team in the ACC start the night a half game out of first place theres omir the Brad transfer didnt hit the rim shot clock didnt start and zilly with a good block out itll be Virginia Tech ball this is a smaller Miami team norchado mirror 67 on the front line but you see how quick he is off his feet so he plays bigger than a six seven frame starting lineup for Virginia Tech MJ Collins The Freshman from over South Carolina in there Purdue has had a great year and Hunter Couture has a chance too Justin mutz the leader the veteran gets the first two of the night for the Hokies these are two very well coached teams very well prepared to play in the quarter Court offensively which means as the game slows down I expect this to be a possession for a possession game easy buckets not going to be able to be had by either two this is an undersized Miami team but one with a lot of scoring options as omir is off to a tough start around the basket hes missed a couple and averaging close to a doubledouble for Jim larranegas team will doing a good job keeping his dribble alive stretching that trap but then he turns it over he turned it over six times when they met earlier this year that was a game in Coral Gables Debbie that featured 17 lead changes and the guy dribbling the ball now Nigel pack would scoreless until the final 508 of the game and he went off for 17 including five threes well Virginia Tech Target over 14 times in that game and led to 24 Miami points that cant happen tonight at home theres another turnover for the hurricane theres Jim larenega his 12th season took his team to the elite eight last year hes revitalized Miami basketball the elite eight run theyve won the ACC only Elite eight appearances five of their 11 NCAA tournament bids have come under larnagas watching for the first time in his career hes been nominated for the Nate Smith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame and Hunter Couture needs three points for a thousand was wide left on that one that is uncharacteristic when Mike young has done a sensational job now in his fourth season about 12 miles from where he was born in Radford Virginia won the ACC tournament last year a thrilling four win in four days with the championship Victory coming against Duke behind the MVP performance from Couture Isaiah long driving in and Isaiah cant get it to go Jordan Millers scrapping and pulling it out of there is Hunter Couture Miami has not scored but they are easily getting to the paint with a lot of shot opportunities at The Rim its good an offensive team as Miami is Debbie that wont continue if they continue getting those types of hooks theyve missed their first five though on the road and that could be a problem for Virginia Tech if they dont contain dribble penetration and keep him out of the middle did you see that pass from mutts bazilly couldnt finish it the grand transfer from Wright State but mutts has exceptional Vision very versatile player Miller gets around much and uses the left hand beautiful George Miller is not who you start on the top of the scouting report for Miami but he is capable in all three levels of producing offensively good pass from Collins in this time basily can finish it and its flowing moving offense from the Hokies has produced a couple of good opportunities already really good misdirection on the weak side and Vasily does a great job of cutting hard off that Couture Exchange great crowd in here Reese its starting to heat up too it was a hot day here in Blacksburg unseasonably warm and no AC in the house Seth Greenberg built it didnt take long theres Miller again with two boards the veteran guy who does a little bit of everything averaging about 15 points a game sort of settling things down for mccains who got off to a little bit of a shaken start on the offense then are you thinking Seth ought to pitch in for some AC Im going to leave that alone hey I think Seth donated a lot here but Jamie lucky the call inside not going to put up with the nonsense Anthony Walker whos into the game from larenaga and picked up that foul foreign and now checking in for Virginia Tech is Lynn Kidd hes a transfer from Clemson he had six points in the first meeting between these two hitting all three of his field goal attacks situational offense key for both teams scoring on your Baseline out of bounds heres your chance to really execute exactly what you want Miller looked as if he had the thing blocked but now kid continues his 100 field goal percentage against Miami this season more size and depth on the front line for Virginia Tech and Mike young going to sub early getting basily off the floor Applause Longs got a lot of tools in the back to be able to find ways to score so dude is that guy Nigel pack transfer from Kansas State and theyve hit their last three shots now hurrying down the floor and Ted with the flush really good Advanced pass by Couture up the floor and Debbie thats what Miami said it wanted to do was beat Virginia Tech down the floor but it was the Hokies giving the canes a little bit of their own medicine early on Applause Miami has been able to get inside this Virginia Tech defense every possession cuts off pack momentarily now three ball on the way in and rattles out from Miller heres Padua using the kids screen Padula down the Boulevard and he scores when we talked to Sean Padula today and he is a scoring mentality on the top of the floor something thats different from Mike Youngs system theyre both learning to adjust but that was a great decision by Sean always laughing coaches have to adjust the guys who can score and they looked around the country and seen how many teams cant score we got a guy who can score oh I love a scoring point you make that adjustment anytime Padua can score gets a man on the air with a shot fake and cant get it to go scramble look whos first down there to get it Couture and he is tied up and I think Nigel pack got one right across the bridge of the nose with a poplar a little slow to get up as well so weve got some action in the early going here okay basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance its easy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom there have been Thrillers in this series Debbie Charlie Moore hitting the walkoff this is what Digger Phelps used to call Munich he hits the shot you run to the locker room dont give him a chance to overturn him that was the walkoff victory in this building fort Miami then in fact last six meetings they split the last six weve had a triple overtime game an overtime game and a walkoff buzzer beater the average margin Victory less than Four Points its the kind of game we expect tonight and despite the fact that Miamis a half game out of first place in the ACC theyve won six in a row tied with UCLA for the longest winning streak and among power five teams Virginia Techs a two and a half Point favorite and after the Padula bucket up by a half dozen Im not surprised that these two teams because theyre so well prepared so well coached the Scout on both sides this morning was outstanding Applause what Miller has provided the bulk of the offense for Miami in the early Goa he now has six of the Hurricanes eight I love that set coming off the time now Virginia Tech ran but the Doula got a little back down action because he can score with his back to the basket with Joseph number four is in for the hurricanes and theres Hunter Couture with the three ball and that gives him a thousand points for his career 158 the 50th hokey score one take 1K in his career perfect for Hunter off the flare screen knocks down a triple for Point number one thousand Nigel packed leads it up top omear cant finish it the bucket Couture in the front Court Miamis shock chart would look good everything in the paint but theyre just not converting theres a steal wilgar Poplar Bentley Joseph lines at the Lefty and shot at about two feet long see a hesitation like that and maybe you rethink the thing or maybe you keep going and try to get it to the buck you mean when in doubt dont shoot and Lynn Kidd is still perfect against the game 178 and the Hokies who stopped Pittsburghs sixgame winning streak in here that means in the field North Carolina out Miami a five seed and Virginia Tech has moved back into the under consideration group Miami has sixth quad one wins thats strong laronegas team securely in the field itll just be a question of seating but Virginia Tech on the other hand they need some more signature victories now Virginia Techs got three quad one wins Debbie but they also have four losses in that quad 3 Quad 4 group if you if you you know follow that type of thing they had a seven game losing streak that has been tough to recover from theyve got a couple of questionable losses in recent games Boston College and Georgia Tech right now projecting them out at least under consideration you win a game like this theyve got an opportunity youll see them this weekend against Duke I believe on the road so theres some opportunities in front of in front of Mike Youngs team well I think theyre in March uh Forum right now right this is the way you got to play to be able to get to the postseason so their postseason has already started the clock is working on them Bentley Joseph the feed to omir and norchad finds the range finally to transfer from Arkansas State youre not worried about the score and youre getting points youre getting the ball to the paint I think shots will start to fall youll be fine youre getting the shots you want look their calling card is not defense now they want to scramble create some turnovers get you playing too quickly this is an offensive base basketball team so seven point deficits really not much for Miami to worry about primarily when youve got that guy outside unlimited range as he knocks down the three Nigel has five in the early going and you know you have to have great guard play to advance in the postseason and both these teams have excellent guard play now I got a little issue with Joey lunardi on uh NC State being an eight seed Im not so sure about that theres one of the turnovers we talked about Harlan Beverly ended the game gets to steal and the veteran goes up strong just like that in transition hit along three get a steal back within two one stop at a time one score at a time do it turned down that screen and now the feed inside to Poteet and milanjo Poteet the transfer from rice and they just Rave about his hands and his footwork he knows what hes in there for to provide some muscles some size and to score around the basket and he does that hes coming off a plane 20 minutes in that Pittsburgh game where he had his season high at Virginia Tech 15 points heres pack again pack started feeling it as I mentioned earlier at the end of the game and decided to do a little heat check here in the early going and this second meeting between the Kings and the Hopkins theres pasilli for three and it rattles out whats done for the Hokies one of the tools that facility has in his bag that he is very capable of that short roll torque Pop I should say Miller had it knocked away as he goes out of bounds Virginia Tech has sent Rodney rice into the game highly touted freshman this just his second game of the season Deb you want to talk about some tough luck have some ankle surgery cost you 16 games to come back against Syracuse tough place to play only hit one of nine shots at least you know for a youngster seeing that zone for the first time and then he suffers a hand injury and is just back in the lineup tonight after that well I know they had high aspiration for him at the beginning of the season and when he played in that Syracuse game they were playing without Couture so padul played 40 minutes in that game the bucket last time that was a new advised passed by Padua Beverly is going to drive hell kick it out to Bentley Joseph Joseph it didnt work out so well in the three ball last time this one much better and Miami takes the lead 20 to 19 you see the speed of Miami and how quickly they convert off their defense thats the first thing coach laronega talks about is generating turnovers getting stopped so they can get out on the break Padua tries to answer for the mistake omir who can be a rebounding machine hes almost stands six seven but the explosive guy strong McCains the last 245 on a 122 run and they havent even gotten Isaiah long started yet Kane turn it over as Beverly and Wong got a little disheveled along the sideline Tuesday presented by Progressive on the banks of red cedar Michigan State in Indiana tonight nine oclock Eastern time on ESPN of course everyone in Michigan State still recovering from that horrific tragedy and great show of sportsmanship from their Arch rivals in Ann Arbor and Michigan over the weekend when those two played continue to keep everyone in your prayers and hope for healing at Michigan State rice not shy Let it Fly often against Syracuse moves off to Mark here hes a good shooter he hasnt had a chance to play much yet because of all the incidents well its a difference between game speed and practice speed right so hes going to have to play his way in and hes he can be a valuable piece hes a player that can get Virginia Tech a little bit deeper into a postseason opportunity adds to their death certainly their skill set whos no small guy himself theyve hit seven in their last 10 shots North Chad had a big game in the first meeting 21 points and eight rebounds and its a couple of Fighters The Rim Early in the early going but hes found his footing here in the last couple of minutes that ball screen defense of Miami is really pushing Virginia Tech out theyre taking him deeper into the shot clock the Padula loses it on the way to the basket Miami with a threepoint lead laronega has the Kane settled in spent two hours with her on a Saturday at Carver Hawkeye just the two of us and this is one of the videos about her concept about slicing the floor you know I like to cut up the floor when I can I just you know its hard for defenses to move side to side rather than you know going straight on and you know when I get the ball in transition you know thats what I love transition three is to get into the rim um its about thats what our teams about too Maurice Caitlin is third in the nation in scoring 273 points she leads the nation and assists 83 Iowas a projected number two seed but I was also the top scoring team in the nation 88 points a game so thatll be a fun one taking on Indiana for first place in the Big Ten is she the type of player that South Carolina is proven to be the best team in the contribution the type of player they can carry a team to a final four potentially national championship she is the type of player that could do that because of her scoring ability and because of how she impacts scoring for her teammates absolutely shes a tremendous rebounder she sees the floor well and she has logo range which shes famous for Music Virginia Tech got a couple of free throws the last time since we do was they looking for a field goal and thats their first one in about five minutes or so coming from Justin mutts and the Hokies surge back on top Applause both teams hedging on their ball screen action and that means that if you move the ball quickly you could find an open roller to the rim or an open shooter AJ Casey into the game and firing the Freshman from Chicago that they really have high hopes for hes just still developing as he continues in larenagans system games a little straight they really think hes got a bright future for the hurricanes foreign Music ER does such a good job of bouncing that ball screen out Applause and Man in The Mask give Jay Collins gets a baseline bucket still dealing with that broken nose suffered against Virginia you know the last time they played Miami he dislodged a tooth dislodging the defense as Isaiah long and cutting through there for his first bucket of the night I mean Isaiah Wong can turn the corner get to the paint come on heres Collins again they cant get it oh near pulls it away a couple will be closed his scores in the backcourt and Wong and packed Collins with the rebound for the Hokies that is a really deep shot early in the shot clock for Miami Im not sure costar Nega liked that one but he liked it just fine when he made it earlier in the game zilly backing down look at Pat getting in there knocking it away and then bazilly is going to be called for the foul after getting his pocket pick Y and Florida tomorrow night seven oclock Eastern Time Wild catcher played much better and North Carolina is really he saw minority saying theres a first team out in the field of 68 after playing for the national championship a year ago trying to get well at Notre Dame because tomorrow night on ESPN Notre Dame has lost their last two games by a bucket could be a bad recipe for North Carolina going up there behind Dane Goodwin just fight their tails off against Duke and they did the same against Virginia and came up short both times Rodney rice pushing it in transition for the Hokies kid thats a little farther away than Lynn has been doing his business earlier tonight he misses for the first time thats one of those uh there might be a reason why youre open Isaiah long in front of the rim theres rice with another rebound the team has really shot it well from behind the yard I cant wait to see what Rodney rice can do here in the next couple of weeks as he gets you know up to speed with the game I mean hes already a tremendous athlete but playing at game speeds a little different Couture following his own and then found kid for the flush thats already eight points for Lynn Kidd off to Virginia Tech bench he only averages Five Points a game youre working on kid got him in the air and nicely done using his body to shield and he and he now has eight points I mean nor Chad omir is big hes strong hes very athletic quick off his feet another excellent pass for months kid cant finish his time but Jamie Luckys got a foul in there and kids will go to the freethrow line win kids weve got to follow your own Couture didnt initially but he took the deflection and its good come on I dont think you are and I wouldnt if I I did I do I do listen so why is the if its the hurricane mascot because its the last to leave when the hurricane comes there you go see race thats right you give me history you give me knowledge I mean I I am listening maybe well have opportunity later and we can talk about the origins of the Hokey hokey High chance I dont know that twin kid this is the first free throw you see what hes been able to do tonight with four or five from the floor with eight points Miami hasnt shot any free throws in the first half she did one of two Virginia Tech up by two Bentley Joseph Harvey Bensley Joseph has returned for Miami he has the ball now those are one of the stronger players in the hurricane team but we are certainly strong look at him use that big rear end creative little space and score again hes into double figures for 10 well its the quality of the catch right there and it Linton kids stayed a little too long on the switch before he could recover back to Omer Music Music mud has it now spins pass Miller he just has excellent Vision thats just a great find for much and Couture with the Finish hes got two three balls and six points on the night once you get that ball in the Baseline behind the defense it collapses them a little bit on the top of the floor it leaves some room for Hunter to get into his threepoint rhythm Applause headed toward the two and a half minute Mark to play here in the first half Miami on a sixgame winning streak long draws contact from Couture outside and gets the call from Terry Ogle we watched months get behind the D Couture with a long triple and then on this end good pump fake gets Couture up in the air you know I I dont know is that offense initiated contact I I I didnt think it was a fact he didnt and Im one Im a firm believer in protection me too I know you are as well and I and I dont think they do it as well as they should that particular that particular play I think Isaiah got away with the Savvy veterans I agree theyre going to check too to see if it should be two or three free throws lets have this is I dont think theres any question about that hes well behind the line now you know as I look at that from that angle though it could stand corrected its not really an important enough foul with this juncture I dont think to say lets get the boys in the tape room to dig it out and show it again but you saw Couture reaching a little forward in that in that overhead angle either way they call it thats the way its going to be Im not changing my mind he didnt affect his Landing space I thought he I thought he initiated that contact he certainly leaned in when he left question about that but we get to watch it three times so we can go back and forth lets not give him any slack long knocks down all three free throws to ties up at 31 mutts another fine very good patience a shot fake and Padua cant pay it off kid gives him another chance heres Couture running down the lane omir with it Miami wants to run Applause is going to get another chance he cant make it and here come the Hokey through the rebound under two minutes to go here in the first half kids sort of an awkward move inside and so awkward that he is called for the travel sixth turnover the first half for Virginia Tech which is going to get facility back in the game the kid has had a terrific first half basily gives him a little bit more calmness a little bit more of a pick and pop guy kid is a hard roller to the rim which takes up some space inside you mentioned off the top hes been Sensational how about showing the ball and getting loose Nigel pack what a terrific move I mean its a very good offensive game plan by Jim larranega they are attacking the paint theyre getting pretty much whatever they want inside thank you zilly pops off that ball screen for Padula and foul will be called I mean what a fake nice play but its the action turning the corner with the quickness First Team all Big 12 last year Kansas State before opting he got a switch much value transfer to Miami in the corner Collins no good Poplar which is not I think Justin mutz has got to shoot that hes got Isaiah Wong on him and hes got his back to the basket hes capable of making that play Applause long step back buckets see to me that was more of a foul because he did hit him on the the other other arm how about that jab step pull back he created some space Applause that time much did try to put it in and he draws the foul and hell go to the line and shoot his pair and watch this right here that is what you call pull it back and stick it toward his body not only going to the baskets of creating shots creating passes hes as good a backcourt guys there is in the ACC and one of the best in the country Isaiah needed seven points coming into the ninth to move into the top five on the alltime scoring list and there he is with 1718 points of course theres the great Rick Ferry on the top of that with almost 2 300 points fourpoint lead Applause I think you take this all the way down last possession if you can theres about two second differential Music Applause streak set the Hokies have stopped inside this building and the start that Miami got off to trailing by nine early two possession lead at the half at least and feel pretty good Wong gonna pull up again Couture right in his face and didnt get Rim so there will be a little bit of time for the Hokies to get the last shot in the first half though not much eight tenths of a second on the clock at the moment and for a catch and suit here if you throw it all the way to the other end theres the catch and Collins didnt get it off see the record that Jim larenegas put together with leading at the half theyre 14 and one this season but leading at the half in Virginia Tech oh and seven one behind after the first 20 minutes 3632 Miami with the lead well see him in Blacksburg Virginia Tech against Miami the hurricanes have won their last six theyre a half game out of first place in the ACC kept Mike Youngs Team without a field goal for almost the final three minutes 71 run to end the first half Reese Davis Debbie Antonelli with you Miami did a lot of damage in the paint driving the ball in the first half well see if the Hokies can slow them down not off the initial Drive Norterra Mir got inside and Jordan Miller finished it in the lead is up to six by Design Jordan Miller and North Chad OMeara on a two side taking it to the bigs of Virginia Tech Applause Grant bazilly had a tough first half turns it over omir big fella driving himself and now Amir follows once follows twice cant get it to go either time now Amir hustling for the ball but itll be Virginia Tech basketball Grand Priscilla is going to have to get a little tougher here in the second half he played 12 minutes in the first half he was one for three and hes got a tough assignment defensively having to deal with the size and the girth of omir Debbie first half can be a little misleading and plus minus sometimes but bazilly was 12 in the first half in the 12 minutes he was on the floor in Rodney rice and Malaysia Poteet all minus 12 and all play between five and 12 minutes in the first half so the hurricanes have it with a six point lead can you turn it over in a live ball it is tough to get back Miamis conversion speed from defense to offenses very quick Asia Wong cant get it to go and omir the last to touch it and the Hokies will have it when you look at the way that Grant basili has been playing hes third in the league in scoring right hes averaged 20 almost 24 points in the last eight to do turning the corner gets it knocked Away by willga Poplar Virginia techs come up empty on their last five field goal attempts Hopper rattles in a three and the canes have their largest lead at nine when you have your offense in front of you you do not want to call an early timeout in the second half you got to believe that your veteran players will make a play like this right here Couture cant get it to go much has a good tip it wouldnt fall either Poplar hit that last three Debbie and Jim layernaga was talking to us yesterday he wants him to shoot that the pullup will also take a nice pass to Amir but he says he keeps telling boogers shoot the pullup shoot the pullup you got a great pullup scrapping on the floor and Couture was in there to get it nomir couldnt pull it free how about that last blocked by Poplar you see how Padula turns his shoulders and opens up his frame that gives the shot blocker room to get there you got to go Rim body ball if you do that you can draw a foul instead they go the other way to do it was only six one giving up a lot of sides just about any time he goes in there its a 65 Poplar got a hand on it do it this is what he does well and that throwback stuff will you get misdirection going strong one way and then you throw it back to the other side thats how Couture and Padula do a really good job of setting their feet and knocking down shots Applause packs pins away loses the handle but gets it back now Miller on the drive he beats mutts he probably would have been better off just reversing that shot now Jordans going to pull it out of there shot clock still rolling open look on the side and pack will usually make that eight times out of ten and Wong throws it away Collins Against omir who spots it away and Collins is down again now remember Collins is playing with that face mask after the broken nose that he suffered against Virginia I dont know if he took a little swipe I mean watch Superman because thats what omir looks like right here and he flies well there he comes down on the block shot right across the bridge of Colins face right there now they didnt put a whistle on it yeah but you can go over and look at it if you think there was unnecessary and excessive contact Jamie Lucky Now is going to go over to talk with Mike Young and I mean we talked about this a little bit in the first half with Collins as the crowd is letting this officiating crew know that they think they ought to at least go to the monitor because usually when theres contact to the Head Rhys on an Airborne shooter its usually an F1 do you think that should have been called an F1 I think they should have looked at it all right from looking at it Im not sure that I think so um I do think do you think it was a foul Im not sure it raised to the level of an F1 but they never put a whistle on it right right and poor MJ Collins its uh obviously not only the nose we see him wearing the mouthpiece as well against Miami had a dislodged tooth he was wearing braces so that helped them in some degree and they gave him the mouthpiece too and he just his face keeps finding other peoples arms and finally brazili gets a big shot same action Reese its the throwback to the weak side Padula and Vasily both hitting threes a couple of Threes for the Hokies and theyve cut that nine point lead down to three and oh and theyre going to call a foul Im gonna call it on bazilly with the block on Pat this is just a great pass by Hunter Couture he draws two and he whips it back to basily whos ready to catch and shoot this crowd did a bit of a frenzy they dont think theyre getting a friendly home whistle right now heres Isaiah walk and he gets his pocket picked by Purdue who cant control it hell stay on this end with a hurricane this is why Mike young doesnt call timeout when it goes 4132 right because hes got his offense in front of his bench and he is terrific at managing the game youre going to need your timeouts late both these guys isnt that what coach laronega wants you to do right in that ACC area a little shot fake created some space how many times a day does he tell Ruger popular to go to his midrange I think on the season the count was one of the players have told Jim it was like up to 500 or something Applause when boogers hit one behind the arc and one inside theres a good start to the second half to tour the mutts Missouris got to get it away he does and Grant mazzilli a couple of field goals here in the second half he has seven he is such an important part of what they do offensively because of his skill set he can shoot the three with range he can go to the block and throw that half hook Poplar gets it blocked by rice Padua on the drive cant find anybody how much we feed it inside facility back to work now hes fighting for the rebound but Jordan Miller takes it away for the Kane well he doesnt need to counter he can go right back to that half hook long gets it knocked Away by much kanua spins away nicely has facility with him Euro Step vanilla scores beautiful absolutely gorgeous Isaiah long with an answer that is an answer silence is the crowd with his quickness to the rim hes into double figures with ten this place was rocking and they were ready to really lift the roof off of it theyd still be eager to do so akies will give him some reason Padua just might Applause thank you packed with the ball for Miami pack gets by Purdue and just throws it into the air and its a turnover for the Kanes pack tries to get it back its that facility itll be a goal 10 the basket to count how about this move from Padula the spin the Euro boom off the glass pokeys on a run hi Coke no matter home or away so I asked him where the best popcorn was and of course he said here first but he immediately mentioned Boston College too well have a popcorn cam here so you know during the games theyve got Mike looks like his heads coming out of a popcorn box its pretty fun what a great guy what a fun guy to talk to hes entertaining and so is coach laronega both of these guys have incredible play recall I was at practice in October with Mike Youngs team he went over to the video person and said hey can you run that uh show me that set from the Villanova game uh in about the eight minute Mark in the second half and I went over to the video guy said is that from three games ago three years ago he said yeah thats three years ago thats the kind of play called recall he has so does coach laronega they both have that omir follows his own in Brazilian whos playing with a little more energy in the second half pulls that away on the recall front larinega was also reeling off the 1960s St Johns starting lineup today too its featured Kevin Locker is rice misses going to the bucket heres Wong in transition omir kicks it out Bensley Joseph for three Miamis going to pick up some full court here bensleys hit a couple of open threes here in the second half see what a strong frame he is front squats 250 best on the team Applause silly with a new advised pass and omir to snatches Harlan Beverly youre going to go by bazilly nice cutoff on the Baseline Harlan did a world of trouble hes got to get it out of there and he does Applause Arlen Beverly this is omir keeps it alive Isaiah Wong lines up three Isaiah wall never changes his expression he makes so many winning plays for Miami pushes The Edge back out to seven and Jordan Miller is going to get called on the region hes called foul when its all about the use sometimes its all about Isaac you need a bucket or you need to settle your team down you want the ball in his hands hes moved into fifth alltime in program history and scoring he is a dynamic offensive player thats really fun to watch hes on the bench right now to get a breast a break Debbie he had a 27 point game in this building as a freshman so Isaiah finds a shooting backdrop in more city building with a 10foot basket pretty favorable to him but uh he had some success in this building these two teams have played some wild games and sort of shaping up the same way only a seven point lead for Miami right now with 17 lead changes in the earlier meeting three weeks ago in Coral Gables tonight only three has been tied five times Hunter Couture knocks down the three he reached the 1 000 points Mark for his career tonight and he pulls the Hokies within four they pull out the horn set and we know on Mike Youngs play call card hes got 50 to 60 plays there they worked on that particular set today Applause I asked Sean Perdue with what it was like to fouls going to be called on kid has to do it today what he was like to have to digest all of that as you look at the what you were talking about here just a great screen right there maybe a little bit of a moving screen but look how quickly Hunter Couture exit Cuts he takes his Defender to the rim and then he exit Cuts back out to the perimeter hits his feet and his hips around and he has a fantastic threepoint shoot the best percentage in the ACC when that volume of offense at Virginia Tech carries Padula said you know he had storm Murphy in front of him to help last year but even this year coming into this game Mike young calling to play in practice and hes looked at him and said yeah I dont know that one they said theyd run it one time this year and hes broke it back out from Miami so Mike tell him well if you dont know it we cant run it obviously Sean went on to say look if you theres a big volume he does a great job of letting us know whats coming getting the ball in Hunter to do her hands is a good idea but hes a little long on that one and see once Hunter hits one or two then theres a whole combination of plays in the package offensively for Hunter how about Nigel pack just splitting okey Defenders and getting all the way to the rim again Reese down the lane line turning the corner getting points at The Rim yeah 24 theyre 36 in the first half in the paint more of it from the perimeter here in the second half but still doing damage Pat comes out with a loose ball Kanes up by eight the chance to stretch this lead into double figures Harlan Beverly has it roll out Harlan recovering from back surgery that he had just over a year ago and it kept him out from extended period of time hes a round back into form another valuable player off the Miami bench Couture with a good cut but better Hands by Miami running ahead is omir and omir is fouled from behind by Kid Applause thats a perfect example of what Lara Naga was talking about even as good as old years been all year and as good as he was in Arkansas State Jim said today hes running now and hes getting run outs hes getting put backs and there he draws the foul and hell go to the freethrow line anytime you run ahead of the basketball and transition and you can advance pass up the floor that quickly we should be getting points out of it omearas gun a dozen double doubles this season 47 for his career womens ACC basketball on the ACC Network Virginia and Miami at noon itll be followed by the ninth ranked Hokies at Georgia Tech at four there is a big Thursday on slate for the ACC and the Virginia Tech Hokies right now sitting in third place Elizabeth kitley their ACC Player of the Year and Georgia Amar best combination in a twoman game right now in the league Kings holding their largest lead of the night at 10 hokeys trying to cut into it and back into the gift shot in the face Kim Jake out of his own trying to urge on this Virginia Tech defense omir cutting lost in hell be called for the offensive foul Collins again stepping in hes made a bunch of hustle plays for Virginia Tech tonight its a great read he sees omir roll off that ball screen and Collins steps outside the restricted area and draws that charge Music himself a couple of times over the last few games coming back and sticking his face right in the fan mutts climbs one up this is badly here comes Knight drops it for long Applause a mere thought about it now shot clock at 15 throwback to pack but a good job by Couture to keep packing getting that shot up it doesnt matter to Nigel he just steps back and fires offensive rebound Joseph Miller for three it wont go either a couple of really good looks for the Hurricanes here that didnt go down Padua again and itll go a chance for a threepoint play one of the things Sean Padula told us today when we were talking to him is how coming out of high school he did everything at one speed that was fast up and down in the end and hes learned how to change speeds hes added 15 pounds of muscle to his frame he said he can definitely feel the difference I mean he might have lost a little bit because theyre running so much right now but look at the improvement from last year to this year for Sean Padula Applause finishes the threepoint play and the Hokies have now scored the last six after facing their largest deficit of the game theyve climbed back in within four as we head toward the eight minute Mark to play here in Castle Coliseum Applause for some pack way out on the floor for Nigel just working his way back and gets in the paint to score again and Nigels limping a little bit hes got 11 now downhill guards thats what Miami has then they can turn the corner and get in the paint mutz has got a mismatch zilly may be settled for that one itll be Miami basketball up six at the under eight Texas was a physical team last year they are again this year but uh it was a tough go for storm Murphy and the guys for Mike Young Hunter Couture was the MVP of the ACC tournament last year 31 points in that game against Duke Unstoppable theres a popper on the Baseline thats how you build confidence you keep telling Ruger that you wanted to shoot the midrange and then you run a play for him coming out of a timeout lets get back to eight custom mutts working on omir he gets by him and uses the rim beautifully to protect it I didnt think Virginia Tech was doing such a good job of recognizing mismatches when they went to break lets see if they can fix that and find the right match up on the floor thats a big part of Mike Youngs offense Applause so I clock in tight 10 as we go inside seven minutes to play here in Blacksburg switch Isaiah long shot out of desperation Padua somehow maintains control long gets a hand in there and hes going to be called for the foul and might have saved the basket in process thats going to be Isaiahs third inside 10 seconds on the shot clock defensively Virginia Tech switched so remember we were talking about ball screen defense to start to half much kicks it out Padua for three wont go and omir wins the fight for the rebound Sean Padulas threes are online long or short but theyre not left or right youve only miss it four ways hes got to make the adjustment or Miller working inside cut off nicely by mutts resorts to the fade away and well go pop were back on the offensive boards in Miami has done a really good job getting hustle offensive rebounds Miami averages six and a half offensive rebounds theyve doubled that here tonight womens college basketball number one team in the country South Carolina on Thursday night on the road taking on Tennessee live on ESPN app a Miami sort of middle of the road and rebound margin in the ACC same nationally as well theyve done a nice job here tonight despite being undersized Collins with a good shot fake Couture drains to three and a better decision to kick it to the best threepoint shooter by percentage in the lead smart the tours hit 43 balls Virginia Tech is scrapped back within three and theres time out on the floor Couture and the Hokies trying to protect home court and in the Kanes winning streak Music its Miami took a 10point lead a little over three minutes ago the Hokies have outscored the Hurricanes 114 to call back within three yeah watch this play right here mutts behind the defense good ball fake by Collins kick it to the wide open threepoint shooter and Hunter Couture you go ahead and shoot until your arm falls off you got four triples in the game as much fight as the Hokies have shown the hurricanes have been steadfast and fighting off virtually every challenge so far five on the shot clock Applause Nigel pack has to force a tough one and Nigel Cactus was about the time that he heated up in the meeting three games ago you mean when he scored 17 points and hit five five York in the last five minutes and change Music thank you Collins again with his shot faking to pull up long able to stop the penetration Music Poplar staying close to Couture and thats a very good idea now the shot clock at five on this end facility the zilli driving gets it blocked by Wong how about Isaiah Wong coming up with a defensive play on the big man or Chad omeere pack turn down the screen Nigel pack almost hit it again Miller got the offensive rebound another one of those for the canes and he gets fouled by Couture I mean packed rejects that screen and gets separation late shot clock he drives Couture back their best on ball Defender and sticks a triple man oh man they have some guys can make some tough shots gonna make them dangerous in the NCAA tournament for sure now they have some vulnerabilities now we got to get this here after Jordan Miller missed that free throw the crowds going nuts heres why if he misses the second one everybody in this house gets free bacon bacon for everybody sizzled up in the frying pan The Hokey 61 all time when the fans win bacon Applause now lets see who can bring home the bacon as it were mutts on omear oh great looking bazilly for the dunk its a fourpoint game with four to go what a read by mutts he saw the help coming Baseline to double the left facility wide open at The Rim so excited about the bacon I dont know we were having a conversation before that Bacons a big deal here but then again bacon makes everything better look at Poplar now Walker got up in the air and had nothing to do with it and trying to get bailed out and he did from the 337 to go will go to break the silly inside with the flush and the Hokies keep hanging around and hanging around can they take the final bite of bacon when you come back home and car insurance at progressivecom bundling scoring opportunities is what Nigel pack is good at hes only hit two of eight from behind the arc tonight but he had a tough one in a big one just a moment ago Debbie this tops hes a great counter to Isaiah Wong he can really move the meter here for Miami late in the game because hes a good free throw shooter he takes care of the ball and he can make plays much a little too hot if you tour underneath its a 10th turnover of the 9th floor Virginia Tech so now the Hurricanes that they have all night have a chance to answer one more time theyve got three guys in double figures laronega talks about trying to get Five Guys to 15 this has been played a little more at the Hokies Pace tonight and Pat cant finish it because its tough to outscore this talented explosive Miami team and Pat comes back and makes turnover Miller on the run brazilians with him he cuts him off Jordan didnt want to draw that offensive foul and maybe he should have gone ahead and gone after the bucket Waits on help and now Juan to turn the corner again and therell be a block on Padula see heres the thing about the Miami Gardens race in a late game situation theyre closers they can close out a game they can make free throws they take care of it they got the ball in their hands coach laronega trust them they have been turned in the corner all night on Virginia Techs defense okay they tell me the 32nd time out here with the k13 prank team in the country theyve won their last six they have the possession arrow have a couple of timeouts left each team with a foul to give and then relatively few whistles tonight Applause Jordan Miller on the drive Miller Miller got fouled on the way to the basket and fought through the contact and scoring anyway hes in double figures fourth hurricane with at least 10 its a sixpoint lead medulla for three it wont go in omir high to snatch away that rebound when North is hes had some bits and starts in terms of finishing around the rim but he has been solving on the rebound all night hes got 13 boards another DoubleDouble for him the tour and Poplar got tangled up on that last series and a few words up the floor I dont think it was negative they just I think they were laughing about the contact Applause muds showed to stop long from penetrating and turning that corner as he has several times tonight omir patient created space and patiently finishes at the bucket an eightpoint lead he has 16 to go with those 13 points well its a welldesigned clear out everybody lifts it above the freethrow line so he could go oneonone brazily trying to answer its been a tough night for Grant hes been red hot in recent games doesnt quite had that shooting touch and hes just played over the last eight games or so Applause about six points below his season scoring average brazili with eight but with 11 I should say average of 17 heres wrong this time he does turn the corner theres a lot of contact in there and theyll call him for the offensive foul one more popular players playing the fan base in the team looks like he got a little elbow to the chin also Music fourth foul on Isaiah Wong now so youll have to proceed with caution Miami is the lead but they need and Veteran guard to close this thing out if they can here in Blacksburg and its exceedingly looking more and more as if theyll be able to Brazilian on the drive and Grant gets the bucket and its a quick timeout after the bucket call by Virginia Tech 104 to go hurricanes trying to hold up impressive I mean hes been around the rim hes active hes quick off his feet plays bigger than a six seven frame they dont have necessarily a shot blocking presence I think for foul trouble coach laronega would prefer rotation versus gambling honest blocking the shot unless you certainly have it but uh I think hes done a good job staying out of foul trouble tonight as well hes also played well in both games against the Hokies he had 218 in the first meeting turning in the double double tonight and theyll quickly foul with the hurricanes on the freethrow line now I know that Jordan Miller Missed a couple and gave bacon to the entire crowd but oh thats a 16 foul still got another one to give but theyre going to put the Keynes on the line shortly when they do this is a really good freethrow shooting team tent Fest in the country 78 second best in the ACC seventeen thousand dollars can you look at this as a two possession game Virginia Techs got to get it out quickly should he miss moving up the floor I dont think you necessarily knew threes yet you still can attack the rim so keep putting pressure on Miamis defense at The Rim the couple earlier you get double bacon here no Im not sure the answer to that Debbie but I know its its off the table or out of the skillet as it were now after Jordan makes the first one a three possession game so you got to score quickly here I like that pitch back action theyve been running has an open path to the basket and he couldnt finish it and itll go out of bounds itll be Miami basketball hard trap steal quick foul Music number one of four of the freethrow line tonight dont get beat over the top almost a turnover and it may indeed be a turnover if mutts got a timeout call you think he might have been out of bounds Driscoll and Gary ogles be talking it over there and call it jump off on the hill ball on The Possession arrows in favor of the hurricanes okay so right here same thing cant get feet long make him come back to the ball try to make them catch it in the corner so you can get a trap youre definitely going for a steal here you got to go steel score steel score last Scramble for the basketball theres much see I thought much was out of bounds but they called jump ball as it turns out the right team winds up with the ball Miami does Wont Give Up The Possession unless theyve discussed it and changed nobodys come over and told us anything yet and the arrow hasnt changed crossed away from us now Drisco and ogles being lucky Ill have a conference okay they were just they were discussing how much time remained to get it into the front Court after that long to Bensley Josephson and now claranega will call the timeout and they get plenty of time now that Court good Hustle by Virginia Tech defensively but the next foul will put Miami on the free throw line for 11 so three possession game one that was moving along expeditiously till the end I dont know if you saw a college game day on Saturday we were in Kansas where the rules of basketball the original rules of basketball are housed and several people suggested rules change one thing that former Virginia Tech coach Seth Greenberg said what about the ilam ending where you get to a certain point in the game you set a Target score and everybody plays until you reach that score you like the element you know I I didnt like it when I first thought of it but the more Seth talked about it rares this may be he convinced me that I think its a pretty good idea how about the fourpoint shot you like that do without that I think I could do without that but he keeps the the point with the elim that Seth was making it keeps everybody playing instead of the foul because in the Elam ending for those who might not be familiar you set a Target score you play to that if you commit a foul on the floor you get one free throw and you get the ball back so your fouls are not incentivized Ensley Joseph fouled as he gets into the front Court third Brazilian will be called for what its his third Music Joseph has hit 70 percent this year but he hasnt shot a lot of free throws only 27 coming into this game calmly Strokes that one through thats what Im talking about the package of guards from Miamis and their Miami and their ability to finish off games at the line thank you good teams have come in here riding High and gotten sent home with a loss not calling this game yeah theres a great dip in from mutts but this will be a toughminded strong win if Miami can close it out in the last 322 and it would give them seven in a row and if we were doing an ACC power index Id put him at number one right now I think theyre playing the best basketball of anybody in the league would you favor them to win the ACC tournament as well as you have a look at what they have coming up Florida state only they blew out the Seminoles in the first meeting earlier I think they certainly have a chance because theyve got great guards because they have speed versus size and in most matchups that will win now Pittsburgh is going to present a different matchup but I think at 37 Footers okay thats something that Miami does not so our statistician gets its images flashing you a Virginia card so why do you favor Miami over Virginia at the moment I think theyre guards the ability to make plays make shots I like Virginia I just think Miamis backcourt is a little bit stronger and Im a big Kihei Clark fan but I think Miami has a few more guards and I think you need guards in the postseason you need a lot of regards in the postseason they played way back in December Miami won the game by a bucket at home I think Miami can play at any case obviously its just a lower possession game against Virginia I dont think Miami turns the ball over I think they use their quickness and their ball screen action and uh North Chad OMeara plays as Ive said many times tonight longer and taller and bigger than that six seven frame omir has been outstanding tonight for Jim larranega we were talking to him today about the gift he has sort of understanding the psychology of his team baseball pass run out to Joseph whos going to make him catch him and foul him to drain some more off the clock unless of course he loses the ball out of bounds which he very nearly did Applause talked about it before not getting beat over the top and allowed him to run some clock off and Virginia back excuse me the Virginia Tech bench is asking for a review on the out of bounds Applause Applause heres Joseph who lost the handle but I I think thats off Couture dont you I do its hard to tell from that angle but Pat driscos on it right there they are going to look at it Im not sure what the protocol is for video reviews on the Elam endings but if you limit eliminate some of those Im even further all in on it Music Gary Oglesby coming over telling us that theyre looking at the out of bounds here at the end theyre also going to fix the clock so he said it might take a little bit longer lets have a look there Music it looks like Hunter Couture is swiping down and Music Joseph is swiping across yeah I I really thats going to be as it was called on the floor in Miami ball and my judgment and well see what they do with the clock Music immediately following us is 30 for 30 Requiem for the Big East so the people in master control were going to be grateful that they dont really have any worry about any field programming we were on course to play this thing in about an hour and 45 get a couple of reviews a few trips to the free throw line its been a fun night here in the castle probably a little bit of a frustrating one for the home crowd bacon aside theyve been closed but Im really impressed with the toughness that Miami has shown to turn back every Surge and there were plenty of them from the Hokies tonight Music Miami came into this game a half game back standings in the ACC race Virginia and then Virginia Tech knocked Pittsburgh off of its perch over the weekend it has a lot of work to do in the closing 27 seconds if theyre going to do the same to Miami tonight foreign split with NC State this will be seven in a row for the Hurricanes I think they are playing some of the best basketball in the league I put NC State up there as well I think Duke is playing much better understand that everyone gets a fresh start and an opportunity once Conference tournament play starts but this is at the very good least a missed opportunity for Virginia Tech who according to Joe Bernardi was sort of in the under consideration group and needed some wins needed a win of this magnitude tonight it doesnt appear that theyre going to get it heres Couture from the corner so just when you think it is just a two possession game 207 to go this is a great push up the floor deep Corner three long late on a closeout so one thing Miami didnt want to give up is wait possession three or late game threes final timeout for the Hokies here on the aforementioned ACC standings if the Hurricanes can hang on here they will move to 144 in conference play Tech will split through six and eleven and tie with four to stay to the trip to Duke looming this weekend who by the way theyre playing really well right now and getting better I think theyre going to be dangerous in the NCAA tournament as well Duke is a a six or a seven seed maybe depending on how they finish I know some recent lines had them on the eight line thats not an appetizing matchup for you the round of 32 Derek Whitehead back in the lineup gives him another level of depth and another emerging level of play that I think that John Shire is getting his quote too I Im impressed with how hard they play how much better their personnel is getting individually and how they play collectively moving the ball and I think the roles inside the Duke system are starting to get to find a little bit better here at the end of February and I know youre really high on NC State and played really well against North Carolina over the weekend well get a chance to see North Carolina State and Duke next week but then youve got plenty back Clemson youve got Virginia youve got those teams right now off the tournament and started today theyd all have a chance as well with their death ly Pitt I think theyre a real physical tough team we had a tough shooting night in here they sort of did them in they only made three threes and you know what Miamis had trouble in the back court against this pressure from Virginia Tech I hope hes thinking they forced a turnover well the one pressure reliever throwing over the top worked because it ran some time off the clock theyre going to review this one you said it Reese fight in the Hokies a lot of fight here late back to the monitor we go TV sports getting a workout lets have a look and see the ball didnt bounce out of bounds and to deal with laying his body out to get it maybe from this angle we can see if Pat touched it after the Dua deflected it did not appear so from that angle its tough to see lets have a look here Music I think I think I think thats last Touch by Padula I think so one thing about it Miamis turning getting the Ballgame in the backcourt to an Adventure down the stretch Music this is where their speed should definitely be a factor right they need to show a little bit better spacing here and I try to catch it on the Baseline thats not where you want to catch it because youre going to get trapped and uh in defense of the hurricanes too honesty compels me to say there was a pretty sizable amount of contact in that effort and that effort for the ball too Music eight different looks it appeared there on the last and theyll go back to the big picture and see if they can see whose cuticle was the last to graze across the pebbled weather of the basketball and knock it out of bounds this might be the best look well get here Music I dont think Pat touched it again Im not so sure if Padova didnt foul him anyway okay running clock on the reviews and if you dont see enough in the allotted amount of time if you want to add centralized replay someday in the ACC go ahead yes but if you dont get it in the allotted amount of time and theres not enough there to overturn it these guys are trained professionals theyre the officials on the court let them make the call and lets play ball I want him to get it right dont get me wrong but if you have to spend that much time on that series fingernail Grayson Ill Trust your eyes on the floor yeah I hear you but its still been tough Its a Long passive Wong with some accuracy that on the long pass that would make Mario Cristobal proud making a downfield explosive play its been a great pressure reliever against the herkies thrown over the top thats twice that theyve been able to connect thats where the speed comes into player I was just talking about Miami speed and being a factor of relieving pressure thats one way that their speed can be used no mirrors had a big DoubleDouble tonight this is the first and he needs to get this one to make it a three possession game hides his hands on the floor and then on the back of the sneakers I think you can get a quick three here you got to get a quick three a three possession game Purdue was going to milk every millisecond he can now picks it up as he crosses the half court line Rises up and fires its short Joseph pulls it away and theyll foul him Couture fouls him in the backboard and Joseph will go to the freethrow line 79 to go I think it was ultimately the backcourt play in Miami that finishes the game off Reese you know Isaiah Wong had a stretch Nigel pack had a stretch and Jordan Miller just quietly goes about doing his job Applause you really got to be the unsung hero of this whole group because everyone else gets the billing and Jordan Miller just comes to work every day very solid game great enthusiastic crowd here in Castle tonight many of whom fought hard and are now headed for the exits with final five seconds coming up Miami is going to get a really impressive Road win Padua puts a little icing on the stat line in Miami coming in here on a sixgame winning streak but a two and a half Point Underdog gets a sixpoint Road Victory make it seven in a row and the longest active winning streak among power Conference teams in America by one at the moment over UCLA foreign by the Hurricanes value and effort
