my mind that he K is going to be an outstanding coach at coach at Stanford now we are underway as the Cardinal takes the opening tip in front of a packed house here at Cameron indor heres Blakes with a touch right around midcourt gets it off for sers who comes out averaging about 14 theyve got three guys averaging in double figures Reno just had it go off his fingertips he pleads his case he didnt think that was true but its a turnover the only chance they have to win here today I believe two things have to happen I really believe that R know is going to have to have a fantastic game and theyre going to have to do a great job taking away the three ball from dke well hes absolutely capable dicki of having a fantastic game but you see the Blue Devils going inside early OB weve seen that a lot with malawat with a jam to start it off a look at the Stanford starting lineup we mentioned Blakes whos coming and averaging 15 points a game the Duke transfer as you guys said as improved as anybody in the country he was like a two or threo a game guy for Duke he was on some great teams here his Runner will be offt Target hes already come back east in shock North Carolina in an ACC game as we check out the Duke starting lineup we just saw malat go Skyhigh hes 72 to begin with on the first basket today tell you one thing once you penetrate and get any kind of help its Lob City and thats where he scores on the lob had a good game the last game goes double double at 10 12 rebounds and hes got great potential when he took malat and last time Dicky B actually knocked down a three ball so I was waiting for you to get here and talk about him I know he too does a she but he hit that one you had against Carolina wow Carolina had to say it himself man what else is going on against me whats happened down here in Chapel Hill sellers with the foul to put canip at the line where he makes eight 88 hes the best fou shooter for the Duke Blue Devils the one thing that really stands out about Stanford is they make their foul shots theyre up around 86 in conference play OB there has to be some type of engineering behind that I mean you would only expect for the Cardinal to be able to figure out a way to make free throws even easier Reno with a big dribble lofs it up there short rebound kicked out of play and itll be Duke ball one of the ways Duke makes life for you on offense so difficult is their ability to switch everyone on the roster outside of my God Spencer Hubbert 65 and up so Dicky V when theyre switching theyre still putting size on a post player yeah really big team no question about it flag banging bodies there lofs it up there and takes the foul and hell be off to the line where he makes 81 you got a little isolation one one big story publicized yesterday Cooper says I think I may be coming back to Duke I love it so much man I got better chance Obie of growing here than coming back to Du there a no way that going to happen no way so you dont you dont buy it for a minute neither one of you guys buy it for a minute the Cooper flag who just might this is the innocence in me Im like maybe he just loves the student body loves being on campus so much loves wearing that uniform yeah theres no question hes making good money obviously with the nil but Ill tell you what that hes going to see at the next level is a whole different world cant take a chance of an injury cant take a chance cant take that chance and this is one of the reasons why Cooper flag reclassed up he was actually in the 2025 High School class and so he would be a senior right now he reclassed up to be able to get to the draft earlier with a December 21st birthday that allows him to be draft eligible this year and he will be the number one pick in the 2025 NBA draft Duke making a trap there and making life very tough for Blake as its knocked out of play a 6 nothing start for Duke and a shot clock of factor here down to seven Ill tell you one thing Obi when you have a formula your top five in a country offensive and defensively efficiency you got a formula for success and thats what Duke has and going to turn that over as the shot clock was winding down there we see that defense from the Blue Devils early and it starts with the length of the everyone 65 and up the tall team in America but being able to switch doesnt allow you to run your offense Dicky V when you were coaching and you come into a building and you dont they wont let you run your office then what do you do after that Flag straight on and off Target on a triple you get out the pray C you get out to sa June the miracle working sellers wanted to run the 65 junr he comes in at 14 points a game and the first one Switched in by the big the sevenfooter Reno on the money they needed that big time flag trying to return the favor but cant do Applause it AER wall up top to Blakes theyll swing it for young and young cant cash in with a long one Proctor to push the tempo hes really been a hot hand these days for Duke James tiptoe on that line canle open got it he can flat out shoot the ball what a year he has had that diaper Dandy think of the publicity notoriety he would yeah if he didnt have a team like Cooper flag even though Cooper helps him have a great year now one of the things that Kyle Smith was talking about was hanging in early against Duke thats going to Rattle home good tucks there by sers who by the way makes 41 from threepoint l a transfer hes a guy that Stanford finally l in transfer first time since like 2000 I believe it was eight proor averaging over 16 points a game each of the last four games rebound torn away agal good strength there the sophomores had some really nice games during the stretch recently had 14 points against wake he had 10 against NC State and a whistle inside no basket a foul before that the Cardinal coming into Cameron indor knocking down the three maxen Rau who was over in his Wednesday effort from Beyond The Arc against Georgia Tech but anything you can do I can do better K nipple returning the favor for the Blue Devils on the other end tell you one thing right now his stock is going up in the NBA people hes going to get a little bit more physical hes got to get stronger physically and I think thatll help him tremendous hes got a great attitude he was a walk you he was a waron at one time 71 senior from Paris Dicky V Im walking around the building pregame and there a bunch of NBA Scouts in the building of course the opportunity to see Maxim rno as well as you know I mean I think they know enough about Cooper flag but guess what all theyre asking me about not r no not Cooper flag wheres Dicky V thats all they want to know OB well those guys do a heck of a oh what a nice club without the board and pro will lay it in great great play m without the basketball a lost art you move without the ball you get people involved you got yourself a chance for a good shot Duke number one in the conference in assist its a terrific passing team backing into the lane agell gets it outside for Reno and hell that one down but how about the help from Malik Brown really and when he turns his head Reno relocates to the corner you cant leave a big man that shoots as well as M Reno and give up an easy three in comparison to a tough two hes got really a nice stroke the leader in the nation with double doubles thats 20 this year James on the drive takes the I got my guy Ryan lacrosse of mced names sister graduated was a tennis player lot of talent lot of talent I can see you on the courts in the backyard you know schooling them all great here watch watch Dicky Vs backand watch this this a thing of beauty I got no backand Im trying to hide it theres the ball theres my soninlaw my daughter my wife smiled R youre on TV SM shes so serious and my daughter in the middle she went to nor a her husband play quarterback back upd to Rob po going is now a judge really a Im so blessed with a beautiful family James knocking him down at the line to put Duke in front 13 10 and Duke off to a 6 for six start at the line now the Cardinal has not gone to an NCAA tournament in over a decade it has been a long drought for them yeah it really has been but had some great teams you talking about with Mike Montgomery sellers right on target from threepoint distance he can shoot the three as you talked about earlier Obie youre so well prepared you Cory hope dont score your party well hes number two in ACC games at 464 and returning to favor quickly is tyres Proctor man is even locked in hes been the hot hand for the Blue Devils had a big performance for them on the road at Clemson he was the guy that got them going knocked down four threes in that game and is really continuing to play more and more confidence John sh loves the way hes grown up as of late yeah he really has played well Cory getting good shots making now tough shot by Reno knocked out by Stanford so itll be Duke ball Obie you mentioned it earlier though the Blue Devils lead the ACC at about 17 assists per game they share the basketball extremely well already four assists in this game so they continue about what is what theyre about sharing the basketball giving up a good shot for a great shot Ill tell you one thing when you share them allall like that there goes Mr but can he use that left hand he is so efficient with the left hand he uses it quite often as well Cooper flag I dont want to make excuses for him I thought he was under the weather especially in the first half he looked a big timee against Clemson yeah John sh said you were right he was under the weather he started to cramp up late in that game the turnover James Picks It Off flag on the run and a blocking foul against the Cardinal you know people love playing with Kim like a guy like Kim Cory is super always thinking pass right there was another example he was thinking pass pass pass and I know you were locked in on Wednesday watching Cooper flag when he continued to go to the basket time and time again and use that left hand as he does on the last play but he gets to the rim and does a great job of using that wingspan in his big hands to avoid shot blockers going to that left hand and finishing off the glass coming up 27 against Cal and hes on his way to another big one maybe today as he absolutely drains the long one he has s points in a Time Kyle Smith the Stanford head coach was fearful of when we met with him before the game well they got what why Kell always talks about spurt ability and Ill tell you one thing theyre going to spurt you they put you away you got to hang you cant let them get that big spurt I really like this guy I think hes going to be a special coach he learned a great deal from Randy Bennett we worked under down at St Marys and Ill tell you this he did a tremendous job at Colombia he then did a great job when he went to San Francisco and he did a super job with the kgas up at Washington State 25 wins last year won a game in the Nate tournament and Stanford Came Calling baby well Dicky V we talked to him about the travel and he said well to be completely honest the travel even though theyre coming across country is a step up for him they struggle with their travel at times in Washington state a year ago so its been an upgrade for him even at least they got Great Planes to make that trip across country and try the plays now so we had all commercial buses things a little different Pro there with the Airborne pass to James decides not to take a long one Proctor great head fake for a three and it wont drop for him tell you want to mention something James what a job hes in the last seven games hes averaged five assists per turnover its unbelievable the way hes distributed a ball Blakes trying to take the Baseline the pass didnt get there tried to get it off in the corner there for okara but it never made it youre talking about the Stanford travel those 3000 mile trips and look at the record by Coast when theyre played on the west coast theyve been Dynamite one and four on the East Coast that win in the final seconds against North Carolina but that top note is the important one youre missing four weeks of a 10we quarter were not talking about the average University were talking about Stanford missing class at Stanford is a big deal Flakes with a scoop shot no on the reverse and knocked out of play by the Duke Blue Devils you know and another thing with that OB Dicky V when you go to Stanford and Kyle Smith made this clear to us you have to want to be there there is an accademic requirement for you that you may not find in all universities so youre talking about guys that want to be there and want to get that Stanford degree I would never ever had that problem because I have no gra zero I would have no shot its great that my grandkids are at schools like Duke no today cuz I couldnt spell Duke if they gave me the Dig itll be stand for a ball from the Baseline Blakes to put it in we had 1235 to go here in the first half they got to get Blakes going hes not been a a going right now I think hes a little bit you know hes hor back here hes got a degree from duke now hes going to have a graduate degree from Stanford what a combination thats going to be couldnt get it in and had to call a timeout 25 Duke just the one loss in conference play to the Clemson Tigers on the road Duke Remains the only team in the country to average 80 points or more while holding opponents to 60 points or less the last winning record they had was 2020 2021 they were 14 and 13 thats not going to last long with Kyle Smith hes going to turn this to a winning program oara lost the dribble great hust by kiple hitting the deck and a tie up on the play that was with six on the shot clock and Duke will take over the basketball but we see how quickly kiple was to the floor giler was a little indecisive as to whether or not he was going to dive after the basketball there was no indecision by Khan kiple he was immediately on the floor going after the basketball and because of his effort the Blue Devils get possession well you know when you watch him play you get that with his personality hes a fierce competitor Applause Gillis will turn and fire got a nice look but it glances off the iron and thats his expertise he did a great job at Purdue they went to the final game with Mr Ed in company but Ill tell you one thing he helped big time with that threepoint shot and he helps Duke with their defense they missed him severely in that Clemson loss hes the guy that normally comes in and plays those minutes at the four behind Cooper flag Cooper had to play 38 minutes in that game with no Gillis Oar with the hook did a great job keeping that foot down tell you one thing he did a nice job hes very physical he came by the way Oak power he came from Harvard by the way congratulations Tommy am he got 300 wins last night only four coaches in the ivy league ever had 300 wins congratulations and Tommy was always one of my favorite players here and two had a lot of good years too at Harvard proor on the drive off the window Banks it in he just kept on churning hes stuck Im with you he going up and up abolutely does but Im with you I I actually and Im going to say this on national TV I actually liked Duke in the 80s with the famous back court of Tommy Amer and Johnny Dawkins together the class that saved Coach K of course ta was an 87 not 86 but I have to admit I was a Duke fan at the time well heres Gillis again to knock back at three hes a big fan right now hes got a big fan John shy baby yes he absolutely Johnny d hes the last coach at Stanford in 2014 to go to the NCA tournament Johnny then definitely is one of my alltime favorite players hes the one that started his program rolling when Coach K got a yes from him sellers up against malawat thats going to be a tough battle to win heres sers again but no rebound up and off the window and multiple opportunities here for Stanford its out off them and Duke front 26 17 were talking about the more recent history of Stanford but Arizona was number 12 some great players in that game but what a moment when Rob Robinson hit that shot was just a great great moment for Stanford basketball Im still caught up with Tiger Woods out there storming the court how about did he come over and take a selfie with you back there oh man I wanted to get his picture man that was the bloy kle taking some contact nice job backing it in for two and he has seven I really think the next four minutes guys I really believe this Quarry and Dave it could be danger time for Stanford you got to try somehow to avoid a spurt by Duke here it could be blowout and it happens in every Duke game right theres going to be a point to where they get plays like that going from malawat with the block turning into points on the other end with an advantage serat heres James from the corner uhoh uhoh here come the dookies here come the dookies and the cam crazy are going wild baby oh man what a block shot that was thats why I drafted him so hard Mal watch look at that block shot by malat malat what a great block the rim protector for the Blue Devils and facing a different challenge in having to guard right no out beyond the threepoint Arc but however still able to get back in and control the paint been tough for him to take that Baseline heres young he quiets the crowd for a moment you know young is going to be a very good player especially on a defensive man they like his potential defense dke could not be much hotter they have made eight of their last 10 shots heres kiple over the top from malash intended for him but a whistle a foul on the deck 844 to go in the half our guy guy at ESPN Jonathan Javon does a great job with the NBA evaluations ready for this hes got three players from Duke in the top six players top six are you kidding me they have three in the top six its unbelievable thats how you know how talented you are he has certainly flag one he has canle six and he has right there the D Machine Seven thats three coaches would die to get one thats three on one team so what youre saying is you approve of the job that John shy and Rachel Banker have done assembling this team oh man a phenomenal job what did he get rolling nothing falling for him and look at Flo up with a onehanded rebound watch the pass hes looking to make the pass he will back it out beyond the threepoint line working on Reno Head tohe head and up in there how good how good are you kidding me coming back to college theres no way no CH Alexander no chance there is no hair growing on your head put that one that aint going to happen yeah 15point lead here for Duke R wants a long one malawat high up for the rebound I sense it was going to happen in terms of that little spurt by them they really they are so Applause talented flag looking for some room gets doubled up a fallway that was a tough shot bat went for the save and it will be a foul in the lane with 727 left in the half that quick thats impressive as heck 727 to go first half favorite Cameron indor the inbounds and a slam from alaat how do you let him get free like that what unbelievable execution the execution is incredible think about this they have nine assists with zero turnover and Dicky V I feel as though K malat really grew up as a player when Malik Brown was injured he was forced to have to play more minutes and Obi he built a tremendous amount of confidence during that time tell you one thing hes a ter terrific defensive player you only this really great deflections and they chart deflections and you know when it all started Im going to give you a little tip deflection started Years Ago by a former assisant coach at du how would e the two assist coaches you you w believe this I know you wont believe it Cory two assistants here to a great coach Vic boers in the 60s was a guy who just retired from television the other day yub Brown assistant and guess who else was his part assistant whos that CH I tell you what thats thats a staff right there wow where were you on the staff what was I they they they werent going to give you a job I was coaching little high school yeah I remember you coaching High School I watched the documentary kiple with the pick and it will be D I know it did I told you thats saw the documentary I was no little high school you guys were good good enough to get you a college job well we played the games on the road we didnt have a home court you strut up with the wild cats bright Hall Kim my guy Mr Becca Lesley kasan oh man those are great young guys coer flag in the offensive zone Duke number five in scoring defense exerting their will again defensively holding opponents to about 60 Proctor On Target from threepoint l i mean that passing in the basketball no one with a right guy is getting a ball to the right guy whos hot Proctor thats just beautiful basketball thats a clinic theyre putting on sellers will fall away short yeah Proctor already with 10 back to flag and tapped out of play by sers so Duke will retain Duke continues to share the basketball up to 10 assists but its so many different guys getting involved Cooper flag will get the hockey assist Malik Brown finding Tyrese Proctor in the corner knocking down the three ball Malik Brown reading the defense even before he catches the basketball dick V yeah hes a really solid player they got from Syracuse the tell you about him he did tell me a little bit about him I want you guys having a great time up here Mr door up who I really like Blakes picked off by kipple read that perfectly re ball coming from Slim Right Here you see it Koop already sees him oh he missed that one turn around and that glances away I thought that one was going to show time slim Isaiah Evans in the corner Evans hitting 43 beyond that threepoint line for the year cant get any shots of all by the way right now a tough time hes two for eight di yeah two for eight made leges with a scoop shot another tough shot all of his have been difficult shots proor keeps on trucking again for two and that was an attempt to foul Proctor they actually grabbed him by the shirt but give tyres Proctor Credit he doesnt even Flinch at that recognizing that my little big sis yeah yes G Staley and also I mean youo orama what a job he has done the pan thats what happens when you eat a lot of Ron you eat a lot of lasagna why hasnt that worked for me thats all Ive done my entire life Duke on a 21 to5 run Ray no been very cold not this time as he sticks the triple you know one thing hes achieved think about this hes LED unbelievable the conference in scoring and in rebound only a few other guys have done that Tyler hansboro did it Tim Duncan did it Bagley did it when he played here at Duke and then missed one oh I got it Harris Grant Harris Grant did it theyre the only guys to do that lead the conference and Tyle talk about a favorite him and Duncan special taking on Reno the scoop no Reno defended that beautifully heres the heave with a shot clock winding down Evans cant hit it hes got nice skills when you looking right now think about where hes come as a look on player very close friends with wemy hes very close with wemy thats his chess partner those two guys play chess together the first time I ever saw Victor wanyama he was actually playing two on two in his teammate was Maxim Ray no the incredibly Talented Mr Hart OB Im taking you over Kevin Hart in the game though I watched Kevin Hart win the celebrity MVP in the celebrity game Im going with ob I saw your work at Syracuse saw the picture of you out there hooping and and youre you got the height advantage over Kevin Hart by the way Im taking you by maybe an inch and a half maybe I know one thing doesnt have over Mr Hart Dash register that goes dingling dinging ding keeps going too keeps going yeah I know Evans will fire that pass out a turnover and Duke with their first of the game yeah how cool shes unbelievable Harper Harold shes a battle bone cancer shes really like such a shes a hero as of gu John Shire terrific young girl 10 years of age cant get that one to go just 10 years old yep I want to Simply say if you want to get chances on that car make sure you go to vorg vital raffle vorg V raffle heck with the two point I dont care about more important is raising money for kids battling cancer Pro to is 15 and the lead balloons to 4527 Duke Reno off the fake on Mala watch got it thats his first bucket inside to threepoint line Reno with the jump hook we saw it with the left hand from that side this time hes able to get it to go with the right hand but great touch for a sevenfooter you know right now if youre Kyle right now to K Smith you just hope that you that you can get this to tapack if you can go in a locker room at 10 for them would be a victory you dont want to get to 20 nice fake R going for the slam with both hands we talk he shows a lot of potential he really does he shows a lot of potential and we talk about NBA guys and you think about a guy like Maxine REO with the ability to shoot the three balls hes already shown and now showing his ability to show touch around the rim as well as put it on the floor 7 foot one this the guy youve got it like right Dicky V attacking the basket with the F Harper able to get going at all I think coming back back home has made it tough psychological they really hes well loved you everybody loves him Coach K come out to see him he welcome a back a beautiful young guy with the Blair Academy in New Jersey hes been playing so great I dont think hes scored yet has he off the spin knocks it in and thats the reason why because when you come back I can remember my first game after going with to the Denver Nuggets and going back to San Antonio they did not want me to get off and so you think about tyres practor what he done in this game one thing for certain even though hes scoring at a major clip 15 points for him already his biggest effort was making sure that jayen Blakes does not have a big game here on the hes over for four today he has been completely shut down and now hes over for five really struggle for the kid I really believe psychologically its been tough on him Blakes pokes that one away to stop the fast break a minute 15 to go now during their practice on this floor before the game Coach K came down to shake his hand and and wish him well and tell him hes very proud of him well he really really loved them he loved M he recruited him Proctor again working on a 17point first half i s in amazement when I think about when Johnny Dawkins came here Coach K got to commit from him and how from that moment what he achieved and his numbers they should make Coach K the commissioner of basketball for college basketball he would be ideal and the commissioner football should be saving why not take advantage of resources like that raino with another one that one is all next he has 18 tell you what its down to 13 let me ask you this do you think coach Kay and well talk about in the second half you think Coach K wants to work that hard thats a tough job to take right now Dicky B tell you what hes a man that can handle that tell you that just like he did with the Olympics well Stanford making a late run here at Cameron indor healer on flag how about a 69ine guy handling the basketball against a six foot guy at the top of the key with no issues whatsoever the spin dribble get away gets the shot up there follow watch with a follow and itll count and thats the end of the first half bat getting it up and in to make it 4934 he has played really brilliant when you talk about prop yeah averaging about 19 points a game over those last four so hes really exploded here Reno with a second half touch puts it to the deck swatted Away by malawat but a blocking foul and theyll get Proctor for that be number two on him Reno on the ground holding that left wrist looked as though he tried to brace his fall attacking the basket turning it and you see that left wrist going to the ground immediately all of his body weight going down on that left wrist hes up headed to the free throw line but paying that left wrist a lot of attention yeah his Pals who play with him on the French national team had that look on their faces his mom here on hand his mom Vanessa in the crowd the first I met them last night at dinner they came over we said hello and what a nice kid Ill tell you just classy un namey w b man shot right there even though its the list risk that controls gu didnt of the basketball his mom was a Hooper in France but OB the first game I had of Max R know he said hey make sure to talk nice about me my mom is watching Well he kind of makes it easy he really does hes definitely made it easy here this afternoon Id love to see young guys give recognition to M man so special we know 19 great spacing you thats you cant get a whole lot of help on them because they get such great space offensively but they got great spacing they could be CU theyve got so many great Shooters on the floor canull over the top couldnt get the pass there for malat 4935 the Duke Blue Devils wants to get him one one Reno with that left hand no follow watch with the board he uses the left hand quite a bit as well he really does both hands around the rim yes James penetrates off the window and a foul two turn out so underrated he wasnt underrated when he played at chain hes not underrated in the eyes of John shy hes not underrated in the F lies of his teammates he has been just a different maker getting into that starting lineup so physical that was an example of his strength going to the Bas Dicky V he gave up football after tearing his ACL as a youngster so he decided to pick up the basketball and its its been a great decision for him very smart sers his second foul and a threepoint play you know hes label right right now according to our experts in the ESPN a second round draft choice and hes really going to get a chance Ill be honest with you we had him at CP3 Camp Elite Camp earlier all point guards and it was combined with Jason Tatum Camp I thought he was a small forward OB when he walks in the door Im like no way this guys a point guard but then when you see his skill on the floor he absolutely can match it with that physicality and one of the reasons why Duke is one of the best teams in the country maybe the best team in the country is because they made the move to put him at the starting point guard spot kiple just picked up foul number one cion James one of Dukes true guards who is 66 on the tallest team of the country flag came over to help out defensively Reno again even though he missed that one you guys have been raving about the touch and a whistle here with 1831 to go in half and thatll go against seon James his first you I normally dont ever root for a player Im really rude for get BL Blakes to really start to have a good second half I know how much it means they coming back to Duke where he graduated played here four years and I know hes hes been so great all year 145 a game leads the team steals assists sellers got a good looking shot knocks that down he comes in at 14 points a game excellent shooter came with a big time reputation shooting the ball ni V look at your numbers on Jaylen Blakes however the last two seasons and you can consider that he had a stretch where he was a starter for the Blue Devils during that 2022 year I believe and he scored 16 and 17 points and backto back games for them so he show flashes of this what were seeing for now in Stanford but just so much talent with this Blue Devil squad over his tenure in his three years here by the way graduating from Duke in three years hats off to that young man hes a graduate student at Stanford because he got the job done academically here in Duran Ill tell you this right now hes not going to have too many dark days once he becomes graduate stamp with his graduate graduate degree combined with the Duke degree combined with his personality his attitude he set it for greatness in his future canle off the inbounds little spin to get himself an open look for two kid from the bger state Wisconsin played Wisconsin Luth in high school and an undefeated season the Young Brother uhoh give it back flag to canle over the top and flag with a stu wow de gracis going wow right there thats awesome baby with a c the leg hes a solid goal PTP its swatting away and a foul there hes like I qu you when you play solid gold PTP Nick this is the way red our back designed it when you talk about the fast break the ball doesnt touch the floor y great great passing you throw it up allowing your Superstar to be able to go up dunk it through he gets the double figures another assist from seion James but Cooper flag starts it with his defense on the other end thats where Duke is so successful turning their defense into offense I got a B pick with you you mentioned the name red orback red orback stole from us we gave him when I was us three with pistons we had three first round draft choices so we go out and get Bob Mack do our ER wanted to do the deal get Bob Macker do and the bottom line is we gave up three first rounds we gave one went for a guy by the name of Mel one went for a guy named Parish in a trade and they get an ML car actually as a free agent so they got three guys for our draft choices and you know whos so for yeah well thats why were so fortunate because now youve been with us for 45 years and changed the college basketball game all because red arbach got the best of you the train oh its wide open on the feet from flag red would have liked that screen roll to the goal I spoke at a big Bank re was I said red youre talking about your championships wheres my ring wheres my ring I got blam for those other people than me even though M said a great guy was a terrific player wherever you went sers beyond the threepoint line raino Callin for the ball heres Blakes can he get started here no been a long day for him and his return to Cameron indor but Obie look at the special attention being paid to Blakes if theres anyone and again these guys love them tyres Proctor loves jayen Blakes as a former teammate having a huge days got 20 points but he wants to make sure that he under that Jaylen Blakes understands what he left and what he could have been a part of on this team that could possibly win a National Championship nice done there and the revers is up and in oh there he is agall with the basket best looking basket today so far for Stanford watch again they can be no WR they can be no WR flag is such a good passer such a willing passer yep you know what I was just thinking about think about this in high school you had Cooper flag together Derek queen of Maryland and MCN and Connecticut all three are right now charted for the top 10 in the NBA draft mat of three high school kids again were gaining Big Time command of the game not that theyre ever really tested you know who just left a couple of moments ago who has seen enough the great Kevin Hart hes like duks really good Im out and hes seeing Cooper flag and he will see Cooper flag even more most likely in the coming years at NBA Allstar Weekend where Kevin Hart of course normally is frequenting but has a show here tonight so not going to be part of NBA Allstar festivities this weekend Kevins got a show in town by the way otherwise Im sure he would stayed for the whole thing Cooper flag with 13 three rebounds four assists so Stanford trying to cut in sers to drive it giler outside and the former walkon will hit the three Gilda was a starter earlier in the year they were playing a two guard two point yard lineup with he and Blakes however they were getting beat up on the defensive end so they made the move to bring him off the bench but he gives them a shooting spk Off the Bench you know theyve done all right from threepoint territory they made seven of them heres flag to try one but too strong kle with the rebound Proctor back for flag open again and give him three dont give him two opportunities dont give there look I know some Stanford grad is crying his out happens to be our producer our producer was a great player another good player he was a superstar I mean the one of the best ever at Stanford rebounder scorer Hall of Fame Pack 12 Hall of Fame Stanford unbelievable Kim belon its a pleasure work with hey Kim did i s it way he wrote it out for me you missed a highlight or two Id like you to revisit that after the next break when we were talking about not anyone can just get into Stanford I was actually begging our director Adam to be able to put up our Kim Belton graphic weve got one from work on us Stanford with the ball here 70 to 44 Duke Maxim Ray knows had a great year at 20 and 12 and 20 double doubles for the year as thats poked away Proctor everywhere and knocked it free R know 33 and 14 against UC Davis 32 16 against Santa Clara 28 12 against Miami he has had a slew of outstanding game shot clock down to five raino near midcourt does he see it he gives it up long one coming Blakes cant Bank it in it just cant hit a shot he is 0 for Applause seven Brown will let it fly and hit the three Malik Brown the 69 Jr and everyone shooting him for the Duke Blue Devils oh he looked at one earlier but he turned it down that time not turning it down of course Malik Brown has that ability is not normally that that aggressive on the offensive end but let one fly and is able to knock it down part of the paint trying to get around Gillis thats tough to do and He will draw the foul Gill such an outstanding Defender and came back after missing a game because he was sick did not show up for the Clemson game play 15 minutes against Cal this week and he will send oakar to the line the 68 JR out of Bronxville New York yeah he up played as we said earlier Tomy EV that of Harvard really a very physical kid we congratulated Tommy on his 300 win last night beating Cornell The Ivy giving him 300 wins in the ivy congratulations Tommy o par at the line one of the weaker foul shooters for Stanford theyre a great foul shooting team they make near 80 hes at 67 contagious see your teammates do it in life a lot of things become contagious oh what do you see Cory as a former NBA player Proctor NBA I I love his size and Ts Proctor came in with the reputation of a shooter hes been showing off that shooting touch this year but Dicky B has six fo 5 66 he has the ability to play both guard spots and he can get after defensively so I do see a future for tyres Proctor at the NBA level not sure if that happens this year or next but I do see him making his way there a great effort there by Brown to hit the deck and deflect the pass you know Cory theres no no substitute for a guy who can play either position and make shots and make shots and we look at the draft board right now of course Cooper flag kkan nipple and K malat we talked about Max INR no projected right now as at the head top of the second round as Tyrese Proctor is in those first 40 picks but Tyrese Proctor and of course in todays age of nil may decide you know what it may be more beneficial for me to stick around and graduate from duke be here four years and have another opportunity to be able to try to win a National Championship next year as well Lakes finally gets one to go from midrange and it has been a terribly long day for the former Duke Blue Devil returning to Cameron indor finally gets a shot to go hes one for eight really happy for him that a shot went down hes one for eight hes been so good all year flag looking inside puts it to the deck keeps on driving and left hand usually doesnt let him down but it did there give R know a lot of credit contesting that one though without foul you know really makes flag so special he plays so hard on both sides the ball he doesnt just play offensively really working hard but no hes so in tune the game has such an awareness his cerebral attitude and mentality is special Gillis open in and out we got an excellent look he was also shoved to the deck but no whistle after the shot should have got three there I think the ref want to go to dinner 7348 Blakes will try and weave his way through and draws the foul with 1107 to go here in the second half and Duke frankley work I believe thats the definition of a power couple yes without a doubt tipped out 1106 left in the contest and John shy in year three at the helm has three more McDonalds allamericans coming next year yeah two uh booer have you seen the bo I have seen the Bruiser brother I think they are absolutely fantastic both great young men mom CC directing the way of course we talked about the mothers we we dont need to talk about their dad cuz we know weve talked about him more than enough to pull up pop on drop and canle with the weak side rebound James Mal set the screen for him he rolls back inside and tipped Away by Stanford an uncharacteristic turnover by seon James you dont see many of those from him thats his first of the game now with six assists so 31 assists only six turnovers thats a pretty good ratio Obie I never saw a ratio like that duuk only had one turnover at halftime I no you didnt have that ratio I did not cuz I was looking to shoot you like to shoot the rock hes trying to shoot the rock shot it very well too 1032 to go that did it very well G will let that fly and knocks that down Benny Giller the 61 Jr who po cow stayed Fuller in for 20 so he can score he has six today theyre going to win their share of games in the conference at home you dont play Duke every day Evans what a tough shot couldnt get it bat lost the handle but its knocked away from him yeah its not that Stanford is a bad team of course theyre 8 and six in the ACC this is a good team the problem is they cant guard Duke well new Flash no one else can either you know so the thing is especially on this court as you mentioned Dicky V its tough to come in here and try to stop the Blue Devils on their home floor canle outside the three Gillis for James James around the back still and a tough drive just kept gone going very determined he made that because of his strength his body his strength sealed off the defensive player really well got him oneonone he has really been a big plus John John sh told me on a we made an excellent job my staff and all in finding the right people that fit our style ofart he has 12 today hes had a really good day Stanford cant strike inside but Duke with the foul good n and a half Applause showing Dicky V you talk about making the fin finding the right guys to be able to have on this roster roster construction so important in todays age of nil and the transfer portal you have to give Rachel Baker a tremendous amount of credit and you look at the staff of course John Shire Jay Lucas Chris Carwell I mean you it goes on these guys do a tremendous job but Rachel Baker in the GM position the first general manager in college basketball makes a tremendous difference because shes not on the court she helps John Shire to identify the people necessary to bring in but she doesnt have to worry about coaching them I think that makes a big difference when youre building a roster well Ive heard great things about her managing your roster is a key there aint no doubt about it just ask down there in Carill land who bu away theres my little sis theres R and she and again she doesnt sit on the bench she sits behind the bench often times you cant even find her Im asking where she is and shoot around shes hiding behind a table of somewhere OB she does not want any part of the Limelight she is only concerned about creating the student athlete experience here in Durham at Duke University that is her overall job and she takes it as seriously as anyone and is great at it well were going to give her some PR because she deserves it our camera guys are too good yeah youre going to find you oh the Slam by malat and a foul to give him 14 points some Rim rattling Ducks today dunks today by the Duke Blue doubles great action once again pick and roll and recognizing not to drop it off to the sevenfooter dicky V throw it up in the air where only he can go get it and malawat finishes strong yeah not but people are going to go up there and get it I know I could never have gotten up there you mean you werent an elevator man no up up in the way hey John shy you mentioned earlier Obie what great job hes done in his third year as a player he was an all American he was all ACC he was runner up Player of the Year deir at that time had a great kid Vasquez remember him he was a good player gives it up and Blakes cant connect from threepoint territory and a foul in the paint approaching 9 minutes to go here on this Saturday afternoon I went and looked up for the acate what he did in high school sh I was blown away are you kidding me this guy he was just unbelievable as a player and then he did that in Illinois in college he was certainly tremendous senior year average 18 points a game John was a great great shooter teammate just a terrific and hes a hes hes a rising star coach no doubt about it its not going to stop get the Boo and run this year going to be great caros certainly was one heck of a player and thats rubbed off on his kids hey coming up at 6 Eastern on ESPN todays featured college basketball match matchups continue itll be Syracuse hosting North Carolina then at 800 Eastern number 15 Kentucky against Texas in Austin boy Texs really been struggling lately because the toughness in the conference from top to bottom you know and I sort of agree with those of the state it may be the greatest Conference of top to bottom ever ever ever ever I think one of the real struggles for the committee the selection committee is going to be not bunching them up too much in their particular brackets as flag lost the handle on that malawat collects it though heres kiple open hustling for his own Miss got Airborne a great job there to deflect it right off of Stinson theres a perfect example of hustling and H right there up 24 points and doesnt stop him hustling I never forget one time I came here to do a Duke Carolina game and Im watching practice I could not believe when I was watching on Hurley and Grant Hill diving on the floor so I said but hey has anybody told you guys made the team care about that we care about tomorrow night BR Hill you know youre talking about the some of the greatest of all time to wear that Duke uniform you better put the name Grant Hill in there L hustle plays today for Duke and a giant reason the Blue Devils are 21 and three and its been their defense again shining today winning hustle diving for balls thats a reflection of coaching thats reflection of where the pride they sell what that Jersey brings out it brings commitment from everybody against that flag again from allat and another scoop and another fantastic dunk by the big fella thats by design it absolutely is and when you play for the Blue Devils and you get into the painted area youre looking for Kam malas all you have to do with your read as you see that big man step over its no dumping it off no bounce pass you just throw it up to where only malawat can go get it and its been beneficial for the Blue Devils here all night another example of why Cooper flag shows what a great team player is always looking to make the pass they love what I love about it they got great comaraderie they love playing together they really do well they love to see these type of highlights Cooper flag getting into the painted area we talked about the left hand we know he can score with it he also can drop dones getting downhill tossing it up with the left malaw with the hammer back after this message and a word from our ABC stations sell this out right now make sure you get those Raffles vorg vital raffle and youll be helping kids battling cancer you know I mentioned Grant Hill a little bit earlier hes going to be

raised million and we going to go over 100 million for pediatri versus pediatric cancer V the jimm Stinson collects it another opportunity here for the Stanford Cardinal on the move sers too strong and a big rebound by James and of course for the Cardinal this is their fourth ACC road trip since January 1 running up against Cooper flag who has 19 today and its just been way too much for give him the credit as well but how about the way that my guy has directed dealing with you and me how about the challenge that hes had to do dealing with this of course as much as I talk me Im e you you you are like a walk in the park my man oh youre youre both phenomenal youre the best of what you do hey I want to say this to really we wind down here this blowout I cant thank you enough seriously you guys are producer directors all the guys oh man we had the dinner with them last night all the guys and what you did to get me up here i been so Sleepless wondering how my body could possibly get up these steps and you guys practically almost carried me up here and I cant thank you enough youre the best my man youre the best unbelievable having you back is incredible as we said last week the whole country just wrapped their arms around you having you back where you belong you know thats how much you mean to everybody and having you back where you belong and it took a lot of work from a lot of people and again you give them praise for it but in this seat here in the Crows Nest doing games at Duke this is what America remembers about Dicky V this is what they know about you there have been so many memorable games in this building and to see you back here in your comfort zone is great for all of us to be a part it really meant a whole lot to me guys Stanford with the basketball Evan Stinson with lifts but cant find a range from three and guno with the rebound 8859 its been a Runway here in the second half for the Duke Blue Devils you know Cory and Dave we were talking about some of the draft choices do three guys in the top six in a jump shot you knows in a to be drafted in the middle of the second round at this moment evens yes yeah but I would love to see and again if that holds I would love to see Showtime slim stick around for another year I agree with you and again with nil the way it is and of course Duke is the truly only Global College basketball program theyre not hurting for resources and when you think about that I would love to see him cuz hes a first round Talent fosta with the spin into the lane but got to the 10 and couldnt finish it heres young to swish it in from threepoint territory Vicky V youve seen Duke now twice live youve watched Alabama you watched Auburn when you look at the good teams the great teams right now in college basketball where do you think Duke is after seeing them twice live oh absolutely as good as anybody in the game because they do it on both sides you know every night youre going to get a consistent effort defensively execution wise youre going to get because they play so well together and they play so hard Ive never seen not play hard they play with such passion coach Kay was a great believer in that when he achieved that imense record that he has and its passed down to his people it becomes Applause contagious giler the junior that glances away right to gunba Obie as we look at this lineup on the floor for for for Duke Kayla FL Cayla flosser was a five star should have been a McDonalds all americ coming out of high school as he steps back lines up a three ball I asked him and thats the first three hes made in the last 10 games I asked him pregame can you go back to being the guy that I used to say layup when you shot a jump shot I had an opportunity to coach him at oakill hes lost his confidence but hes starting to find that he got a field goal in the last game I in my opinion theyre going to need him down the stretch you can never have enough guards on your bench that can come in and give you quality minutes well a little tangle between Reno and Malik Brown there they had to be separated at the 307 Mark 9564 and we will take the break here getting a little bit frustrated you can tell Stanford is here down the stretch and Renas really been locked up in the second half after a big first half but its been all Duke since the break at Cameron Duke second five when you put the likes of brown and put guys like him on the floor Foster I think they got five guys that come off that bench could probably finish maybe in the top 2025 in the country I really believe that I believe so you look at Caleb Foster but then think about this lineup Darren Harris is a fivestar Patrick GBA would have been a McDonalds allam had he not been injured and miss his entire senior year and of course Isaiah Evans was a McDonalds AllAmerican so you think about this group and again you put Malik Brown in that mix who led the ACC and steals a season to go and now youre talking about a Top Flight Team a Top Flight starting lineup for another entire University I agree with you nice little jump hook in the lane has yeah hes got the ability he his his skill is offensive thats what he does when he catches the basketball hes always a threat to get a buck by the way moments ago gunba and Reno offsetting flagrance in transition Here Comes Foster getting some minutes late and getting some points play but its important still look at that he wants more playing time the step back cant TR it oh man Harris with a rebound and I can tell you right now Dicky V theres no one more excited than John shy to see Caleb Foster having some success here because he knows that that can get him going back Caleb fost saved them against Michigan State a year ago hes shown flashes of where he can be brilliant in this Duke uniform look he was starting last year Evans off the window and they get over 100 he could be a prolific scorer hes got great scoring ability we know he can shoot the three if if you dont believe me he can shoot the ball every since the drive call up Bruce Pearl he had six threes in the first half in a victory over all and going high off the glass showing off his touch and its John SH now John sh I forgot to tell him about it John and I we got issues because in the blowout win over C on Wednesday he did not put my God Spencer hbert in the game I need to see Spencer hubber on the floor here tonight this by the way is season eye on points for the Duke Blue Devils they have had it rocking all day a threepointer On Target by geler I just hope that jayen picks it up when he go back home down there in paloalto and gets it rolling he came here with tremendous desire and I think it really really affected how hard he wanted to do and really do well here today well had to be an emotional return for him I certainly know it was for one dick vital coming back here to Cameron indor where you have made been part of so many amazing memories over decades on ESPN and a nice job getting open for that one Agra wal the 66 sophomore under a minute to go 101 to 70 ABC World News Tonight coming you way next D was at their best tonight they really were they were executed their rankings with Mr pooy is going to go up in every area oh man Foster again thats why thats why John cant get Spencer in the game Calebs playing to well right now 10 points for him he struggled as of late to see him get the double figures thats a positive sign that the Blue Devils are going in the right direction hes got to really feel good psych psychology wise today leaving here great effort I forcer on the turnover and a run out for the slam here in the final seconds so everybodys getting in it they love it man look at them they got one wacky in the crowd all the future doctors lawyers oh man you turn about those kids Giller with the pop 1500 sads I got rejected here I had 1500 three times 500 500 500 but youre still paying tuition you got grandchildren here so they got you anyway
