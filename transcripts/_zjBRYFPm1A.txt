Carolina State Its all about controlling the glass That is their one area of weakness Unfortunately for Georgia Tech music they will still be without their freshman big man Moila Hes got that high ankle sprain Hes missed pretty much the last three games He will not be available today So thats makes it a little bit easier for North Carolina State to control the glass How about this crowd for a noon tip here in Raleigh huh No surprise Fantastic Copeland straight away and he misses on the three attempt to start our game Also really important for Georgia Tech to get off to a bad loss Theyve had some terrible losses their last two games against Miami And what did you talk about just a moment ago Turn over number one That that shouldnt be hard to keep track if it goes to form Very frustrating for Damon Stonire This is Williams leading scoreer for the Pack this season Pumps up the jumper and theyre 0 for two early Couple of players got tangled up Ven Luben behind the play Im not crazy when Darien Williams fades away on those I wish hed go to the basket Thats two turnovers inside the first minute Alan Breed was in the vicinity number seven and White has the ball now as they whip it around the perimeter NC State 12 and five on the season They are 31 in conference play An enormous win against FSU this week on the road Then Alan Luben couldnt finish it off upstairs NC State won that game cheering against Florida State 11369 by 44 points Largest margin of victory in an ACC game in cheering school history Shot clocks at eight Theyve played a few of them here cheering Fleming against three defenders Williams took it away Three turnovers inside of the first 90 seconds Williams stop and go and the kick Reed from THE CORNER FOR the pack Thats Darren Williams playing a de facto point guard role That is new This is the third game hes trying that and even with Trey Hollowman coming back Will we told us hes going to stick with this and you see his passing ability and especially he becomes more aggressive with the ball in his hands Just the ninth three of the season for Allen Breed Gongo travels with Luben defending and that is four turnovers early for coach Damon Starttomire and Georgia Tech He might check himself into this game One of the great alltime college point guards terrific NBA point guard cheering How frustrating it is Four turnovers already Coach Stomire in his third season leading the Yellow Jackets McNeel with the entry Luben kicks it out Copeland off the glass and good And a nod to coach Dontomire after he banked it in No Im sure he called that cheering Georgia Tech responding at the other end with Fleming I mentioned the bad starts They were down 3517 against Pittsburgh 152 against Miami early on NC State despite the miss by Williams on the last possession made 19 threes to tie a school record in that win at Florida State 19 of 35 They went one of nine to start the game and then went 18 of 26 to finish it McNeel with the basketball for NC State Copeland defended by Mustaf Williams with another miss from long distance One thing you notice about NC State is they switch one through five on the defensive end Not a lot of teams doing that And thats how you beat all that switching is getting it to the cup and trying to score inside Mustaf in traffic These two teams long time ACC rivals Copeland Hell try it again Long rebound Back to Copeland Turning it around Dongo Lost the handle for a moment Finds McNeel Cant leave him Back to Copeland Preserving the possession Wasting no time Ball knocked around and taken by the Yellow Jackets Theyre going to theyre going to be fine with Cadier Copeland firing away from threepoint range Theyre not anywhere near him when he launches Omar Washington number one and old goal A veteran presence in this lineup for Georgia Tech His three attempt is off the mark Williams reaches out to Coral Im just really not crazy with all these threepointers early on for Georgia Tech Playing right into the defenses hands Its not what they do Luben against Dungo welldefended held ball and it will be Yellow Jackets basketball So well take a timeout A rapid first few minutes and a onepoint lead for NC State on the CW Lenovo Center and NC State not bashful about shooting that threepointer Two of eight so far for the Pack and theyve taken 10 shots overall to Georgia Techs four shots Thats the result of those four turnovers So Georgia Techs just got to settle down a little bit cheering NC State makes just over 11 threes per game That is third most in the ACC This is Fleming looking for three And that one is all net for Fleming 28 threepoint shooter Thats why he was open Good for him for making him pay for that disrespect So that is an 80 run for Georgia Tech after trailing six to nothing out of the gate and Fleming comes up with the steal You see how theyre sagging into drop coverage off of Copeland and he forced it anyway Kelly and Kiraak have come into the game for Georgia Tech Poked away from Washington It is out of bounds and its going to be NC State ball Nice job by Allan Breed Walling up there Senior transfer He played for Will Wade at Mcnes as did Copeland Thats just body on body Breed has started the last seven games for the Wolfback Matt Ael has come in off the bench Number three with the basketball now McNeel on the cut The drop off Luben couldnt get it over the rim Gustaf right down Broadway and he lays it in Georgia Techs had their answer starting with the interior defense And Alan Luben is not great at finishing inside especially oversized Made him pay in transition Four points now of the first half for Jaden Mustaf Averages about eight per game had his best game this season against George in a losing effort on the road with 15 points McNeel misfires and its back to Washington Washington eyes for the rim into the paint and driving against the NC State defense set Thats now a 120 run for the Yellow Jackets They took a punch early on and now theyve punched back See if Williams can respond This is individual effort all the way Drops it off to Lumen for the double fisted rim rocker Beautiful backing down his defender in that mid post area And thats why Will Wade wants the ball in his hands Hes a brilliant decision maker Driving to the rim knocked away from Fleming in midair mind you So well stay at this end of the floor McNeel Jr is going to get a breather for NC State Terrence Arsenal has come into the game Still waiting for our first look at Trey Hollowman Hell be in soon Hes a double digit scoreer on the season Just over 10 points per game for the senior Hollowman has played 121 games in his collegiate career Havent heard a lot from Kasi Reeves as he hits the deck and creates contact Yeah he definitely likes that matchup against Van Allen Luben Lubens not going to be able to really contain him out there Kesi Reeves is a very aggressive scoreer He can get hot at 23 on five for seven threepoint shooting at Duke Yellow Jackets gave the Blue Devils all they wanted in Cameron Indoor Stadium on New Years Eve couldnt quite pull out that win And thats why this is such a significant game for both teams Tommy because neither of these teams has a quad one win NC State is 0 and5 against quad one teams 0 and3 against ranked teams but there are many many quad one opportunities to be had for both these squads This is not last years ACC You can get some quad one wins but youve got to take care of business especially at home Reeds is one of the top scorers for Georgia Tech Six times this season Hes gone for 20 points or more as Seth mentioned And now able You can see Georgia Tech is switching everything And now weve got a turnover for North Carolina State Thats the third for Will Wades team Hes in his first season Crop of new coaches in the ACC Turning the roster over Fourth in the ACC in scoring and they have shot the three Not so far today all that well but 40 leads the conference seventh in the nation This is the fourth school that will Wade has coached at in his career Hes been to seven NCA tournaments in 11 years including the last five straight You think the folks in Raleigh were a little excited when Will Wade signed on Hes a gunslinger Hes a dynamic personality Hes aggressive Hes catning it for the media We like him cuz hell say anything Hes a little nutty that way We like him a little nutty but thats what you need in North Carolina State You need a big personality on that bench Last year his team went 28 and seven at McD This matchup of Van Allen Luben on Aqua Ree is going to be a problem for North Carolina State I mentioned they switch one through five So if you just keep screening they keep switching till you get the mismatch And thats another fall away from Darien Williams cheering And another turnover from Georgia Tech Luben spun out Arsenal tries to track it down Williams a ricochet bounce pass inside to Luben who musles it in Hes got four in the first half Love the no call there too Get up young fella Jaden Mustaf trying to draw the charge Good bucket Good find by Williams Bird Smith AJ Desai Anthony Eid in charge of the action this afternoon from Lenovo Center Theres a bump on Kelly and a foul will be called against NC State Well step aside for just a moment Georgia Tech has the lead on the road taking on the pack on the CW courtside Saturday Blake Forest and by the way didnt play so hot in his next game against Virginia but you know I talked to Will Wade about that yesterday and uh lets just say it was not as spontaneous as it might have looked He was coaching his player through the media which is a great move on his part And its also part of why he made the move to have Darren Williams play some point guard to get the ball in his hands and get him into a more aggressive mindset Its why my advice to young journalists I dont know how young your friend Joe is but dont ever take it personally Theyre not talking to you theyre talking through you Bill Wade was coaching his guy and he has responded A legitimate question from Joe and I think coach Wade got his point across in the response to my buddy Joe Gillio Quick little turn around just over the edge of the rim NC State and Sier Well they would love some good minutes out of Sier again We talked about Moila the freshman big man for Georgia Tech is once again out with that high ankle sprain Cam Craft number 12 is in the lineup for Georgia Tech just hit a three last time down the court Pass to Kelly Tipped away by Ael cheering Saved by Mustaf trying to cross it over in front of Hollowan Copeland in some serious traffic and a foul coming up against Georgia Tech and Mustaf Theres Darien Williams You see his music numbers there where theyve been solid Its not easy You know we think of these guys as big strong athletes but music its not easy going from the third guy on the opponents scouting report to the first guy And he was deemed ACC preseason player preseason player of the year Expectations come along with that But look the fact is is that he can get a little bit too passive on offense and doesnt get to the foul line as much as he should And so if youre going to take the check youre going to have the expectations The miss from Hollerman Georgia Tech gets it back Williams does have three assists so far as Fleming attacks the rim Arsenal was in the vicinity So was Copeland Terrific defense from Arsenal You you play three years from Kelvin Sansson youre going to learn to play defense And now heres another turnover from North Carolina State That is the fourth of the first half for the Wolfpack Guadir Copeland the senior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania at McNiss last season with coach Wade as Seth mentioned two years prior in the Syracuse Orange program playing his 105th career game Hes got over 900 points in his career Past the midway point of the first half of action So glad that youre with us Reeves was fouled in the act of shooting by able defending Tom Wormy along with Seth Davis one of the most trusted voices in all of college basketball and our outstanding production team led by producer Ken Neil director Brett Lancaster Well if youre Damon Starttomire you got to be happy You know theres execution and theres competition music Obviously you need both but from his point of view the more important part is the competing part the fight part They had that really bad Theyve been competitive even in their losses until that home loss to Pittsburgh And so coming up next CW Courtside Saturday continues Number 22 Clemson hosting Highflying Miami A crucial conference showdown Miami number 22 Clemson next only on the CW with Tom Brenamman and Mike Jaminsky at Little John Coliseum Damon told me that on Thursday at practice they did nothing on the court They had a they had a chop it up session as a team He wanted to know what issues are going on Clearing the air Didnt dribble a basketball Says he maybe does it once a season He wants to see his guys fight and compete And they have done that the first 11 minutes Thatll be a foul on Fleming for Georgia Tech By the way Miami and Jay Lucas another firstear head coach in the ACC won 10 in a row And Brad Brownells team at Clemson has won eight in a row We had them a couple of weeks ago on the road and they got a victory at pit for coach Brown Coach Starttomire something to say right now This teams hanging tough In fact theyve got the sevenpoint lead Seth six turnovers for Georgia Tech Four for North Carolina State Its amazing because the Yellow Jackets could not have started this game any worse Well North Carolina State didnt do a good enough job executing on their offense Theyre only 28 applause and cheering And Georgia Tech is 58 7 for 12 So even though NC States got six more shots theyve been sloppy themselves Georgia Tech wants to avoid a 19point halftime deficit That was the situation at home against Pit this week in their losing effort Theyre seeking their first road win of the season Come in with a 108 record 14 in conference play They havent won since early January against Boston College They lost all their neutral sight games too They have not won a game away from home No time like the present Trying to work it inside to Reeds Hollowman came over the top to strip it away Beautiful feed by Dongo Hollowman with dribble high off the glass and a foul is called You see what Hollowman brings to this team especially in transition Hes not a smooth shooting guy See the double comes over and the really nice delivery and Hollowman with the defense and finish You talked about Trey Hollowerman coming from Michigan State Terrence Arsenal coming from Houston Those are winning programs 83 at the free throw line this season for Holland There you go He said about winning programs Will we brought in nine transfers six of them have played in the NCA tournament The two at McNees and Benal and Luben as well played for North Carolina Yeah remember Hollowmans Michigan State team a season ago in the regional final against Auburn losing 7064 One step away from the final four This NC State program just two years removed from its trip to the final four under Kevin Keats That was some run Fleming rising up and hitting Hes got eight points in the first half I I just like the bounce and the step on these Yellow Jackets Theyre on the attack Theyre down in their stance Hollerman catch and release and its a three ball Welcome back Trey Hollerman We missed you Five quick points for Hollowman I thought that coming off the bench cheering Fleming and Reeves not on the same page Saved Dongo couldnt handle the pass Here comes Arsenal Copelan avoiding three DEFENDERS TO FIND ABLE OUT OF THE CORNER FOR THE THREE BALL Beautiful play by Copelan on that hammer play Abel was right in the corner where he knew he would be and another Georgia Tech turnover Holland creating all kinds of confusion for the Yellow Jackets Able reloads Fleming goes high for the rebound Georgia Tech better slow this thing down cheering NC State now four of 12 on threepoint attempts Flemings been a big factor in the first half Dongo midrange bounces out to Arsenal Worst shot in basketball Hollerman who missed the last two games with an ankle injury prior to today and only four points in his last four games including the two he missed Series of booze from Copeland He hit the deck collided with a teammate as well And Sier cheering Fleming steps into a three ball Long rebound to Ael and he will wait for reinforcements And now the officials take a timeout It is Sier who was shaken up at the other end of the through to form We talked about they turn it over more than any other team in the ACC They only I say only when they average little under 14 a game So theyve already got eight here in the early going But NC States offense not quite efficient enough to take full advantage of it And even though NC State has the onepoint lead their two leading scorers Paul McNeel and Darren Williams have yet to score This has been a fun game Yeah Williams back into the lineup McNeel is also in there This pass taken by Washington An alley TO THE RIM cheering TRYING TO GET BACK AND BLOCKING ITS Luben again He challenges Fleming Oh couple of players collide on the loose ball Arsenal and Reeves We got action here Whistle Yes the whistle stop play almost immediately after that contact How about this sensational unbelievably welltimed block from Ben Allen Luben off the window return to sender and then a good job bodying up as well Oh thats going to hurt So that was Terrence Arsenal for NC State running into Kuwaiti Reeves Hopefully hes okay We got the officials at the scorers table full of moment Bird Smith AJ Desai Anthony Ees Just taking a look at that sequence Previous play is under review So I dont know if theres doesnt sound like theres any kind of appeal Maybe looking at an F1 on Arsenal but thats two thats just two guys going for the ball Interesting pace of this game I mean both these teams like to get out and go My buddy Clark Kellogg calls it a windshield wiper game Its the type of game I like to watch A lot of possessions Youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands Georgia Tech has led by as many as eight in this first half I have to review the call on the floor stands as a common foul It will be North Carolina States basketball in the back court with 30 seconds on the shot clock Seems to be the right call You always got to look at it Re will get the foul for Georgia Tech Will Wade never shy with his opinions but uh thats just two guys going for the ball Easy for me to say here I didnt get punched in the nose Believe me that would be it for me Why I havent played I havent really played pickup basketball since I broke my nose at Chelsea Pierce in Midtown Manhattan Probably a good idea Were glad that youre with us I think it was 1999 or thereabouts Somehow the game of basketball has survived Back in the day as they like to say Seth McNeel catch and release trying to get into the box score and it rattles out He hit the deck in the aftermath Just think if youre NC State you want to run some things for Darren Williams You dont want to get him in that passive mode Fleming working baseline Two defenders are there Ball goes out of bounds Hollowman came over with some help defensively Georgia Tech maintains possession McNeel and Williams now 0 for music seven combined 0 for four from three Pretty clean music game by the way Only seven total fouls between these two teams and were under six minutes in the first half Teams played once last year That was a win at home in Atlanta for Georgia Tech 8762 by Dongo had a careerhigh 29 points in that game We havent heard much from him so far in this game He is not on the floor right now Shot clock and theyll beat it with a three Washington now with five Terren Arsenal was right there Offense was better than the defense 15 threes on the season for Washington by percentage Georgia Tech one of the better threepoint shooting teams Theyre fifth in the ACC You see they trap Williams every time on that ball screen I know the defense wants to take him out of NC States offense but he cant take himself out of the offense And there you go There you go Hes got to see that ball go in the basket a little bit First bucket for Williams who is the leading scoreer this season for NC State just over 14 and a half points per game coming off 20 points in the win at Florida State He made three threepointers in that effort earlier this week Those games against Wake Forest and Virginia He did not attempt a free throw And theres another threepoint bucket from Jaden Mustaf So hes got seven points in the game Five for eight Yellow Jackets from behind the ark They only average six and a half makes on the season Lowest in the ACC Luben Luben puts the shoulder down off the glass Not high enough on the square Collected by Reeds Another offensive set where Darren Williams is not really involved Angular rebound to the corner and Fleming off the Reeves miss cheering Shot clock at seven Washington eyes the three Gurowak came over the top Its out of bounds It will be NC State basketball Georgia Tech has the lead on the road and youre watching C with the ACC womens tournament The 49th edition the 50th edition will come up to Charlotte next year So well have ACC womens basketball in the CW Thats coming up tomorrow Louisville the highest ranked womens team and theyve won 10 in a row under Jeff Walls Back to the action between Georgia Tech and NC State We are late in our first half of play One thing to keep in mind is Georgia Tech right now is plus four on the boards NC State on the season two and five when they get out rebounding Dango off the glass and hes got his first two of the afternoon Thats a terrific bucket by that young man 69 junior from Sagal Hes got loads of potential NBA scouts eyes are on him Be good to get him going Williams lost his footing Not a good first half for Darren Williams Fleming Tough shot He got it to go with McNeel defending Thats how you make a team pay for a turnover NC State has not done that enough so far in this first half And Georgia Tech now up by seven Look at what he just falls down Ball ends up in Flemings hands there in the really nice finish How about Fleming so far into double digits with 10 points for Georgia Tech in this first half to lead them in scoring In ACC games hes made 17 of his last 18 free throws and he completes the old school threepoint play I had faith I gave you credit Matching the largest lead of the game after that free throw for Georgia Tech Ill tell you what if Will Wades press conferences are entertaining Id love to be in that this halftime locker room as his teams getting outplayed Pass some tight quarters Luben dont go defending May have picked up the personal foul Good job by Van Allen Luben attacking the glass You see Will Wade cannot music be happy Although you got to give Georgia Tech credit One thing theyre doing is shooting the three ball which they music have not done this season Theyre five for 10 from behind the arc Well we talked about Georgia Techs turnovers NC States got six Van Allen Luben 72 for the body of work this season from the free throw line Five points now for Luben Id be interested to see if maybe Trey Hollowman gets a little bit more run I thought he was pretty effective when he was in a game Hes played eight minutes excuse me nine minutes here in this first half One of two for Luben Ael tracks it down after the miss myth Cant happen There you go Reed rattles it in Hes got six Its always got to be so frustrating to a coach when a team gets an offensive rebound after a missed free throw No resistance on the Washington drive Seven points now for Washington Copeland with a glove troder dribble has to back it out You cant have a guy dribble from threepoint line to the rim without any resistance Reed a little too much on the pass It comes right to Copelis fires off the rebound Quick release from the corner Reeves right to Ael NC State is 82 at home one and one in conference play on their home floor Theyve won two in a row and seven of their last nine Entry to Luben for two Hes had a really good first half Seven points now for Luben Two from Williams zero from McNeel one for nine between them for NC State Luben cheering field goal percentage for the season best in the ACC Now granted a lot of the shots its close to the rim Dongo trying to go behind the back Copeland comes up This is a battle of number 11s for the ball I dont know what Dongos doing there He almost lost it and then he tried to drive it A little feisty out there Getting a little agitated on both sides David Starters got to like that Copeland Dongo in the middle of it And you dont you dont ever want you know punches thrown or anyone getting hurt But a little scrap a little hot tempers changing glances Will Wade is not going to be one to cool the temperature at all Lets go Emotional and intense Great conversation with coach Wade I mean Dongo the game today Dongo almost loses it And instead of throwing it to someone whos a better ball handler he tries to drive it He tries to put it behind his back We were here for a nonconference game earlier this season Francis State coach Wade said I need a little more emotion a little more fire from our guys And they are on the right trajectory right now And its big deal Thats a three ball and his first points of the afternoon And thats what you want to see if youre NC State going into this locker room You got to get him going a little bit given how poorly they play To only be down one is pretty good Second leading scorer for the Pack this season Paul McNeel Jr Just cheering over 14 points per game Washington on the handles Able defends Loving the board applause cheering Almost knocked away from Copeland Spirited play from both teams at this juncture Final seconds of our first half How could it be Seth This one has flown by Very few fouls Neither team in the bonus When do you ever see that About a second difference gave shot Copeland trying to do it himself SPIN FROM 11 cheering HES GOT it right before the horn But here Copelan for NC State and five And it appears that coach Wade and Patrick Stacy right there the assistant GM and the analytics specialist were almost spot on with those numbers And consider that NC State returned less than 5 of its scoring this season on its roster Yeah the trick for NC State has been defensively We talked about how they switch one through five Thats a tough way to play defense It takes time It takes connectivity I dont know that theyre ever going to be a great defensive team cuz they dont really have much rim protection But getting that in order when youre switching and communicating and connecting like that all five positions takes a minute He crunched all those numbers in October Almost completely accurate here as we play in January Copeland into the paint Had it poked away Lost the handle Got it back Washington defense deep into the shot clock for McNeel over the top Fleming comes flying in for the board Now I dont want to get yelled at by Will but you have got to get Darren Williams involved in your offense He did not touch the ball that possession Fleming was the leading scoreer in the first half for Georgia Tech as they toss it away Thats one way to get the ball Turnover number 11 McNeel Copeland who had that basket right before the horn of the first HALF AGAINST REEVES COPELAND to the free throw line Got him up in the air Went for the shot fake The way fell for the banana in the tailpipe Vladier Copeland is just a grinder music man Hes a competitor Shot fake lean into the defender Bucket and one mean face Hes carried them today Second foul on Reeves And thats now eight points for Cop Hes also got five assists and one turnover Georgia Tech now 11 turnovers on the day Coach Starter not pleased with the start of the second half Start of the first half was brutal for Georgia Tech as well as they piled up the turnovers but came back came roaring back NC State finished the first half on a 70 run in tight quarters Copeland emerges with the basketball shovels it back misses for three And Williams short of the mark NC State now six of 18 on threepoint trials They lead the league in makes per game just over 11 Williams defending going to the floor Prize it loose Copeland Hes got an alley to the rim Will be a timeout Damon Dynam has seen enough I think hes had enough How about Cadier Copeland now after that layup Hes got 10 points A legend in the local sports media and it is my even though I always see great basketball when I come to the triangle seeing Charlie is the hobbit of my day Great producer great cameraman and one of the alltime great human beings So many people around our industry who work so hard on so many different levels and still shooting those highlights from the baseline as Washington takes it to the rim Thats a good job out of the timeout by Damon Starttomire getting the ball into Washingtons hands getting him going downhill He always talked about Lamar Washington being the toughest guy on the team Portland music native He played one season last season at Pacific where Damon starter previously coached He didnt play for Starttomire there but Starttomire obviously familiar not only with his game but his mentality And cheering thats exactly what they need right now to get this thing right Nine points after the miss for Washington in the game He averages just over 11 Got his third best on the Yellow Jacket roster I mean NC States playing good defense but so many of the turnovers from Georgia Tech are just unforced Difficult shot from Copeland Gustaf heads the break and find Ree on the wing Hell miss the three Dongo tips it around and another chance at a threepoint play for Georgia Tech and Mustaf on the offensive glass Great job by Dongo keeping that ball alive He not going to get credit for a rebound Hes not going to get credit for an assist but thats his bucket Look at how just tipping it away keeps it alive into Mustafs hands Finishing with the and one Thats two straight and ones for Georgia Tech We know North Carolina State doesnt have great rim protection Theyre not a good post defensive team Instead of settling for threes drive it to the rim Might help to make some free throws when youre trying to win on the road Georgia Tech is 11th in the conference as a team 70 from the stripe Unable to finish off those threepoint plays in succession Copeland looking for Luben They miscommunicate It goes out of bounds Now the officials were talking about it and it will be deflected by Georgia Tech AJ Desai came in to award the ball to NC State Theyre trying to say trying to indicate to Damon about replaying it now He wants to use one of his reviews which as long as you have a timeout right But I just dont know that you want to use it at this point in the game Although I think theyre going to win that unless there was pressure from Mustaf on the ball might need a little bit of a better angle than that Under review for a coachs challenge on the out of bounds call you know So the rule is you get one challenge per game If you win the challenge then you get one more and you dont lose a timeout If you lose the challenge you lose a timeout and you dont get any other challenges Theyre going to win this one though Theyre definitely going to win this one for sure And its always interesting like they got a guy on the bench with an iPad looking at the review Like you got to look at a a replay before you make the decision With all this high tech you know its still a bit of a risk but theyre going to win this one So while the officials deliberate we tell you about your favorite board game Its not your favorite TV show Catch the all new episodes of Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson this Thursday 87 central right here on the CW Watch for that triple word score I got to get me one of those game show gigs man How can I get Are you You You aint kidding man Ill tell you Theyre listening here Well work on that at the CW By the way youre looking sharp in your Johnny O pullover Also Johnny O Dave Neville the SVP of marketing came by to say hello today Good to see Dave and appreciate Dave who lives right here in Raleigh as a matter of fact Well if the refs looked at the same replay that we did it should be a pretty easy review Thats Bert Smith at the table Hes joined by AJ Design Anthony Eid offici After review of the previous play it has been determined that the ball went off North Carolina State So the ball belongs to Georgia Tech on the inline with 30 seconds on the shot clock and well resume play Excellent uh explanation Not quite Bill Kennedy level what hes doing at the NBA Little entertainment on the replay reviews We always like to be entertained but good coordination from the Georgia Tech bench Certainly indisputable video evidence to support the overturn and keep the ball with music Georgia Tech I think the new re replay reviews for the most part have sped up games It gets a little dicey music though with the unlimited appeals See theres reviews theres appeals theres challenges Too much to keep track of Now the officials can no longer go to the monitor Final two minutes of regulation in OT to determine possession Well the the the officials can never go to the monitor as you as you know Tommy to determine possession And trust me thats going to come up in the NCA tournament where theres going to be a bad out ofbounds call and people who havent watched college basketball all season are going to realize if a coach is out of a challenge it cant be reviewed I hope it doesnt happen But with all the games and all the possessions and all the out of bounds calls that happened during March Madness somethings going to get sideways But but the interminable reviews the way they just suck the air out of basketball games I think its a huge problem across sports particularly in the NBA So I do think that on balance its been a net positive change for college basketball Entry to Luben They loop it into him and he jams it home Beautiful screen and roll there by Vanalen Luben Thats how hes going to score inside Its not going to be a traditional post entry Thats nine points now for Luben who averages close to 13 per game And hes also the leading rebounder this season for NC State as that one swirls on in from Washington with 11 Hes putting his team on his back right now Right at his season average Darren Williams is standing still in the far corner Breed got the defender in the air and Reeves got around him Little floater hits the front rim Blumen preserves the possession Back to Brie Dongo comes in to contest the shot and a foul called So well step aside It is a tight ball game Stay with us You went to Duke didnt you I did I I promise you it wasnt for my math skills But whats interesting is both leading scorers been super quiet today Ive been talking about Darien Williams Hes one for seven 0 for three from three with two points But Kesi Reeves is not much better for Georgia Tech One for six 0 for four from three So other guys have done it for both teams But I I do sort of feel like when you get into winning time you need your alphas to alpha And Georgia Tech is trying to win here at NC State for the first time since November of 2019 when they won in overtime 8281 We could be headed to a similar situation Could be Well they got 13 turnovers on the game They average 137 on the season Thats the highest total in the ACC Their season high is 20 Maybe we should track that What do you think We got 154 to go and theyre 13 Are they going north of 20 turnovers Probably shouldnt suggest those questions in the current environment but its been a problem Fleming all kinds of dribbling lost the handle up ahead Breed He had it poked away by Washington Out of bounds 14 turnovers for Georgia Tech music Foul was called on Washington on the play They poked it away from Breed Yeah I mean like I said theyre competing better than theyre executing And as a coach theres no nothing more important that sometimes just playing hard is can fix a lot of problems And theyve done that today Williams trying to back it down against two defenders Had it taken away Mustaf Reeves on the run Tried to put it up on the glass and he got fouled in the process Hell go to the free throw line Darren Williams fadeaway mid post shot with two guys on him You see Carowak comes over with the help and the nice strip by Mustaf remember Mustafs father Jared quite well former Maryland Terapin NBA player music cant get away from the DNA cheering 80 from the line for Reeves this season youre watching CW courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands Damon Dynamar would like to see Reeves get going here in the second half I mentioned how brilliant he was when they almost beat Duke in Cameron He went for 23 and hes now got six today Coming off of that foot injury from last year for Reeves caused him to miss 28 games Back into the lineup and a focal point for Georgia Tech this season Williams drawing the double Mustaf was defending That was strength on strength and a foul called Second on Mustaf music and body on body Carowaks been shading helping Mentioned neither team got the bonus there in the first half Im guessing that wont be the case here NC State for the game 38 from the floor Sier trying to fend off the defender with one arm and lay it up with the other Mus the freshman from the Gambia Kurowak picks up the foul The Gambia on the northwest coast of Africa Just six of 14 for the season from the free throw line Sier and now thats five team fouls on Georgia Tech this half applause Sier had seven points against Florida State in the win on the road this week That was a season high 19 minutes off the bench for Musa Sier cheering and applause Four points in the game Knock them both down Washington They flip it around the perimeter Kelly misses Able got it back Trying to make his move against two defenders reaching foul I like the decision to attack Georgia Tech doing everything they can to play the gaps defensively but you can attack that anyway So Carowak picked up the foul for Georgia Tech his second Itll be Copen on the inbounds And thats 16 fouls now on Georgia Tech So next one NC States in the bonus Williams on the block drew the double gave it to Sane with a twist and dunk Thats what happens when you put the ball in Darren Williams hands He loves it there Doubles coming over all day long That should be available if his guys make the right cuts cuz hes looking for him That is four assists now for Williams who had five assists in the win at Florida State when he scored 20 points and also had a game high 10 boards Little bit of danger zone right now for Georgia Tech Washington Kelly got it for the Yellow Jackets They can pay for not guarding you Thats how you do it First basket for Chaz Kelly the senior from Houston Texas who spent three years in the Boston College program Hes been real quiet 47 threepoint shooter Williams in front of his own Hes woing a little bit Id like to see him woofing Get him mad Hes got five points in the game See if that gets him going Just the lone bucket of the first half for Williams Has the three here just a second ago And now Williams the peacemaker as there was some conversation after the whistle Love this interaction between Quintier Copeland and Trey Hollowman there Darren Williams with a smile on his face Hes definitely been quiet today music but we got a lot of game left Just five points so far the 21 points for Williams over the last couple He is the leading scorer on average And a lot of this is on his teammates when hes got the ball in his hands to make really good cuts sharp smart cuts He loves to find the open man Hes really too unselfish with the ball Hollowman picked up that last foul for NC State Shot clock is inside of 10 Theyre playing defense now partner cheering Mustaf on the drive and a foul called Georgia Tech refusing to go away Were going to make up for a lot of no fouls called in the first half in this one NC States got five and Georgia Tech has six 13 on the clock Both teams in attack mode Second foul on Abel Mustaf at the free throw line 69 on the season cheering Trying to get to double digits Hes got nine points so far in the game Reeves and Dongo will reenter Georgia Tech now five for 10 from the free throw line Thats not going to work They are shooting the ball well 49 from the floor for the game for Georgia Tech Just struggles at the line as that one pounced on the front rim twice 0 for three now for Mustaf from the free throw line NC State had won four in a row prior to the loss on the road last year when the teams met The pass to Williams got juggled They whistle Dungo for the foul for Georgia Tech His third Now itll be a oneonone situation now for NC State Starting to pile up both individually and team fouls now for Georgia Tech Thats something to watch Dongo getting his third Remember theyre without their freshman big man Moila Missed the last three games and he only played two minutes in the game against Miami with a high ankle sprain Those things are tricky What that means is they cannot afford Dongo getting into foul trouble And like I said hes got three First free throw of the game for Darien Williams News Nation Tuesday Katie Pav sits down with President Donald J Trump one year into his second term for a prime time music exclusive interview Dont miss Katie Pavage tonight Tuesday 109 central on the only network that is for all Americans NewsNation To find NewsNation on your screen go to newsowcom 77 of the season for Williams Hes got them both And NC State has its largest lead of the afternoon Jazz Kelly has a threepointer in this second half Reeves up and under Thats the guy you want to go to right now when you really need a bucket Like I said Alphas got a Alpha Kesi Ree with eight points Put a little style on that one Out of the corner with the response Its Arsenal for the pack Terrence Arsenal just his ninth three of the season cheering And his first points of the game Reeves at the other end extending the range free from the corner You dont want to get him going if youre NC State Rims looking a little bigger right now for Kesi Reeves Punch and counter punch Georgia Tech NC State in the second half of a fivepoint game Able misses Dango comes down with a rebound Mustaf to the rim Fleming is THERE TO LAY IT IN HE WAS FOULED Good things happen when you attack the basket Even if it doesnt go in Mustaf saw the lane created the space and the offensive rebound opportunity A guy Fleming hustling on the glass up but I get to make the decisions cuz Im the head coach And even with Trey Hollowman now back healthy hes the guy whos more of a combo guard but can certainly play the point cheering Will told us before the game hes going to stay with this strategy to keep the ball in Daren Williams hands 14 points now for Aai Fleming Williams coming off a double Double his third of the season with 20 points and 10 boards at Florida State That was the win during the week or last Saturday rather for NC State 113 to 69 with that win against the Seminals Theyve won five of their last six games Williams backing in Offensive foul as Reeves went down Well Reeves certainly accentuated the contact but I do think that was the right call You can see hes going to kind of lean in there Reeves went down like he got hit by a truck Right call though Will you dont agree I I thought for sure he would agree with me He was wondering how his players would respond after having a week off with the win last Saturday in Tallahassee Given that Georgia Tech already has 14 turnovers the fact that theyre only down by a deuce pretty good Itll be NC State basketball in that pass to a cutting read Tough to catch Thats now 15 turnovers in the game for Georgia Tech Season high is 20 Theyre seven for 11 from the fieldielder in the second half A lot of thats come in transition Copeland leads the way in scoring with 10 is the only Wolfpack player in the double digits and a foul is called as Hollowman hits the floor Both teams with Georgia Techs got 18 fouls and NC State has seven And so both in the bonus and quickly heading to the double bonus after neither of them were in the bonus in the first half NC State is 11 of 13 from the free throw line despite the protests from coach Starttomire in his third season at Georgia Tech His first win as a coach in the ACC in a conference game was right here on the CW a couple seasons ago They defeated then number seven Duke in Atlanta at the Camish Pavilion applause Back on the CW this afternoon against NC State Womens hoops tomorrow North Carolina Florida State Well be in Tallahassee for you on the CW This is just game one of CW court side Saturday Miami and Clemson to follow Both teams 5 and0 in ACC play as that one rims out for Hollow Free throws are going to be huge these last 10 and a half minutes Dongo strong move to the rim Deep post position had hollow on his bat An excellent awareness by Mustaf Four points now for Dongo playing with those three fouls Starttomires leaving him in there Really doesnt have a choice Hollowman recovers from the slip Approaching the 10minute threshold of our second half So glad that youve been with us Tom Wormy Seth Davis our outstanding CW Courtside Saturday production crew with you from Lenovo Center in Raleigh North Carolina This facility opened up back in 1999 NC State winning 70 of their games on this floor Remember when they built it the thinking was we want to have at least one more seat than the Dean Dome At the very end of the shot clock the miss from Hollowman cheering Jongo double team over top of it to Reeves LINES UP THE THREE AND KNOCKS IT DOWN Gohan Kesi Great find by Dongo Double team deep in the post cheering That was a deep three And now it is a Georgia Tech lead 5856 Right back at you with Luben Miscommunication on the switch Luben took advantage Lets fire it to the corner and Mustafa off the mark Dongo weak side got it fumbled out of bounds and that will be NC State basketball Very fortunate Dongo didnt get his fourth there That was a very aggressive offensive rebound for a guy whos got two But you see the deep post and even though even though he was deep Breeze was going up all the way with that one That gave Georgia Tech the lead momentarily as Luben laid it in 13th time this season hes gotten to double digits Georgia Tech had not led since it was ahead 3433 in the first half Were going back and forth here in the second half and tied at 58 Dongo by the way picked up his fourth on that Still in the game this cheering point You got to take him out Copeland spins and kicks Its Mc Deal misfires Dongo weak side board Hes got Cole Kiraak on the bench as his backup big Washington at the other end for Georgia Tech Hes got 13 points in the game for Lamar Washington the senior from Portland Oregon and a transfer from the Pacific Copeland at the other end Difficult shot well defended by Dongo out of bounds and Wolfpack ball Dango with those four I think Goh Steinomire has seen enough of Dongo I I dont know that hes like capable of playing passively on the at either end Very fortunate he didnt get his fifth Good recognition by Hollowman to drive it at him He comes out with four points and eight rebounds right now That is a game high for Dongo on the bench right now from coach starter Shot clock is at 10 for NC State and Cop trying to work his way in against Washington Exploit the size difference cheering Its going to be a big few minutes for Cole Carowak I think hes up for it cheering Georgia Tech by two inside of eight minutes to go in regulation Havent won here since 2019 MUSTAFA DRIVING AND SWOOPING IN Got him on the switch Jackets by four Lubman puts it on the floor and finds Copeland He cant lay it in Carowak comes in for the clearance Two straight defensive rebounds from Kiraak NC State just one of its last seven shot attempts Conversely Georgia Tech with the miss now five of their last seven Copeland Arsenal had nowhere to go on the baseline Guarded by Reeves Miss from Mcneel Volleyball out of bounds And it is Georgia Tech basketball And everything going the way of the Jackets 6258 the lead on the road for Georgia Tech on the CW on the game to North Carolina States 38 So thats really the biggest difference in the game and also Tech is plus eight on the board as I mentioned earlier this season where North Carolina State has not rebounded they are 2 and5 on the season So Georgia Tech smells a little blood in the water here Tommy would love to steal one on the road after that very poor performance in a 23point home loss to Pittsburgh in their last game McNeel picked up the foul for NC State Itll be Breed correction Breed on the foul One and one situation Georgia Tech which by the way this season is nine and two when they out rebound the cheering competition Georgia Tech is three for seven from the line so far in the second half make that four for eight Their last win was January 3rd at home Mamesh Pavilion against Boston College 6553 They held BC to 27 shooting in that game Trying to stop a threegame losing streak this afternoon at Lenovo Center Question for North Carolina State is where do you go to offensively now The two leading scorers in Paul McNeel and Darren Williams have three buckets between them 16 points now for Fleming set That leads all scorers in our game after his trip to the free throw line Luben pump fake Dango was defending and now thats four I think with a sixpoint lead and a pretty good option in Carowak maybe you take Dongo out for a few minutes so you have him for the final stretch But I dont see Damon making the move prior to arriving in Atlanta Two years as an assistant with the Boston Celtics for Coach Stomire Yeah Carowaks coming I think thats the right move As I mentioned you know Dongo really only knows one way to play Hes super strong and aggressive Plus youve got a sixpoint lead And I think Carowak can play in there If they ever get Moila back by the way theyre going to be in business because this roster was conceived to play those two bigs Reeves went high for the rebound Then he hit the deck Thats just a great rebound by your shooting guard Love it Part of being a good free throw shooting team is getting the right guys on the line So now Reeves gets to go to the line as an 80 free throw shooter Love guards who can rebound Just go up and get it And she stayed susceptible on the glass Second foul on Copeland Hell come out Williams comes in Reves at the free throw line Senior from Mon Georgia Spent two years at Florida third year technically in the Georgia Tech program for Reeves All new episodes of Trivia Pursuit are coming to the CW this Thursday To celebrate we have some trivia for you Do you know which NC State coach led the Wolfpack to the historic 1983 NCAA Championship The answer Seth only one guy Only one guy Jimmy V For more sports trivia watch Trillio Pursuit Thursday 98 central right here on the CW 102 rim Foul called against the Wolfpack Second on Breed end to end action The pace has been fast most of the afternoon with Washington at the free throw line for Georgia Tech 81 free throw shooter cheering 0 for one on the day Oh my goodness cheering You dont often see an 81 free throw shooter with an air ball from the foul line cheering Theyll let them know about it wont they One more for Washington I love these fans man cheering NC State has one of the great fan bases in the country gets that one a call 14 points Lamar Washington Washington also has three assists in the game He leads the team in that category for the year with 104 now and fourth in the conference in assists Washington who just made one of two free throws Georgia Tech shooting 53 on the day Thats going to win you a lot of ball games McNeel almost gave it up Washington pumped it away and a foul was called applause That was very close to a pick six Second on Washington I think he got him with the left hand on the rat 14 points of the game for Washington Second personal foul By the way Seth you mentioned 53 from Georgia Tech Way above their season average of 45 15th in the ACC in shooting for a year And look at that 56 for Georgia Tech from the free throw line North Carolina States identity is not at the defensive end that we know Their defense has to be just good enough but their offense has to be on point Theyve only made 39 A lot of that has to do with the way that Georgia Techs defending them With 4 and 12 minutes to go they are way below their season average in scoring as McNeel makes free throw number two Over 86 points per game for NC State this season Coach Stomires team with a 6965 lead What a way to start CW courtside Saturday This just game one Yeah this is great And you know one of the great things about this fourpoint lead for Georgia Tech is it allows Damon Style to buy some more time before he comes back with Dongo with those four fouls Both teams in this game have led by as many as eight Washington carves into the paint Luben gets a piece cheering and then a foul committed to the back court on Washington is third Nice play by Luben staying with the ball Little bit of a frustration foul when you get blocked and youre reaching in You dont want to get whistled for a foul 80 ft from the basket Luben was right there the whole time They got him on the reach the senior from Orlando Florida to the free throw line for NC State A year at North Carolina right Seth Yep A year at Notre Dame a year at Vanderbilt as a home here in Raleigh this season Both teams in the double bonus so shooting two for every foul rested away As usual the last four minutes are going to be decided at the foul line applause 12 points now for Luben 13 times this season double figures in scoring 55 times in his career for Luben One of two Remember in the preseason when we talked about Benal and Luben transferring from North Carolina he said his previous school was quote too dumb to play him He was playing this afternoon Made a play on the defensive end Now a scrap for the loose ball and the arrow will favor Georgia Tech So when we come back Georgia Tech will have the basketball It has the lead 6966 CW courtside Saturday offers 247 protection when you bundle auto home and motorcycles Learn more at progressivecom Well as we say Alphas going to alpha Kaci Reeves had a quiet first half 14 points in the second half Three for six from threepoint range to go along with two rebounds one assist here and thats only in the second half 18 for the game And weve been talking throughout the afternoon Tom especially at the top Damon Starttomires disappointment at the way his team competed at home against Pittsburgh on Thursday They had a practice where they were not on the court at all It was a skull session maybe a group therapy session clear in the air They have competed here today and they have a golden opportunity for a huge win Would be their first quad win of the season Fleming slams on the brakes Shot clock down to two Poked away Breed Georgia Tech will not get the shot away Shot clock violation Yellow Jackets Another turnover applause Its been 209 in favor of North Carolina State points off turnovers Thats been the consistent theme for Georgia Tech this season Kelly came into the game for Georgia Tech 17 total turnovers and theyre up by three on the road Doesnt happen often after trailing by one at halftime Thats what happens when youre dedicated to playing defense and just scrapping Knocked away by Kelly for a moment Copeland came up with it tried to find Luben underneath He fell down and a foul was called Thought he was in good position but nice job being in attack mode by Copeland And thats three on Mustaf Hes just one rebound away from a double double 11 points nine boards Guadir Copeland at the free throw line in game one of CW courtside Saturday Dont forget coming up right after us it is Miami on the road Little Village Little John Coliseum The Clemson Tigers Both these teams undefeating in the ACC Miami and Jay Lucas first year head coach working on a 10game winning streak as they face Brad Brownell and the Clemson Tigers Rattles out for Copeland A threepoint lead for Georgia Tech as we approach three minutes remaining in the game Were going to try to run something from Reeves here 51 shooting in the game Loop it into Dongo Triple D Nice recognition there by Washington Reeves was in the corner Got a flare screen from Mustaf It wasnt there So you throw it inside Third foul on Breed Dongo shaken up after the whistle Four points in the game Yeah hes just got four points He does have nine rebounds though And he has been the leading rebounder this season for Georgia Tech In fact 10th in the conference at almost eight per game Good to see Dongo helped up by his teammates going against Breed for NC State there Just really good recognition by Lamar Washington The play was clearly for Reeves Looked like Copeland came in with contact to the line 63 free throw shooter First trip to the line this afternoon for Dongo Georgia Tech 10 for 18 on the day 56 Had such a monster game last year when the teams played in Atlanta 29 points a careerhigh 17 rebounds cheering cheering This is a guy closing in on a thousand points for his collegiate career All right here we go One shot cheering cheering He has started every game in his Georgia Tech career and trying to finish off a road win Now six points for Dongo How about the big fella knocking both of them down Thats how you get Capone Williams And now Copeland driving to the rim against Dongo and spins off the edge Lubman grabs it Deflected right to Williams He misses side rim Georgia Tech so active on defense cheering The deflection threw off Williamss rhythm on the threepoint shot just 38 shooting as a team in the game for NC State Well below their season average of 48 fourth in the ACC Trying to get a late clock bucket now Shot clock is down to four Reeves over the top of the defense and over Luben for three FOR REEVES AND 21 POINTS for Georgia Tech and Kesi Reeves Are you kidding me Kasi Reeves Seventh time this season hes gone for 20 or more after a slow first half and he MAKES THE BLOCK OF BREED ON THE DRIVE WHAT A SEQUENCE for Reeves Hes a oneman wrecking ball right now What a basketball game What a half Just four points in the first half for Reeves Deflected into the back court Well remember when he knocked down that three early in the second half you could see a great score Once they see that first one go in its lights out Hes made four threes in the game Dongo misses Luben wrenches that one away Dongo rush dash Copelan trying TO HARNESS A THREEPOINTER AND HE DOES IT Time out ON THE COURT BUT COPELAN for NC State at 13 points this afternoon See Kesi at the end of the shot clock pulling up and putting it in He likes what he sees And then the block at the other end but Quadier Copeland music with the biggest shot of the game for the Wolfpack He has been carrying them today Hes now got 13 music Its taking him 15 shots so not hugely efficient but he also has six assists and two turnovers Copeland now two of six from threepoint distance Reeves four of 10 on threepointers And for Reeves that now gives him 165 music career threepointers The disparity in the net ranking Well this is the new ACC music Its not as weak as its been the last couple of years So this is a quadrone game for North Carolina State 10 of their last 13 games excuse me for Georgia Tech 10 of their last 13 games are quad one games So you have opportunities but youve got to close them out So for Georgia Tech to get a win like this on the road if theyre on the bubble on selection Sunday would look huge on their resume but they got to close it out and thats going to mean knocking down free throws Pressure in the back court But heres Steel Williams diving forward and a timeout called alertly Good move by Will Wade to turn up the defensive pressure right now Mustaf called it on the floor Both coaches still have music their replay challenges as well music Dont forget this just game one of CW courtside Saturday Game two features the Canes and the Tigers who are one of five ranked teams in the ACC 10 in a row for Miami Clemsons on an eightgame winning streak We saw them a couple of weeks ago get a win on the road at pit Those are two NCA tournament teams for sure Nick music Davidson playing much better for Clemson but Malik Renu what an unbelievable music find hes been for Jay Lucas squad Not surprising coming from Indiana Allconference caliber performer Should be a good one Fact Will Wade as the coach at McNe knocked Clemson out of the NCAA tournament a season ago in the first round And Cuadira Copeland was a big part of that and hes been a big part of today cheering Georgia Techs got to take care of the ball and knock down their free throws if they get there Shot clock is down to five and were inside of a minute to play in regulation Fivepoint lead Its a sevenpoint lead Beautiful clear out and the drive with the right for the lefty Lamar Washington 16 points in the game Copeland steps into a three He makes it at the other end and an immediate timeout from Will Wade Thats two clutch threes by Copelan late in this ball game and its a fourpoint difference He has been huge for them Ive loved the body language from Georgia Tech really from the getgo Even when they had that rough start Tom with all those turnovers they were still competing which coach Satire told us is something they did not do midweek in their loss against Pit at home on Wednesday 8966 Its been a week since the last game for the Wolfpack with their win at Florida State Won two in a row five of their last six seven of their last nine And Georgia Tech trying to interrupt this momentum that this Wolfpack program has built recently Seth and you know I talk about Georgia Tech getting a quad one win here potentially Well this is a quad four game for North Carolina State And they still dont have a quad one win 0 and five Quad one win defined on the road against teams 1 through 75 in the net Georgia Tech trying to stop a threegame losing streak Havent won since early January Marines on the inbounds First thing is getting the ball in bounds which is not easy to do Monster second half for number 14 in Oold Foul in the back court Washington will stride to the free throw line Georgia Tech you want Washington and Reeds on the foul line Two 80 free throw shooters Nine of 15 from the stripe in the second half for Georgia Tech Very underrated part of the game is throwing the ball in bounds My guy Jay Wright compares the inbounds passer to the holder in a football game on on a field goal as an underrated and critical part of what happens But if youre Georgia Tech you make your free throws youre going to get out of here with a win One of three in the game from the Strike cheering Washington cheering Really short applause cheering cheering cheering One more for Washington cheering Big free throw to make it a fivepoint advantage for Georgia Tech Georgia Tech youd like to play good pressure defense without fouling Force North Carolina State to work some clock How about North Carolina State roughly midway through this half had an eightpoint lead and the resolve of Georgia Tech to come back and take the lead in this one Kelly and McNeel getting tangled up I dont know if McNeel clutched his arm a little bit but thats just not a foul that you want Second foul on Chaz Kelly not least cuz hes an 81 free throw shooter NC State has been to the line a lot in the second half They are nine of 17 free throw line Both teams leaving a lot of cheese at that line With the limited amount of free throws we saw in the first half weve made up for it in the second 20 minutes applause and cheering The sophomore from Rockingham North Carolina One more free throw for Paul McNeel Jr 12 points in the game McNeel one possession game Goes back to the missed free throw by Washington If he makes that its a twopossession game Huge difference cheering and applause Fleming had it knocked away Luben Georgia Tech ball out of bounds Go right to the iPad on the sidelines I think it was the right call Yeah I think that was off Luben No challenge cheering Fourth on Copeland Washingtons going to have another shot at it Hes had one air ball one almost air ball Two of five in the game for Washington 81 coming in Winning time young fella The senior who played at the Pacific two years at Texas Tech playing in his 112th career game 17 points for Washington Greens leading the way with 21 and the free throw from Washington Two possession game Dont forget Miami and Clemson coming up next game two of CW courtside Saturday when we cheering are through here in Raleigh One of two Fourpoint game and 30 seconds to go Three bounces out for McNeel Mustaf for the rebound and he is fouled for NC State I just dont think you need to rush a threepointer in that situation Plenty of time Drive to the bucket Get your two You know theyre playing for the three Its a double double for Mustaf His 10th rebound New careerhigh in rebounds for Gustaf at the free throw line cheering applause Hes now 0 for four from the line cheering 14 of 25 in total for Georgia Tech for the strike cheering 16 of 25 for the game for NC State from the free throw line Pistons cheering and the turnovers are doing everything they can to give the game away NC State hasnt wanted it Copeland trying to get to the rim Had it knocked away He hits the floor Batted around and taken by Washington and Luben HAS TO FOUL HIM 148 SECONDS to go Unbelievable defense by Lamar Washington The deflection and then the rip He just wanted that ball more than anyone else on that court And so frustrating for NC State not to get a shot attempt after the misses from the free throw line at the other end for Georgia Tech I mean is this college basketball or what NC State wins its previous game by 44 points the largest margin of victory in an ACC road game in program history Georgia Tech loses to a Pittsburgh squad that was winless in the ACC by 23 points at home And Tech is about to steal this one in Raleigh and potentially get its first win on the road this season NC State also made 19 threepointers last Saturday in the enormous win at Florida State That tied a school record Today theyve shot 38 in total 52 shooting for Coach Dtomires team cheering Unreal Two more misses We are not done Williams trying to find a teammate Were down to six seconds Miss McNeel Luben back out Copeland got it AWAY AND THATLL DO IT GEORGIA Tech with the road win in Raleigh 7874 over NC State Yellow Jackets showed more fight Thats all that happened today Like this
