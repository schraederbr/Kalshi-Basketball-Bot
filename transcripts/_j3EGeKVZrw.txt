red shirt yeah playing a lot of minutes and obviously anytime you talk about Nigel Pac a guy that has final four experience one of the best guards in college basketball huge blow for this Miami team Miami with the basketball as they win the tip Brandon Johnson out of Matthew Cleveland Florida State transfer Here Comes AJ State McCrae for three and the week side rebound by Lyn kid hes a focal point and thats his favorite shot but jump hook in the lane yeah one of the better rebounders in college basketball thats going to be key when we spoke with Earl Grant he said we must identify L kid on both ends defensive and offensive class DC starting five as you see Fred Payne is in the lineup making his first career start for Dion Brown who is sick as Chad venning is Off the Mark here comes Miami State McCrae strong to the hoop and thats what they want to do they want to force things on the Baseline when we asked Earl Grant keys to the game number one was control the pace in particular keep Miami out of transition thats what they want to do Bill Courtney six years as the head man at Cornell three seasons as associate head coach a lengthy resume with Jim Lena and they remain excellent friends and he said it was bit of a depressing time for him in the first 24 hours but coach L said make it your own team as ly kid takes it to the hoop on Chad Benning Miamis off to a great start yeah this is a great start if youre Miami on the road against Boston College theyve gotten the ball in the paint and then theyve gotten out in transition our first foul is against Miami as patris calls it but Lin kid strong yeah and thats a matchup they are going at early on they feel like Len kid they can uh identify him put him in the post isolate him now boson is going to have to make a decision do you bring some help and double or dig foul is against Matthew Cleveland J Josh Beetle throws it away Beetle the Clemson transfer as Earl Grant is in his fourth year some pensive moments for him in the first 90 seconds of this one and youc five and three at home theyre coming off a win over Fairley Dickinson you see the record of Grant he was effective at the college of Charleston and know he keeps telling us that its a build job here its a rebuild job he feels like he needs to fertilize this program as he saids yeah but nice job last year again nit performance put a guy Quinton Post in the NBA get some minutes for the Golden State Warriors and so again he is certainly capable of doing it Cleveland in transition and venting the rebound you can see early on what Miami wants to do make or Miss they want to get up and down in transition and push the pace Miami can score and they can shoot theyre averaging 79 points per game 49 from the field that hasnt been the problem defensively problematic and a deflection of the Fred Payne shot well off the mark one of the areas Earl Grant talked with us about was they needed more production from the point guard spot again thats something hes still trying to figure out whos going to be the leader of this team from that position and its showing early on right now Miami much better flow offensively Boston College really uh has not had any flow offensively whatsoever early on in this game AJ State McCrae transferred from sford hes averaging seven points he hit that last shot Beetle knifing through the lane and BCs off the schneide yeah nice job that time by Beetle playing off two feet Miamis been aggressive early defensively in the passing Lanes theyre going to have to do that to soften up this defense somebody make an individual play to try to break down the Miami defense deep three Brandon Johnson East Carolina transfer and its tipped up and in Benning had trouble with position with Lin kid who gets credit for the hoop yeah and thats been the problem right now ly kid really has had his way on of the offensive glass again thats twice now hes just speeding of vending to the spot and getting the offensive rebound Elijah strong with a Miss as its Miami ball Lyn kid the transfer from Virginia Tech 11 newcomers so certainly Miami feeling out process for them theyre still trying to find their way as I mentioned on the defensive end you forget that they were in the final four two years ago M well again it thats just the nature of college sports now I think the biggest thing though without Nigel pack one of the best guards in college basketball a guy that was part of that final four he is been banged up and certainly they are a different team without him on the court and some substitutions for the U with Jaylen Blackman on the floor along with Joe who hoists the three and hes got it so Miami with the 11point lead they are scintillating from the field 67 and its just simple basketball right there just dribble Drive on the Baseline help is late and then he kicked it to a wide open threepoint shooter in the corner Kelly with a good pass to Chad Applause fenning thats a nice post entry pass that time by Chaz Kelly thats an area Earl Grant sta feel like they can get the ball into paint they want to take advantage of their size Advantage with vening in particular yeah theyre going to need multiple paint touches he told us that when we spoke to him he thinks for them to be effective they need to drive get multiple paint Brandon Johnson the Up and Under Benning on the Baseline as the clock goes up John gaffy veteran official calls the shot clock violation and that will bring us to our first media timeout well Miami right now executing in the half court in transition up early in this game 134 on Boston College Music total is 2650 to Scientific Innovative away life science movs for every pointer that make this season Savings Bank will donate 10 to the John M Mary boys and girls love of human thank you back for giving back to our local community today the donation total is 1820 saing always you member FBI and of opposing player misses two consecutive free throws today he win a free Shack burger at shake the next time in opposing players at the line we want to hear you explanation on that so its going to be Miami ball coming out of this uh time out kid here you go Malcolm just what the doctor ordered that mini jump hook how do you defend it theyre going to have to double as simple as that uh right now uh that is the matchup that has been a problem and he is just having his way uh too easy right now Miami over 60 from the floor venning forced it on the Baseline and here comes the U Joe Bay for Blackman lets see if Miami goes back at Len kid give him a touch Blackman and out of bounds off of BC and number three in Orange is Jalil Bea who is one of the best recruits in the country Miamis highest ranked recruit ever Pennsylvania Gatorade State player of the year last year there was some thought he might be a one and done and he has the ball now with a jumper but hes he can be explosive yeah some NBA Scouts here at this game specifically to watch him and youre right he is a guy that many think is going to be a oneand done good pass by hand to Applause venning Chad venning with four of the six for the Eagles Boston College has already made the adjustment looks like theyre going to go and double now on Len kid thats McFarland in the game for the Eagles a three off the line McFarlands got the rebound hes from Southeast Louisiana as Earl Grant had to compensate he lost four terrific players including Jaden zacher whos now playing at Clemson and Deon mcglockton whos at Vander yeah really again erl Gren has done a phenomenal job recruiting but retaining guys and thats just the nature right now that were in but he says he likes this group that he has as we take a look at another though transition bucket by Miami thats on Elijah strong for the n one opportunity for Joe Bay and this right here again great defense by Cleveland one of the better defenders in the ACC and then again theyre going to get out in transition thats great body control and one again transition D was at the top of the list for Earl Grant when we spoke with him coming into this game defending my Miami look theyre going to play Fast theyre going to shoot a lot of threes and put you in a lot of ball screen actions but early on right now too theyve got to figure out L Applause kid and Miami had some spirited practices since Jimena resigned six days ago Bill Courtney told us he loved the energy they had he thought it was very productive they pack practice yesterday before leaving for Boston Here Comes DM Brown into the BC lineup hes been good in the last three games he also was battling an illness all week did not practice which is why he didnt start yeah he has been really good for uh Boston College you talked about it his last four games in double digits averaging 11 points per game but right now uh Miami is having their way in the paint they have just a really shot at a high percentage mainly because theyre just getting quality looks and theyre having trouble BCs having trouble getting the ball in bounds as Joe Bay has given Miami instant energy Off the Bench yeah this right here again thats just careless turnover again pressure again if youre Boston College this is where the organization comes in earol Grant talked about it whos going to step up and man that point guard position get guys organized right now Miami pressuring giving them now some full court pressure Chaz Kelly start of the year as the Eagle Point Guard here comes Dion Brown breaks the pressure for Elijah strong dous glasswork and the Eagles draw the foul Well Done by Roger McFarland heres next Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header Clemson host Florida State the Stars off at 2 Eastern then North Carolina and NC State Square Off in Raleigh finally Virginia Tech takes on Cal should be an out standing afternoon and evening of Hoops on acc Network so a rugged start to the new year for BC as they continue to search for an identity 0 and2 in the ACC Miami conversely in their last 22 games is 4 and 18 and their last 14 games against the power of four opponent theyve lost all 14 bethia oh that was special thats why hes a Pro Prospect jalile bethia draws an n one well you know the talent is there this right here though this is a big time finish and one eyes on the rim the entire time my goodness through three the body control and then the touch that is just a big time move by a player that the coaching staff when they talk about him uh they said look he is just a special young man they see the talent uh they see the flashes obviously hes a young player but theres a reason why there are some scouts at this game hes just that talented more issues for BC and just erratic Malcolm trying to get the ball in bounds they look like theyre totally off kilter yeah and again you know both these coaches talked about obviously starting off of the new year right and certainly when you get into ACC play getting off to fast starts is important in particular if youre the away team and thats what Miami has done theyre the more energetic team right now and thats a big time pullup by Matthew Cleveland and again Boston College has not had many answers for them early on in this game Donald Hs been quiet follows on LY kid thats his first but hand clearly is the focal point for BC on offense with 20 9 against Fairley Dickinson the game on Saturday a game the Eagles won expected hand to be a big time addition he got hurt Tes ACL has come back nicely but DC needs him to score yeah they do and you know you look at these numbers points in the paint right now 14 for Miami only six for Boston College thats something Earl Grant talked about look we need to be the team thats better in the paint wow that was scary as State McCrae went down hard Dion Brown also down as he tries to come back from an illness and looks a little woozy getting up yeah that was a scary fall glad to see both of these young men get up right here yeah again thats that could have been a lot worse so fortunate both those guys are okay thunderous for both of them as they hit the deck with brown at the line Dion Brown another focal point of this BC offense coming over from Maryland Baltimore County with 12 points per game in his last three Applause outings Bill Courtney good start for him 7 and a half minutes into the game great talking him I love his attitude hes extremely boisterous says he has a little bit more energy and might bring a little bit more of a celebratory nature to the locker room well again theres a lot to play for again we are uh just starting of the new year so plenty of basketball will be played and hes got to be pleased with how his team has come out and responded to start off the new Applause year BC Ball but an active Miami defense thats Austin Schwarz 23 and orange Schwarz coming off their bench showing some good hustle hes a 64 freshman from Concord North Carolina well right now again theyre just the quicker more energetic team to start this game off Miami its as simple as that defensively theyve made it really difficult for Boston College and then offensively right now theyre shooting uh close to 60 59 in this game they just getting better looks Dion Brown tightly guarded by Schwarz thats a foul on Austin Schwarz and all the families impacted by this right now though John in this game Miami both ends defensively theyve made it difficult eight points off of turnovers in this game weve already talked about the high percentage looks theyre getting now B just going to have to match their energy on both ends Deon Brown and hand could not tip it in a noticeable hungry Miami team Matthew Cleveland with his first bucket of the game and Cleveland is a huge part for them he is uh really been the guy last game 19 points for them and a loss but his offensive Improvement started his career off at Florida State now been at Miami and thats what hes known for right there one of the better defenders in college basketball because of his great length and shy got a good look McFarland tracks it down here comes hand through a double team and somehow got it done yeah lot of contact that time but Han continues to go through it strong move and finish with the left he Eagles manto man theyll switch up throughout the game kid boy he is eating on New Years Day Lyn kid in double figures he has not missed five for five yeah he has just been so consistent right now leaves the ACC 68 coming into this game from the floor that number may go up he has really been unguardable uh early on and Miami fighting and Blackman wins the rebound deep three Cleveland Kelly tries to keep it alive good hustle and he does for Jaden Hastings red sh freshman Hastings out of Orlando averaging three and a half points at nine in the BC loss to SMU good pass hting in the post yeah beautiful find that time by Chaz Kelly and I think thats going to be the guy again he started off the year as their starting point guard theyre going to need more of that from Chaz Kelly again nice read that time off the high pick and roll you you mentioned it BC looking for a quarterback of this offense searching for a point guard to stabilize Cleveland calling for a goal and this right here again has been the problem in this game ly kid they have no answer the double has to come quicker hes just making a quick move then on the other end right here again Chaz Kelly getting out of that high pick and roll thats a beautiful pass and finish by Hastings but it has been really all Miami and it looks like its going to be an N1 situation right here yep Roger McFarland the foul is first with Cleveland at the line now they take that back now theyre saying its a two shot foul so again they did not call basket interference on that 915 to go in the first half Boston College triling 17 and now you got to be mindful the full court pressure has given them some problems lets see if uh Miami continues to extend yeah theyre going to continue to pick up full Applause Kelly on UG chuku and passes arrive good idea as Hastings was open on the left block well Earl Grant talked with us this uh morning and then yesterday after their practice about being patient offensively look Miami wants to push the pace you see that says we have to use a lot out of shck and be patient make them defend but Miami doing a good job speeding up Boston College forcing them in either turnovers or some quick shots kid on Hastings Nifty and patris calls a foul officiating crew of John Gaffney patris and Tommy marsy one of the better crews in the country yeah veteran crew and really I think things stand out the struggles Boston CS early on offensively getting into their sets and then this guy right here Len kid really has been the he hasnt missed tells the story doesnt it yeah he has not missed and you know right now cing into coming into this game seventh in college basketball at 68 and leads the ACC in field goal percentage and hes just efficient coach courton talked with us about he knows who he is he asked him why but hes so efficient he said look hes not out there trying to shoot threes hes a guy that wants to get on the low block and turn to his left or right shoulder with the short jump Hooks and thats what he works on and hes a hard worker hes always in the gym Ving for Applause Kelly you see three assists and five turnovers and the double team blocked by Kid terrific defense defense by the Virginia Tech transfer Johnson Oru in transition Isaiah Johnson Oru loses it and this right here just great recovery on defense uh by Kid you talked about on the other end his offensive efficiency he brings that Rim protection for them and you know right now Boston again team thats so aggressive in the passing Lane try to get some back door cuts and you got to be a good screening team to free up guys in Miami meba defense swarming BC Brown kid deflects the rebound jayen Blackman kid trying to back in now they double Blackman thought about the three uku takes Music it Kelly and stolen by Matthew Cleveland Cleveland former ACC Sixth Man of the Year over zealous on the break but Miami has never trailed as they lead by Donald hand to inbound Luca Taves on the floor for BC he has the basketball Taves a freshman from Tokyo cousin of Jonathan Taves the Great Chicago black Applause off and hes hounded in fouled by uku thats his first Divine uku sixth on the team uku from Sugarland Texas and Earl Grant during that timeout what do you think he went over well he went obviously uh made a lineup change gotting a into the game I think the biggest thing handling Miamis pressure right now theyre just being very aggressive on the ball and then into passing Lanes zenning St Bonaventure transfers second Team all Atlantic 10 last year and hes a load hes a tough cover isnt he he is and I think right now I like what venns doing hes trying to work before Len kid gets the ball push him out further dont let him catch the ball so close to the Applause basket Cleveland pass to maneuver around hand and Benny has it thats bake BCs defensive possession of the game agreed uh they pushed uh Len kid outside didnt let him catch it and then they were over the ball screens and then they finish it off with the defensive rebound Ving basine into a double and a foul its on Lyn kid thats the second on kid and this is what Earl Grant wanted when we talked to him paint touches he wanted to get the ball whether its in venning or off the bounce a do not settle for jumpers uh again uh great offense by Boston College getting the ball into the paint and then on the other end but theyre going to need more defensive possessions like that uh to try to slowly get back into this game Ving 65 from the line he sees 74 as a team as he banks it in womens basketball takes over the ACC Network every Thursday starting tomorrow we have a double header that starts at six Seas with Virginia Tech hosting Florida State then Stanford takes on SMU at 8 Eastern and five Pacific so it also starts on the defensive and Miami has not had a field goal in four and a half minutes yeah they have and I like the change up right here by Earl Grant now theyre going a little full court pressure lets see what they drop back into and he did mention they may potentially do some Zone against this Miami team try to change up defenses Brandon Johnson played in East Carolina the last three years Taz strong two strong with the three up for grabs Miamis got it Bia Applause Joe Bay has been terrific Off the Bench bethia and strong engulfs it a great block out that time by Donald Han junor Taves good take Benning the put back Benning has a six to nothing run with eight points so its Chad venning 6 BC or Miami nothing and what has happened during this stretch I think the energy from Boston College has picked up they break that run right there a scoring Dr of 340 for the U after the uku M then backs in and hes got another one he is hot with 10 points and five rebounds and much better patience that time by Boston College again they swung the ball left to right and they still want to go into the paint with venning hes got a clear size Advantage but that cannot happen right there thats twice now uuku twice breaking down the BC defense two freshman point guards going at it Tays got to do a better job keeping his body in front of Applause him good blow by by uku hes averaging Five Points and then another another one for the industrious Chad venny he wants the ball in the post and HEC is trying to get it to him grown man move right here by benting uh this is twice take the contact and one Boston College though still trailing Music Music here today the rules are simple if we e those pearly whites lets see them Im there you go see that sound like youre having fun of the game come on now L this afternoon smile Music let go lets go all right thanks very much Taylor looking forward to the halftime show Luke Hancock played two years for Jim Lena at George Mason so he knows just how good a coach he was yeah Luke could flat out shoot that ball as well too as we talk about Coach L and again first time since 2011 he has not been the head coach of the University of Miami and you look at his career wins what he has done every stop whether George Mason Miami Bowling Green all he has done is win and Coach Courtneys got a great story too about when he was a young assistant coach his first impression with him Coach L flew him out as we take a look at another nice drive by the Freshman uku has been really good but he said you know back then when I was first starting off the recruiting budgets werent that great coach L flew him out thought he was going to be staying in the hotel but no he stayed at his house and he said part of it was they woke up the next morning and played two on two against his sons so they lost that game but it was mainly because coach L was not playing any defense thats how he says but uh hes been connected with him ever since and really said hes learned so much from coach L that was a great story and Coach L said he was exhausted he said it was just time and the three so teams are matching buckets now AJ State McCrae started quickly first bucket in a while for him Miami has hit two of 11 threes Taz in the lane gets blocked and got it for BC venning rare Miss as he has scored the last 11 BC points Johnson with a travel Brandon Johnson turnover but Divine uku has been Divine yeah this is been three times now again hes been great off of a high ball screen right there really just a rub screen and thats a tough finish Ive been impressed with his body control and Poise and right here Taves thought he had a clear layup out of nowhere the block thats great team defense uh by Miami but thats evident by their five blocks BC has zero my only averaging three blocks per game so you talked about their help defense and their weak side defense thats been aggressive it really has and Boston colle though has settled into this game theyve done a nice job slowing the pace down Eagles Trail by as many as 19 Beetle for Elijah strong called an X Factor by ero Grant they need him to be effective shot clock violation Miami ball and thats that swarming defense again giving BC issues yeah right now again they got to be better in the doubles Miami again they just been aggressive point of attack and then theyre pressuring the point guard and then theyre aggressive in the pass Lanes anytime the ball goes into the paint theyre doubling so you got to be good out of the double teams in which youre passing if youre Boston Applause College uku rare slowing the pace theyve been running gun State McCrae Johnson spinning in the lane and a foul on the eagles they got Fred Payne Applause right here again pretty good defense up by Boston College again try to contest just could not finish the play off and got him right on the arm afterwards uh 15 foul the First on pay Blackman and Payne has the rebound Here Comes Luca Taves cut off of the Baseline by uguk group waning stages of the first half its been all Miami first game since the retirement of Jim Lena good pass Taves to Hastings oh that was pretty beautiful pass by Taves and the coaching staff really thats what they talk about with Taves his passing they know hes going to be very good for them and they need his production now now in particular from that point guard position hes a natural point guard hes played his whole life Cleveland on hand five to shoot and out of bounds off Miami so BC energized and its starting on the defensive end but this also helps their CA right here beautiful no look pass by Taves out of that double team again hes handled the pressure and he has been really solid for Earl Grant Off the Music Bench Tes the handle in the lane McFarland but he Applause traveled so the turnover is mounting for the Eagles thats the ra the only good thing about that one again its not a live ball turnover where theyre going off uh in transition afterwards Miami with nine points off those eight turnovers a lot of that though was Len kid lets see the adjustments that Boston College makes I think the biggest thing coach Courtney talked about it is the energy theyre going to have to match the energy that Miami has had in this game and Chad venning part of that BC surge late in the half with six field goals but a turnover for the Eagles goes out of bounds BC with venning and strong in the front Court Josh Beetle Fred pay Donald Han in the back court inbound by Cleveland is stolen Miami has link kit up front Brandon Johnson State McCrae UGA chuku and Matthew Cleveland thats a great job reading The Scouting Report by Benning on that out of bounds underneath he knew exactly where they were going he read it and is able to come up with the Ste then on the other end Donald H Jr we talked about it at the tip as we take a look at the turnover Donald H player to week in the ACC last week and he continues to play well for Earl Grant right here through contact thats a nice finish to start the second half yeah hes become a much more effective driver and how about that story theyve been giving out that award since 1972 first time a fatherson won it in league history Donald hen senior a terrific career in Charlottesville and Donald H is the first guy in the gym every morning at 630 Earl Grant says hes putting up shots and heres another one but pounded by the defense thats great defense by Miami mainly theyre doubling venning quick so venning is going to have to be better passing out of the double team make a quicker decision three state McCrae Payne wins it Josh Beetle and the Nifty layup for beetle in transition the Clemson transfer just like that its down to single digits Applause BC has never LED Miami from Pillar To Post in the first half the decisive Edge and theres Lin kid in the Baseline if he gets hot its problematic for BC kid has 13 he get a double double against number one Tennessee with 14 and 12 and again Boston College chose not to double team that time strong awkward but fighting for the rebound and patris calls a foul its on AJ State McCrae but the Eagles are running the floor well arent they yeah the energy has picked up started with their defense and it this right here nice finish by Beetle I think a big theme in this second half both teams really but uh in particular for Boston College vening is going to have to be good out of the double team and theyre doubling soon as the ball goes down to him in the post theyre not waiting but running at him and doubling trying to get the ball out of his hands I think on the other end Boston College is going to have to do the same theyre going to have to double Len kid also strong with his first point of the game and hes been quiet the last couple he only had two against fair Dickinson in 23 minutes the 68 sophomore from Charlotte Myers Park High School its averaging 10 and a half points and five rebounds but B Grant says hes one of their ex factors they need him to play well yeah they definitely need his offense right now Earl Grant changing up to defense picking up call full court pressure Fred Payne and a foul so pay made his first career start for Dion Brown who is dealing with an illness the energy has changed in the first half Miami was the more energetic team and the second half to started off Boston College has matched that and a big reason why theyre on this run and the game is back down to single digits of the the energy I can tell you right now Earl Grant definitely talked to them about matching the energy that Miami had in that first half it was noticeable it was a hungrier Miami team in the first half the numbers on pain BC is three and one and hes scoring 10 plus ECs already forced three turnovers this half after four force in the first half so Eagles Trail by as many as 19 points that was at the 838 Mark of the first half and look out Brandon Johnson blows the layup Here Comes Donald H for the Eagles the three rims out kid wins the 5050 good Hustle by link kid Jalil bethia highest ranked recruit Miami history another turnover by the U and a foul on Miami they got the crowd back in the game and a noon start you know probably when you played probably didnt enjoy starting at noon I I was never a fan of the noon games but right here excellent defense Again by Boston College and theyve been able to get out in transition get some easier opportunities before this Miami defense can get set up is that just a product of not only New Years Day at noon but also just getting out of bed and going to shoot is that a problem well I think everythings off right you dont have a shoot around youre typically used to shoot around as you take a look at a nice pick and roll Soft Touch by Benning and I think again slow starts obviously always a concern a lot going on but they have really uh responded if youre Earl Grant you have to be pleased with how your team started this second half Miami playing without Nigel pack again hes out with a left foot injury he would be a St stabilizing influence hes their best player preseason First Team all ACC but Matthew Cleveland says hey you know what I can shoot too and he continues to play well his last two games uh hes averaging 22 points per game over 56 from the floor excellent offense that time by Miami Cleveland has nine he averages 11 pain through the double team and an N1 Applause well this right here again a breakdown by Miami not there playr contact and one and Errol Grant talk with us about that again they didnt werent able to do that to start the game off but he said look we need to get paint touches whether its off the bounce or getting venning involved in the offense with some post touches so the threepoint play play completed by the Houston native Fred Payne BC with 28 paint points they average 32 huge part of their game plan is you to emphasize Jo Bay is bumped to the ground Paul joob B gave them a lot of quality minutes off the bench in the first half at the Third on Elijah strong Miami scored 41 points in the first half here last year 41 here today bethia hell go to the line thats on Chad venning first on venning well in the screen and row watch what venning does again he drops and not up hedging and a lot of body right there and thats what theyre going to continue to do put a venning in a lot of ball screens and uh draw him away from the basket see if hes able to get out and slide with some of these wings and guards Miami 80 from the line thats first in the ACC Roger McFarland back in the lineup for the foul play Elijah strong McFarland averaging six points and five and a half rebounds two misses by bethia but the followup rebound by Cleveland and Benning got a piece of it Beetle and hes got it Coast to coach for Josh Beetle there has been a energy shift in this game beetle in transition and one opportunity right now Boston College on the roll FS on uuku before the break as Beetle rims it out you see that BC has never LED it how about this second half BC 406 to score 15 points in the first half it took him more than 13 minutes to score 15 points2 Applause foul on Chad Benning is second tomorrow night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double hitter the nothing but NE crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend weve got you covered all season on acc Network and the ESPN app and watch the battle between vending and this guy right here Len kid uh vending trying to push him out away from the basket Applause out of bounds on BC Joe Bay and Roger McFarland were fighting for it Miami Music wins Miami 14 straight losses dating back to last year against Power four opponents they one and eight in their last nine games coming off a loss to Mount St Marys in overtime at home good Hustle by Lyn kid keeping it alive Austin Schwarz in the game for Miami kid trying to back in pass to Cleveland and hes got it watch his strong inside Presence by Matthew Cleveland Inside Out game and thats a heads up play by kid again hands thinking hes going to shoot this so hes trying to block out right here Cleveland he thinks hes shooting it thats a pass heads up play by kid and one and much needed bucket for Miami to stop this run by Boston College Matthew Cleveland 12 points one of two hurricanes and double figures kid has 13 Donald has mcquire with four points why is that happen well I think credit Miami again theyve not uh really allowed many swings or reversals of the ball in that first half and then right here again H thats what he does best though again uh they loosen up this defense of Miami because of transition points and then the dribble drives this is a great skip Court pass and in hand again we talked about how well hes been playing himself to the free throw line foul was on Paul Joe Bay yeah hes a slasher dribble Drive artist Donald Han from Virginia Beach and he has five points and leading the Eagles 153 also underrated aspect of his game rebounding 7 and a half rebounds in the last two games and S and a half overall for the season yeah hes got great size 65 strong frame and and really hard to find somebody playing better over the last two games everything 26 points per game shooting a high percentage from the floor hes eighth in the ACC and rebounding Maxim Reno of Stanford whos having a terrific year leads the ACC in rebounding and thats a bad foul by Benny y again hes reaching hes already got ly out by the threepoint line no need to go for the skill there he did a great job pushing him away but hes too important for what Boston College wants to do again youre going to take a look look this has been a battle all game again hes done a nice job if hes going to catch it after threepoint line youve done your job just dont want to go and go for a steal right there tough break for Boston College and he exits with three fouls Hastings in and what a dunk by Matthew Cleveland OH he shook the foundation yeah he does so much Cleveland again hes got great length great positional size can play really one through four and showing off the Hops right there on the loose ball excellent career at Florida State for Leonard Hamilton beetle Hastings the rebound tries to keep it alive Farland Steel by Paul Jo Bay put back is good by Cleveland Cleveland has been an instant Energizer on the offensive end he has 16 points and John back to my earlier point in the first half Miami is so aggressive in the passing Lanes you got to be either a ex screener or get some back door Cuts cuz theyre just shooting the gaps trying to come up with steals or deflections pain the Deep three Blackmans got the rebound for the you Cleveland 10 and a half Seas ey 24 against Presbyterian one know there are four wins as Beetle tries to punch it away off of BC and look at this right here again you got to know theyre trying to shoot the Gap right there ball fake get a back door cut thats just great anticipation and aggression in the passing Lane by Miami but on the other end if youre Boston C you got to know theyre shooting the gaps now you either got to get back door Cuts or set better screens you see 12 turnovers per game they have 10 Miami has made a commitment on the defensive end from the jump Jaylen Blackman for Brandon Johnson who was quiet in the first half out of bounds Miami ball with five to shoot great job of beetle that time giving up a lot of size fighting that time into post almost came up with a steal Cleveland and thats a shot clock violation turnover against the U their ninth turnover yeah great defensive pressure that time by Boston College again knew it was a short shot clock didnt wow thats the key thing and then able to come up with a change of possession its Elijah strong and Jaden Hastings in the BC front court with Fred Payne playing the one Josh Beetle and Roger McFarlin who has the ball in the back court put back by Hastings is good Hastings has been solid of for Earl Grant Off the Bench obviously Ving in foul trouble thats great work though on the offensive Blass they think Hastings is going to be terrific player mymg by way of Orlando Schwarz for three Johnson still up for grabs and pay wins the 5050 Here Comes BC Elijah strong hop skipping a jump and the reverse great transition offense and strong nice job that time not settling for a jumper excellent transition offense by Boston College impressive agility by the big fella but Jo Bay the blow by did the hard part and he missed the bunny Beetle for McFarland Balls moving quickly but its out of bounds off the Eagles so Miami is Led from the jump and theyre frustrated made it Erol Grant and staff deserve a lot of credit but hes just continued to get better certainly putting up some really good numbers of this season for Boston College and has been neutralized for the most part by this rugged Miami defense as kid backs in on Jaden Hastings hes playing for Chad venning whos on the bench with three points venning leads the eagles with 17 Luca tavs back in the lineup as the point guard DC is out scor the U 21 to 12 in the second half strong backing in on Johnson well done and this has been a game of the paint and neither team really shooting threes uh Boston College one of eight from three 133 Miami three of 16 19 only four total threes made but both teams continue to attack the paint closest the scor has been since it was nothing to nothing when they tipped it Applause off kid three to shoot in the paint out of bounds Johan gy looking for help from patris officials and I think theyre going to go take a look at it important possession right here and I think the key thing with that possession what Boston College did Len kid took a jump Hook from the foul line and it looks like theyre going to reverse it now and just call it Boston College Ball but Boston College again in particular ass doing a great job pushing kid away from the basket dont let him catch it not letting him catch it on the Block he went out of bounds off Brandon Johnson whos been held scoreless in 20 minutes he 0 for seven from the floor strong too strong with the three Divine uku to LY kid and a takeway by BC excellent double team that time and then on the backside the help side was there came up with a deflection you can see the adjustment Boston College has made defending kid foul on Miami thats on Johnson is second hecs had trouble defending in the second half but not the case today those numbers tell a glaring story yeah I mean its really been lopsided uh and today really has been a really different story I think in particular of the threepoint field goal percentage theyve done a nice job defending the threepoint line something Earl Grant talked to us about his keys to the game defending Miami obviously transition D and then defending the threepoint line Miami really has not been a factor in that area three of 16 19 from the threepoint line strong trying to tie it up hes 71 from the line and they are tied for the first time since it was z0 you see checking divine uku full court Luca Taves who went to the Newman school right down the road in Boston excelled there Austin Schwarz each side board by Roger McFarland hit from the Eagles McFarland in the lane could not sustain Schwarz had numbers but hell take it and hell make it Well Done In transition by Austin Schwarz a breakdown though by Boston C nobody stopped the ball he just kept going nobody stepped over to stop the ball and heads up play Miami averaging 79 points per game McFarland the three and hes got it this your first BC lead of the ball game at the 846 Mark and thats all set up by Luca Taves thats a beautiful pass thats the hockey assist right there broke down to D extra pass off his beautiful skip Court pass ly kid no good but a foul but lucaas has been a presence hasnt he yeah really solid minutes off the bench again thats all set up by his dribble Drive skip Court pass and then unselfish play led to a wideopen three excellent offense that time in the half court by Boston College fouls on Jaden Hastings his first with link kid at the line Amys first game without Jim Lena who retired on December 26th heres next Saturdays ACC Networks mens basketball triple header Clemson host Florida State to start us off at two Eastern in North Carolina and NC State Square Off finally Virginia Tech takes on C should be a terrific afternoon and evening of Hoops on acc Network Applause Luca Taves with the ball in a tie ball game right now Miami in zone again change up a defense theyve been mainly a manto man in this game and they go Zone in Boston College patient berris a three that is Boston Colleges third three of this game good look for Fred Payne he took advantage of it he has 11 points AJ State McCrae is doubled and McFarland FL him in the post and I think the key thing with that is he kept it in play Hastings didnt block it out of bounds hot pass by BC in the turnover but Fred the era oh that has been a question mark for them whos going to step up and give them quality minutes from the point L guard position Taves has been really solid for him off the bench Applause today Cleveland the hand off for Schwarz guarded by Fred Payne Cleveland from the elbow how about Fred Payne aggressive off the glass yeah I think again theyve done a nice job contesting shots and then keeping Miami continuing to keep them off the offensive glass Miami 26 shooting in the second half strong couldnt handle the pass by T Cleveland blocked by Jaden Hastings but Blackman gets Applause it just joining us BC Trail by 19 points with 838 left in the first half theyve LED for 3 minutes and 19 seconds theyve capitalized on a 34 15 second half scoring margin Miamis 0 for six for the last shots from the field and theres pain on the blow VI well Miami is going to have to adjust right now Boston College are getting down the lane just too easy Nic Farland this steel largest lead of the game for the Eagles thats a heads up play by McFarland again could have easily thrown a lob good decision to pull it back out Taves taken away by Joe Bay Here Comes Matthew Cleveland bumped by Fred Payne and a foul second on pain but previous time down Luca Taves impressive yeah watch how he plays on this ball screen Earl Grant talked about this he wants his guards to fight over the top of the screen when theyre playing that drop coverage Taves doesnt nice job not getting beat on that ball screen they call it bullying bullying up over that screen forcing the defender out as opposed to right down the lane excellent defense that time by Luca one andone opportunity for Cleveland womens basketball takes over the ACC Network every Thursday starting tomorrow we have a double header that starts at 6 Eastern with Virginia Tech hosting Florida State and Stanford against SMU all starts at 8 Eastern five Pacific on accn Cleveland has put together a nice afternoon 18 points five of five from the threepoint free uh free throw line and uh he just continues to impress me with his defense again he is one of the better Defenders not just in the ACC but in college basketball former ACC sixth men of the Year Florida State strong ill advised shot Miami slows the pace with Austin Schwarz step back three yes sir that was nice and the difference on that ball screen a no fight over uh he steps back into a three thats a tough step back jumper by Schwarz and the Eagles called timeout so Austins comeback was two years ago at Clemson when they Trail by 23 and one the game but right now some anxious moments for both teams yeah I think its going to start with your offensive execution obviously turnovers that was an issue in the first half where Boston College cant turn it over and then transition defense to try to keep Miami if youre Boston College out of transition defense reminder the Cal at pit coming up next on accn and the bank free by Josh Beetle how do you like that well he pointed over at somebody Im not sure he called glass on that but Earl Grant and staff will take it if youre Miami again no need really to rush Id still go and give Len kid a touch try to see if you can get him reestablished in the post Cleveland doubled by Hastings in hand Schwarz waning stages of the shot clock kid and Strongs got it but a steal by the Hurricanes blman took it away Cleveland the three and they capitalize and thats a breakdown by strong hes got to know hes trying to run out in the break you have a lead no need to go fast in that situation excellent job though by Miami capitalizing on that turnover Cleveland leading all scores with 21 he has 15 in the second half Miami with 14 points off of 14 BC turnovers Beetle thought about it now he takes it and he makes it Josh Beetle says you know what I can match it well he can hit the class that time nothing but net thats backto back threes that time off of excellent shot fake by Josh beetle beetle has 12 Schwarz to shy Hastings harassed by ly kid with 96 seconds left in regulation yeah this one right here again you got to call glass from there but then the next one uh really off a nice shot fake poor close out and Beetle backto back threes huge for Boston College now again not sure what theyre looking at and I think they checking to see if there was anything extra after after that foul previous fouls been under review John Gaffney on the PA as you just heard now again it was a hard foul again right here and again you can make the argument hard foul and also hes trying to go for the ball stand as a common foul common foul is that a good call yeah I think its a good call again he wasnt again hes still making a play on the ball you can make the argument again it was a hard foul right uh but again in this situation I think again veteran officiating crew dont take a lot of time look at it really yeah it might have been a little extra but again uh nothing I think that warranted the flagrant again hes trying to reach for the ball right there out of frustration again excellent job by the officiating crew dont take a long time take a look at it play on Hastings the missed front end of the one and one Joe Bay slashing to the rack athletic move by Joe Bay yeah just p a defense by Boston College again in that situation you got to keep the ball out of the paint dont want to be too aggressive in that situation two possession game and a foul on Miami thats on Vine uku is third uku was slid to red shirt before the year now keep in mind Miami is playing without Nigel pack he hasnt played since December 10th hes at home with a left foot injury and that just takes a huge chunk of your offense and defense out of the lineup yeah again a guy with final four experience one of the better players in college basketball not in the lineup for Miami but fresman has played pretty well for them acpn with Mark Packer and Taylor bomb you can see it weekdays at 4 Eastern right here on accn in the ESPN app Donald H hes got both big ones for the eagles with 75 seconds left in regulation two timeouts remaining for both teams Divine OG chuku Blows By beo but he blew the layup and thats out of bounds off of Miami as Johnsons had enough a rough night no points he does have eight rebounds in 25 minutes but they want more on the offensive end from him yeah and again thats just a really missed opportunity if youre Miami right now if youre Boston College keying getting the ball inbounded Miami picks him up full court Hastings to beetle beetle trying to dribble up some time and a foul much to the shagr of Paul Joe B hes called for the foul thats his third and Beetle has been solid as well too for oral Grant talked about production from that point guard position obviously the backto back frees was huge but I think handling the pressure that was really the change in this second half also BCs play the majority of the second half about Chad venning who has led them with 17 points he has three fouls so theyve withstood his absence due to the Quality minutes from Jaden Hastings and Elijah strong strong has 11 the Eagles have four in double figures pay with 13 Beetle 12 and Benny with 17 Miami with Cleveland 21 kid 14 and Joe Bay with 10 oach chuku to Austin Schwarz Cleveland the rebound Applause Music out and hand is fouled youc 38 seconds away from posting the largest comeback ever at home they Trail by 19 points with 656 remaining in the first half and dont forget cow at pit coming up next with Dave Leno and Tim Welsh Tim Welsh former Providence coach and his assistant was Bill Courtney whos now Miamis interim coach Donald H at the line fourth foul on Paul joob B and John back to my earlier comment about Earl Grant and the staff the job theyve done with hand last season five points per game but this year the numbers that he is putting up for him are really impressive coming off in AC see player of the week of performance where he averaged uh 26 points per game over the last two games OG chuku has a chance for a threepoint play hes got a bright future for them well Ive really been impressed again hard to believe they were going to ret him but obviously uh they were the expectation was he was going to be behind Nigel pack and other guys so again let him learn let him red shirt but with the pack injury hes thrown into the uh fire and he has been impressive in this game his ability to get into the paint and man the point guard future very bright for this young man at the free throw line Ive been impressed with this game p the rebound and the foul on Austin Schwarz so pay will go to the line the Eagles needed this one theyll go to one and two in the ACC more than likely with 258 seconds left Miami will drop to 49 in its last 23 dating back to last year so theyre still searching again you know these coaches understand how hard it is to win in this league in particular if youre without your star player again I felt their guys The energy they came out with Coach Courtney had to be pleased in that first half uh but on the other side Errol Grant the response in the second half equally impressive and that really was the difference in this game Boston College that matched their energy and then made it difficult for Miami in that second half in the second half Hastings wins the rebound Eagles will kill the clock Elijah strong huge influence in the second half good crowd at Connie form on New Years Day and its a happy New Year for Boston College as they win their first
