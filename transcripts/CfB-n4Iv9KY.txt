they be able to get their guys in position to score because remember Florida State they may be on four but theyre still long theyre still athletic they can still get after you well the Knolls are coming to the floor tonight they are wearing their Native American Heritage jerseys tonight of course this started back a couple of years ago this is the 10th consecutive year that Florida state is honoring not only the Seminole tribe which is such a very important part of what they do but also Native Americans and the Aboriginal youth as well Mercer in the black Matthew Cleveland the accs Sixth Man of the Year had it on the perimeter and James breeding tonight with Ron Gruber and Jenna Renault whistles of foul and its off the ball on Darren Green Jr it will be his first a look at the Mercer lineup featuring Luis Hurtado Jr who was their leading scorer along with Kamara Robertson those two guys toward the top of the car immediately you see that Florida State pressure weve talked about its all the way thats McCrary Jalen McCrary is a transfer from South Florida starting his college career at South Carolina and he puts the Bears on top two to nothing Mercers here theyve lost four straight and eight of their last nine Road games dating back to last years Campaign which saw them finish at 16 and 17 and 7th in the Southern Conference long two out front is good opening night shot for Cameron Fletcher and thats a good sign Fletcher is a guy I think who has to be able to score for Florida State to have their most success ortado cannot finish on the quick drive McLeod back in the lineup grab the rebound its hard to finish with a 74 guy in there inside quickly the easy Miss Fletcher couldnt finish it and here are the Bears Hurtado zanzoni a freshman from Charlotte by way of Greensboro day is fouled on the three and Fletcher draws his first thats the second on Florida State West disappointment for Florida State that they werent able to score but its a good sign that they got out and got the shot close to the basket in zanoni he comes in with the reputation as an outstanding threepoint dreamer outstanding shooter overall although in his last game against Winthrop he was over nine yep so Michael zandoni has 20 minutes of ball game misses for the second time this year at the line and 10 tries he knocks that one down and of course Florida States led by 74yearold Leonard Hamilton we had a delightful conversation with him today covered a lot of areas about these first four games and his 21 Seasons here and really his 35 years of building programs in some respect too Dan its hard not to have a pleasant conversation with Leonard Hamilton hes such an engaging guy tied at four a couple of free throws for zanoni basket for McCreery and Florida States got a couple of field goals as well Florida State really working hard to pressure the ball tomorrow Robertson in the corner three balls and Oni that was really a good job by Robertson to recognize that even though he had an open threepoint shot with dribble penetration he could get zenoni a better one threepoint lead early for the Bears they lob him for McLeod McCreary on the hip out of the corner Fletcher three ball to tie Fletcher is actually a pretty good catch and shoot guy Wes hes not a high percentage threepoint shooter this year but hes a good catch and shoot guy and youre talking about a catch and shoot guy Under Pressure how about Robertson yeah 11 of 19 now from behind the line Dan theres Mills trying to find an alley the scoop McLeod inside battling and hit the underside of the basket last Touch by Florida State Ron Gruber going to award it to Mercer and very quickly Jalen Worley out of Philadelphia into the ball game sophomore and we also get our first look at the Freshman Tom house from Dayton Ohio whos averaged about six minutes the last couple of games West one of the problems that the Seminoles have had early has been point guard play and Mills is not really a point guard hes a scoring guard hes doing the best he can but in situations like that he drives in he draws the defense he wants to shoot the ball youve got to be able to pass it to somebody in there yep heres Robertson who just knocked down the triple house out front to guard him and thats not a criticism of Mills hes the guy whos wired to score and theyre asking him to do a little bit different thing ball got knocked away her title five to shoot heres Robertson kick out three ball from the right and that is Sean Walker Jr his eighth triple of the year but Wes as advertised we talk about their ability to shoot the three and theyve had a couple different guys knock him down Worley here is Cleveland on the drive and hell take the bump and the foul from Hurtado but the Bears are already striking gold Dan three threes for Mercer already but the Bears are reacting to the pressure defense if you compete the pressure youre going to find an open shot if you can find the open man and thats what Robertson did great job to get into the lane and we got changes all around a freshman from Orlando has checked in wearing zero for Mercer well they dont want her toddler picking up a second foul early Applause Music front Karen Greene Jr and Baseline Cleveland for the easy dunk sophomore from Atlanta on the board Applause and I wrote Matthew Clevelands a heck of a player but I think hes best in the attack just like that hes worked on his threepoint shot but he needs to be attacking the goal ball got knocked away house couldnt recover Cameron Corin has also come on the floor for the first time tonight for Florida State wearing number three theres a drive rebounded by house now you got to push him outlet for green trying to get around zanoni fall away and it fell off the iron and it got touched in the cylinder said James breeding so it will be basket interference and belong to Mercer Bears protecting a fourpoint lead early in Tallahassee find an open threepoint shooter Greg Gary in four years in Macon has done a very nice job tonight coaches his 91st game with the Bears hes won 50 you see the first ever socon championship game in the couple of years ago hes got a terrific resume by the way if guys hes worked with and where hes worked and most recently at Purdue with Matt Painter all right man he had some success with man painter it was funny he told us before the game that he basically was in charge of the Purdue offense and they came in here to play one of those really good Florida State teams and he said he had his game plan all worked out were going to run this and run that he said they got the halftime and they realized before the defense was so good they couldnt run anything yeah so all they said guys go out and play you know a couple of basic things lets find some open spots Quinones spins in traffic had it swatted away from behind by Cleveland recovered by Cameron Corin and here is Worley on the drive kicking to the Corner House thought about it now tried to reskip it and turned it over Applause those Give It Away trailing four and granola stepped on the far side out of bounds in front of the Florida State bench with Matthew Cleveland denied mercer at the basket a moment ago well one of the things is characterized before the state defense is the ability to pressure the ball once it gets inside they dont have like five seven foot guys like they usually do but they can still contest shots Hurtado has returned Luis sitado Jr wearing 11 for the Bears with canonis and we also see Jalen Cobb a Fordham transfer for the first time on the floor for Coach Gary all right house working off the dribble look at Worley the drive and basket nicely done Jayden warleys first basket Worley he plays sort of the same way as k icker and taken away by Cleveland command with him he will scoop it and draw the foul Matthew Cleveland will get a couple of free throws and a chance to tie the ball game here this is really a nice job by Worley to get through traffic and then Cleveland we talked about the defense and its hard to throw those long passes against these seminals really good Anticipation by Matthew please so heres Cleveland 67 percent at the freethrow line which is identical to where Florida state is as a squad through the first four games a year ago the ACC Sixth Man the proof real good hit one of the iconic shots in the league a year ago that winner at Virginia its interesting to read some of his comments after you know Dan like a lot of guys in college basketball have success you think about do I need to you know take the next step hell want to come back he Embraces the college experience but he said the other thing is Im about winning I want to win thats kind of what his pedigree was coming out of high school and thats a big part of what and Leonard Hamilton was talking about him specifically today as you see McCrary knocked down the two Matthew Clevelands gonna have to be a guy that might have to lead as a sophomore here they dont have as many older guys as traditionally Florida state has had right West and Matthew Clevelands philosophy about winning that sort of characterizes what a lot of people around college basketball call the Florida state model the Leonard Hamilton has built here you get a bunch of guys who are willing to go at it for four four and a half minutes at a time and then come out of the game they dont care if theyre playing a lot of minutes you know they play 24 minutes then thats fine but you play a lot of guys they get after you and all they want to do is win well they missed the first end of the two second foul by the way on Quinones a moment ago so here comes a fullblown line change for Florida State Fletcher Mills are back first look of the night at Deontay green nahim McLeods come back and Chandler Jackson Waits at the table right there with Leonard Hamilton where Jalen orley to finish his second free throw and he gets to ride Farleys got three and here comes Jackson The Freshman from Memphis who played two minutes the other night you can see the right thumb is bandaged up he had a pretty good injury its cost him a lot of time and theres a bump and a foul Applause on Jackson trying to challenge the inbounds pass for Walker so the young man whos the number two player in the volunteer state and top 50 nationally comes over the floor picks up his first first well West he was a very highly touted Prospect as you just mentioned and he was a highly touted Prospect at the point guard position and thats a place where Florida State could really use it Rock Court heres Hurtado one point Mercer lead Walker catch and shoot thats partially blocked by Fletcher and were going to whistle in a foul inside James breeding tonight with Ron Gruber and Jenna Renault on the whistle and the foul is going to be on Deontay green freshman at 6 10 from Asheville North Carolina its the fourth on Florida State now they got the foul there but they also got the block on that point shot the Seminole is doing a really nice job flying at those threepoint Shooters after giving up three of them early for tato quick entry pass for Robertson out front this is Cobb Jalen Cobb his fifth three of the year is his first point tonight and the fourth different guy whos made a three four point lead for Mercer Mills this is green Applause and now going to work as Fletcher 12 to shoot and heres Jackson out front left hand drive pushed it up blocking call on Robertson itll be his first its the fourth on the Bears free throws coming but about the three a moment ago out of the offense well again you have the defense collapses after that inbounds play and Cobb is another guy hes a little slowed by a knee injury but hes a guy who can make a three as well who mentions theres four threes and thats by four different guys Chandler Jackson one of two at the freethrow line so far the young season played just a couple minutes the other night against the Gators knocks down the free throw look now this young man six five 215 pounds physically Dan hes ready to go he looks like a player thats for sure second one bounced out but he needs some time yeah you know not only is he impression but he missed a lot of practice time with that thumb injury well unfortunately time is something you dont have when the year starts right you dont have much more in about four days at any given stretch and you know Leonard Hamiltons talking about the combinations and the challenges with the injuries I mean we havent even gotten into the you know the Jalen Gainey injury and all the things that go with that in terms of post play and things of that nature its kind of handcuffed this team early heres Mill back door cut Jackson Nice skip for Fletcher and a three got it Cameron Fletchers got eight to lead Florida State and he is shooting the ball with a tremendous amount of confidence West sure is Fletchers hot a pair of threes and a regular field goal and at the other end Walker Ranchers Greg Gary told us today that he thought Sean Walker had to play well today yep back in front go the Bears the young man has responded so far 15 to shoot for Mills McLeod trying to help and thats going to be a block so the call Will Go On Cobb for the block itll be his first and Florida state has done a nice job forcing defensive adjustments by Mercer that was a great play by Jackson in there to catch the ball in traffic and find the open man thats what you expect from your point guard and Jackson executed that play perfectly of course it always helps with the guy you pass it to makes that the back end always Chris yeah everybody looks better Fletcher sizes up Craig and Mystic got his own rebound and score now west you watch as McLeod sets the screen out at the top Craig is playing way back in the lane but theres going to be some opportunities for the Seminoles see Robertson trying to find a crease Cobb back out front Robertson cuts it loose and the rebound for green heres Fletcher Doles trying to pick up something in transitions Mills skips for the corner Jackson launches and seven foot four David Craig from South Africa grabs the rebound for the Bears another three and Craig gonna be called for the push inside on McCloud first on Craig six on Mercer breaking the action in Tallahassee bears by one the guy comes in as their third leading scorer has not shot the three well so far this year but hes knocked down both of his threepoint efforts tonight hes been ready hes been confident and this is a play where he just follows his own shot so made two twos and two threes looks pretty good on the offensive End plus hes got a blocked shot kind of looking at some of the notes and the details you see the four of six that features the two triples for the St Louis product by the way he averaged seven points four rebounds a year ago but a dozen and six rebounds in the last six games where he posted four double figure efforts a year ago for Leonard Hamilton West youre talking about the relative youth of this Florida State team Fletchers another one of the older guys hes got to assume a leadership role and today hes leading by example yep so far youre right Deontay green on the floor Fletcher McLeod Mills Jackson for Leonard Hamilton left hand turn nahim McLeod nicely done by the Junior from Philadelphia for his first point just his second field goal of the Year appearing is only six feet eight and McLeod did a nice job catching the ball close to the basket and then just putting it in the basket over top of it Greg Gary took the big seven footer David Craig off the floor for Mercer during the time out theres Walker a high hanger fell off the back iron heres Jackson nicely done Fletcher in transition green Walker trying to close out Cameron Fletcher thats a situation where the ball needed to move West Mills and the rebound pulled away by Greene and Cobb is hurt yep Cobb shaken up heres green for three missed badly a third try for Florida State on the Fletcher offensive rebound Mills Music a little spin in the lane and couldnt finish it Walker had it now were going to get a whistle and the foul will be tagged to Florida State cop is going to have to come out of the game for Mercer yep I think theyre going to put this on Deontay green Gerber whistle they foul and yes Deonte greens yep so its on Deontay green its his second well West but the one thing you see at convention over there at the scores table with green and Jackson being able to play suddenly Leonard Hamilton has 10 scholarship guys he can rotate in and out and hes played 10 guys here in the first nine and a half minutes of this half yeah when Florida state is at Full Tilt the last few years weve all had our you know our fun talking about the hockey line change at the similar bench well when you have the depleted number stand and the depleted experience from what this program is that makes it a little dire at times and thats a reflection of maybe the first four two when you see nobody going to the offensive boards for Mercer theyre really concerned about getting back preventing transition house Darren Green on the lobby Cameron Corin averaging nine a game is on the board Florida State in front three Applause question Greg Garys teams going to have to answer is were we living too much behind the line cant we get something in a half court set and their problem is when theyve driven the ball to the basket the shots have been highly contested theres a nice dump Robertson tries to dump it to McCreary he couldnt hang on turned over to Florida State and Florida state is playing very well on the offensive end the drive forces the defender to commit nobody comes over to help out and pouring is wide open for the dunk thats an excellent pass by Greene but thats all created off the dribble penetration if you can force the defense to react and help generally you can get a pretty good shot if you keep the ball moving Cleveland thought about the catch and shoot now hell put it on the deck Drive cant finish Corey inside one dribble in the rebound and the score Cameron Corin backtoback field goals asserting a bit of a presence inside well you drive the ball of the basket the defense has to come and help out theres nobody to block out pressure on the back side the jump shot no good from McCreary maybe a little bit less because of the pressure House of catches shoes he checked in he hasnt shot the ball yet how can he think hes hot Applause under nine to go ball deflects it away into the bench area Mercer makes a change Jordan Jones a sophomore from Macon coming into the lineup for the Bears theres a look at Jones but if thats your first shot Wesson youre doing a heat check then youre a very confident shooter well I mean the book on young house from Dayton Ohio is that hes a shooter confident confident shooter down this is Hurtado who is scoreless so far West but after the first five or six minutes of this game you could just see the Florida State Defense tighten up Mercer has not been able to get the ball from side to side they havent been able to get penetration to create those open opportunities yeah Luis certado kick out zanoni for three knocks it in and a foul the goal will count for zanoni hes got eight in the ball game now on his second triple I thought I saw the official single 11 no but its five yep the Prairie draws his first seventh theme foul okay its the 17th foul thats what she was signaling is it one and one so one and one at the other end for Cameron corick thats the first time in a while though that Mercer has been able to get inside that defense and create an open threepoint shot opportunity and so its a lot of matter west of living and dying by the three you have to take the shots that you can get and Florida state has been really good at cutting off the middle Applause that is the 63 of this first half for Mercer theres Corin nicely done on the one and one Cameron Corin is from Allen Texas but hes got roots in the Southeast his dad Richard Corin was a terrific player of the 1983 final four Georgia Bulldogs featured Vern Fleming and James Banks for the legendary Florida State coach later Georgia coach Hugh Durham Durham no relations Corin hit a boat but corn is the guy whos not necessarily known as a power guy inside hes more of a pick and pop kind of outside shooter type yeah heres Robertson on the drive and it rattled out for it and how hotly contested was that a layup yes but a good shot I dont know and look at corn around the glass a third time here and Worley ends up scooping it up press 20 for Florida State Cleveland off the core and screen at 18 feet air ball and it hit the inline out of bounds it will go to Mercer fourpoint lead for the nose here Warren has affected this game West simply by hustling up and down the court I agree and you look at Jones who will bring it through the back court now Ken is uh played 10 games for him last year after injuries forced him into the lineup yep were going to timeout Florida States got a fourpoint lead Cameron corens had a pretty good few minutes here on the floor for Leonard Hamilton the dunk off the lob from green back in a moment Music well Florida State fourpoint lead under eight to go in this first half with Dan Bonner West Durham we welcome into our coverage tonight on acc Network Dan dare I say guys like Cameron corn who weve talked about even to a degree Jalen Worley they kind of adding a little spark to the punch here theyve really picked it up on the defensive end us as weve talked about a couple of times and I dont think you can overstate the fact that theyve already played 10 guys so far here in the first half zanoni with Craig Jones Hurtado and Robertson on the floor for Mercer with the basketball Fletcher Cleveland green Worley and McLeod are out there for Coach Hamilton McLeod and Craig insides probably worth your time if youre watching this ball game not too often you get to see 74 and 72 draw it up at the post in the college game Hurtado has not scored tonight and taking uh only one shot Dan deep three ground Craigs a nice box out of the cloud now Craig is not a guy whos going to go very far to get a rebound but if it comes in his area hes going to grab it theres a screen to allow Robertson now Hurtado the three cockside rebound Cleveland Knowles looking to run look at Matthew Cleveland skip through out front Jayden Worley three ball right at the top of the line first triple of the year for the young man from Suburban Philly Wesson thats were talking about the last time you drive the defense back they get set but if you move the ball quickly you can get an open one Robertson kick out Hurtado Applause the lead is seven for the nose thats a really good job by Fletcher to force Robertson to reload Craig kind of a screen that allowed Robertson to pull the trigger uh Craig is going to screen you know youre going to be screening no question Worley on the drive the cloud tried to keep it alive slapped around theres Fletcher Johnny on the spot scooping up hes got 12 in the first half Worley couldnt get the ball but he slapped it to a teammate nice job by the Knowles to attack the offensive board and with that were going to get a timeout Mercer wants to reload here a little bit Greg Gary State Trails nine 6 15 to go everything youve seen me do move the defense you saw all the black shirts get in the lane but the pass outside the dribble draws the Defenders and nobodys there to pick up warley and again you say hes not noted as a threepoint shooter but Cleveland created that whole play with the rebound and pushing the ball first three of the year for Worley gets him on the board from the floor and what youre seeing Wes is that the Seminoles have been able to play in transition and the Bears are having to play in a half court set yep and that Florida State Defense is just really tough alternating possession well keep it with Mercer tend to shoot for Greg Garys team theres a direct result of the quality of the shots yeah and Greg Garys guy after getting some good shots early have really struggled against an intense Florida State Defense the quality of their shots has gone way down so Cleveland and Worley are out Chandler Jackson with Caleb Mills now Dan we talked about this I believe briefly here a few minutes ago Mills at times has been playing the point but when Jacksons out there we know Chandler Jackson is going to be the point guard Florida State couldnt close out Walker got it swatted back now Craig and McLeod and Craig gets the roll Music theyre squaring off on a different floor from the rest of the teams absolutely those guys live in a little higher life Jackson into the corner Florida State League trimmed to seven on the first Bucket from freshman David Craig Applause here is Fletcher Mills sets onehanded push on the three is good just the second three of the year for Caleb Mills well Mills thats not the strength of his game but if you give him that much time in that much room hes going to be able to knock it down biggest lead of the night for Florida State double figures just ahead of five minutes Hurtado kick out for Walker well covered by Green there Dan nice recovery here is Robertson by everybody couldnt finish zanoni runs it down fresh 20 for Mercer Craig inside tried to scoop it out somehow got it through to Hurtado and now Walker Oh Boy missed everything Wes this is just a situation where the defense has the Bears in a big hurry yep see zanoni playing Mills for the drive and thats what you have to do but when he rises up to shoot that ball you got to put more pressure on Mills wants to take it and go by you everybody knows that you see the threepoint shooting numbers for both schools well over 40 percent Mercer has only hit by my countdown three regular field goals in his first half heres McLeod rolling with the left hand again and the cloud got it over McCrary before McCreary six feet eight a little more difficult that time against Craig Music so now Tamara Robertson the senior from Alpharetta Georgia trying to go to work here on the drive into traffic zanoni theres a walker with five to shoot pull up and the rebound Fletcher got to figure out a way I think to put the ball in the hands of the big guy Mills all the way through tried to go back to Worley and last Touch by the Knowles and that will get us to the under four media timeout 10point lead though Leonard Hamiltons team 346 to go first half at the Tucker Center Auto Owners ensures your car youve got to get them going to games early right yeah you got to get him hydrated and you got to get him that popcorn thats it gotta have the popcorn right Mike young will tell you that at Virginia Tech you got to have the popcorn right wow of course Mike young absolutely yeah they were going to give him an nil deal it would be for popcorn of court so away we go here 346 to go in the first half Florida States defense changed his first half or the ability to get a little deeper into the bench Chase his first half Wes I think the two go together when you get out there you feel like you can play harder because you know you got guys coming in for you but I think the defense is really benefactor because it has forced Mercer into some tough baskets tough attempts here late and a half and while Florida state theyre not lighting it up theyre only shooting 43 percent from the field that their defense has been good enough that theyve been able to hold this 10point lead Walker Robertson zanoni Craig McCrary on the floor for Greg Gary for three and a half to go Walker tried to find all the way through kick out for Robertson three wouldnt go down Craig the rebound McLeod there blocked it recovered by Fletcher ahead for Mills trying to find an alley and cant finish it Worley the rebound green a three sure 153 of the year for Darren Green Jr well West may be a little force on that DriveIn transition but the result was great because they got the rebound and green in a situation where he can catch and shoot in transition he is a dangerous threepoint shoot Mercer one of their last 11 from the floor make it 12 zanoni had that blocked by Worley heres Mills I move the ball Fletcher of three wow about moved the ball to Fletcher thats the second consecutive transition three hes got 15 in the first half matches his season High the lead is 16 live catch McCreary snaps a bit of a drought for the Bears with his third field goal Bears really having to work hard to get any kind of result here is green McLeod set a nice screen foul that jumper short Applause 205 to go heres Robertson almost had it poked away but able to keep it alive on the dribble zimony lob for Craig big fella to catch and one so crackle go the chance for the threepoint play at the line but Florida States attacking from the perimeter at their offensive end here in the last couple of exchanges theyve been able to get out in transition and this is after an offensive Rebound in transition you cant get back to the shooter and then again the ball goes into the corner nobodys picking up Fletcher but that how about that passed by zigonia it was perfect Craig he threw in a spot where clay could catch it and make a move and Craig isnt the most mobile guy in there right when you hit him with the ball when hes in position and he has his feet set hes hard to stop I dont care if McLeod is seven feet four so Craig after his second field goal knocks down the free throw so hes got five in the first half this is an important last minute and 50 seconds for both teams yep I agree with you on that Applause foul line McLeod maybe thats not the shot theyre looking for there might be a reason he was open Mercado scoreless in the first half working against Deontay Greene heres Robertson a catch and shoot cant leave him open can you six for Kamar Robertson well he was able to set his feet that time Wes the defensive pressure wasnt there Leonard Hamilton wants a quick timeout hes going to use the user to lose a 30 here because quite frankly its been cut down to single digits after the three ball by Robertson back after this Music watch ACC football all season on acc network with Xfinity well the campus for the most Parts on the break so anybody here helping with the band bless them right absolutely absolutely folks try to steal a few days away basketballs on the road tomorrow theyll be in uh the Orlando area for ESPN events starting on Thursday large football game here Saturday Friday night actually Friday night yep Florida Florida State on ABC now what do we got here I think they put Green in and now theyre taking them out well house cant come in until the ball is played because House Green came back on the floor right well they put Green in and you cant take him out until the ball is played Hill theres some time runs off the top Mercer on an eightnothing run to cut this thing down to eight here is Chandler Jackson nice scream from McLeod pullup jumper too strong Jackson the rebound from behind Robertson Cleveland in the Knowles the new 20 Florida state has dominated their offense points theyve done a great job getting second opportunities out of the corner green fires rebound Jackson right back inside Cleveland couldnt finish it well they had some pretty good Applause 40 seconds to go in this first half Applause Robertson on the drive thats a tremendous job by McCurry to cut him off Craig the rebound from behind McLeod Applause and almost threw it beyond the original Walker five second differential shot clock to game clocks we go down the stretch here Walker with Cleveland defending here is Walker off the Craig screen puts it up over McLeod rebounded with three seconds left Darren Green from half court spun out Florida States going to take the lead though to the locker room 4234 Dan really good effort by Florida State defensively in those 42 points you like to see that we said they had to create some easy opportunities and they did so stay with almost three minutes without a point so Greg Gary in his fourth year in Macon and a team that is uh trying to play toward that front half of the Southern Conference which is a terrific by the way mid major basketball league and theyll see Florida State on the attack here first theres Mills with a softball away or Craig starts the second half big fellow a nice box out of the cloud here is Hurtado who went scoreless for the opening 20 minutes and played almost 16 of those 20 I had four assists yep tend to shoot Robertson not a walker lob for Craig McLeod on it back for Walkers three and the rebound for nahim McLeod that was a situation where I think Walker put a cup to the corner and got a better look from three yep you cant just throw it to the big guy and stand you got to give him an outlet heres McLeod and now bills to set the offense he plays with Darren Green Jr heres green bounce pass into the corner on the drive and the dunk cam Mitchell 17 now for Fletcher thats really confident move by Fletcher you know Gregs not a big shot blocker hes a big man but hes not really a shot blocker but youre not intimidated at all Hurtado has to give and go and then that got poked Away by Greene they roll to the deck and Craig somehow reaches down around everybody pulls it out of there and now all of a sudden a missed three by Robertson and Mercer comes away empty its really important that you compared a high percentage lets go back to the drive in the dunk here a moment ago by Fletcher well this is a situation where Fletcher gives the fake or Currys out of position and Craig you know he doesnt want to go and pick up a foul and he also doesnt want to step there because if he does then McCloud the seven foot four guys all alone under the basket just a really good aggressive play by Fletcher Caleb Mills is 12 of 14 at the line this year twoshot opportunity and the first one is good dont forget coming up next tonight game two of our ACC Network doubleheader Mike Monaco Malcolm Huckabee standing by Cameron Indoor Stadium tonight Dan and Bellarmine continues its ACC I was getting ready to say adjunct membership for uh Scott Davenport and the Knights as they see number seven Duke tonight around 8 30 well send you to Cameron with Mike and hook theres a quick fall away and nicely done Bob McCleary enough to your point down a moment ago Hurtado with a nice delivery of the basketball and thats really mccurrys game hes somebody thats got a score of the midrange and around the basket Cleveland trying to wind off the screen in the cloud didnt quite catch it all Fletcher will look at this little soft onehanded maybe we should have stopped and passed that ball or pulled up and shoot a jump shot of working on Mills lead is nine for the Knowles and Hurtado around the cloud and now were going to get a whistle and a foul I think on looks like its going to be inside on Green it is well her toddler does a really nice job finding McCreery inside and I think Fletcher thought he was going to try to drive it to the basket but McCreary hes like I said hes a very good shortrange jump shooter and knocked out and down so heres David Craig 72 270 pounds a freshman from Johannesburg in South Africa its his second free throw hes got a half dozen Greg Gary says but Craig spends time with a graduate assistant or a manager shooting at least a hundred free throws every day that Greg Gary told him he said hey look youre a big guy inside youre going to get fouled youre going to score a lot of points if you can make free throw he hit them both the lead cut to seven almost three minutes gone here in the second half Applause the goals had a pretty comfortable halftime lead on Friday night Cleveland knocks down a three Matthews got seven now in the ball game thats just his second field goal and Florida came all the way back ultimately won the ball game by nine the other night sure and somewhere in Leonard Hamiltons mind is thinking about the sequential nature of the second half tonight for his Club is Walker answers Clevelands three with one of his own hes got nine on three triples returns it to Cleveland over the top of Craig now we just saw Cleveland make a three but the strength of his game is that midrange game right there and thats against a mercer Zone good ball movement to find the open man nine for Cleveland the lead nine for Florida State blocked out of there by McCloud it will stay with the Bears and Jalen Worley going to check in heres another look at the three from Cleveland s just all alone we said thats not his strength but when you get that much time thats like shooting in an open gym Fletcher tries to put a little pressure on but nice job by walking heres the locker Walker now Craig with the cloud inside the cloud got a piece of it and last Touch by the Bears thats a really good job by McLeod Craig is a big man Im not hes tall obviously but so is McLeod but Craig must outweigh him by 40 or 50 pounds no question and McLeod did not allow himself to get first out of the way lets go slides through nice pass Fletcher a little reverse Up and Under move cam Fletcher 19 now in the ball game Dan really a clever move he was blocked on the left side just made a pivot and went around under the basket career high for Cameron Fletcher hes been very active on both ends of the field yep heres the ferry and the cloud altered that three skip for Cleveland OH nice move 18footer left it on the front rim Applause Hurtado and Mercer Oni waiting at the table for the Bears hes been arguably one of the more impactful threepoint Shooters heres Robertson taught in the air hell be fouled by Fletcher that will get us to a timeout two fouls on the null second on Fletcher 11 point lead for Florida State when we come back thank you from the null Zone student group even during the Thanksgiving holidays and attendance here tonight the Tucker Center and a good chance to remind you that theyre all amazing fans across the ACC and now during this final week of the regular season early basketball we need your help ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a picture Dan take a video tag it with the hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social you might see it on acc Network you have to wear funny costumes some would say we have funny costumes all the time well okay Ill buy that yeah free throws for Robertson out of the timeout and the first one bounces out Mercers not really been able to get to the freethrow line tonight Florida States done a nice job dominating the inside Florida state with 20 Hidden Side points yeah commercial six and really good news for the second as theyve had 13 points from their bench Robertson got one of the two hes got seven five minutes into the second half ten point lead house has come on the floor so is Cameron Corin hes got the ball at the top against mccreer corn can give Leonard Hamiltons team that boost he did in the first half right well for it was really good in the first half six points four rebounds two assists in less than five minutes of playing time hes going to turn that over trying to find I think Corin on the Baseline well Mercer switches back to the mantoman with Craig on the bench all right Leonard Hamilton not really happy that time with the way his team reacted but hes got to be pleased with the defensive pressure Hurtado against warlins the dribble of zavoni and Robertson real three guard flavor here its only 10 seconds left on the shot clock yeah Robertson kick out for Walker in the lane nice pass McCreary the bucket 10 for Jalen McCrary and again thats mccurrys sweet spot right around the goal with that little lefthanded jump shot foreign Applause tried to go inside deflected away corens got it with 10 got a mismatch against Robertson back for Worleys Runner I fell off the iron rebounded McCrary Quest says corn gets more experience hes going to recognize that thats a play that he needed to make rather than pass the ball so heres Walker Music McCreary gets Baseline and dunks it home hes got six and a half and 12 in the game hes getting ready to say Mercers got to feel like maybe theres a window here to crawl back into this and theyve taken advantage theres the drive by Green he couldnt finish now the Bears down six Florida State the ball movement has not been there here in this little stretch Robertson oh good heavens and the drive four in our three and a half nine in the game and a timeout for Leonard Hamilton its down to four 1251 to go Mercer on the run to cut it down to two possessions Why Pay overall its been a couple times in about the last 11 oclock minutes of the game and really it feels like the Bears might be kind of leaning in here on a run too well they are and theyve done a nice job creating situations the defensive pressure not quite as intense thats really one of the first times weve seen them get to the basket certainly for a dunk but remember McLeod is out of the game and the guy who was out on the perimeter Corinth is the guy who got beat off the dribbles in his own shot blockers back there and remember Wes with 247 left in the first half Florida state was ahead by 16 right so Mercer has chopped 12 points off this lead in about 10 minutes well they went and a NATO run to finish the first half thats how it went from 16 to 80 at the break and now here you go back and look at it its a essentially an 184 run by the Bear 186 Run Dan excuse me 4234 at halftimes 5248 now right the other thing the seven of us arent playing in transition right thats it against a set defense and thats been a little tougher heres Caleb Mills seven to shoot Cleveland slash kick out three ball Jackson spins out a rebound from McCreery again they were getting easy opportunity and the ability to move the ball that transition but they havent been playing in transition screen for McCrary heres Hurtado lobbing and play up good that was a great pass and a great cut Simmons caught a little flat footed 14 now for Jalen McCreary eight in the second half lead cut to two Applause Cleveland Alfred Jackson kind of moves the ball yep bills Waits on the screen heres cord this is Fletcher whos their leading scorer six to shoot now bill three to shoot hell have to take Robertson skip Jackson shot clockwise stepped out of bounds though before the clock expired so Leonard Hamiltons team an unforced Aaron a moment ago heres that lob for McCrary 2410 run by the Bears there to win the two when we come back Music the Run has been the play of the South Florida transfer Jalen mccreer well hes been really good Wes hes got eight points here in the second half and hes done it basically around the basket they they keep losing him on the inside hes done a nice job catching it and shooting particularly when hes able to get to that left hand and then this is just a drive to the basket the defense is not able to pressure the ball now this is just a great law pass Florence got caught watching the dribbler and McCurry took advantage and went back Florida State brings McLeod Cleveland Fletcher Jackson and Mills back to the floor Hurtado Robertson Walker zanoni and McCreary out there for uh Greg Garys Club well lets see how McCreary is able to match up with McLeod thats that was a tough matchup for him in the first half because again hes the guy who plays around the basket is awful difficult guy to play around on the inside yep mainly because you cant play a Roundup you got to play over but hes seven feet four Walker in the backcourt against Cleveland Sean Walker from Northeastern North Carolina and Elizabeth City veteran player at the Mercer program theres Furtado in the corner Robertson standing three for the lead Kamar Robertson a dozen in the ball game thats his third three of the night well they had a double team inside against McCree and they left Robertson alone yep Florida State on the law from a cloud backing down McCrary threw it away to Hurtado I think he was trying to skip it for Cleveland Luis Hurtado the layup too strong Ill tell you what McLeod made a mistake throwing that ball away but he ran down the court to get that rebound sure did Mills redirects on the dribble and score tough shot for Caleb Mills third field goal unless he takes tough shots but he can make tough shots and he can score a lot of points in a hurry still got 10 and a half minutes to go and it feels like were playing the last 10 seconds yeah it does theres a lot of intensity out here suddenly on both ends of the Court Walker heres Hurtado Applause Baseline move skip back McCreary over McLeod Jalen McCreary now 10 in the half 16 in the ball game to lead Mercer how high did he Arc that shot unbelievable the cloud McLeod wants the ball inside and Cleveland going to take it on the drive and whistle and a foul I believe we have a block underneath the basket here Mercury tried to block the shot Jalen mccrearys hurt by the way he got hit in the face its gonna be on McCrary which is a little worse for the wear if you will but he was inside the arc I I dont think it got called West for being inside the ark because he jumps in the air jumps in there he gets an elbow in the face as he tries to block the shot but that arm came down and he hit Cleveland on the arm so thats the worst of all worlds he gets smacked in the face possibly you have a bloody nose and you get called for the foul Prairie going to come out of the ball game and Daniel or David Craig will check in Matthew Cleveland gonna go the line here and itll be interesting to see what happens now because mccrearys Mobility right and the ability to score against the Florida State Defense has been a big part of this Mercer comeback so Cleveland at the line for a pair hes two for two tonight first but good dont forget ACC football coming up this weekend on acc Network prime time at the Hard Rock in Miami Gardens Pittsburgh and Miami s team after a bit of a dip has come back to win three straight including a twopoint victory over Duke last Saturday and of course lost in Clemson outside so the Mario Crystal Balls team needs a win to be Bowl eligible both the free throws for Cleveland you saw McCrary on the bench gonna work his way back up to the seating area of Greg Garys Pine meanwhile Craig stays on the floor heres Hurtado now Walker flying to the basket over the top of McLeod got the bounce boy Mercer playing suddenly with a lot of confidence West taking the ball to the basket yep Walker pushes the Bears back in front theres Cleveland for McLeod Music Applause Cleveland has such versatility Wes drives the ball into the lane forces Craig to commit and McLeod just follows the defender and hes all alone Florida State by one Walker back inside heres Craig and he gonna count it in a foul basket for Craig the foul is going to be on Matthew Cleveland and theres the follow shot heres a look at the McLeod finish now McLeod just follows this man to the basket and thats thats a really heads up play Nobody rotated over and call the foul on McCloud not Cleveland a third on Florida State the big guys showed a nice touch from the freethrow line yep all those free throws at practice must be paying off the Bears in front of pair Applause for nine to go were early kind of moves the ball out front Fletcher he had the hot hand early and ties the game bill has the hot head 21 now for Cameron Fletcher and General Renault is stop play for a moment with 8 39 to go I think it was a shot clock I do too yep wow Leonard Hamilton to hop into the full court press too Hurtado into Robertson well the Seminoles had some success with this pressure in the first half yep theres Fletcher now hands to Worley plays over the top of the Craig screen nicely and Al zanoni down to 10 yep Robertson trying to hire Works to the right with four ball away two and the rebound for Cleveland really good defense yep and Fletcher has been very active on the defensive end as well tonight Wes Cleveland step in two got it Matthew Cleveland I got him with nine now but that midrange jump shot is going to be there if McLeod sets a screen because Craig is playing back inside nine in the second half 13 on the night for the Atlanta sophomore Walker the runner Craig the rebound a battle inside McCloud followed it Craig got it back looking to reset dropped the ball and it was stolen out of there Greg commits the foul as Florida State broke three from underneath Wes Walker had the opportunity for a layup and he elected to take that floater and that really hurt him the Seminoles with the twopoint lead theyre half the ball Im the captain of the Peewee foot twopoint game tonight in Tallahassee with Dan Bonner West Durham we welcome you back to our coverage tonight on acc Network Florida State trying to get their first win of the year its been a rock fight at times for Leonard Hamilton really kind of at both ends of the floor Dan regardless of what transpires tonight they played pretty well at the defensive end I think yeah they really have Wesson very very well in stretches at their offense today has been keyed by Cleveland hes got 13 and Fletchers got 21 yeah Florida States hit their last four shots on the floor by the way theyve got a season high and blocks tonight with eight and to show you how improved that is defensively you take Stetson UCF and Troy combined they only had seven blocks in those three games not individually all three and theyve got eight here tonight McCreary is back in the game as the bears looking for a little bit of offense although Craig has 10 points and 12 rebounds foreign Applause bills trying to find a way around Robertson a cloud inside of the dump Raheem McLeod has got a half dozen they just cant match up with him inside unless Craig is it again points six rebounds three blocks but when you get that penetration forces the defense to come and try to stop the ball handler and McLeod does a nice job getting into good offensive rebounding positions Prairie zanoni is a hard shooter for the perimeter Walker with a nice set of moves but cant beat 74 heres Robertson now Walker from in front of his coach and a shot clock violation Walker went down Greg Geary not happy with the call or no call I should say thats a really impressive job by McCloud to just sticks with it here he gets the ball inside just pushes the fury out of the way but on the defensive end he moved his speed he presented Walker from getting around and then he blocked a desperation three and thats thats got to be frustrating for Leonard Hamilton because you get the sense that the game is turning right now so now after that turnover can Mercer answer again were in one of those stretches where an important stretch of the game for both teams seventh turnover by Florida State remember they only had three at the half which was their best half of the year so far Applause Hurtado heres the Noni better defensive pressure a cloud out there on Hurtado who tries to beat him on the dribble and does first first point Luis sotato Jr thats a big basket and Worley going to be fouled racing into the front Court I think they got Simone the Sonys a really good shooter but at this stage in his development as a Defender he sometimes has a tough time staying in front of three people Michael sonone is a freshman from Charlotte who played for the legendary Freddie Johnson at Greensboro Day School Dan North Carolina he can shoot it sure can Applause just the fourth foul on Mercy theres bills nice feed to Cleveland Applause Music hes taking force that would try to get it up for the basket but recognizing the collapsing defense finds the open man 15 for Cleveland in the ball game lead to four Applause we still have a lot of time left in that game but each one of these possessions suddenly feels really important there is McCrary and follow good what a play by McCreery yep Applause twopoint game again Applause Cleveland law from a cloud now heres the advantage he had in that first half back for Cleveland with 15 to shoot Mills pushes one up I dont like that shot not with 15 on the shot clock Applause Wills has made a three today but hes not a threepoint shooter and that was a contest of three Hurtado can tie with a two thats Quinones its been a good bit of the first half in foul trouble Applause and now we are tied thats a great job by McCurry inside the Florida state switches screens he had a mismatch he called for the ball he was patient he was able to get it up on the cloud Jayla mccrarys got 20 the game is tied and McCreary commits the foul its really a nice job by McCurry hes patient doesnt let the defense come and then he knows McLeod is back there but a dead father hes not playing against the cloud hes playing against Worley mccrarys got 20 season High 22 against Milligan and heres Worley at the line one of two tonight 11 of 19 this year in the freethrow good you see Darren Green Tom house return for Florida State Fletcher Applause and Mills out for Coach Hamilton I think youre just trying to give McCurry a breather hes got three fouls and you want to have him fresh second one for morally good eight now for the sophomore Mount Airy Pennsylvania Applause twopoint lead for Florida State Applause Robertson Music Hurtado uses the Craig screen backs down on green over the top of the cloud Craig got a shot at it knocked toward the corner where Cleveland collects it lead for McCloud and the basket got knocked down by Craig nahim McLeod on a great lead from Matthew Cleveland Dan its a great lead but McLeod runs from the floor tonight for his eight points thats just a great job running out on the break I mean he was in the middle of that scrum under the basket but he got down the court timeout taken by Mercer Greg Gary wants to talk about it but a moment ago Matthew Cleveland if Jordan Travis might want to get a look at that the lead from McLeod and the bucket Knowles by four when we continue from Tallahassee Auto Owners protects your home an estate leading Mercer the Knowles have hit seven of their last nine from the floor Dan to take this advantage and theyve kind of come in all shapes and sizes here yeah it sure has Florida State again theyve turned it up defensively remember they gave up the lead and Mercer went ahead Music well see Matthew Cleveland with house McLeod and McLeod has been a big factor yes played very well particularly in this late rally by Florida State hes got eight points seven rebounds five blocks and Mercers got the basketball with Hurtado Craig zanoni Walker and Kamar Robertson and 11 to shoot for the Bears Simone right there house defensively now Craig over the top of McLeod couldnt finish nahim another rebound is eight you know Robertson was over on the side but he did not give Craig a place to throw the ball you got to move to an open spot where your big guy can see you he would have been all alone for the three generally offense doesnt work as well if you stand heres heres McLeod trying to help Orly to the basket over the top of Craig couldnt finish it said only the rebound now Hurtado and the Bears try to find the same out front Walker heres Robertson by Green held in the air and fouled by Green e Jr his third five on Florida State and Mercer has been very aggressive in transition and thats just her nice job by Robertson to hang up in the air and wait for the foul and thats a situation with green he has to trust this guy behind him he got beat but McLeod is standing back there what is the six foot Robertson going to do yep tomorrow Robertson one of two at the line Dan he came in 11 of 13 at the line this year and obviously every opportunity is Big here Greg Garys guys you cant afford to squander any of them Applause spun out guy who came in at 85 percent through four games is one for four if youre the Bears you need to stop yep Applause Cleveland hell take Hurtado and theres the foul on Luis Hurtado thatll be his second that is five on Mercer which is okay right with 225 to go thats the point of Memphis this year this year Wes he starts his drive and Hurtado had both hands on him yep fresh 20 on the shot clock McCrary there now Cleveland Matthew bumped and fouled as he cut it loose and thats a third on Hurtado and sixth now on Mercer Cleveland has done a great job putting pressure on Hurtado and if Clevelands gonna catch the ball out there West I think hurtados got to give him a step because Clevelands going to look to drive it and Hurtado has got caught a couple of times now 11 in the half 15 in the ball game for the sophomore from Atlanta Two Shots here for Matthew Cleveland personal no good a year ago against the ACC averaged a dozen points five rebounds shot 44 from the floor now this is a mustscore situation for Mercer I think Applause Applause a good spot for him most of the second half thats a shot hes made all night and a great recognition by Hurtado that he had this match and a great pass team to shoot point game the state got to be conscious with the ball here is green thats a long two Darren Greene Jr second field goal gives him by the lead seven Dan with 90 seconds and that might be enough thats really a good play by Green didnt take the tough three stepped inside hit the two and a timeout for Greg Gary a little bit of patience I thought maturity maybe a board you might want to use to describe the possession about Leonard Hamilton Steve well its really a good possession because Worley gets in and then steps back he sees the open man and what makes that play is that green recognizes the penetration goes and finds the open spot and then reacts when the defender comes out and attacks him the defender knows that hes a threepoint shooter and Ill tell you thats so valuable as a threepoint guy when he just Ripple step inside that line and knock down the midrange jump shot well Florida state will load up tomorrow and head to the Orlando area and theyll be part of the ESPN events tournament at Walt Disney World theyll see Sienna out of the MAAC on Thursday and then on Friday theyll play either Stanford or Ole Miss Dan meanwhile Mercer is headed to Savannah for an Mt that features Robert Morris on Friday at Fairfield on Saturday for good Garys team this is always a interesting time of the year as we found out last week in our visit with Chapel Hill and Carolina both those schools that night Carolina and uh the way youre looking at those games Dan youve got to be concerned about the rhythm of your own basketball team and what you find out about your team before you get ready for the next game right and you play those games thats this time of year those tournaments those events so you can find out where you are 15 to shoot 75 seconds to go Furtado cuts it loose Cloud another rebound and thats probably enough Wes 105 to go in a seven point game in Florida State now Mercer can commit a foul and theres Walker to do so on his first that is the seventh or 18 foul beg your pardon on Mercer so one and one coming here for Jaden Jalen Worland West with the Florida State team that comes in Owen for they had to be lacking a little bit of confidence to lose that lead and still come back and win the game I think it has to be a very positive sign for Leonard Hamilton and his staff so here is Worley to see if he can make this an eightpoint game with under a minute to go first one by the front end the 101 pounds out needed three sure do heres Robertson theres zenoni in the corner over Cleveland air ball I think Cleveland got a piece of it Fletcher fouled in the backcourt more free throws with 468 to go thats a sign of some basketball smarts there Florida state knows they need to shoot a three so they go out in cover thats the fifth foul on Mercury yep so the foul on Hurtado Hurtado okay it is the fifth on Hurtado whos going to foul out with a single field goal but his contributions tonight came in a variety of other ways now he really did a nice job finding open players yep he had nine or ten assists and his teammates missed like two or three other shots Coronas into the lineup to spell Hurtado here is Cameron Fletcher at below how about his life he was terrific in the first half and hes got seven here in the second half hes got 22 by the way Florida States on an eightnothing run Dan over here since it was tied at 66 and they have to tie it at six to six because they fell behind yeah Applause second one good and in addition to his offensive effort I thought Fletcher was really good defensively tonight yep heres Robertson sneaking through McLeod blocked it Robertson took a spill Ron Gruber going to take it this this looks more like the Florida State defensive teams that were used to seeing its hard to get the ball the way to the basket with those big guys back there now the difference with Florida state is they dont have so many big guys and you can pronounce all their names usually they specialize in big guys big guys with hard to pronounce names but not this year so come on Robertson to the line one for four tonight two of five as he knocks out Applause and here comes Jordan or Braden Sparks Ill be back apart first time weve seen Sparks third appearance of the year with under 40 seconds to go he may be into foul I think you might be right and Mercer is going to defend the inbounds pass Applause and here is Fletcher into McLeod theres the foul by Robertson Tamar Robertson listed at six feet chasing the 74 nahim McLeod with something to see in the corner the cloud is going to get a pair of free throws oh hes only going to foul hed take him two more years dont forget number seven Duke waiting in the wings Bellarmine the Knights of Scott Davenport whos so far in the ACC have beaten Louisville and lost a Clemson fan standing by Mike Monaco Malcolm Huckabee the Crows nested Cameron tonight by the way Tariq Whitehead back to the lineup the other day against Delaware for Coach shot so it feels like the Blue Devils have rounded into Health right have rounded into Health but now you got to put everybody together thats it what Mitchell came on was a flurry Lively is now back in the order interesting to watch Duke especially as they kind of go through this Thanksgiving semester schedule well have the Blue Devils conference over there against Boston College for you here on acc Network a week from Saturday and now were going to get a timeout 329 left and a seven point game so Greg Gary will ground his staff Bobby cummer Kim Lewis DJ bird there well they got some free throw this that they were looking for from McLeod but if youre going to come back now you got to come down and score right at West I I dont think you have enough time to take a quick two and play defense or foul I think you got to make threes at this point yep got to stand on the line a little bit that Florida state knows that at this point in the game I dont think if youre the seminars you worry about two point baskets thought Greg Gary was candid with a stand he knew his guards had to play well tonight well and they just her her title I think gave him in certain aspects what he needed he helped control the ball they really didnt turn it over that much but I hurtados got to score a little bit furtados a guy that throughout his career both at UAB and Bryant has been a facilitator a distributor but great Gary told us that he said to Hurtado hey you got a score for us and thats one thing that Hurtado was not able to do tonight those of you waiting on number seven Duke and Bellarmine that ball game has begun on the ESPN app we will be sending you live to Mike Monaco and Malcolm Huckabee as soon as we wrap it up here seven point game with 329 to go at the Tucker Center Florida State trying to pick up their first win of the season after what has been a frustrating start for Leonard Hamilton and his staff and squatting a lot of different ways because that chemistry thing were talking about Dan thats been a real thing here with injuries and all the things theyve battled in addition to just new guys Music heres McCreary now Zenonia three got it boy thats a thats a heck of a play right there 11 for Michael zanoni who by the way played 24 minutes against Winthrop on Saturday with scoreless and missed all six of his threes they threw the ball all the way across the court to Mccreary and he threw a lot of attention and so zanonis able to step in clearly a threepoint shot thank you so theyll take a look at it oh theyre looking at the clock is what were being told by James Brady so it is a three we knew that and they put two tenths in the second on the clock the clock is supposed to stop when the ball goes through the basket good thing theyre in charge and not us well yes thats always a good thing heaven knows what would happen if we were in charge that would not be good I can promise you I just got to get it in bounds here tie out taking Florida State weve got a fourpoint game with 29 seconds left well we might be to that Duke government game at Halftime no no foreign Hamilton you know if youre the Seminoles the last 293 seconds is going to seem like any turn it is right and the point being here youre upstairs with this as much as you are literally whats happening on the floor Yep this is as confident as Florida state has played though it feels like dance but you still got to get this thing to the house if youre having his team well you do but theyve responded every other time right if they needed to uh Mercer came out and scored well and they were down early right and they responded to that and then they built the big lead and lost it and Mercer came back in the second half and actually went ahead and the Seminoles responded to that yep so theyre in great position here so youre probably going to have to make some free throws Music Corinth green Mills Fletcher and Cleveland on the floor Applause see who handles the ball here inbounds Fletcher handles gets it to Mills and theres the foul with 277 on break Sparks who you said was entering the ball game a moment ago to foul now Im an expert on that the trick on this is regardless of whether Caleb Mills hits one or two it is still a two possession game it just depends on the shot selection and again I dont think Mercer has any choice they got to go down and take a three right two shots for Caleb Mills Music Applause completely through now I dont know that you have enough time but the only strategy here is to trade two to three zanoni itd be job one defensively for Florida State Applause second one good for Mills closer doesnt have any timeouts double figures for Caleb Mills here is Walker in the backcourt Mercer trapped what good defense by the Knowles here and then Cleveland to steal Matthew for the layoff 15 seconds left zanoni shot is blocked recovered on the Baseline and a foul on Mercer Applause Matthew Clevelands got a new season High Dan of 18 thats just great pressure by Florida State you get that pressure on the ball Walker a little bit desperate because he feels the 10 seconds running out Music Cleveland looks like a defensive back there stepping in front of a receiver yep a couple of free throws here for Mills could make it 10 with 10 seconds to go here Leonard Hamilton you like to see Mills at the freethrow line yep I thought Mills was much more under control tonight it may be in a couple instances in those first four games 8171 heres Robertson gonna take it all the way down and were going to get a foul oh green challenging the drive stay tuned in 42 well send you to Durham that really doesnt matter but thats the situation where youd rather not commit the foul right but again it makes no difference two shots for Kamara Robertson if he makes the two shots then they have the same two points youd have given him Music so heres Robertson for the first of two and so it turns out to be a good foul because he doesnt get the two Arkansas has beaten Louisville Dan Boston College a winner tonight Utahs Edge Georgia Tech so far and Florida States going to get their first win here by the way more coming up at the half of Bellarmine and Duke with Drew Carter and Carlos Boozer but here tonight Tallahassee Florida state is going to win by nine 8172 nice allround effort yep Knowles are winners by nine 8172 Cameron Fletcher a season high 23 for Dan Bonner and our great crew tonight at the Tucker Center West Durham thanks for joining us now off to Cameron Indoor Stadium heres Mike Monaco and Malcolm Huckabee
