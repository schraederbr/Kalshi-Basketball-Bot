Saturday afternoon Henry Vesar and Johan Grunllo Couple of players from Europe first years in their program will jump it up Vesar gets in there but Grunlow wins the tip for the Virginia Cavaliers UVA team that is almost entirely new from last year Same you can say about UNCC their leading scorer Tessa Ritter immediately turns it over And cheering applause as we look at the North Carolina starting five it is the same as it was Wednesday which includes cheering the Virginia Tech transfer Jaden Young making his second start of the week and season And the freshman Derek Dixon in his third consecutive start And Virginia on the first possession off defensively cheering decided not to trap Caleb Wilson Caleb Wilson has been trapped the majority of his catches on the block Huber Davis going to him early but Virginia electing not to trap even still coming up with a turnover Virginias had the same starting five every game but one this year Hall and Thomas the guard Malik Thomas has been scoring it at a very high rate along with Lewis Derritter and Grunlow Brian ODM first year coach for UVA has his team right at the top of the league Duke and Clemson the clear top three in the ACC so far Thomas with the first shot of the game and the rebound to the former Hokei Jaden Young Its a cheering North Carolina team thats really good at just about everything offensively as Young misses a three Rebounded by Trimble His stick back will go Seth Trimble the only player who was in this game last year is still on one of these two rosters with the opening bucket and then Wilsons rejection right to Ditter for the first UBA Great job by Ditter cleaning up the action Thats where Virginias at its best Theyre one of the top teams in the country where averaging over 142 offensive rebounds per game UNCC turns it over for a second time with Betsar and Bessar just unable to handle the basketball in that possession A great pass from Young Best start thinking more about the basket than he was catching the basketball first taking his eyes off the prize Where do you expect Cory UVA to try to exploit Carolina defensively Well when you got to think about throwing the basketball on the inside allowing Caleb Wilson to go to work And right now looks as though theyre going to try to play him oneonone in the post which no one has been able to do yet this season Sam Lewiss shot rolls off Wilson tries to track down the rebound cheering and he was out of bounds when he had the ball to turn it back over to Virginia Thats already the third Tar Hill turnover and the Tar Hills only turned it over eight times against Notre Dame their last game out So has it been the offensive start that Hubert Davis was looking for cheering Heres Don Hall Gruno who can shoot that will shoot it and will miss a three Rebounded by Trimble Thats going to be what many people consider the worst shot in basketball Foot on the line A long two that comes up empty cheering North Carolina coming off a 9169 bludgeoning of Notre Dame Wednesday Besar too strong against one of the best shot blockers in the nation in Grunlow Heres Der good for three cheering And thats an area where Virginia may be able to exploit Often times cheering Caleb Wilson runs back into the painted area defensively with Der cheering with Bruno at the top of the key Both are capable threepoint shooters And as you watch as Caleb Wilson runs back transition on defense hes in the painted area has to close out to Ditter but too late giving Ditter way too much time beyond the arc And that is exactly in line with what Ryan Odum told us before the cheering game He said theyre going to look at finding some actions with Caleb Wilson defensively Try to get some open looks and they get one early UBA the second best threepoint shooting team in the league 37 on the year Heres Vesar an excellent threepoint shooter will be fouled by Grunlow Its the games first It was a tough West Coast trip for North Carolina and Hubert Davis last week They were swept at Stanford and Cal You really like the response against Notre Dame Wednesday They never trail They held Notre Dame to just eight threepointers and 32 shooting But you mentioned the road woes Cory for this team Theyve given up 92 points per game in their three ACC road games all losses And more importantly theyve allowed their opponents to shoot 543 in those three losses on the road as Honeyel comes in and has a immediate cheering impact blocking the shot of Jay Young and then Young tucking the basketball out of bounds So thats the dualheaded monster for Virginia on the interior Both centers tied for second at 25 blocks each in ACC play And that was the first touch It was defensively for Oanau the sevenfooter first substitution for Virginia Again theyre the second best shot blocking team in the country Only behind Georgia onu with the ball now Hes really cheering developed on this side of the floor as well And he finishes over Vetsar with the off hand Seven straight for UVA And great patience by Onensu on that cheering possession Besar took away the first option but was able to pivot back Use that left hand to finish Dixon pops it over on Yensu off the top of the backboard and knocked out to Thomas Elite Thomas kicks it Lewis sticks it Trimble attacks the rim Onensu is called for the foul A 10 nothing Virginia 1983 to 89 cheering And we asked Ryan before the game your favorite memory of Virginia North Carolina I remembered a game where Terry Holland was actually six So his dad had to step in as head coach for a couple of games including a game against UNCC January of 1989 where Richard Morgan scored 39 and UVA won 10683 That was a pretty good resume tape I guess for Dave Odum who got the Wake Forest head coaching job the very next year Yes great tape for coach ODM And in our UVA hoops group chat John Crowy who played 11 years in the NBA just mentioned that that performance by Rich was the best shooting performance hes ever seen as North Carolina comes up with the steal and Bogot steps in knocking down the three ball off of the Virginia turnover So Virginia scored 10 in a row UNCC gets some free throws from Treble A steal by Treble And then the three from Bogavots off the bench Jakari White and Chance Mallerie on the floor for UVA Mallerie the dynamic freshman from Charlottesville finds cheering White whose shot is blocked from three by Wilson Ends up in the hands of Lewis Three to shoot Lewis goes into Wilson and Bessar And Tommy Moresy will call that a good basket with a goend Yes it was two North Carolina players up around the rim Bessar and Wilson Someone touching the rim causing the basketball to pop out making it a goalending call So Lewis is credited with his second bucket Hes got five Five minutes gone by A fivepoint Virginia lead cheering Derek Dixon true freshman point guard sets up Vesar rattles it in and thats a three that will be reviewed with his foot near the line But thats the challenge of guarding North Carolina when Bessar is shooting close to 50 from three You have to be connected to where he is Onenso can make it as well but nowhere near as high of a rate as Vesar Vesar 48 now 26 out of 53 Onensu finishes over Vesar This his second bucket in the paint Well and you can see that Virginia wants to make a point of emphasis on going inside to see if they can get on they can get Wilson or Vetsar in foul trouble because the depth is not great for North Carolina on the front line How about this Cory Wilson hasnt taken a shot yet against Devin Tillis Wilson will muscle it in against the very physical grad student from LA Theres the first bucket for Caleb But Wilsons not used to not seeing that extra defender when he catched the basketball on the block now navigating oneonone and has had success And its stripped away from White WILSON RUNNING THE FLOOR AND THE NATIONS DUNK leader adds number 61 to his tally A number of people here of course are rooting for Virginia but they are excited to see Caleb Wilson Ive had many people say I look forward to watching the freshman though Backto back buckets for Wilson to tie cheering the game Heres Tillis leaning in off the window Onensu cheering sticks it back and hes got an early six Virginia once again freshing his muscle on the offensive glass 142 offensive rebounds per game which is one of the best in the country Well theyve already grabbed four of their six misses Thats our three This rebound will end up spilling over to Mallerie So Virginias taken 13 shots Theyve made or rebounded 11 And Mallerie Travel Caleb Wilson getting out in transition where hes extremely dangerous And whether he has the ball in his hands or not this time catching it One dribble the sweep over the top and then the finish with ease showing off his elite athleticism which makes him one of the best NBA prospects in this years class Wednesday had 22 seven rebounds five assists a block and a steal in 30 minutes against Notre Dame which is pretty much a typical Taylor Bolson stat It was he was slacking He averages over 10 rebounds per game That should have been his 12th double double of the season He was slacking on the glass Fair point The five assists helped make up for it He had a couple of hockey assists in there too But those assists were coming because he was being double teamed every time he caught the basketball on the block Right now Virginia playing straight up and has benefit them with Zayen Hot Early minutes for High as Thomas got fouled in transition after the game Wednesday Im seeing that early from the first year player Hall driving Nice finish cheering Don Hall the BYU transfer The great recognition by Don Hall recognizing that he has a big guarding him on the perimeter Able to go off the bounce with a clear side to get a easy bucket Right now Wilsons calling for it He had to switch against Hall So now Hall guarding the big Wilson cheering jumper is too deep over the graduate student Heres Thomas Hall with the offensive rebound Virginias fifth applause Hall a very good rebounding guard Had 12 rebounds versus Louisville last week and now gets Virginia another possession And all the time when you get that extra possession thats the best time to shoot the three It wasnt the immediate kickoff but it still counts Theres three second chance points for Guma cheering Seventh straight for Virginia after North Carolina had rallied to tie it Heres Bogabots off of Wilsons screen and he buries his second triple Bogabots who was two of nine against Notre Dame on Wednesday already knocking down his first two threepoint field goal attempts of the game Feeling good about his game on the road Valerie Grunlow again way off the mark Rebound to Jonathan Powell 2117 the Virginia lead Both team shooting it well early Wilson trying to power his way in Gets held up by Ditter Throws up a wild shot Its Monique Thomas down with his third rebound And Virginia has numbers Caleb Wilson is gassed They didnt recognize Chance Mallerie open on the opposite side Mallerie now a contestant three Who needs to be open cheering applause Virginia is Stanford who went for 36 against the Tar Hills So they point guards have had their way as Chance Mallerie knocked down a three cheering on the last possession He and Don Hall have a great opportunity to have a big offensive night Virginias doing what theyve done most of the year Hit threes offensive rebound They lead by seven Vesar could not connect to the rim Sam Lewis has the rebound for UVA which is plus nine on the glass Four different players with a three for Virginia Ditters one of them And Ditter will get to the foul line Thats what makes Ditter such a matchup scent Well over on ESPN today great day of college basketball Houston and Texas Tech the showcase game that was moved up from 630 Eastern to 2 Eastern again because of terrible weather across the country Thatll follow our game on ESPN Then Tennessee and Alabama tonight the reinstated back from the GLeague Charles Byako back for Alabama and the neverending eligibility saga of college basketball in 2026 830 Eastern tonight Well youve got two three players actually in this game that play professional basketball in Europe So when you consider Bogots who has the basketball now Derer and Gumlo have all played professional basketball But those who have exception to those who played in the G League playing have exception to guys who played in Europe playing college basketball and that has been the argument for folks like Nate Oats as Delin gets bumped and fouled applause Obviously the last couple of years weve seen eligibility there is still a lot to be figured out and it doesnt seem that theres any clear guidance right now So you see teams like Baylor and Alabama saying Hey if somebodys cleared to play we are going to allow that player to play Again you youre not breaking any rules If the rules state that they are allowed to play you consider the fact that Tester played three years of professional basketball in Europe Thats the reason he only has two years of eligibility at Virginia Luca Bogots played three years of professional basketball and he only has two years of eligibility So what the NBA excuse me what college basketball is doing they are pretty much allowing five years of eligibility If three of those years were professional then you get two to play in college Gruno only played one year which means that he has three years of eligibility at Virginia if he chooses to use them Jer up to nine points listed as a cheering freshman here but as you mentioned only two years of eligibility Hell turn 23 at the end of the month cheering And hes got a steal thrown right to him by Evans Virginia by a game high 11 Heres Lewis Vessar throws it off on Yensu And it will be North Carolina ball Crowd did not like the speed in which Henry Vesar threw that fast ball but illegal play as Wilson returns along with Dixon for UNC Tar Hills just one for their last seven This is the thing you didnt see much the last couple of decades for Virginia a fullcourt pressing defense which is Ryan ODM style Well Ryan ODM has made it very clear his style defensively is to disrupt They really havent been able to do a lot of that defensively in ACC play as far as forcing turnovers but the style of play often forces tougher shots than what opponents are looking for on one end the floor Ditter rebounded by Caleb Wilson And this is where Wilson becomes so dangerous his ability to initiate as he finds Bovots on the other side with Thomas fouling him on the three But Caleb Wilson who averages close to 11 rebounds per nine and a half point per game score mostly a starter this year has returned to the bench of Lee and he hits the first tomorrow afternoon ESPN and the the Gamecocks trying to bounce back from an overtime loss in Norman to Oklahoma on Thursday ended up losing by 12 in OT of course that game cheering One of the many special threetime national champion to go along with her threetime Final Four appearances as a player Lost in a national championship to Tennessee during her time here on grounds Two for three for Bogots A 9point Virginia lead as we close in on eight to play in the first half Virginia has been hot since a cold start The antithesis of North Carolinas Ditter has the size advantage against Trimble on the back down Ditter got applause Ditter can take smaller guys on the interior He can bring bigger guys out on the perimeter Very versatile on the offensive end Hes got cheering 11 And Mallerie picks up a foul on second chance points They cannot ill afford to do that against Virginia Virginia will bury them on the offensive glass Five offensive rebounds for nine second chance points so far for UVA That was a a big issue converting offensive rebounds in their loss to Cal last week Carolina with the ball Bogots misses a three and its Jakari White who comes down with the rebound and a jump ball North Carolina has the arrow Thats a great example as to why Virginia is such a good rebounding team Everyone crashes but more importantly your guards take advantage of the long rebounds the ones that the guy the big guys cant get to as Jakari White goes in and grabs a rebound Does go down on that left wrist but still hangs on to the basketball You see the brace for White who broke his left wrist a month ago on a dunk against Maryland cheering and missed five games Hes returned for the last three out of a double Wilson Dixon misses a three Oh Lewis and Anensu both went for the ball and Trimble comes up with the offensive rebound Hey great effort by Seth Trimble to come from the opposite wing to pick up that offensive rebound even though Dixon is unable to get it to turn into second chance points Youre going to have a lot of trouble finishing against the sevenfooter on Yensu as Bovots checks out of the game for Powell for UNCC Two of the best twopoint defenses in the country and they are two of the teams that youd imagine defend the paint about as well as anybody else as thats poked away from Derer by Wilson But the difference is the way that Virginia guards the threepoint line right now Only allowing opponents 289 from three And thats where they excel Taking guys off of the threepoint stripe not allowing them to get beat from beyond A drive and a push St Louis has seven the 67 junior Toledo transfer averaging just under 10 per game on the year and is the largest lead for UVA Well Virginias finished around the basket throughout this game so far this afternoon North Carolina has struggled once they got the basketball in the painted area to convert That ball was kicked North Carolina has not hit from the field in the last 4 minutes and 40 seconds Tarhill started five for 10 Since then they are one for 10 Heres Wilson facing up into Tillis leans in and scores it Caleb with six And Caleb Wilson getting to play oneonone from the free throw line is going to win that matchup more often than not His size and athleticism allow him to score over bigger players and hes normally going to have a speed and quickness advantage Mallerie drives it Searching for an outlet Now rolls back into Powell and finishes Chance Mallerie showing off his strength in the restricted area cheering Displaces Powell knocking him about but two feet backwards to give him room to make the layup Chance Mallerie who is the smallest guy on the floor pretty much every game has no interest in being defined by his height Well you got to be talking about height because when you start talking strength hes far from the smallest You can see using that shoulder to displace Powell in the restricted area and then just going straight up for the easy layup before can get over to effective Hes a hometown hero leading alltime scorer the most alltime wins at St Ans Bellefield School here in Charlottesville He committed to UVA under Tony Bennett He reopened his recruitment after Tony Bennett retired before last year but recommitted to Ryan ODM And boy where would they be without Chance Mallerie Wilson a tough jumper for Caleb Wilson whos leading the way with eight for UNCC Caleb Wilson once again opportunity to play oneonone at the top of the key but Virginia will live with those twos from Caleb Wilson as long as hes unable to spray it out for his teammates for three In the corner Tillis way off the mark Here comes Caleb in transition Got around Jakari White runs into Hall puts the shot up almost got it to go has NBA scouts salivating about Caitlin Wilson Its his versatility his ability to play on the perimeter not just a back to the basket guy Watch this An outlet pass to a 610 guy in and out to get to the rim and then challenging four different players to get to the free throw line and knocks down the first free throw Wilson or Bogavox have scored the last 14 for UNCC And Powells got the offensive rebound off the miss And Wilson trying to direct traffic from the post pointing to get the basketball to him on the block so he can make a play He found Vesar out of the double though He has started to take over the game Caleb Wilson but that was the first double team on the post with this game for Caleb Wilson So Ryan ODM switching up his coverages when Wilson catches the basketball Lewis cannot answer Don Halls got the offensive rebound Second offensive board for Don Hall where all the guards are able to crash on the offensive end which is unconventional Hall got Wilson in the air Knocked around back to Tillis Hall wanted it in the corner He gets it in the corner and he missed it in the corner And cheering look at Jakari Whitey OUT MUSCLES TRIMBLE TILLIS WILL TAKE A THREE BOY did Virginia deserve that Three opportunities end up cheering with three points Three second chance points Virginia just Keeper on the glass out working the Tarheelss Dicks it off the screen Unable to answer Powell fighting hard and Lewis tracks down the loose ball Tillis White air ball Caleb gets undercut and fouled by Sam Lewis So itll be a one music Zuma Malcolm thank you Yes second chance points as Malcolm said have been a big big story for Virginia 124 three runs of 7 nothing or better Caleb Wilson scored it well Hes blocked two shots How about this Cory Wilson and Henry Vesar who averaged 20 rebounds combined on the year have combined for one rebound That was from Caleb who hits the front end of a one and one and Caleb Wilson was struggling before the end of that before they got that media timeout He would have probably wanted to come out of the game but the media timeout saved Cooper Davis an opportunity to get him some rest and get him back on the floor where hes able to knock down the first free throw of the oneonone where free throws has been a struggle for Wilson and the Tar Hills especially since they got to ACC play Running off the miss Heres Thomas Wilsons got 10 Bogavots has eight The rest of the Tar Hills can combine for nine And right now Wilson just trying to find a way to get to the post with Chad Mallerie guarding him Whips it into the corner Kicks out to Evans He missed a good look for three And Hall has the defensive rebound But what a difference from what we saw from North Carolina on Wednesday night What seemed to be everyone was making a three Wilson with great hands knocking the basketball away from Mallerie spots knocking down two of those three Virginia playing with Hall and Mallerie They like this twopoint guard look at times during the game Talk to Don Hall about this He said I like an opportunity to get off of the basketball but both these guys are playmakers number one and two respectively in the ACC and assist to turnover ratio Dinner grabs his own miss puts it in high off the window 13 for Tess to Ritter and 14 second chance points for Virginia as they continue to dominate the offensive glass which is something that weve watched North Carolina do for decades And right now the Cavaliers giving the Tar Hills a taste of their own medicine All defended tremble Well Thomas bangs it home cheering right in the face of for 63 cheering A bucket that gives Malik Thomas 141 career points between San Francisco and Virginia and USC his first couple of years And Mallerie now is held by Evans Just the fourth foul on Carolina Its Evans second Virginia getting out in transition And this is truly the difference And what you see from Ryan ODMs Virginia Cavaliers versus Tony Bennetts Virginia Cavaliers pushing in transition looking for threes early in the shot clock Thomas able to knock one down to stretch the lead to 15 for the Whos coming off 23 and a careerhigh 11 rebounds and a really good road win at SMU Saturday And although Tessa Ritter is a leading scoreer on the season for Virginia ACC play has been Malik Thomas who has been their guy on the offensive end averaging close to 19 a game The Ritter ducks in and draws the second foul against Vesar Well free throw is coming up Two fouls on Vesar Beg your pardon It was Gruno who drew the foul But just a nice find from Don Hall as Grunlow is able to seal Vesar really two feet away from his teammate Glo misses the first Tonight on ABC 530 Eastern NBA rivals week continues with the Warriors and the Wolves followed by the Lakers and Mavericks at 830 Eastern Its all on ABC and the ESPN app inside the NBA pregame show before the big night game starts it off at 8 All eyes on the Warriors now See what happens at the trade deadline with Jimmy Butler tearing his ACL Will miss the remainder of this season Now does Jonathan Kaminga eventually get traded for some help for the Warriors What do you think Uh if Im the Warriors I absolutely I believe that Kaminga is really the truly the only piece that you have to be able to move to bring someone else in Wilson off the back of the rim Somebodys going to grab the ball at some point cheering will be Dixon who will lob it to Treble and Trimble got fouled on the way down by Gruno Great vision by Derek Dixon to recognize Seth Trimble whos as a athletic as anyone else on the floor not named Caleb Wilson but Trimble going for the lob Brings it back down Possibly had a chance to finish it up high before he readjusted in the air Thats the second foul on the German big man Grunlow Netsu is going to replace him Final minute 31 cheering says Trimble 70 free throw shooter Carolinas 7 for 10 today They are the third worst free throw shooting team in the league at 68 Well the silver lining for the Tar Hills is they have been a better second half team offensively and defensively even on the road throughout this stretch But for your Hubert Davis right now you want to spend this last minute and cheering 31 seconds trying to get stops on the defensive end and find a way to possibly get this to a single digit game where theyve struggled with halftime deficits above 10 or more Big foul Closing 80 seconds for Virginia which has only trailed for 12 of the seconds today The Ritter against Wilson Ditter scoops it short Knocked out into the hands of Dixon Trimble One minute to go in a first half Dominated by the home side of Charlottesville Boabots buries a step back He has kept Carolina around with three threes Big bucket for Boglevox trying to cut into this lead right now A 12point lead If the Tar Hills can build this under 10 going into the halftime locker room theyll feel good about some momentum on their side Thomas got free too deep and North Carolina will have it with 35 seconds to go Simple down screen to give Bobots a good look to step back Able to knock down the three over the outstretched hand of a much taller defender And now Bogabotss handling the basketball to try to alleviate some of the pressure on Dixon Bogots have been just 6 for 28 from three in the last nine games Three for four today Dixon dribbling out the final seconds of the half Carolinas got to get a shot up here Dixon against Onensu Step back triple High arcing three is good So Carolina gets two threes to end the half Virginia leads at the break but the Tarheelss cut a 15point deficit to nine and get 10 defensive rebounds Virginia as you mentioned has nine offensive rebounds So well see if the Tarheelss can tilt the scales a little bit in their favor on the boards Theyll start on defense in the second half down nine And Malik Thomas unable to make it 12 Hes just one for seven cheering But that time Jaden Young clearing the defensive rebound And often times its been those long rebounds that the guards for Virginia have gone in and come up with offensive opportunities Caleb Wilson with 10 in that first half He and Bogavots both in double figures Wilson too deep and an uncontested rebound for Gruno Tester Ritter leads Virginia with 13 Sam Lewis had a big first half Hes got seven nine points in favor of Virginia The absolute same as the halftime lead for Virginia going into the locker room Two points for Lewis whos got nine had been scoring pretty well of late until last Saturday at SMU Hes picked his offense back up What do you like to see from Carolina offensively to start this half Well lets see how theyre going to guard Caleb Wilson when he catch the basketball on the block No double team however where the double team comes late Nice disguise by Gruno which forces Wilson to get rid of the basketball right now North Carolina looking discombobulated on the offensive end until Seth Trimble bails them out with the three ball Its all fun and discombobulation until the ball hits the bottom of the net Trimble hits his first three of the game Leads down to eight Grunlo got position on Vesar Finishes over Vesar and Grunlow has six Second time weve seen Hall and Gruno connect on those tight spaces but still Gruno able to seal Vessar and finish over the top Wilson again this time against Ditter Lewis is lingering Wilson to Young back for Vesar Carolina along the perimeter The freshman Derek Dixon into the corner TRIMBLE SAME SPOT AND SAME RESULT BACKTO back threes by Trimble as hes starting to feel a little more confident in his shot in his offensive game as hes returned now for close to a month from the broken forearm A lead down to seven Heres Hall Offensive rebound Ditter No offensive rebound again Grunlow smothered by Vessar It stays with Virginia and Del on the fourth shot of the possession Have we said that before Scores it And again youre talking about two elite rebounders and Wilson and Bessar being dominated by Duter and Grumo on the glass Dixon one foot shot for Derek Dixon will go and Derek Dixon telling his teammates to box out pointing out Bessar and Wilson Young with a strip and steal ahead to Dixon against Hall DIXON WILSON SLAM AND HERE COMES CAROLINA WITHIN FIVE THE Virginia native Derek Dixon from Vienna is right in Northern Virginia making plays on the last two possessions to get North two freshman Derek Dixon who was the hero in their road win their lone road win on the season at Kentucky making big shots down the stretch now becoming more of a leader for this team Tremble it out of bounds Hubert Davis talked during the week about Caleb Wilson and how vocal he was Hubert said When I was playing maybe I said one word my freshman year maybe five my sophomore year Things have changed so much And hes got to be so thrilled that a team of players he really likes is getting a little more vocal leadership from its freshman Yeah and and the things have changed significantly because freshman now are often the best players on the floor which is the case for North Carolina but Hubert and I both played in a time where you come you pretty much had to wait your turn to be a leader but you know Ive always been vocal so its never been a challenge hard to believe Dixon off the window Wilson tips it to Vesar and North Carolinas on a 196 run the Tarheelss have pulled within three and it all started at the end of the first half knocking breaking down those backtoback threes to make it a singledigit game Thomas will answer with a big time triple and a much needed bucket from Malik Thomas whos been the guy that Virginia really has relied on during ACC play cheering to make big shots Sixpoint lead four minutes gone by in the second half Dixon finds himself alone Dixon sticks another three But a breakdown in pick and roll coverage on that possession Ditter and Hall getting mixed up allowing Dixon to have a wideopen look Hall driving Hall with a good finish Backto applause back buckets for Virginia to stem the top And right now Don Hall having a conversation a heated conversation with Griff associate head coach for Virginia about the defensive possession on the last play Dixon Heres Bogabots who was hot in the first half Not so here Thomas flies in for his fifth rebound to go with six points And Thomas goes right into the body of Dixon Got the ball back Derritter Stripped by Wilson whos shown elite hands a couple of times today and then steps into Thomas to draw a twoshot foul I tell you what dont believe it was actually Aldrich who made the mistake It looked as though it was supposed to have been a switch between he and Ditter Ditter did not switch on that possession but the point guard is always at fault I learned that early in my time here on ground cheering Even a graduate student Denon Hall even one who had nine assists and one turnover last game He has steered the ship to see Griff Aldridge who was a long head coach the last seven years Took a long to their first ever NCAA tournament done a great job and deciding to come back to the University of Virginia with his old teammate his Hampton Sydney teammate from back in the day Had those two guys playing oneonone before shootound It was slow motion oneonone by the way And they were reliving their 17yearold days Ryan ODM was a fouryear starting point guard at Hambit You know sometimes you say a team takes on the identity their coach Brian ODM is the alltime leader in threepointers made at Hampton Sydney So it makes sense that his teams would be prolific threepoint shooting teams And thats what Virginias been this year And thats saying a lot because from 1992 to 1996 when Ryan ODM was playing college basketball the threepointer was not used at the same rate that it is today So thats a nice record to have By the way the previous coach here was a pretty good threepoint shooter too Yes On Yensu end of the shot clock hell hoist a three It didnt hit the rim A shot clock violation Just the seventh Virginia turnover And North Carolina which was down 16 with 205 to go in the first but we can tie this game We talked about in the first half Carolinas a better second half team And so it was simply about getting the lead under 10 having some positive momentum going into the locker room which really has started this effort from what weve seen of them here in the second half The other thing is they havent turned it over since early in the game Three turnovers all in the first half Stevenson gets fouled by Mallalerie here Chance Mallerie picks up his second And and North Carolina had three turnovers before they had three points in this game as Jiren Stevenson tries to catch in the post Chance Mallerie with two hands in the back going to pick up the foul Stevenson coming in for Bessarabots in the paint Bogavots with A SMOOTH TOUCH CUTS the lead to one Bogots playing with great confidence in this game on the road recognizing how much his team needs him and his experience on the road At 22 years old hes one of the veterans on this group White blew by Wilson on the switch and Jakari White is the ninth Virginia player to score And then Wilson runs the floor and finishes through an injured Onens able to finish and outrun Onensu to the rim Wilson finally gets a break cheering Vessar returns to the game Whos lead the Heels by one Mallerie and he was fouled Lets go back to this pass by Dixon the length of the floor Well this is the way you play as a Carolina point guard First off North Carolina runs after makes or misses Derek Dixon advancing on the pass finding Caleb William Wilson in transition Thats what you saw from guys like Kendall Marshall They were able to pass the basketball They werent the speediest guys on the floor but their passing allowed their team to be able to play fast Derek Dixon doing a great job looking ahead Well Isaiah Kayen Evans who is a Colorado State transfer struggled this year 57 points per game not really shooting it So Derek Dixon got the chance to start on the West Coast road trip Some folks had been wondering when Hubert Davis would make that switch He made it three games ago He scored double figures now Dixon in backtoback starts and he has eight today How good can he be the next couple of months Where can he grow to lead this Carolina team Well I believe he could be the future of this program and I would hope that hes not a guy thats going to be putting his name in the draft this year So he can be the point guard for this team moving forward And again hes not the prototypical speedster that Carolina normally has at the point guard position Hes got great positional size and tremendous skill Powell for the tie to short and Tillis will track it down Jakari White up the floor All nine Virginia players have scored now with White who steps back into a three A very difficult shot Powell secures the rebound Dixon again eyes up finds Stevenson Derek Dixon with his fifth assist and Jiren Stevensons first basket Advancing on the pass The pass moves much faster than the dribble does Derek Dixon taking advantage looking ahead keeping his head up and finds his teammates running the floor Oh slithers into the lane too long Grunlow kicks it to Mallerie A brick is grabbed by Powell cheering Hubert Davis calls out a play cheering Powell retrieves it from Dixon They go work with Stevenson against Hall A size mismatch Hall holds his ground Hall is as strong as it cheering gets being able to get a low base Stevenson slams North Carolina into cheering its first lead since the first basket Another defensive miscommunication Two players on the ball leading Stevenson wide open for the easy slam 5958 What a rally by North Carolina which was down 16 with 205 to go in the first Grunlow again seals off Essar cheering this time he missed it Dixon again he has a big man laying the floor and Stevenson is pushed in the back by long long way to go Cora and UNCC has used a lot of energy to get back in this game but even with Caleb Wilson on the bench theyve been able to maintain control Well what youre seeing right now is Virginia who is one of the best offensive rebounding teams in the cheering country and Ryan ODM has made it very clear often times when you crash the glass with all five players you may give up things in transition And what North Carolina has been able to do in this second half is pretty much keep Virginia to one and done on their shots and get out in transition beating their bigs down the floor often times for early layups which has allowed them to build a threepoint lead Eight fast break points already in the half 15 in the game for UNCC against a Virginia team at one of the best defensive teams in the nation Don Hall with an offhand answer Good allaround game for Hall whos got six points six rebounds and three assists And Don Halls been able to find his way to the rim as Derek Dixon continues to find his way to the rim beyond the threepoint arc with dropping dimes whatever it has been hes been able to have success here in the second half Double figure game for Dixon Third straight game hes done that Sam Lewis gets in the paint and scores it 6362 And the Virginia student starting to make a little more noise cheering Trimble floats it home Hes got 13 back to a threepoint Carolina lead But give Hubert Davis credit for his adjustments right now by putting that side ball screen It takes away the help as Gumo is off the mark from three Virginia will maintain possession as the basketball went off of Seth Trimble But if you look at the last possession operating that side screen and roll takes away the opportunity to take Bessar out of the play Trimble is navigating the screen to roll getting right to his spot in the middle of the lane able to go to that midrange shot Trimbles played a really nice game 13 points four of five two of two from three three offensive rebounds two assists two steals Just a level of activity from Seth Trimble Its not surprising but was necessary for North Carolina with their slow start especially on the road is where you expect for your seniors your leaders to step up and make plays for you when you need it most And theres a turnover Stevenson had a good close out on Lewis and Sam Lewis stepped on the out of bounds line Youve heard me say it so many times before its the most common turnover in the game of basketball when you consider theres not a lot of space for guys who most more often than not have pretty big shoes So therefore there is no retreating Every step has to be taken forward Anything backwards is going to be a turnover Were midway through this second half Derek Dixon has played the first 10 minutes of the half Hes navigated the team brilliantly Bessar into Stevenson again Has the size mismatch with Hall Doing his best to body him And Stevenson just sticks a turnound in his face Stevenson very similar to Derek Dixon were heavily recruited by Virginia coming out of high school Both had great relationships with former associate head coach Jason Willilifford And Virginia was a target for both these two guys And now theyre here on this floor making a difference against the Whos today Lewis five to cheering shoot it Treble got his hands up Thomas drives it into Vesar and draws the foul applause Malik Thomas with free throws coming for UVA Besar with his defensive presence but often needs to look to him to be more aggressive on the offensive end and provide a spark and putting some points on the board Dont forget coming up in just 23 minutes over on ESPN The College Game Day crew is in love for Houston and Texas Tech Already seen this game this year A great one in Houston The Cougars won Tennessee and Alabama for the big game tonight at 830 Eastern Those games over on ESPN and the ESPN app Houston just quietly rolling along with only one loss on the season undefeated in Big 12 play And this will be a great test against JT at Texas Tech Whats new for Houston Its pretty much business as usual Kelvin Samson continues to build one of the best programs nationally cheering Folks want to see a couple of great freshman There are great freshman in that game including Kingston Flemings a point guard for Houston Now folks think Kingston Flemings may be among the first names called in the draft Kingston Fleming the fastest player in college basketball point A to B Im sure there are some people that will challenge that And Im sure Kingston would be up for the challenge On Yensu back on the floor no ill effects after the injury that knocked him out onu is four out of five for eight points and Virginia is back within two cheering Caleb Wilson back on the floor guarded by Mallalerie and its A TRAVEL AGAINST WILSON Great job by Chance Mallerie pulling the chair on Caleb Wilson For a big guy you want to make sure you know where a smaller guard is but theyre trying to defend you That time as Wilson went to back down Mallerie Mallerie pulls the chair gets out of the way forcing to travel The first turnover of the second half for North Carolina just its fourth of the game Lewis gives it to Mallerie The freshman spark plug ties the game at 67 cheering No Dixon on the floor for Carolina Bogabotss initiating Wilson Evans No And cheering Wilson is called for a foul Running right through Mallerie once again from here in Charlottesville A local hero Nine points couple of rebounds couple of assists a steal set two great defensive possessions on Caleb Wilson And both teams have been hot from the field here as we head down the stretch Virginia trying to win it six straight after an opening ACC loss North Carolina looking for its first road win in the ACC this year Tess Ritter with seven to shoot Guarded by Vessar Ditter puts his head down and gets it to go UVA is back on top 6967 and Ditter has 17 And lets think about what has happened to the Tar Hills since Derek Dixon went to sit down Dixon now at the scores table cheering ready to check back in at the next dead ball But the Tar Hills have operated completely different on the offensive end without Dixon Evans uh force three Once again it was Mallerie guarding Wilson and they couldnt get him the ball And Chance pulls up for an air ball Now thats rare Ive watched this young man play basketball since he can walk And I dont think Ive ever seen Chance shoot an air ball especially in transition wide open Thats his shot Cester Ritter was not thrilled about Chance Malleries shot selection Let him know about it before giving him a warm embrace But thats when as a point guard you have the right to tell the big guy Shut up and go play some defense laughter Well Dixon is back on the floor now guarded by Mallalerie What an impact these two freshman have had Bessar They threw it right to Mallerie but there was a foul in there And I think that foul is on Chance Mallerie guarding Wilson Its Mallers third Well Mallerie with the right arm around Wilson Thats cheering where the foul was originally but on the pass attempt in caught Mallerie in the face with the elbow Some fans wanted a review The officials wont bite I mean would would you as an official go review that when Tommy Morris was right on top of the call Stevenson got knocked over by Wilson but Steven forces out of bounds Stevenson fortunate Wilson coming in and thats almost like falling on the offensive tackles legs after the play Fortunately Jared Stevenson is able to get up and run away from that one Six minutes to play in Charlottesville Mallerie lobs it Too tall for Anu And Onensu back behind the play Sprints back into position Vesar Stevenson three No rebound to cheering Mallerie applause Malleries got the big Stevenson on him Hell use a screen Hell penetrate and hell reset Stevenson is more than capable of guarding Chance Mallerie when you consider Stevenson came to Chapel Hill as a member of the Alabama Crimson Tide last year and guarded RJ Davis So hes taken on a number of challenges guarding much smaller players That time Chance able to take advantage of the mismatch once he got Stevenson away from him And a big foul there Its the fourth on Henry Vessar who has had a really difficult day Seven points only one rebound Vessar who averages 17 and nine and has been in double figures every game Mallerie buries the first to two Luca Bovots will replace Vesar And so Carolinas super big lineup gets dented by Vesars fourth foul And now what you see is the possibility of Virginia getting back to crashing that offensive glass with a smaller lineup on the floor for the Tar Hills This is where Virginia becomes even more dangerous shot once their shot goes up Virginia 12 of 14 at the line cheering and the Cavaliers are on a nine nothing run to reclaim a twopossession lead Wilson guarded by Anensu comes over to set the screen Dixon for Stevenson That three is good Jiren Stevenson with all 11 of his points in the second half and Jiren Stevenson playing very confidently on the offensive end of the floor giving Hubert Davis huge minutes here on the road Theyll switch Stevenson on to Ditter the Tarheelss Ditter spins his way to the bucket applause cheering Heres Wilson operating against Onensu Scores it cheering Boy those were three quick moves Ratat from Wilson against one of the nations best shot blockers And its a onepoint game again Thats Wilsons advantage when hes going up against bigger players Hes normally going to be quicker and faster And he used it on that last possession to get a bucket Mallerie driving on Boabots Now Hall for Thomas A deep one No good And look at Donald Hall gra another offensive rebound The point guard with his third and it will lead to free throws for Taster Ritter What an awesome scene weve had in Charlottesville music today Jiren Stevenson off the bench showing up with 11 huge points for the Tar Hills off the screen and roll able to pop knock music down a huge three But on the other end is Tessa Ritter making music magic happens Mike Tomlin did for by the way from the great state of Virginia 757 Mike Tomlin did 19 years there on the sidelines Mike McCarthy You know what Deemed that the Steelers have more Super Bowl wins than we do Great hire Steelers laughter Chuck Null Bill Cower Mike Tomlin and now Mike McCarthy steps in I cant believe my guys did me that way 7472 One for two for Derritter Virginia in the lead Fabulous game here to kick off a great Saturday of college hoops Heres Caleb Wilson A game high 18 for Carolina Five double figure scores Stevensons one of them and he misses a three for Virginia Lewis is back on the floor along with Grunlow with Hall Ditter and Thomas Hall has had a productive day on both ends of the floor doing the job defensively as well as attacking offensively running the show Hes the unsung hero of this team had a big block in the closing seconds against Boopy Miller Saturday Oh thats going to be a back court Oh it should have been It is It is Okay Roger right there on top of it Hubert Davis also right there on top of it I believe originally thought someone tipped the basketball but there was no North Carolina hand on that one 10th turnover against Virginia cheering Three minutes to play Still no Vesar out of the game with four fouls Its Wilson Stevenson Trimble cheering Bogavots and Dixon Heres Bogavots off a screen Gives it to Stevenson Hes been the man in the second half And he scores TO TIE THE GAME PLUS A FOUL Jiren Stevenson with a second half takeover So you know what I noticed most about that celebration is the core strength that Jiren Stevenson has as he attacks the basket the pump fake the finish But watch this KB Hes flexing before he goes to the ground and his head never touches the ground Thats strong C I know you know nothing about core strength However that is cheering great core strength by Jared Stevenson Stevenson completes a threepoint play Ive only heard whispers and rumors throughout my life 7574 Nothing in the first half for Stevenson A bagel 14 here in the second and he scored 14 points in 13 minutes in the game Now Malik Thomas driving on Stevenson who cuts him off Mallerie back on the floor for Virginia Ditter gets it to him Mallerie no good Big rebound for Wilson Trimble Trimble going all the way AND HE SCORES IT WITH A FOUL SETH TRIMBLE ATTACKING North Carolina slicing the middle of this Virginia defense can stretch the lead to four at the line But what the Tar Hills have done in this second half by taking care of their defensive glass they have tested Virginias transition defense which has not been up to snuff here in this second stanza Seth Trimble attacking oneonone and able to to finish through the contact of Malik Thomas An opportunity for a threepoint play the oldfashioned way Trimble is five for six Two for two from three and three of four at the line About as efficient a 15 points as you can have cheering And a big free throw here would make it a two possession game cheering And thats exactly what he does 7874 North Carolina cheering which was down 16 leads by four with 220 to go A lot of contact between Ditter and Wilson Tess has the ball going after the freshman Ditter makes his move and draws the foul Smart play by Derritter taking his time recognizing is to see if North Carolina will bring a double team or a trap with no additional defender coming Takes his time gets to his spot and forces Caleb Wilson to reach in or that would have been a bucket for Tessa Ritter Its just the first foul second beg you pardon against Wilson Ditter five for six at the line and misses the first one Ditter who made two Sorry Cory Tar Hills will highlight next Saturdays quadruple header against Georgia Tech picked Clemson in there as well Thats one week from today ECC Network and also the ESPN Ditter made two huge free throws at SMU to close the game Misses two big free throws here But how about Don Hall once again getting involved in the mix The basketball will be awarded to North Carolina right in front of Ryan ODM as he looks to his back bench to determine and theyre Virginias going to challenge this saying that the basketball was off of the Tar Hills But as the play happens right in front of Ryan ODM hes immediately looking at his staff to determine whether this should be a challenge or not The out ofbounds goal is being challenged by the University of Virginia Remember in the past officials could review out ofbounds plays in the final two minutes which is exactly where we are now Now outof bounds plays can only be reviewed on challenges So well see whos the last to touch the ball Was it Wilson It looks as though Caleb Wilsons left hand was the last to touch the basketball Although Ditters hand I mean Halls hand is in the mix he does not touch it And Don Hall is immediately signaling to challenge this play once Mark awards the basketball to Carolina So a reminder for folks the challenge North Carolina trying to do so now After view the ball is clearly off for UNCC Itll be Virginia ball on the sideline with 20 on the game Jump So Virginia maintains its timeout Has two remaining North Carolina still with three Two minutes to go and the Tar Hills have the possession arrow at a fourpoint lead And Mark Nur wanting to move the basketball back down to the point of interruption where it went out of bounds Both teams in the bonus shooting oneonone Heres Derritter They get it to him into Stevenson and an offensive FOUL DROPPED BY Stevenson whos been the man of the hour Ta Ritter trying to talk Tommy Morsy into the fact that Jiren Stevenson moved but it looked as though Stevenson got established I think a lot more of it has to do with the fact that Ditter really turns his body and lunges into Stevenson Great call by Tommy Morsy right on top of it cheering 11 turnovers for UVA only four for UNCC Dixon with a kickback Stevenson YES SIR Great action great design by Hubert Davis knowing that Caleb Wilson will attract so much attention allowing Jiren Stevenson to knock down another three Jiren Stevenson with a second half of his life and Thomas with a much needed answer His three answered the second three for Jiren Stevenson All 17 Cory in his second half His best game as a Tarheel and when his team needs it most on the road in a hostile environment Stevenson stepping up and making plays on both ends of the floor But Malik Thomas is not done yet knocked down a three ball to make it a fourpoint game Jared Stevenson a young man reclassified committed to Alabama after Carolina had been on him for 2 years Went to Alabama for a couple of years went into the portal and he told the Daily Harill They impressed me when I was a freshman So coming back cheering I felt was the right choice back at the school where his mom was a star and his Tar Hills lead by four Closing in on the final minute of play Dixon into the paint Dixon with a tough shot off balance Easily blocked by Bruno Heres Don Hall for UVA Fourpoint game HALL DRIVING cheering HALL SCORES it right around Bamas to cut the lead to two cheering Caleb Wilson will walk it off the floor for North Carolina and Hubert Davis uses his second timeout Get the bodies in order with 438 to go and the walls close Davidson with 17 points all of the second half for Carolina Caleb Wilson leads with 18 They are in the game with Bovots Dixon and the inbounder Seth Trimble who gets it to the freshman Derek Dixon Dixon guarded tightly by Don Hall over to Caleb Wilson Wilson long steps off the BACKBOARD AND GOOD Caleb Wilson with an But coming on the road and playing the way that they played here in Charlottesville win or loss has to give them some confidence moving forward on the road in ACC play Plenty of time to go here Mallerie Thomas in the corner Got a late close out by Stevenson He draws the foul against him Good play by Malik Thomas who will shoot two with 246 to go Its Stevensons third foul But with any other defender Malik Thomas gets a three off Jiren Stevensons size his height his wingspan allow him to even be late on that close out but still run Thomas off the threepoint line and force him to have to score at the free throw Right Thomas not a great free throw shooter Solid 70 Rims out the first Virginia has missed some big free throws here in the second half cheering Second free throw applause That ones good 8380 Sam Lewis will check in Those of you looking for Oklahoma Missouri thats starting on the ESPN app Well get you there as soon as were done here cheering Next foul will be a one and one Virginias committed seven Inbound to Dixon Heres the double team Dixon fouled instantly And Derek Dixon free throw Gruinow back for Lewis So a good percentage for Derek Dixon but not a lot of free throw attempts this year The former Gatorade player of the year in Washington DC cheering from Vienna Virginia buries the first free throw cheering A season high seven assists an 11point game for the true freshman 32 minutes only one turnover Dixon way short WILSON HAS THE OFFENSIVE rebound and Mallerie will foul Trimble And thats the reason Groom was subbed back into the game Brian ODM took out Sam Lewis for rebounding purposes to put Grunlo back into the game Caleb Wilson able to go over top of Grunlow and come away with the offensive rebound And now a twopossession game with Trimble at the free throw line trying to make it a sixpoint margin Its still a one and one cheering for Trimble 70 at the line In and out Virginia still has a shot Malik Thomas transition triple No good Fight for the ball Pingpongs out to Bogavots and hes fouled with 9 seconds to go And North Carolina is oh so close to for the North Carolina Tarheelss this week If they can cheering shut the door here Bogots will shoot two cheering and he missed the first North Carolina struggles at the free throw line and their struggles have shown up here late with a fourpoint lead Only 9 seconds remaining Noar Hills on the line cheering Bogots hits the second 8580 Virginia needs to score as quickly as possible Mallerie got to put it up He does He misses Its Derek Dixon How appropriately The North Carolina Tarheelss get their signature win of the season 8580 at Virginia A huge road statement
