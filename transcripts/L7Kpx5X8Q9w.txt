was their largest comeback under Mike young and they just feel like theres a renewed confidence for a team thats had success in the ACC tournament in recent memory ly kid wins the tap against Huntley Hatfield and away we go Hokes on the road in the white coming off that comeback win at 16 and 13 overall and with the top five offense and ACC in top 35 in the country heres the Northwestern transfer Robbie Baron missed on the follow away and a rebound for Huntley Hatfield who we spotlighted along with Clark James and white all at 13 points per game and then the true freshman Caleb Glenn has brought a ton of energy and hes been ascending recently for the cards in Black at home there is white missing short kid clears it we check out the Tech starters with point guard sha padulla the leading scorer and hter Couture fifth year senior second at 14 a game and its padulla who starts the scoring padulla is coming in this game playing really really well he cut down on his turnovers really efficient from the floor and but the Hoke you love to see first shot go in as they create a turnover here on the defensive end of the floor padulla gets fouled by Clark after kid tipped it away all right so you talked about that comeback for Mike young in his Fifth Season at the helm his biggest comeback win in his five years and as only Mike young can say in the first half I was tight as a banjo string what do you think its pretty good yeah that is pretty good no Mike young is its one of the you sit down and talk to him and hes so passionate about the game and so much energy hes a fun guy to be around and I love to hear him to talk about his players because hes brutally honest about his guys other great Mike young quotes this season by the way Mels got that big old body like a tree stump on Fon Reed for Wake Forest the big man the seven footer who they just faced hes big as a house he is ever quotable and one of the real fun head coaches in this leag to talk to I love his quote about Sean padul he says hes all gas and no breaks yes that ones getting a lot of mileage as H fans know this season so for zip first 9 seconds and Louisville goes to work offensively with the cards at 8 and 21 3 and 15 as we showed you in the ACC and coming off a sixpoint loss to Syracuse and theyre struggling with turnovers in the early going heres Kenny pay and you asked him today whats the biggest key to this game and he said take care of the ball they have to nearly had an unforced turn over there the hogies are going to sit in gaps and and really jump to the ball so Louisville has to be careful of turning their back and spinning on their drive and penetration offensive rebound Brandon Huntley Hatfield off the Caleb Glenn Miss with the shot clock winding down Glen is calling for it hes matched up with the stretch for Robbie Baron couldnt get it to go big match up there between Glenn and baron who wins that matchup MJ Collins connects his best game of the season and his best scoring game in two years collegiately was in the first meeting between these teams three months ago when he had 20 and he was three for three from long range hes coming in well hes confident against the matchups but hes also the secondary ball handle for this team as Bradley hunting hfield gets to turnar around he knows the double is coming so he try has to go quick he cant allow them to continue to double team him and take him out of the game great adjustment by him no was coming turns faces drives thats what you want to do against a double team turn it face it gives you options to find an open teammate or attack it like he just did other end heres Baron popping cant stick it offensive rebound padulla attacks and its a foul on sky Clark MJ C Collins has struggled from behind the threepoint line this year but comes off here off the ball screen shakes up squares himself up and knocks it down big sign for him I think he just loves playing Louisville right now the way it looks like throw the throw the percentages out by the way second foul there on sky Clark so he goes to the bench in the first three minutes and Tyler Johnson Four and black the Speedy freshman from Brooklyn comes in Off the Bench for Kenny Payne I think the game begins once he gets in the floor he just makes a difference when he comes in because I think he and Burton are the fastest two guys in the ACC with the ball in their hands and cant simulate their speed in practice pocket pass from him to Huntley Hatfield who missed the jump shot Tenny Payne told us he wants more defensive consisten though from Johnson as you see there Ty Johnson gets caught in the screen doesnt fight over and get through and Shan Padula wont find an easier shot than that sevenpoint lead for the hokes Mike James cant hit the corner triple one of their leading scores at 13 a game like we said and coming off 18 and8 Saturday in that lost to Syracuse Couture got fouled its on M James one thing the Louisville prepared for was was skot Clark out there they had their size advantage in the back court and it would allowed them to post up the smaller guards but now Clark picks up two fouls and Johnsons that changes things now so thats one thing you were wondering about seeing and you also mentioned that the double came from the Hokies on Brandon Huntley Hatfield what other matchup wise do you think is most important here in this game well how does Louisville Wings space does anyone cut to make it easier for Brandon Hy have to the last time he got double everyone standing on the per he needs someone to cut so it makes his read easier you cant allow the Hoke to take him out of the game and make him in a perimeter player and he needs to stay aggressive even though he knows the double teams coming set of screen for James with the rescue it malel potit in Off the Bench is now tked with Huntley Hatfield and he commits the foul great start for the hokes on the road up by nine in Louisville early of the ACC regular season three months after the first meeting between these teams that we mentioned that was a Virginia Tech win but it was tight throughout no it was it was a very close game and and as you saw there the biggest differen is the the bench production and for both teams and and again you got to figure out a way if youre loable to get the ball to Bradley Hunley Hatfield as much as possible and allow get him in space so he can turn and face see the double team coming gets him going and he can find teammates as well Robbie Baron sticks the second Hoke triple and a good sign for him you got to take something away you cant let a Mike young team just freely move and execute their offense Glenn downhill new offensive foul on the Freshman Caleb Glenn theyre sagging off the Lal Wings theyre conceding threepoint shots you got to know when youre driving someones going to be there playoff two feet Elevate finish will kick out kick it outside the three but theyre trying to control the the hes are trying to control the paint here early in force Lille who mightily from Perimeter only shooting not as bad on the year I mean theyre 29 on the year and they put theyre streaky from behind its just threes is not a strength of this team they want to drive and get to the paint hter Kor off a screen buries a three Virginia Tech has opened up three of four from long range Kenny pay cant be happy with that that play they walked through he screamed getting through that final screen eliminating that three from hunor but its easier said than done Curtis Williams The Freshman for Louisville known for his shooting hes into the game for Kenny Payne shot clock winding down on Tyler Johnson Huntley Hatfield the cut gives it up for Williams knocks it down he had been one for his last 20 from three The Freshman from Detroit as the first non Huntley Hatfield points for Louisville the pass wasnt intended for him it was sometimes its better to be lucky than good on that one it was Ricochet it off one of his cutting teammates and Williams said Ill take it its a foul out of Elijah potit drawn by xan pay the sixth year Senior Walk on Hanukkah T set in the back screen and again coming off no one is better at shooting off screens great footwork and knocking down another three pass intender for Trey white Williams says thank you very much Ill take that three from the slot lets see what Louisville goes here in their offense again trying to get the ball moving in space getting it to Bradley Huntley half field on the move oh that is a nice move and and you love his game I do I think hes one of the more skilled big men in the ACC dont let the record of Lille fool you hes a talent that could play for any team in this league and us you dont find that on teams that have struggled at the bottom of the league its skills but you also told me you love the way he moves and just the natural gifts because you cant teach physically what he has hes banging with kid who walks with it so Brandon Huntley Hatfield does it on both ends I mean youre talking about a guy good defense there on the other end but he set comes up he sets the screen Cates his pocket pass on the move and just finishes thats a skill that not many have and you have to respect his ability to pass tipped away and it stays with the cards its 12 points nine rebounds per game for the season for Brandon Huntley Hatfield but his last eight games its 17 and nine and hes been really good you see the double doubles hes got consecutive games with double doubles coming in I think his ceiling is 20 and 10 I think hes one of those guys consistently yes I think he has that ability in him because now you know you see he can turn faing the post he sees the double team coming hes able to drive slower bigs post up smaller bigs heres kid had the mismatch against white and he scores his first points the problem Louisville has now is someone else has to step up and create offense right now everything is going through Bradley Hunley headfield Scott Clarks out with the two fouls so whos it most likely to be for Louisville its got to be Tyler Johnson hes got to keep his dri there and someone elses and thats what he does that can get other guys involved but Louisville spacing isnt great Williams missed the shot off the feed from Huntley Hatfield and the hes have it8 minutes in ahead by eight on the road early Run for the Freshman Jaden young gave it up to the Carolina transfer Tyler niichel and he gets a friendly roll he called glass on that when I heard him just plopped it down off the back of the rim Zan Payne hits a three and scored his last seven games in a span of more than 60 minutes and he sticks one from long range the first three of his career you cant make him unless you take him the Hokies are daring them to shoot theyre sitting in the paint when they get penetration off the dribble or post up you got to get your feet ready and attempt them early who knows tonight may be your night nichel can answer and a good battle by Kid leads to a young triple coach is upset with zaye there son his son leaked out he was at half court when a shot shaded out three long shots of long rebounds and about that yeah he was trying to get himself ready for another bucket Tech by 10 Huntley Hatfield shut off by Kid theres a double and it prompts a turnover MJ Collins at the controls nichel wants another cant hit and pay the rebound got to push in simple as well dont let the Hoke defense set Johnson can do that gets it to go and a foul well Zan Payne has played six seasons of college basketball this his 55th game and its his first career three ACC at its Duke at Carolina and this was all the scoring we had in the first meeting the greatest robbery in college athletics is that game coming up and I Im just excited about it to see how it turns out I mean Dukes playing really well right now got a win last night against NC State and Carolina has been best team in the ACC from the start and super excited to see how that turns out Carolina at 15 and3 in the AC and theyre playing right now on acc Network at home on senior night against Notre Dame and at last check up by three kid cuts to the block hes matched up with Caleb Glenn so hes got the size Advantage kid goes to work turns away from a double and a battle on the boards and a foul against Trey white okay so we talked a little bit about Virginia Tech and where they sit as it relates to the NCAA tournament jool lardi says theyre considered hes got him as their 83rd team on his board the net is 57 this is a quad three game simply put you cannot lose this game if youre Mike young well I think either way you cant lose it for the purpose of seeding for the ACC I think for them to get in they got to win the ACC tournament I think thats their best chance for those guys in theyre going to have to Leap Frog too many other teams would have to call back to them and I think their best way is to build momentum toward the ACC tournament get the buy one less game you got to play and make a run like theyve done in the past hang on a sec they they made this a shooting foul so Robbie Baron gets a couple appeared to be on the rebound and uh if youre a Louisville fan youre saying ball dont lie on that its another look at the foul being called did you think shooting foul maybe hey it was called a shooting foul I mean Ive never known the ref to change it after that so well on this one they did yeah they didnt call they called it a shooting foul was it yeah I thought they flipped it afterwards in any event its an eightpoint lead 10 minutes in Trey white off the to the Baseline for three two strong pay runs down the offensive rebound and the pancs are going crazy here Johnson off the bounce shadowed by The Freshman guard and it does stay with Louisville with nine to shoot with this lineup is on the floor now I think Tyler Johnson has to get aggressive get to the rim Force rotation and just for will just keep the spacing he changes the game when he comes in and what Hunley hat fi out of the game right now you need to have the ball in his hands to create for his teammate hle Hatfields got eight of the 16 for the cards down by eight Williams pulls up thats a tough shot and Nichol got the rebound for Virginia Tech its padulla nckl Couture Collins and baron small lineup out there for Mike Young gives it up to Collins coming off 11 points and five assists and hes got his second three hes just catching it just sizing him up that shot was contested padulla the deflection and the steel and Collins looks good he wants another couldnt connect Johnson pushes some of the tempo you talked about gets it back from Caleb Glenn and initiates the offense hok know they got to get back make this team play against a set defense theyre not overplaying anything theyre just sitting there trying to close gaps theyre getting deflections and they want to force those type of shots really good contest from Hunter Couture and your point no fast break points on either side in this game the hes have done a good job getting back against Louisville padulla goes spinning and he draws a foul hey the ACC mens basketball tournament tips off Tuesday March 12th starting at 200 Eastern time at Capital One arena in DC top eight looks like this right now we told you Carolinas at the top Duke a half game back after that win over the pack yesterday and then for the other couple of spots for the double buy there is still a lot to be sorted out a lot to be its a lot to play for thats what you want coming down the stretchier and I think the only team that has a forur spot is I think Virginias in now but theyve already they got one game left and theyre home against Georgia Tech and for everyone else youre fighting and it matters a double bu still one double bu spot to play for and in the final single spot so and again if youre Virginia Tech you were rooting for Florida State to lose at pit late night Williams misses baring the rebound Virginia Tech up by 13 and looking to add to it on the half field back into the game and right now its Glenn on kid on the blockout around the screen back for Baron kid someone for lble is going to have to eventually knock down a three kid pivoting and scoring through two talked about his footwork hes just trying to feel your bodys he pivots off either feet hell go over the left or right shoulder and just got to stay down and just keep a body on him stay in between him and the basket Kenny pay needs a timeout Mike Youngs got to like what he on the road in the ACC their only Road win this year you got to go back to late January at NC State and its also their only one in the last calendar year and you asked Mike young about it and he said look Im frustrated Im tired of talking about it and Im tired of thinking about it he did he he was animated about it and he just said you know what there no excuse for it we just got to step up and you got to win and and he challenged his guys and like he said he thought that his team took a step in and their comeback went at home against wake and he expected his team to come and take care of business and so far here in the first half they have Mike young also pointed out to us a lot of good teams have struggled on the road we were talking with Lynn kid about it as well and he said yeah weve struggled on the road but I think tonight will be different he said were confident coming here off the big comeback there was is huge for us he just picked up his second though a guy whos had a great season one of the most improved players in the league the parts he has hes improved his scoring so much and we talked about his improved footwork shooting 66 from the field and not third in the country James walks with us yeah its the biggest increase in points per game in the ACC Lyn kid and hes third in the country field goal percentage as well he sits with his H up 15 thats a development thing credit to Mike young I mean Sean padulla made a big jump like that his you know his freshman a sophomore year Couture gave it up traveling called so weve got one at both ends if theres one thing that happens that slows the hokeys down is turnovers they will they are acceptable to turning the basketball over when they run their offense they always fun to watch they they have so many sets and counters and their counters have counters and you got to be disruptive against those guys like James buries a Music triple third three for Louisville they get back within a dozen with James coming off that big performance Saturday against Syracuse padulla gets bumped gets it to go and its the third foul on sky Clark who just came back into the game with his two and now hes saddled with three big three here for James because he really wants to play off that shot make it get to the pain and just a great job by Shawn padulla initiating contract contact shooting off one leg and Clark just gets back in the game and picks up his third foul heve been back in for all of 3 seconds hes got to go back to the bench hes done for the half now with those so where do the offense come from ohley Hatfield throw in the Baseline and now tries to get positioning on malijah potit Pos physically strong enough to push him off a spot white no dice from d and Hunley Hatfield just tumbled coming back up the floor and hes grabbing at his left knee oh man you just never want to see anything like this starting to make his way back up the floor and fell down he made the pass kicking out to Trey White at the start of this sequence obviously well get you another look at that as Huntley Hatfield does get to his feet and walk off under his own power off toward the tunnel Brandon Feld might have just stumbled a bit going down the tunnel as well lets have another look I hope for the best for the junior big man Glen the rebound off to padulla miss so Louisville dealing with a little bit of everything in this first half and of course thats the way this season is gone you got your point guard on the bench with three fouls you got probably your best player out of game without hes your best player and your best player whos playing well and because of his double teams he was creating for himself and others as Trey white decides to step up here and hes going to have to come out figure out a way to get himself involved in the game as well his first points after he started 0 for four niichel the midrange jump shot his second bucket but it has to start in the defensive end for the Cardinals I I mean in EC play theyre giving up 81 from the floor 48 from the field and 40 from three and the hokes are on Pace to even surpass those numbers and they have to figure out a way to get stops they raate as the worst defense in the ACC according to kenpom and theyre facing an elite offensive team with a Playbook as deep as anyone in the country yes I mean and they they have so many different plays en counters when youre playing a hog you have to take things away you got to be disruptive you just cant let them run and execute their sets couple of Hoke fouls here this ones on Baron the one prior on Collins what was it like preparing to go against a Mike young team its you know what you have to have your defensive principles and to stick to your principles because theres so many plays you dont know what hes going to run you just I think you practice things that are in similar to your playbook and then you just review things that you may not have and then you just prepare your guys for what the counters are but the main thing you do is you need you need to be active with a ton of energy and just try to be disruptive and take certain things away you cant give them everything you cant give him threes free throws and layups inside you have to take something away Mike James got the offensive rebound Johnson cant bury the three Andor clears it for the hes and you got you got to pressure the hes because this team is susceptable to turn the basketball over more so than they have been the first four years under Mike young Baron Corner three second triple for Robbie Baron like theres a mistake there you never help off the strong side corner theres another turnover here you never want to have turnovers either for DK yeah and grinning at his teammate MJ Collins coming back down the floor MJ would try to tell him throw it back to him for the lob or throw it off the glass hun was like no way in the 100th start of Hunter Coutures decorated career leaded 19 coming up on four to go white recovers late shot clock turns it over thats an ugly offensive possession yeah not much on of head and I think Tyler Johnson has to continue just be aggressive I know you had a turnover they dont cut they dont match up there Baron sticks another and this is a bloodbath boo come out here at the Yum Center it is all Virginia Tech Corner three there by burn Breakaway dunks Hoke having their way up 22 doubling up Louisville AC on ESPN back in Louisville where Virginia Tech is ating the Cardinals but if youre a Louisville fan youd love to see this that Brandon Huntley Hatfield has returned to the bench area and we just got word that hes good to return in this game you see him now hes doing some strength tests there to see the stability in that leg and everything must have checked out for him to be cleared to come back in this game great sign for the Cardinals he just flashed a thumbs up right now and is jogging back over to the bench area and hes headed straight to midcourt to come back into this game you want to get him in the adrenalines flowing before he stiffens up from being out of the game meanwhile Mike James gets the roll had pulla on the Block using that size advantage and thats what we thats what we talked about earlier the the size in their back court was something that they were going to go to and I imagine with Brandon Huntley hled out of the game theyre going to try to go to a little bit more until he gets back in well the rare Miss for Virginia Tech in this half have been connecting at 65 sent from the floor before that misfire and theyve knocked down seven threes Glenn on the Block against nichel its great off the move tried to drag screen there get Baron the Hedge Glenn rolled inside was able to turn and score before Baron got back on him and need to play with Pace that is not called a kick and instead its Baron in the corner up top Collins hits another MJ Collins third three theres just no hesitation you know hes just catching it as confident as ever right now and knock down his third three here in the first half if you look back at the film of the first meeting between these teams MJ Collins looks like a different guy when he had those career high 20 we told hes coming off a very good performance as well Saturday against Wake Forest young the reverse had it roll off in transition see I think here you got to push Pace attack the rim well Brandon Huntley Hatfield does return to a nice round of applause good to see him back out see the tape around his knee glad hes okay tape around the right knee saw he had been grabbing at his left knee when he was down on the floor Pat wesler is into the game for the hes as well with the margin at 21 Johnson tried to split turn over number eight of the half for Louisville padulla for Baron extra pass Collins off the shot fake its Baron swirls one out Lo Lucky in that defensive possession never got matched up Bo another costly turnover from the cards up top Collins goes soaring Collins was calling for that early running the wing they missed him the first time he made sure to let them know he was available that time and Up Up and Away with the slam there if Hunter Cs not going to give it to me well maybe the Freshman will Jaden young and he did hes telling the Freshman you better give it to me youre just a freshman how about the half for MJ Collins hes got 11 tied with padulla for a game high Collins I mean just showing you hey Im much more than just a threepoint shooter getting out on the wing really good perimeter Defender as well hes evolving into a heck of a player for Mike Youngs H we asked Mike young this morning when hes at his best what is it like how do you tap into the best of MJ Collins and he said really its when hes not as concerned about his offense as he is with the defense and rebounding that that stuff comes first and then youll get more efficiency offensively hes playing with enough talented players on the offensive end of the floor if he just competes with hun Couture as the best perimeter defender on the team the ball will find him is just like it has so far this game I mean hes not forc in anything just like that wesler couldnt finish off a couple of good feeds from Baron and Collins and by the way this is Virginia Techs first 40 plus Point first half theyve had on the road this season its another Louisville turnover Collins In transition at the controls and Mike Youngs gone to his pinch early here with Kesler and young in its many minutes here early in the first half and even the other freshman guard Brandon reiners in the game as well wesler skipped it for Baron late shot clock this is Collins spinning on white and Johnson poked it away 27 left for Virginia Tech to work with by the way most points for the hes in a first half this season 53 against Clemson Mike young takes the timeout well take it as well back in 30 triples and a dominant performance at the center Virginia Tech at 8 10 coming off that impressive win over Wake Forest with the huge second half in a quad three game they dont want to lose trying to get single by and avoid playing on day one on Tuesday in DC and next weeks ACC tournament Mike James went driving hard right at Robbie Baron was a little bit slow to get up sky Clark does start the second half for Kenny Payne with his three fouls and for the hokes the 49 points led by 11 from both Collins and padulla heres post entry for Lyn kid who only played 9 Minutes in the first half with a couple of fouls and he gets a late foul call he told us today to your point in the first half that over the years with his Improvement his Player Development he thinks the footwork is what has improved the most and you saw it there hes filling the body of Brandon Harley hfield hes hes fing them and he spins he knows he can go over either shoulder and Kenny Payne told us he said hey you know early in the year we were like hey take away his left shoulder he wants to get to that right hand hes improved so much he goes over the other way and now you just got to play him honest he told us every morning in season at 1000 am he goes in for an individual workout with Ace custus Hokes Legend Who of course is on the Virginia Tech staff and that thats where that move in particular and the footwork in general comes from he learned from one of the better players there I mean Ace was a heck of a player in his day and the interesting thing is he reminds me of you he must be a night a cuz he said early in the morning at 1000 am I was like oh hes going to say 6 or seven yeah early in the morning at 1000 am when I work when I work out its like really okay douet turned it over clark with a nice dribbling Baron went straight up and Hunley Hatfield follows and hes got a dozen for Louisville but if Louisvilles going to get back in this game thats the pace get down attack the rim if your guards get in the pain to attack The Bigs if the shot is blocked or altered like that you want your bigs to clean it up kid face up spin move footwork on display kicks out for Kor driving on Glenn got to his spot but missed it I thought Couture had the three wasnt ready to shoot it on the catch told you in his 100th career start 48th game hes having the best season of his career statistically Hunley Hatfield couldnt get the face up to drop the Hoke run Padula saw the opening lost the handle thats one of the turnovers you want padulla has done such a great job of taking care of the basketball as it turns into a transition three there for Louisville from Mike James and Kenny pain steams got it down to 14 remember Saturday against Syracuse trailed by as many as 19 in the second half but cut it to four in the final 40 seconds cha padulla answers right back his first three and the ninth for the hokes you can sense that was coming pulla had to unforce turnover the previous possession there and mix up in a l defense didnt communicate on a switch on thefield driving tried to tip it alive but Collins secures it for Virginia Tech padulla surveys Collins hits the Gap couldnt lay it in got it back Couture Rises cant connect and the rebound to Music Glenn Hunley Hatfield on the Block spins into a double down to the deck got it back again and somehow found Clark who turned it over a dozen Louisville turnovers and padulla got Applause fouled Bo the opening has been here for Noble to go on a bit of a run a couple of costly turnovers yeah theyve had the opportunity there and just theyre just unforced turnovers as well just settle down hit the open guy and I think the fans are unhappy with the foul but it definitely was a foul they just whistled it late it looked as though as if he had made the shot they would have conceded it but it definitely was a foul hit padulla across the head trying to block the shot padulla is six of six at the line featured lineup Saturday starts with big city greens its back for the NHL match up between the Bruins and Penguins on ESPN plus Duke Carolina in Prime Time Sun Celtics on ABC and UFC 299 in Miami that crowd didnt like the late whistle and padulla splits hoks lead at Music 18 Hunley Hatfield drives on petite and Dono yovanovich getting some run Johnson wide open theyre going to get those looks I mean the Hokies are going to conceed the three you got to make enough just to get them to close out a little bit to open back up those driving lanes conceding because Louisville is 29 from three this year worst Mark in the ACC its a skip for nickoll cans it 10 three for Virginia Tech good sign there for tile nickel and he didnt hustle back and Glenn draws a foul because of it second on nickel starting to heat up a little here get a kick to the corner and Ty Lord Johnsons knocking down his three 15 points six assists and only a couple of turnovers turnovers well documented for padulla this season but in his last five games only six in total before that averaging nearly four turnovers per game Mike young talked to us this morning we said whats changed and he said hes being more of a point guard instead of a walking assassin shooting me in the foot I you know and I asked I said it looked like earlier that sha Pulu had so much responsibility and felt so much pressure to create for himself and his teammates that he was forced and things and Mike young admitted he thought that he didnt help him enough earlier in the year and sometime those things take time and Mike young team Co point guard yes sometimes you know sometimes helping a guy like that is taking the ball out of his hands and uh hes hes settled down and and they Mike young teams always played better in the second half of the season and Seans playing elite point guard play right now Mike young said its night in and night out where theyre getting the highend performance from Padula who clears the James Miss and Virginia Tech in control up by 17 in the first 5 minutes out of half timee here in Louisville nckl comes up to get it Pula off a screen guarded by yovanovich fulah Hoy cant connect and the rebound to Glenn thats one I thought he could have attacked had to Mitch Match there and settled for the three on Hatfield met by a double yovanovich finds James finishes and a Applause foul James doing what he does best getting in that paint forcing contact and forcing the a whistle to fist to blow the whistle here and catches it does settle not many better in the ACC than drawing fouls than that young man third in the league in free throw attempts Judah minz of course is the leader in the ACC in that category and James with 10 points by the way Virginia Tech Mike young they recruited Mike James pretty hard so a lot to like about his game you should I mean its a big Wing improved jump shot rered his freshman year with the injury and its good to see him back out there this year healthy and further you get away from that a couple years removed from the Achilles Couture wide left from three know coach Manning recruited him a lot when he was still at weight for Johnson a blur around the corner here is James Payne moves it Johnson no Collins the rebound so Virginia Tech shooting 49 from the floor thats down because just two for seven here out of halftime couple of Threes more turnovers than buckets these first 5 and a half minutes kid unsuspecting kept it in bounds for Collins five to shoot Collins connect you knew that basket had to go in pulla throws it off the back of a teammate and it stays in bounds finds Collins so you know he had the basketball guys are on the Hoke side so far here tonight 13 for MJ Collins he and padulla have combined for 28 about half of the Hoke output James with post entry to Huntley Hatfield oneonone now a double got his own Miss follows it up and a foul he knew the double team was coming there just elevated his second jump is so quick missed the first shot elevated and cut the rebound before kid H Baron could get it I mean hes sees it coming he runs right into the double he knows its coming early quick off his feet put a chance at an n one three on kid so malijah potit will now take his turn against Brandon Hunley Hatfield and with potit in they tend to leave him one onone and I think it allows hat Huntley Hatfield to drive him more off the dribble when kids on him he tends to theyre theyre doubling from the post from the low post petite at 265 compared to 235 for ly kid Couture shadowed by James Collins is feeling good too strong push Tempo and to get him a drag screen or something to create some movement James sticks it its down to Applause 11 Rex Steiner CED it up off the screen but it does stay with Virginia Tech thats what tyo Johnson has to continue to use his speed not just on one end of the floor on the other and here you have to help you see Hunter Couture helps there on Johnson and James walks into one the crowd is trying to get the Cardinals involved and getting them going to support them and get them back in this game Lee Cassel and Jeb Hartness come together for a quick Applause conversation and looks like we are good to go crowd is into it and now Kenny Payne getting out of the way of Collins for an Applause inbound got a lot of moving Parts here yeah its a lot going on neither coaches is happy right now they get the shot clock situated at 21 no change of possession they said so no reset Virginia Tech trying to stem the tide a bit heres Baron whos knocked down three of the 10 triples for the hokes Couture draws a foul against James its two on Mike James All right so if youre the hokes here sense Louisville hanging around crowd has started to get into it a bit how how do you stop it right here and get back to the W you were in a game youve led by as many as 23 they just need to run their sets I mean just get back in executing their offense and taking care of the basketball they got the lead they got a little sloppy couple of careless passes ill advised shots and and it just takes the momentum out that you had away good ball movement here from Virginia Tech and it leads to potit with it rolling off has him in single digits since it was 2416 Midway through the first Johnson to yanovich back to Johnson met by Rex Steiner Huntley Hatfield couldnt finish tipped it out kador hits the gas and will pull it out poate corner kick and now Collins with Huntley Hatfield on him into potit size advantage on James cleared him out and finish yeah a great job by Collins identifying a matchup there was a switch there he had Hunley Hatfield on him and James was in a post when you have that when you caught in transition like that you cant match up when youre a guard and youre in a big guy like that you just want to front pretty mature from Collins instead of just jacking the three in the corner on his own to sense that mismatch and find Pati on the Hatfield into a double back out with five to shoot its Johnson he rises buries it 10point game with his speed Mike you got to back up he is so fast with the ball in his hand shooting the three is not a strength of his only 19 but hes knocked down two of them tonight weve seen this a handful of times from Louisville this year they get down huge they dont entirely go away Barrett answers right back you got to control your emotion and just be solid we talked about it many times with a Mike young coach team they got plays they aint got counter to those plays you just be solid stick to your defensive principles Johnson backs it out coutur on him now pay shut off by Baron and a turnover 13 for Louisville who is hanging around with Tyler Johnson hit hting a couple of Threes here at the Yum Center but the hokes have had answers theyve hit 11 of their own starts in Houston with the Rockets hosting Kawai and the Clippers at 730 Eastern then Giannis in the bucks on the west coast against Stephen the Warriors trying to bounce back from that demolition at the hands of the Celtics coverage STS with NBA Countdown at seven on ESPN and the out youngsters have watched Louisville shoot it a bit better here in this second half including four of five from three as Randall Childers theyre somehow able to hang around down by 13 they have I think the the kids thought that they could come out and help the way they were shooting in the first half I thought they were ready to put on a jersey and come out and help him but the cers have turned things around here in the second half and theyre heating up from behind the line goinging four or five here in the second half and theyve kept themselves within one big run of really getting back and they get right to a 10point lead and then cant get a stop lets see if they can continue to put pressure on the hokes weve gotten four threes from Robbie Baron a season high he wants a fit cant hit potit one arms an offensive rebound but had it knocked away Payne without numbers finds Huntley Hatfield going right at poti and he draws a foul great job by pay there for his teammates and I think Huntley Hatfield is just so versatile he catches it off the move Powers through poti Barons coming to double team and he knows its coming so he has to attack quickly I thought it was pretty impressive watching Brandon Huntley Hatfield that shoot around today which for Louisville is more like a practice the way they go at it hard and for a while on game days I mean he was in a full sweat this afternoon knowing that in about four hours or so he hes got a ball game this guy is working hard it is and and to know that he you want him playing 35 minutes its not like hes playing like ly kid knows petits going to get they can go 20 minutes 20 minutes each and split this is a totally different team when Huntley Hatfields not out there and I think hes their best player and needs to touch the ball it leashed every other possession down the floor they doubled him and he turned it over see that time I thought he turned he kept his back turned to the double team when you know its coming turn and face face up on the double face up on the double potit stayed patient underneath and malel potit got his second bucket the lead back to 15 for Virginia Tech Mike young doing Mike young things there so used to potit popping to the top of the key that time they ran the counter and slipped in a little back screen guard didnt stay behind the help and its the easy two James comes up to get it shot clock below 10 around the screen down the lane gets the roll still plenty of time here just to do that drive it keep your spacing if you get a three you take it game high 16 for Mike James potit was posting up and now Couture Baron moves it padul attacks Johnson on the Baseline potit the cutter and he gets fouled 16 game high for Mike James great job here to screen by Hadley huntfield Hunter cou hits the ground and he cant get back in front of the ball and Jame does a great job of getting an angle there to finish Brandon Hunley Hatfield needs a breather so hes going to check out hes been locking horns with malij and Lyn kid all night how about the value potit has brought to the hokes yes senior who in his last 10 games is averaging 10 points per game and hes doing that in just 17 minutes per game and hes also doing it with a left knee that is swollen and so the hes are cautious with him and how much he practices trying to limit the wear and tear and hes so physical the way he plays on both ends of the floor hes throws his body around and hes so productive because he knows what he is on the offensive end he gets his teammates involved he likes to get over to that left shoulder to that right hand hook hes coming out getting the rest here now and Hokies are going to a smaller lineup taking advantage of Brandon Huntley Hatfield time on the bench because Louis is now with a smaller lineup again Hunley Hatfield took himself out he needed a breather so small ball on both sides Payne up top James moves it Johnson wow Nifty wow heck of a finish from Tyler Johnson Tyler Johnson with the Kyrie Irving is lay there to the other side of the rim thats what he can be at his best he is just down here with his speed driving a close out Kenny Payne said to us today hes got to know what he does well offensively and a lot of times he said its taking a two instead of a three just got to I mean hes just you just cant make up for that speed its just hard to simulate and practice and if he just takes care of the basketball and continue to get deep in the paint playoff two when you can finish like that as he improves his jump shot young man from Brooklyn is going to be a handful Collins cant connect Zan P the rebound inside of eight to go second half with the lead at 13 for the hokes the midrange yeah you want get a drag screen and then you can kind of create thats something hes going to have to learn he playing with so much emotion Niel yes sir three for Tyler nichel and a dozen of them for Virginia Tech so many guys turned down shots there the initial penetration by badulla Baron gets it at the top he shot fakes and skips it and turned down a good shot for a better one Glenn yeah its really unselfish offense from the hokes and if youre loable continue to attack the rim theres no Rim protection in there with Huntley half field out he cor for is out of the game nichel missed it yovanovich the rebound and heres Johnson left it for yovanovich the Miami transfer looking for somewhere to go with it yeah dont overthink it just shoot it he got the pass from the point guard it had a message on it and it said shoot it tough follow Applause it guy who hadnt played the last two games came in with only 18 points in 18 games this year Dono yovanovich heres padulla yovanovich to transfer from Miami and playing with those group of guys hes probably like hey Im not used to getting shots a little hesitant to pull the trigger cins no chains were a wagon last year all right deficit at a dozen Louisville with it Johnson for pay he wants another didnt have it baring the rebound I see a drag screen or something to help him out out Kenny Payne is barking at Johnson telling him with this lineup you want the ball in his hands to create its either his or James Couture off the screen thought about it padulla back out Nicholl another and Virginia Tech has matched the season high with 13 threes and theyve had responses every time up by 15 on the road in Louisville accomplishment too I mean committing to a school like wake that was not very good at the time and finishing with a conference Championship and just so much success that we had there and the memories of so many great teammates and friends that I still have today and just a time youll never forget in a in a tournament I think thats just the best of three pretty good games yeah not Laughter bad Tim Duncan also there he was the big fell was there Brandon Hunley Hatfield hits a three from the corner only his seventh three of the Season deficit at a dozen for Louisville hokes with five minutes to go trying to get their ninth ACC win of the Season trying to keep those hopes alive in DC for a single buy got to win both this week need a little bit of help as well Ken left it short and here come the cards great defense there by Huntley Hatfield staying in between the basket the ball in basket forced land and shoot over top James no pretty good look for the cards yeah its a quick shot though just keep chipping away you dont need a big shot there he didnt need a three get the ball to the second and third side of the floor nichel was looking for padulla here is ly kid Collins back out nickel quick trigger as always back iron Kyler nickel three threes on eight attempts James Clark Huntley Hatfield Glenn and white the five starters out there right now for Kenny Payne white short off the shot fake on Collins Oki content to slow the pace as the clock drips under four to go this is how they want to play get to their sets you got to be disruptive here you cant Trail the plays like this and that look was there if they just didnt turn it over Collins got ambitious Virginia Tech by 12 Witham couple others going on right now Carolina looking convincing at the Smith Center against Notre Dame and then over on ESPN 2 huge game Syracuse at Clemson big opportunity for the orange trying to get a quad one win what it looks like Clemson is in control there under seven to go on that one thats a big game you know for that Clemsons trying to secure a double bu and so is Syracuse and fighting for that final spot Hunley Hatfield on a reverse underneath and its down to 10 the lead for the hokes coming up on three to go rph chers Mike Monaco our entire crew with you from The Young from the Yum Center game Virginia Tech is led by as many as 23 theyve knocked down 13 triples padulla off the bounce against James nearly got stripped recovered late shot clock nickel Rises cant hit but an offensive rebound and kid drew a foul on Mike James inside of three to go its Virginia Tech by 10 on the road if the ACC tournament started right now heres what it would look like two questions first one whos your favorite I dont know how you pick against Carolina or Duke I think theyve been far away the two best teams in the league and of the two though of the two i say Carolina I think theyve been the most consistent if not those two who is next most likely you think to win the ACC tournament I think Clemson is I think Clemsons the team that shown you they can beat anybody you know when theyre dowed in and theyre defending they are a tough out and I expect them to get in the tournament and win a couple of games as well right now in that five spot but one of the many teams who could get that double by trying to do so here in this final week of the regular season kid with the bucket the lead a dozen two and a half to go Virginia Tech trying to keep those hopes alive of not playing on day one on Tuesday next week and an extra day matters Baron the foul yeah it does I mean Virginia Tech knows it just a couple of years removed from going four wins in four days seven seed lowest seed ever to win the ACC tournament and they they have played more of their guys here early in the first half but some of these guys hadnt played much you know uh Rex Steiner he played in the first half he hadnt played in the second half but he played some its really been a sevenman r its been a sevenman rotation and four games in four days will force you to go a little deeper on your bench so it was good for those guys to West with a couple of guys to get some minutes here can you do it with seven though I think its tough I think its tough with seven guys four games in four days is just a lot and it really its a lot when youre a jump shooting team kid with the hook shot you so many teams rely on threepoint shooting and the hokeys do as well and making jumpers over the course of four days is not easy thing to do Hunley Hatfield the last to touch it and its Virginia Tech basketball 93 seconds to go Louisville meanwhile locked into the 15 seed staring down being 3 and 16 in the ACC last year and this year the the two worst records in the history of Cardinals basketball in 110 years yeah its been a tough stretch here and just a level of that not many have seen around here in the Louisville basketball program and kid got fouled with 109 to go thought it was real interesting talking with Lyn kid today and all the work hes put in yes was telling us he had to take two weeks off this summer because his body was so sore because of how hard he was working every day he would do two separate individual workouts in addition to the team lift and the team practice so four different sessions in the course of a day man what do you expect with the early morning 10 am workouts man but no seriously what what was great about the story was just him talking about how he learned from Justin muds and those veteran guys and what they what they meant he he thought he worked hard and then Justin mut showed him how hard he needs he needed to work and he just as he saw the work paying off he just wanted more and more and averaged five points last year and in any opportunity put Vil leaving and he just felt the opportunity just to allow him to get more minutes and he comes back and he takes full advantage of his opportunity here and there he is got fouled again hes got 10 and nine in this one going to the free throw line with 35 seconds remaining so Virginia Tech trying to get just its second Road wi of the Season like young said to us its a struggle anywhere in college basketball its hard to win on the road and he pointed out Wake Forest who he said he thinks is a very good team thinks theyre an NCAA tournament team he said look theyre two n on the road this year and he pointed to Kansas said The Jayhawks are only three six on the road this year its tough to do its very tough to do but if you want to be an NCW tournament team you cant go two and nine a row you just cant and as difficult as it is if you want to go dancing you got to figure out a way to try to get to 500 or a little bit under that and the key to offset that is you just got to take care of business at home you think about Wake Forest thats something theyve done 15 and0 at home this year Headed into tonights game about to get started over on acc network with Wake Forest hosting Georgia Tech you can also check out ACC action later tonight on ESPN 2 another big game with Florida State at 99 in the ACC at pit at 10 and eight both coaches dip into the benches here for the final 30 seconds Curtis Williams Rises up to strong P wesler the rebound shot clock is off and Virginia Tech comes into Louisville and gets its second Road win of the Season convincing offensive performance Mike Youngs team puts up 80 and the hokes are 10 in the ACC still got a chance to get a single Buy in the tournament next week in DC starting to come around and play better on the offensive end of the floor and if they can take care of the basketball this will be a difficult out
