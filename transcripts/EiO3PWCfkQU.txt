35 years old thats as long as Leonard Hamilton has been a head coach and John sire who has played every role in a Duke uniform hes not played hes been a starter been a best player and hes come off the bench so hes the perfect guy to be able to talk to James Breaks about coming off the bench Duke at 103 FSU had four and ten after a really ugly start but playing better lately they had won three of their last four games and Duke will get that first cracking on here today Applause more lively the 71 freshman and quickly they give it right back to Kayla Mills on the Baseline watch Matthew Cleveland number 35 thats how the Seminoles go yeah hes been their best player especially over the past four games where hes been double numbers warley with an air ball and hes got crowd even though the students are not here hes still going to hear it it is still Cameron Indoor Stadium theres something about this building youre talking about a guy who was two for two in his last time out from threepoint range shooting an air ball in the first possession Duke of course had that absolutely grueling November so this is just their second game in three weeks so you wonder how sharp are they going to be against FSU yeah and you also have to think about the fact that Derek live whos in a starting lineup and the reply to both those guys did not play their last time out so getting them acclimated after 20 days off were only The Talented sophomore nearly gave that one away thats the start really doesnt cut it for FSU they began the season with four consecutive losses to Stetson UCF Troy and Florida made some Shockers in there yeah absolutely some chocolates in there especially when you consider the dominance that Leonard Hamilton has had over the State of Florida throughout his tenure at Florida State way downtown a misfire by Blakes but right back out for roach a little fire it up and miss so kind of chilly opening 90 seconds here for the Duke Blue Devils nope this is not a great shooting Duke team they hang their head on their own but the longer this game goes along and theyll allow Florida State to stay stable build more and more confidence Music quick strike there on the back door and you get your best player Matthew Cleveland and ends up for him as this game goes along Matthew a candidate for the Julius Erving small forward award they asked him about that and hes delighted that was going to be brought down the Sky by Lively a big time block by Lively and also a smart play by Kyle for Lebowski to throw the basketball off of Cleveland whos laying out of bounds to maintain possession or retain possession for the Blue Devils but youre talking about high level block so Matthew Im sorry from Derek live again his 23rd leads the team talented youngster youngsters hes an ACC Rookie of the Year really hasnt played up to that ceiling is so high in a lot of ability hes one of those guys you see him covering up the rim can also shoot the three and finish Applause 17 off the bench in the Lost away of course as you can see hes playing with a lot of confidence coming into this game after having a career performance did you like the lineup switch I do like a lot of switch simply because youre getting leadership as well as defensive ability going up against Florida State and they like to put pressure on you you have the other ball handler and Blakes who really was the backup point guard so now John Shire starting the two point guards in his lineup similar to the way he and Noah Smith able to follow the 17 against Wade thats all well and good six out of seven they lost that game by the way shy really likes is what he brings energy wise to the team as you say defense one thing to Duke has done all season long they play defense they played defense and legs is a competitor competitive it wasnt one Applause is one of the guys who guys whos earned his way onto the floor and hes done that by Defender theyll see if that and hes also true in the starting lineup the blanks hooking inside Mitchell back out blanks will launched and a triple on the money doesnt hurt the fact that hes been knocking down the three ball as well and thats where Duke is struggled this season yeah hes been reliable hes been one Duke player who has been 37 percent outside the three goes on the drive a wild play there and an offensive foul hell get hit with a charge and Jeremy Rose got in great position but early enough to wear Caleb Mills really could have kicked that one but Mills decided to see if he could get the bucket great job by Jeremy Rose getting his feet outside of the restricted arcs absorbing the contact and taking the charge FSU of course last year decimated by injuries still managed to beat top 25 Duke last year in overtime in Tallahassee Duke got their Revenge here at Cameron Indoor Blakes nice handle gonna be tipped out but right back to FSU and on the moon comes Worley Applause drains that Applause was sent from three from 3C that top that being inside the line knowing that the Blue Devil was going to run him off making me really explosive 30 35 Ford Dukes from the corner the jumper on the way and out by Roach Applause three percent start to his year Applause much taller Defender and Mark Mitchell with Mitchell Mark Jackson says Music that pulled up by roach and a little too strong batted around Duke will get a second effort Mitchell inside will draw the foul with 1515 to go here in the first half you see Darren Green stepping up from way down Mark Mitchell the McDonalds AllAmerican out of Kansas City Kansas going to the rack a moment ago and had some punishment his wife and wife basketball court gets it right across the face and forcing to see Mitchell back on the floor those are the ones that can hang around for a while its definitely especially if they catch you in the aisle trying to shake it off but staying in the game thats when about a week later you see a guy wearing goggles yes a very good reason youd ever happen do you ever like break your nose not I think I did break it a couple times going through it huh but you know and of course back in the days I sell super oh saying that many of your injuries you would just go to your trainer and say my nose is killing me yeah you probably took one but we I dont think we had like masks and you know they were goggles then but I wasnt gonna wear goggles right Im not going to mess up the money maker over you know how this goes oh I believe me I mean America would weep Applause could be doing the money maker Memphis by two final moment ago in Darren Green and fsues Ryan young has been a blessing for the Blue Devils one rebound away from a doubledouble against Wake Forest but he has been spectacular for them off the bench when Livelys not available and then of course stepping for the starting lineup at times the Lively Applause particularly offensive glass where Dukes been real good shot clock down to five five loose ball well he got it here green gets it off but short ly goes back over to the Blue Devil some type D it really was and Jeremy Rose getting on the floor after the basketball just the hustle in itself but Florida State in a tough predicament when they got the basketball back not much time available on the shot clock had loss against Wake Forest 8170 on December 20 this is their first game since then their other losses besides that came to Kansas and Purdue who both look like final four teams right now they absolutely do Purdue it was probably the best team Music it or they were able to knock off the Blue Devils in Portland at the pka k85 batted away proctored they think better going to the Lane like that again in the game a guy that really needed for FSU and he McLeod a 74 junior he has been out because of the Achilles injury theyre just getting him back for the first time in many weeks it hasnt been much of a consistent lineup at all for the nose broach Applause Music looking to work good two more Brian Young had eight offensive rebounds verse four against State and hes off to a Grace Dawn two already here early in this game Cleveland in the paints another effort cracks at it Cleveland driving hard left that one shorts and whats the call here thats going to go the other way 97 Blue Devils Luke is second nationally in offensive rebounding percentage and Ryan young is a strong part of why you think about the opportunity to pick up Second Chance points which bolsters this Duke offense each and every opportunity Music dude trying to pick up their 11th win of the season right now ring number 17 tonights getting into the starting lineup gives it up for Mitchell tiptone through that lane theyll swinging his right hand shot for look another offensive Proctor good opportunities well I mean one of the one of the game of basketball to get more shots than the opponent when you got a guy like Ryan young getting jobs on the offensive the times youre going to win that battle Royale sealed Applause Music coming off a grueling November but they havent played all that much here in the last few weeks downstairs young again and hell take the hit hell be at the foul line to shoot too and one of the things that has to happen when you play against Florida state theyre going to switch one through five you have to find a way to be able to attack those mismatches as we look at the Blue Devils who played 12 games between November 7th to start the season and December 10th which was more than anyone in the country since then theyve gotten quite a significant break only its the second game in 20 days Applause Music Applause at the line and John Shire said its felt like two completely different seasons the way they started and against that caliber of schedule that you were talking about I mean Big Time opponents who are going to probably go very deep in the NCAA tournament and then it felt like nothing since then absolutely you mentioned it theyve already played Kansas and Purdue two final four contending teams this year also mentioned the Ohio State win here on their home court so you know the Blue Devils have definitely been tested early trying to bust a drought and he does they had not scored in over three minutes and had been over their previous five he needed that one so far theres not been the kind of Duke team year after year after year that could really bust away from you like on a 224 run here comes Mills again going up high and thats what you cannot do against Florida State you cannot turn the basketball over and allow Florida State to get out in the transition because they are dangerous with the full head of steam here for Blakes hell take the lane straight on got it little three youre talking about a young man that put the work in during the offseason to work on that jumper Jaden Blaze was not this type of shooter a year ago but you can see he has the confidence in the work hes put in lately hes been one of their very best offensive players with that shot developing his you mentioned the work paying off Mills again and hell draw the foul the Mills getting very active the Junior from Arden North Carolina one of several North Carolina natives on the FSU side Music all the damage no one else with the Blue Devils has made a field goal in this game you think about Blakes whos starting his first game for Duke and then young coming off the bench grabbing offensive rebounds 14 points combined 57 for those two guys who have been the story for the Blue Devils and those two guys actually leave Florida State right now 1411 so itll be Mills at the line both of these teams are good foul shooting teams FSU 78 Duke theyre at 78 percent and free throws with a factor in both their games it was Florida State who attempted who made more free throws than Notre Dame attempted and it was the Blue Devils who lost at Wake Forest due to their lack of ability to get to the freethrow line in that game and Wake Forest just kept going back and making all theirs they made them all day but Lebowski trying to get it in hes been very quiet so far came in averaging 14 points about nine rebounds a game you know one of the things we talked to Leonard Hamilton pregame and he ran down a list of Duke Big Time Players that they played against foreign Music Applause Music guys who didnt get their touches playing simply because they front everything on the post make it difficult to throw the ball inside thats going to be a walk by Matthew Cleveland traveling violation so back to Duke it goes on top by three you know one of the areas that you can beat Florida State when they go to double team is finding that open area attacking the basket nice find as the Rick Whitehead Cuts right to the room Applause Music down for young and tucked out by FSU you mentioned Leonard Hamilton Leonards had a great career he belongs in the Hall of Fame this would be a momentous Victory as we mentioned for him he was the first black coach in the history of the Southeastern Conference as an assistant who came with that hes also taken over so many programs that hes taking jobs that no one else wants Jeremy Rose knocks down the first three balls for the blue Dodgers so when you think about that hes taking over Oklahoma State when they were in disarrayed Miami when they were just getting their program back in Florida State when they were struggling significantly and built each and every program into a win young fouled by a house they are determined to get it in first super Tuesday cups in Kentucky at rump Arena SEC Showdown beginning at 8 Eastern Seven Central not ESPN and a whistle stops the clock at 9 52 here in the first trying to get a little momentum up by six and thatll be Whitehead to the line if its used personal on cam Corin th the big freshman Whitehead 67 freshman from New Jersey the number two ranked incoming freshman Florida high school Gatorade player of the year so far up and down Music might have missed the majority of the preseason with a foot injury got back into things a little late but hes one of the guys who John Shire told us could end up being a starter before this season ends just got to continue to you know fight through the learning curve that has been being a Freshman and high major college basketball the world of talent no question about that great gifted player Duke on a seven nothing run I wonder if some of these guys coming in now you know because some of the players that Coach K had who came in his freshman walking by Nation here who already made they were Pros when they showed up that has been the case you know for a very long time but that also had veterans on their roster to go alongside and then thats really what there arent a lot of veterans left on this Duke roster to be able to show these guys the way and even those who are having the program strong plucked Away by Mills but on the Baseline so Dukes will have it pursue a team that is getting out rebounded so far this season thats for a letter and team well take the break Duke on top 2113 over the Knowles including the guy theyve lost for the Year Cameron Fletcher double figure score he was the top rebounder at the time he suffered a knee injury he had late in the Virginia game went up got a rebound and came down awkwardly and was joined that game and looked ugly from the beginning sorry to see cam out for the remainder of this season but hes a High character young man who will bounce back strong for sure Cleveland fouled on the drive hit by Blakes well pick up number one nine minutes to go as mentioned the students are not here obviously during the Christmas break that doesnt mean the student section isnt completely packed that is always the case these are the more seasoned Cameron crazies is with actually what you get during Christmas break purchase tickets and be a part student section it goes very nicely from the corner green that is Dante green the 610 freshman Applause question about that is an older look than were used to the Veterans been there theyre coming from all over the country because they finally get a chance to buy tickets in this building and in this section with the students gone at least for a little while it was a couple that Joshua today came in London and this this is a bucket in this item for many best fans many fans of of course Coach K in the Duke Blue Devil program straight on with a Miss Mitch theyre dominating on the offensive glass and thanks for being a beneficiary his first start hes liking it he absolutely is and thats a little bit of a celebration right there Im not sure if thats a guitar but he doesnt have the left hand up hes just hard with only a right hand must have a shoulder strap on it tickle on the twine he has 11 and this is the biggest lead so far for Duke today Applause you need to locate a hot hand Worley shoved and foul though sucked the pocket 804 okay in the world he came in averaging Five Points three rebounds a game and a very strong game against Duke last year right here Cameron Indoor with 15 foul number two on lively I believe that 15 for Worley here a year ago was a career high so you know normally when you Applause erased off the world Applause hes got an array of shots Applause you see his ability to attack off the bounce even beating good defense heres roach from 15 to strong Cleveland with the rebound good rebounder seven a game he wants to go Coast to Coast away Music 7 28 left in the half Jaden Place must know the notorious dob is on the call and he and hes out all his special gifts tuck Jack nunji and Sully boom and Xavier is right now right now X is getting inside the paint and they are executing 70 shooting inside the paint 34 of their 64 inside there UConns got to tighten things up if they want to stay unbeaten the Musketeers will be a fourpoint lead with eight and change to play Music Kim Sean thank you very much Happy New Year to you guys a tremendous job in the studio and at game sites as well thats been a great start for UConn it has been a great start for Uconn and playing against a tough Xavier team Duke knows all about Xavier they actually knocked off Xavier in the PK 85 to get to the championship game but a tough for a contest between the two teams and Xavier continues to play better basketball as the season goes along Music grain quite a bit here in the first half hell miss that one but he has seven and hell get a second chance see grandison came out with his hand up making sure he did he kept creating a good look knowing he can shoot at the way out there shot clock down to five Mills got it threepointer on the money for Caleb Mills Mills now three for three from the field hes gotten off to a good offensive start the stars for Florida State have showed up they just havent had any help Chris boxer run and drive again Applause was starting to get some production from their other guys other guys have got scoring action for the Blue double threepointers too 36 percent Duke has been off Target targeted land s another one of those veterans but not even Marquette Mills will have to launch Applause Music double a strong defensive stand by Duke on that possession now does that cause a shot clock violation I believe it does right does okay turn over so far Music Proctor the 18 year old whos struggled to make his shots just 24 percent Music wasnt even supposed to be here until next year and hell knock that one down Music Applause it all covers Florida State there leaving the Goblet of the basketball by himself Applause Music Applause Joanna Mill s to died a whole lot of scoring but hes crashing it last Applause years back for Brockport Lakes he has been the man early on Mitchell again got a really good open look could not knock it down although hes 46 percent threepoint line like a whole lot of them but hes made but hes taken yeah shooting that high of a percentage you got to find more shots thats the way I look at it you know Mitchell you mentioned shooting Gray from Beyond a threepoint arm Music me Applause Music Applause now about four and a half to go and Duke is looking for one of those patented Duke runs as they lose 2918 and a whistle everybody against the Blue Devils philipowski off the basketball and our upcoming featured ESPN football lineup Michigan taking on TCU Georgia against Ohio State college football player semis today Penn State Utah squaring off with a granddaddy of the mall on Monday the bills battle the Bengals and a big Monday Night Football game and its all on ABC ESPN2 ESPN Deportes and absolutely is a strong lineup and of course Smith America may already know that at one time you were the voice of the dog so we know who youre rolling with Dave suppose no question I think Georgia looking for a second consecutive national championship team Duke will take the break more in a moment you share my understanding with that I know that you are a God that protects the money maker he certainly does oh absolutely we know Farnham is about his money maker he has the hair right everything so perfect he absolutely understands what Im talking about there I know he would not be a guy to put a mask on playing basketball no sir dont spoil it dont spoil it for everybody else I think is always Seans point of view yes would agree 29 Applause as Sean mentioned getting great production Off the Bench thats usually the Seminoles and that that is a normal Florida State style of play so be able to win the points off the bench battle but you miss him right now Sean said it at halftime a 150 Advantage for the Blue Devils right now only has 18 points so right the bench for Duke has been hanging in there with Florida States entire team and specifically their starters who only had three guys get involved in this point the injuries and youth Leonard has not been able to play the style that hes been so successful playing you know he might get first four minutes absolutely and one of the things that he talked to us about pregame was the fact that hes used to guys playing four or four and a half minute stretches thats it then you bring in the next regime and they play before Ministry he talked about Trent for us whos the winningest player in Florida State history he asked Trent this summer now Trent is playing the NBA this doesnt know he says how how many minutes do you think you could have played in our style but Ill face the way of course told him 24 minutes that was the Max and a 40minute game he felt like he could play 24 minutes going to stay style and thats saying a lot more games hes been a real Target and it pickling Off the Bench is a big reason why that Blue Devils have such an advantage in this game it started coming in at 14 to pull up by Green yes swishes it in his shot making ability is so true yeah Green doesnt need any plays run for him just put the basketball on his hands he can go get one on his arm Applause s two to the tune of 44 just for FSU they needed all of it so far today Applause Supreme shot off the window and I love the fact that John sire recognizing what is working well for his team making sure that Ryan young continues to get his hands on the basketball because hes been put down with Western Bradley 10 Majestic ball coming through in three or one not scooped up by Cleveland under three to go in the first half for Cameron Indoor Applause Music disappointing loss to Wake Forest even though they had a couple of players out and Lively and Whitehead Overhill didnt make that trip young again on the story here in the first half Purdue he absolutely has been that 12 points and five rebounds already for Ryan young here in the foreign Music Applause basketball in Tennessees out of Memphis Applause in from threepoint land but even though Ryan young is the hot guy he didnt force an opportunity right there recognized the help is coming got it right back to grandison who was able to knock down the three balls and selfish that should be entertaining Applause and Music look out bit of a breakaway here for the Duke Blue Devils weve seen that before yeah weve seen it a lot and youre accustomed to sing it from duke when you come into this building theres going to be a stretch where players start smacking the floor but theyd lock in defense amazing I go all the way through and Im foul on the play and hell be at the line with 45 seconds before the break its leading to offense Duke getting a stop to Rick Whitehead with the Euro stop the finish with the left hand and then coming up with a steal on the next possession to get him to the freethrow line and has been the defense by the Blue Devils that have gotten him great shape here in the second part of this first half well our first super Tuesday college basketball matchup for the new year should be a really good one KJ Williams LSU theyre 121 coming off an upset of number nine Arkansas Wednesday they are taking on number 19 Kentucky and Rupp Arena coverage of the SEC Showdown Central on ESPN and the Apple if I remember correctly Kentucky coming off of a loss as well against two former Florida State assistant coaches coach Dennis Gates and Charlton young indeed doing a great job at Mizzou its going to be an offensive foul McLeods setting the screen but moving into Duke have all the momentum and they are revving up this crowd 4225 with 338 to go Florida state was seven turnovers only had five the entire game versus Notre Dame and theyll win at the top Music runs clock for seconds difference Applause hit it by Mills and on the line there hes going to turn it right back over to Duke the eighth turnover of the half Music Florida State gives Duke an opportunity to build onto this lead to take it to 19 possibly be even 20 headed into halftime really high point nine and on top 4225 and right now youve got one see if you can get opportunity to get the basketball back into Ryan Youngs hand he has been special here in this first half no better way to end it for the Blue Devil Proctor trying to get it in Whitehead five seconds to go and tip to seven still more than enough time to get a quality look here 37 seconds can still run one of your standard Sidelines out of bound Club Music most certainly on Dukes side they open up a 4225 advantage on a 70 run in the final seconds young was a huge part of that first half success it absolutely was offensive rebounding has been at a premium for the Blue Devils as they take a 17point lead hes pour it on pour it on and well see if the Seminoles can find another hot do it all by himself for Leonard Hamilton they have the rock beginning the second 20 but they havent been able to get back for us thats by designed by the Blue Devils he was priority number one on The Scouting Report as the ball now number 35 back off to Mills had a good first half hes gonna be held up by a roach who commits the personal inside the opening seconds of the second half number one on the captain the preseason all ACC first team and Jeremy Rose playing with a toe injury missed the very least ashore game came back to Wake Forest had five turnovers in the game not himself right now but playing through it so that were only going over the top and down it went yeah I thought it was a lob honestly I did too but from my angle it definitely looked like a lob but Im sure woolly would absolutely love to have that buck if you know the world is 66 sophomore his dads Godfather its Wilt Chamberlain wow Music Stan Jones told me that the outstanding coach for FSU he has some great great stuff that was a lot I angle up here didnt lie to us downstairs Applause yes but you know one one thing I like about it he hasnt forced the action even though hes the leading scorer coming in after Force anything wrong Music Music to again coming in with 10 losses already and to that terrible start although lately playing better Music you could be playing better but then try to come in to face a top 20 team in the Duke Blue Devils on their home for quite another possession in my opinion has been the most impressive thing about calphalopowski this season even though he started off with four straight double doubles doing things that no Duke players ever done before the way that hes competing before switching pickle rollers and standing in front of guards even though he got a foul with that possession I like the way John Shire is challenging his team to become better Defenders individually each and every one of his guys they have played really good defense this season lost a few games early of course its that ruling schedule we talked about I think top 11 the month of November but they have played type D all year averaging you know 16 points between their opponents to 60 again Music Hill 16 to go in the second half to a 604 game the opponents scoring average yeah if you look at the hell 12 to 13 opponents below their season average and again you know weve thrown accustomed to watching Duke play and games being attracting because they have such offensive Talent throughout the past few years that theyre just going to run up and down the floor and just outscore team but what weve seen from this years Edition is simply been about were going to stop him whether youre shooting the basketball well or not they can still be in game simply because theyre doing the job defensively Mills with the foul and roach nails that one here on Coach K courts following on the heels of the goats having to be the man that replaces the man not the left will hit nothing for green hes actually shot the ball very very well all season long serenaded there philipowski will hit the bench for a moment in a teaching moment between coach Shire and philipowski that is a defensive breakdown thats what youre talking about right there very seriously that theres anything that I have to come out or even to correct right now in the offensive into the floor but I love the way his best player is being coached up oh thats a great play Music just kind of that left hand hes had a really nice afternoon he really has and I love his aggressiveness he knows that his team has needed him to go points on the board and he has done absolutely that his third first career start on a cup will get hit with a personal foul he didnt think so as he went up for the block but I love the cause the right call my God Lincoln so right on top of it simply because and of course Lee could sell motions to the bench the arms come down even though he does go up vertically watch the arms come down to attempt to block the shot making contact it may not be the most popular car in this building but it is the right car certainly it was not but appeared to be accurate its his third foul Lively Now 23 block shots on the year The Freshman from Philadelphia Music Applause Duke has signed over the year I mean Coach K really cornered the market didnt he absolutely did as John Cyrus kind of taking over in that same role and this is Sean sires recruiting class the guys on the floor right now one of the things that Coach K did two summers ago simply said Im not going to coach these guys so Im not going to recruiter John sire and his staff did just that and brought in the number one recruiting class in the country blanks a little wild on that attempt heres Mills with a difficult angle to back that in very creative and Mills has been successful with his opportunities going to the basket today have to find a way to be a little more aggressive on the offensive individual in exactly 17 minutes to play and FSU make a run here Mills last four games averaging about 15 points per game Distributing the ball well theyll pick up the foul going thatll be his third so keep them Music five Junior from Arden North Carolina and this is where the depth comes in for Florida State normally in this scenario Leonard Hamilton would have another guy that he can go to but with a lack of death Jones are dealing with right now you Mills having us down the floor and of course were switching now hes got a garnet guy like Ryan young and keep him off the offensive glass Rachel thought about a three heres blanks he will take the three Cleveland Ive never seen a couple of teams beaten up quite like FSU was last year they run a nice one here for Gordon and he will lay that one in yeah you remember thats what Florida State team that started out ACC play last year at six and one and then the Andrew bug continued to hit them over and over again it was a downward struggle from there Applause Mitchell swings for blades always take it away four that one is going to be bounced out of play thrown away by the Blue Devils so that Shawn a little bit of life here and this is what weve seen from Florida State especially throughout the last six games it started when they you know lost to Purdue and the ACC Big Ten challenge but but come all the way to the end with the number into Virginia same thing there competed with it with a dozing off confidence just as we went to break technicals on Whitehead and Cleveland it grills they absolutely did you see walking off the floor to Rick Whitehead wanting the call recognizing that it was offensive foul Matthew Cleveland going to this bench making contact and the two just having it just a little short conversation as the officials come over I got Jeffrey Anderson making sure that he distributes all these technical fouls equally both player gets one yep so those are offset no and you have to remember the Rick Whitehead one of his final schools was Florida State so Derek Im sure was probably hosted by Matthew Cleveland on his official visit he was Leonard Hamilton who told me he felt like the reef was going to Duke before anyone else he told me that was the leader missing Place Duke has gone a little bit chilly here in the last couple of minutes and this is what Florida state has done especially you know as of late they just found their way to chiseled back in the game in the second half young fouled on the floor so not shootings as he was shoved and Duke will inbound from the Baseline you know Im kind of outstanding first half with 12 sit down Music back for Roach Music slices way inside and draws the foul Music Cleveland for that one Matthew Cleveland a sophomore from Atlanta who always wears his right sock inside out in every single game as you would tell me earlier its its because it goes back to his baseball days goes back to his baseball days so he has you know baseball Superstition and of course you of all people know how crazy this is youll go to Superstition I would say nutty the baseball guys are but at the same time has to listen to Taylor Swift and eat fruit pregame thats his ritual needs 15 minutes of Matthew Cleveland time as he likes to refer to Matthew Cleveland time 4835 Jackson up top the freshman almost gave it away shot clock down to seven Jackson will feed Cleveland by Mitchell who really defended well there on the Baseline they make it life very tough on Matthew Cleveland they absolutely are and youve got to consider him hes the guy thats coming in putting up the numbers we talked about over 17 points and 11 rebounds in his last three games and he has been priority number one for the Blue Devils on The Scouting Report foreign Applause with the camera crazies but weve got to give it to people say the other camera craze hes coming in and doing the job here you said the veteran crew and he gets another basket and now up to 14 points a nice play by Whitehead maker on that pick and roll and putting his wife with his teammate could benefit Applause will draw the foul again Music this will go against Jeremy Roach Music running a pick and roll beautifully Tariq Whitehead coming over and you know the great job there by Ryan young not sticking with that screen and picking up a foul Morro Bay slip Whitehead with a nice pass and the Finish from Young you wrote your foul number two a moment ago 14 minutes to go still time for the Seminoles Morley again is going to be held up and suddenly a lot of whistles a lot of reaching plenty of foul starting to Mount up here at Cameron Indoor but give Florida State Credit these fouls are mounting up because the nose are putting it in Drive theyre not selling theyre trying to find their way to get to the basket weve seen Wally doing it weve seen Mills attacking the basket so theyre basically trying to find a way to put the pressure on Dukes defense and the officials to make those balls Proctor with the foul Worley at the line and hes all bandaided up on the chin after taking a shot early in the game and there were several of those it was pretty physical links beyond the three God really calling for the broad legs almost got it to go hell be at the line but Blakes taking the pace out of the Florida State Playbook and driving getting downhill attacking the basket getting to the freethrow line the way Jalen Blake has been aggressive in this game to start it off and here in this second half number three on Matthew Cleveland so keep an eye on that Duke at the line Blake speaks 67 percent its over on acc work and its the first of 2023 theyll be in Raleigh Wednesday night to take on NC State coverage of that one begins at seven Eastern one and two for Blakes no Duke is up 17 at halftime leading 16 here lean in nice back shot there by Cleveland for two and once again trying to get downhill get into that painted area this time Matthew Cleveland the game will Define some success which has been very rare in this game and as you mentioned earlier is three consecutive double doubles heres Whitehead boy that was in the cylinder hes not shot that well at all only six for 24 coming in from threepoint land but the good another whistle the shot wont go by Worley you can see the point of emphasis for them hes president right now they are attacking the painted area of course they will shoot the three when its off of a driving kick but right now he wants them for find a way to get to that Rim well get to the free throw line and all the fouls both teams will be shooting the rest of the way and its with 13 minutes fourth as we mentioned good foul shooting teams Duke in fact is exceptional at 78 percent and FSU 73 percent entertaining Jeffrey Anderson Applause talking about New Years Eve plans Im a really boring guy you know I dont have a boat I dont play golf Im very dull but he does own his own Gospel music you know he basically is a producer owned his own labor so he knows a little bit about a way to spend his off time another foul this one is better though against f uel off the ball Music really tightening up here the officiating crew on these calls Music foul line corn is third but a lot that happens after the double tactical foul when you see tensions start to raise on the floor now the officials have to call it a little tighter to make sure the game doesnt get out of hand its a great point team steps back bottoms on that one you know if hes doing that this Duke team goes to a completely different level right now they dont necessarily have a guy that can hit showing that he might be the one no basket there another personal foul 12 minutes to play and Duke has opened up a very comfortable 5438 Advantage grandison will step off the graduate from Illinois Mills back to the line hes really good 83 percent United States alltime career free throw percentage leader from transfer from Houston it was the 2020 preseason player of the year missile FSU and knew they were getting a really good player the Mills hit 21 points against Florida earlier this season Applause Music Matthew the technical foul has to be has to be very careful Music shot on the way for Mills the guard Music Applause s again house another freshman Big Time shooter in high school big time scorer Hills from an accomplished athletic family his parents were coaches our coaches Applause 14point lead here for Duke and the ball Proctor going in hard draws the foul and thats going to be two for him Whitehead continuing to improve as a college basketball player starting to find his way step back three Blue Devils looking to go to 113 on the year gonna bounce back from A Loss to Wake Forest and as the ACC is really starting to get cranked up and tough loss for North Carolina is today yes Pittsburgh playing very good basketball Jeff K pool of course Duke alum has his team playing very good basketball especially at home the Peterson Event Center yeah which is you know in the past one of the toughest places to win not in recent years for an opponent because maybe theyre bringing that back nice execution nice Design coming out by Leonard Hamilton and his staff to get the bucket and again the silly 14 point game but you feel like Florida States been able to find some gold is strong for two points quiet game for Kyle phillipowski so far just four points but you mentioned earlier hes been unselfish he hasnt forced it green steps back and drains it though twopointer and its been feast or famine with green its either air ball or bottom of the Nets and nothing in between for him in this game theres 11 Applause Music stairs final four is the starting point guard directing traffic because you here they come Worley gets it off for green and a quick strike that didnt take long s13 with the three fouls did not want to foul in that possession Music starting to flex his muscle especially on the interior offensive rebound much of a look does he just a tiny window and he can knock it down but I love the confidence he shot a couple air balls in this game hasnt been deterred at all still stepping up knocking down threes with 25 feet gonna find out about time out here transfer from UCF at 30 against Saint Johns he was eight out of 11 for threepoint land and that one hes one of the best Shooters in the league Music for FSU and Darren Greens Reigns knows no bounds in the building to step up and shoot it from anywhere on the floor but can also play off the bounce grading shots for himself getting to the midrange he can more at all levels with seems to like the level for far beyond 30 like that Logo level out there 16 7 out of 13 as you said a couple of air balls in there but great Shooters they have to have amnesia absolutely he doesnt remember those air balls even though the season camera tradies will remind him when he touches the basketball every so often Music Applause to go ALS completely Music does get the place Music Applause Music on the offensive blast he absolutely goes once again and Ron young does a great is getting and on the side goes up is almost as hes trying to come up with the defense complaints for him Cleveland draws the foul Music to the line comes a guy you talk about hard work hes become a much better shooter this year the knock against him last year was dont let him take a three if youre a seminal because hes not going to hit the shot he came into the game with 42 from threepoint land its a giant Improvement not a ton of attempts but he worked very diligently he said three times a day every day during the off season he shot the basketball he just shot the lights out yeah and thats one of the reasons why hes already made as many threepointers thus far early in the season as he did all season that number is six he made six last year and hes made six already on this season with of course an entire Speed play to go so when you think about Matthew Cleveland hes put in the work you know oftentimes now youre getting to see him reap the benefits of it a little whistle here by the way philipowski has four fouls for the Blue Devils so we keep an eye on that with a lot of time to go 9 11 to the line thats the reason he is on a bench and it tightens up a little bit here 6251 do things were seeing from Leonard Hamilton this season is hes actually sizing down at times Music of course youve been covering Leonard Hamilton for a very long time even longer than I have and we dont see this offer from him where he goes to a smaller lineup cloud back onto the floor but still one big with four guards on the floor 18 points for Ryan Young seven rebounds you call a great sub yes it works like that Mitchell retaining possession and tied up and thats going to be possession arrow on some great defense by FSU Mitchell thought he had a foul but that will not be the case Duke will have the arrow they will have the ball great Hustle by challenge Jackson getting back into the play he did have a lot of arm on that possession so the Blue Devil faithful have a point Mitchell lines up at three reason why we say he needs more shots more attempts from Beyond the threepoint arc when hes shooting that great of a percentage thats 46 on the drive Music to hang in the game single digits but you feel like theyve been able to assess now floors they have to find a way to get some stops and gets into the force especially before the policy sitting down Applause Applause green money overshot him at the pass missed Opportunity by Florida State maybe easier to go to Mills who had a lane to the Murray FSU just missed a golden chance to make this a 10point game but the bench has been 39 bench points as a season 9 they absolutely have Ryan young has been spectacular Off the Bench but Florida state has made Seven of its last seven field goal attempts the thing thats hurt them turnovers specifically that last possession not getting that layup which could have made it a 10point game and put a little bit more pressure on the Blue Devils both teams have been shooting it well here in the second half FSU 71 percent seven percent Music foreign Music Applause wants to make sure he gets the basketball into Mitchells hands and allows him to play 101 in the middle of the floor and it works off as we go it is six feels like more than that for Mitchell green turns the fire off the fire the Duke has it again approaching a seven minute Mark here at Cameron Indoor sold out of course Music Music Applause oh thats belongs to the Seminoles thats the second time Jackson has come over and made a play on the basketball Mitchell this time the nose get the basketball back and this is one where you see the defender starting to help and leave youve got to deliver that to the corner as well as Blakes shooting the basketball hes got to get that one give him and win a Duke a win would be his 400s and this year 600 years ago had some wins taken away at the 22 so he might kill Applause a two and young young trying to talk to Doug South letting him know that he was innocence McCloud creating the contact Music just back after missing several weeks with an Achilles injury Applause took the line 30 39 percent now the College Football semifinals coming up on ESPN he says in the ESPN app number two Michigan and number three TCU and number one Georgia number four Ohio State in the ChickfilA Peach Bowl winners playing on Monday January 9th on ESPN Were Not Gonna appreciate ESPN putting Georgia on second to give you time to get back home to be able to watch it as to why big dog fans in my dogs I should say negotiations Applause 7156 the Blue Devils is Mills climbs away Ryan young doing a great job not only when he has the basketball in his hands but when its away from him that time ceiling off two players allowing Grace turn the corner and play 21 basketball but Mitchell against the thank you phillipovskis been sitting for a long time with four fouls other answers in this one Ryan young has been the answer to every question Applause Music Applause Music Applause a double double the second season and the fifth of his career I love the way that he goes after offensive rebounds when the shot goes up and hes really anticipating it well before the shot goes up starting to get he gets opposition as the ball is working his way around the perimeter Applause with one played for former Blue Devil Chris Collins Music youre welcome heres my gift to you right back to the program he absolutely donations from here on out its fun just hold the checkpoint s for young Music or no Applause his credit defensively they have made life tough for Matthew Cleveland this entire game no good look for Cleveland that Julie is serving small forward of the Year honor is Blakes yes oh that one hurt the Seminoles that triple from the corner gets it up to 20 again and a nice drive from Tariq Whitehead to skip pass recognizing the help one young inside those jumping inside contact Ed Paul give you some frustration there trying to slow down roach he commits the foul to go and Duke and a really nice spot thats number four on Mills OB you and I both know that Florida state is Sixth Man of the Year University however there may be a Blue Devil etching his name on the trophy a strong performance by Ryan young coming off the bench unless hes done hes the season Music he may get into that conversation even more so as this season goes along FSU typically locks that were down like three years in a row Applause sure move up 7856 I think by the way 133 of all time on away hours have been a big part of the story purpose here it really has been a great job Bob Blakes there getting a hand even though his tight quarter fighting fighting around to come away with that steel and reflection Seminoles feels like a lot more than that in the coming critical situations heres roach yes odd threepointer and now Duke is really laying it on and the reason why it feels like more turnovers because Duke continues to capitalize on each and every one of those turnovers 12nothing run warley with a little floater and Duke running away with this one here late in the second half on top 8156 we go back to the possession where Florida state gets Matthew Cleveland gets a rebound hes got two guys ahead throws it away and ends up session where they could have cut it to 10 and just like an awesome as they have been playing great for that stretch Lighthouse triple short out here against Duke and 310 to play Music Duke has a bunch of offensive Stars a bunch of big names Im not sure anyone would have said Jalen Blakes to start the season but they know his name now Music all right 17 points matching his career highs 17 points and also four for six from Beyond the threepoint R but driving to the basket making plays not only for himself but his teammates well to assist for Blakes in this game but he has been a flamethrower from Beyond The Arc big buckets with Jameson Blakes in the first half and the second half as well as he plays the guitar clearly with the shoulder strap because hes not using the left hand at all oh kind of like that move and the move by John Shire to stockhand very smart play there I agree and you know talking with John Shire pregame one of the things that he talked about was hes been in every role as Ryan young gets a huge Ovation checking out the game with 310 remaining with his 20 points how about his line by the way 20 points he made every shot that he took seven for seven made every foul shot that he took six percent he had 12 rebounds so you would call this the perfect perfect Mr Young I think he pitched a Perfecto today I like it I like it not too shabby so and in the end ducat all the answers to Seminoles a couple of times had an opportunity to really close the gap make him nervous Cleveland on the spin to scoop no was going to be Applause on cylinder 8158 Music Florida state had their opportunities just unable to take advantage of them especially Applause and well swing it for green and its off his hands and went back wards another turnover now the 13th turnover floor Seminoles and we have to mention a small margin for error with this Florida State team they won at home against Notre Dame a onepoint Victory only turn it over five times so thats how small the air you know the margin of error is first something is going to state right now Applause were undergrad section Applause and well go to the line with two and a half to play 17 points for Caleb Mills will be a lose weight of 18 against Notre Dame Jeremy Rose getting a nice hand as he heads to the bench Advanced duration one of the things you see for Florida State right now Matthew Cleaver 35 minutes this is not Florida State style Leonard Hamilton does not elected to play guys more than 24 those guys on that production they just dont have a roster door for that right now theres quite a reason why youve seen struggles Ias Proctor from Sydney Australia scoring day for the Blue Devils Obi I normally like Applause because earliest issues right gonna go three trillion dollar players Applause Music Zach White you know recent can you have a guest I dont know if somebody knows thats very guess at the third one Music pretty Congress stats magician is going to come up with an answer I think I think hes actually gone you think hes got it no is he riding it down on a piece of paper to give to you Mike reveal that to America another half 42 to play here 8363 the Blue Devils with the game in hand Applause January Applause I can appreciate the effort there by Matthew Cleveland and the fact that Florida State regards a bang down 20 going to continue to compete throughout this game to transition Cleveland trying to find the Highlight on Proctors inside that restricted area so Freddie has I think an answer for you oh its trivia time lets lets lets tell America what Freddys answer here Freddys answer is Kyrie Irving and that would be corrected too very few people would guess that though Kyrie Irving of course yeah Legend was born in Australia so he is one of the three Australian porn players to play for the blue game I like the question Music directions Music the regular part of our broadcast with a minute four to go foul theyre just out 8365 Duke and really laying it on about seven or eight minutes ago and breaking away running and hiding here from the Seminoles and Duke has Duke had that Nation Ally Applause and really thats something that had been missing a little bit from this Duke team that according to really break away which was a patented thing under Coach K it was clearly shot Applause found some shooting Jalen Blakes the Greek Whitehead both these guys are stepped up knocked down shots Bill powski didnt have a big offensive output but Rockin young took up the slack for everyone for their blue devil uniform 20 points 12 boards for young who has to be in trouble scoring Music and slam that down the last basket we see here this half noon and Cameron Indoor as duke rolls to a big victory over Floridas Floridas highest score today 8667 Applause and John Shire felt his team was starting to get things going in a very positive direction they showed you so I believe this was a step in the right direction for the Blue Devils really a regression for Florida State whove been playing much better basketball leading up to this point but Leonard Hamiltons team always much more dangerous when theyre at home than
