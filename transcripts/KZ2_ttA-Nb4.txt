chance to be off and to actually practice Terry Oglesby Byron Jarrett Isaac Barnett are officials and George Mason wins the tip in the road Applause greens George George Mason likes to attack the basket get it inside Jaylen Haynes gets it inside coming off back to back double doubles and the rebound tapped around back to the Blue Applause Devils George Mason with some pressure theyll play mostly manto man and they like to get after you it is a Duke starting five with three potential NBA lottery picks in the 2025 NBA draft all three freshman Proctor the LOB and a foul against Woody Newton well thats one way to defend that play its its illegal but thats one way to do it thats really a great job by Duke moving the basketball you get so much movement you get a couple of screens and now the defense is just out of position and flag he does so many things so well four double doubles already this year for the 17yearold what stand s out to you about him most just he can do everything and I mean not only that hes a good rebounder hes a good defensive player its not just his offensive Applause game theres Tyrese Proctor with 10 trying to force it into malawat and another quick foul that time on the seconde ETSU transfer Jaylen Haynes John sh told us what scares me about George Mason is that theyre not your typical quote mid major team the 810 this year has been really good we have to be sharp from the jump tonight how about a three from flag to start and its got to concern Tony skin and George Mason just a little bit that his team has picked up fouls early told us he wanted to be physical but not foul and you notice on that jump shot George Mason dropping back on defense not sending people to the offensive Applause boards flag extra pass canle a three and the rebound Braden o Conor one of a number of newcomers for this George Mason team and yet even with all the new faces a very experienced and Veteran Laden Group they need to be able to get the ball inside to hannes to have the most impact hannes fighting for the rebound last touched it back to the Blue Devils now OK Conor for George Mason is really good at coming off that screen and pulling up and shooting the jump shot he just missed that one the last thing you want to do if youre George Mason is to come in here and get off to a slow start they have won five in a row coming off a win against Tan in which OK Conor had 17 and itll go back to George Mason and Matt I think another thing thats going to be important in this game is transition which team can create transition you have to be careful you dont turn the ball over obviously its easier to go down and score when the other team doesnt have their defense set theres Darius Maddox their leading score OK Conor had a jar loose 10 on the timer and picked off by cion James to a trailing Proctor Bang from downtown and thats almost like in the script you turn it over here and Duke is going to go down and make you pay Conor coughs it up backto back turnovers flag off the Applause drive over three minutes to start the game without a basket for George Applause Mason Zach Anderson out to Maddox and their leading score stops the scoreless drought and puts George Mason on the board now Maddox can put some points on the board and even though hes a pretty good threepoint shooter I think what you saw right there is the best part of his Applause Applause game Maddox off the bounce tough floater left it short numbers for Duke the pullup jumper yes floater not so much flag for three and a timeout by George Music Mason hot start for Duke they laided early at Cameron indoors every la Music k she Applause Music ACC mens basketball is presented by Tio price invest with confidence second your head coach Tony skin returning to his alma mater where he helped lead George Mason to the final four between 2003 and 2006 helped them to a 20 win season last year this year brings in 10 newcomers Dan picked in the middle of the pack of a very good 810 team feels like theres more to be done still in year two uh certainly Tony skin would tell you that but this is a George Mason program I mean that was a tremendous final four run but if that was going to occur today with the way we measure things they didnt win the reg they didnt win the conference tournament I dont know that they get in Hayes is sent Away by Cooper flag he wanted a go 10 but they are not going to give it to him thats a really good defensive play by flag he just Waits on him and that ball looked like it was still going up but Haynes had a mismatch inside and hes trying to use it and when Haynes gets the ball in there hes backing it down hes not usually passing it and flag did a great job just to anticipate by the way flags last deep shot going to break counted as a two not a three that makes it 82 Duke that defensive play just shows you the length that this Duke team has defensively Haynes that a jar Loose by flag itll stay here with three on the shot clock Haynes is a guy when he gets it outside he likes to dribble it to the basket and Duke so far has done a nice job sort of harassing that dribble got to get it up quickly if youre the Patriots phips tough shot wont go and tough shot is exactly the right term Matt and those are the kind of shots that George Mason has been getting just one for six to start Brown the kick to the corner good to see Malik Brown back in the lineup after he missed their last game with a toe injury Haynes finally on the board a flag fell down at the on the other end of the court so they had a transition opportunity and the Patriots took advantage of it got to get some easy baskets against Duke we talked before the game about what a good defensive team George Mason is well Duke is even better Duke among the best two defensive teams in the country according to Ken palom on any given week as Proctor is long and the rebound hauled in by Darius Applause Maddox heres the Auburn transfer Katie Johnson Anderson a three and thats what Anderson does he is a threepoint specialist flag left hand wont go fights to keep it alive and a fresh 20 Foster probing rebound Brown third opportunity on this trip flag draws a foul that is just effort by the 17yearold freshman one of the things you have have to do as a defensive team is you really have to get that first rebound because if you dont get the first rebound lots of times youre out of position trying to get another one if the second shot is missed but I mean he just what great balance hes able to shoot the ball hes the first guy down and the first guy back up well you talked about it Dan giving Duke extra possessions in this game for George Mason not a recipe for Success heres another one back by flag third opportunity jar loose but it will stay here you know George Masons really going to have to consider finding flag and blocking him out thatd be your advice to the Patriots Yeah it shows the depth of my insight about this particular game thats why youre a Hall of Famer flag from downtown many sh their last nine field goal attempts they had they had four opportunities leading by four here early nearly Midway through the first Applause frame now they get another big guy uru inside du the Patriots just checked into the game five to shoot here for KD Applause Johnson and another oneand none trip down the floor and another tough shot at the end of the clock Foster on the Drive finds it in the corner Emma juru fighting for the rebound and now here come the Patriots and if Malik Brown is anywhere in the neighborhood youre going to have to fight for that rebound excellent acquisition for Duke in the off season Malik Brown coming over from Applause Syracuse phips pounded by Evans stuck on the Baseline Up and Under and Darius Maddox showing why he was once an ACC all tournament team selection that was great patience nobody panicked and thats what George Mason wants to do thats what they have to do is get the ball then take it toward the basket these teams have a combined six made field goals neither shooting it efficiently we talked about the fact that George Mason gets to the free throw line a lot and one of the reasons that they do is that they attack the basket and this is just a really good job by bips inside to not panic and by his teammates to cut to the basket and give him some place to throw the ball 10 on the timer here for Duke mismatch flag defended by Woody Newton flag another offensive rebound James a deep three got flag is just out fighting George Mason on the inside he already has six rebounds not even 10 minutes into the Applause Music Applause game ok Conor kick out phips and mauru sort of a Helter Skelter sequence there for George Mason meanwhile on the other side for Duke the second chance opportunities presented by Cooper flag being paid off from downtown up five Music Washton join us de Music BK Music h e e Duke up five but shooting just 22 slow starts have been a bit of a theme for John Shys team this year and yet in all three of those games they came back to take the lead at some point winning of course the Auburn game and the game at Louisville and I think John shy had a very interesting perspective on he said you cant talk about that too much because then it gets in everybodys head you just have to go out and play and but again I keep trying to stress to people its the 17th of December coaches still are allowed time to put their teams together and Dukes issues have really been on the offensive end and theyre still putting that together a little bit how much do you attribute maybe tonights quote unquote slow start to being off for a week for the first time since the year started well I I I think being off for a week is a good thing you get to practice you maybe get to rest a little bit you get to work on some things so no I dont think theres rust how can they have rust you know if you were off for a month yeah thats Dukes second turnover but each time theyve turned it over it has not resulted in a fast break opportunity for George Mason so George Mason playing both of their big guys at the same time Haynes has to try to get himself down inside hes got a big advantage over Gillis goes right at the Purdue transfer and lays it in off the window and thats what we said thats what he likes to do if hes not outside and he has the ball hell dribble the ball inside Duke didnt come and double team him that time theyve been able to knock it away from him a couple times earlier theres Gillis its at three now Gillis theres a mismatch if Haynes is trying to guard him outside Gillis is going to get some open opportunities Gillis has not shot the three as well as duke anticipated certainly not as well as he did last year but again its still early shot 46 in route to being the big 10s Sixth Man of the Year last year that three by Gillis duks fourth of the half Conor tough shot again forced by the length of malawat thats o Conors shot but you dont have to often shoot it over somebody the size of malawat 72 250 malawat with a longer wingspan than his Applause height and a foul off the ball against oconor that is the fourth on George Mason Duke still hasnt committed a fight and this is a George Mason team that gets almost a quarter of their points from the free throw line and its hard to get to the free throw line if you dont get foul thats how that works yeah mhm Tyrese Proctor having an excellent start to his season finds Gillis and the rebound carow by Emma juru now you can beir confident that when Gillis gets it out there hes going to pull the trigger so you dont really have to worry if your haes very much about him driving past you heres Maddox two for four to start his night back out to Haynes thats not necessarily a really good idea hes now 0 for seven shooting threes this year Applause well Saturday mens basketball right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app Cooper flag back at it again with number five Duke taking on Georgia Tech noon Eastern and in our Prime Time West Coast matchup Cal squares off with number 23 San Diego State and that Cal San Diego State game is another one of those important nonconference games for the ACC but you talked about on Packers show just before we tipped off across the board the ACC missing a few of those early Marquee nonconference wins well the ACC the problem for the ACC is they play the SEC a lot and thec has decimated been a problem for anybody thats played theyve decimated everybody so the accs record against the Big East the Big 10 and the Big 12 isnt that bad but against the SEC its Dreadful but again everybodys record against the see is Dreadful but the problem is you set the standard in November and December and then its hard for teams to recover kipo goes right around OK Conor kipos got such good sze and he just plays under control his first point to the night Duke up eight Maddox three with flag on his heels literally and three shots coming for the Virginia Tech Music transfer I dont know that Ive ever seen a foul committed in quite that manner and the first of the night for Duke there you have it 12 minutes into the game flag basically falls down and hes trying to catch his balance and he just he hits him on the heels while he shooting a three that is the least amount of contact youre going to see on a foul called probably all year well but its the perfect place to make very little contact its hard for to shoot the ball when somebody is literally hanging on his heels and so the first trip to the foul line tonight for George Mason as you pointed outstanding three throw shooter and so is the team yes and they get there often top 20 in the country in free throw attempts per game as I said literally they scored 24 of their total points from the free throw Music line seven points for Maddox to lead all scores in tonights game so f as as seemingly that theyve struggled a little bit George Mason is still in the game Proctor curling Blows By and lays it in that was just great movement movement of the ball movement of people thats hard to guard o Conor had it picked off here comes Malik Brown Gillis hounded and lays it in with the left hand Gillis and flag both hustled down the court and if they dont do it thats a turnover because brown lost his footing seven Duke points off four George Mason Applause turnovers and there is the second foul on Duke Blue Devil scoring on backto back trips down the floor and getting some points from Tyrese Proctor in the midst of his best season so far in a Duke uniform Music ch Music Applause be Applause Music the Blue Devils have built a ninepoint lead and their defense has had a lot to do particularly with Malik Brown he does a great job getting in the passing L he dribbles it behind his back and everything goes really well till he falls down but Mason Gillis bails him out there and brown is such a defensive presence you know you look at his demeanor and it its like hes just sort of gliding through things but he plays hard look at that he in the past when he was at Syracuse you used to go to shootarounds and talk to opponents and they said weve told our guys you got to watch out for brown anytime hes around so he is a real force on the defensive end John C said hes got the best hands of any player hes ever coached which is pretty High Praise considering the guys that have come through these walls considering where John Shire is coached five to shoot for Hayes had a j loose forces a tough shot and its off the mark good defense by tyres Proctor good defense by Proctor to not let him by and then at the last second flag came over forced him into a quick shot flag using his size no Brown M time the jump but it was last Touch by George Mason itll stay here Brown Miss time to jump but hes in there in perfect offensive rebounding position and Duke is just wearing George Mason out on the offensive boards already plus six in that category against George Mason team that has struggled giving up offensive rebounds this year kiple left open theres Brown again winning position and drawing a foul the fifth on George Mason well Emma juru was out of position and he grabbed brown brown is I mean he moves so well hes a very fluid player flag puts his head down left it off the front end well he doesnt usually Miss shots like that even though its in traffic now again thats thats not going to count for anything thats not going to be any stat except for the deflection but that is a pass thats going right inside for an easy layup and Malik Brown kicks it out of bounds hey 54 maybe hes got the best feet on the team too not just hands well defensive feet Applause Johnson picked up by flag Maddox off the screen but thats a shot that has to go down oh and Dan theyre now four of 18 from the floor 0 for from downtown how does George Mason get some Rhythm here offensively they havent scored in over two minutes well most of the time when youre struggling like that you try to create your Rhythm on the defensive end where you get some steals you create some turnovers and you get easier baskets their problem is theyve played against the set Duke defense for most of the night and the set Duke defense is awfully Applause good five to shoot for foster right into the teeth of the defense and it was last touched by Emma juru with his heel on the Baseline so itll go back to do well Emma juru is having a really tough time tonight hes it looked like hes been off balance many times thats a rebound that he needs to get caral that rebound now George Mason on the Run well thats great defense out there Foster and Evans together prevented an Easy Pass inside oh Maddox almost walked Johnson a deep three oh he banks it in the first three of the half for George Mason sometimes its better to be lucky than good that was sort of a desperation kind of shot but all that said theyre within six points it has been a disjointed first half to say the least on both ends Tony skin telling his guys to slow down Applause heres Newton off the bounds goes right at flag and makes it a fourpoint game and thats Newtons game Newton likes to take the ball to the basket and thats what George Mason wants to do attack the basket Applause Applause hey we talked about George Mason how good they were defensively and youve seen it these last couple of Applause possessions Duke on a three and 1 half minute scoring drought can the Patriots take advantage and mauru had its jar Loose by Brown and itll stay here with six on the shot clock well George Mason getting a lucky deep shot Bank still open late in Durham and they make it a fourpoint game on this drive by Woody Newton thats Music 3 3 welcome back to ACC Network basketball presented by tro price invest with confidence what do you thinks being said there between two Duke Legends Coach K I dont know I dont know but the thing that impresses me is none of Coach Gays grandkids are there so how does he know how to use that phone maybe he could give you some pointers after the game somebodys got to give me some pointers but he and I are of an age and so Im very impressed that he is hes able to get Shane Bader to laugh by showing him things on his phone fourpoint game George Mason has somehow stayed in it while shooting just six of 20 from the floor they got to go quickly here three on the timer and they dont realize it and theyre not going to get the shot off thats coming out of a break and yet George Mason unaware of the shot clock situation their fifth turnover I guarantee you all the coaches are aware of it but what the coaches tell the players to do and what the players do are often two vastly different things are you speaking from experience yes on both sides I presume Applause yes flag takes flight and draws a foul on Hy he is pointing at the restricted Circle saying he was set that is the second foul on Haynes in todays college basketball world with the rules being what they are he was not set before that last foot planted prior to the jump and thats the rule hes still moving he gets set before flag leaves the the floor but thats not the rule anymore yeah the restricted area is really inconsequential when you got a player Taking Flight he was not set before the final foot planted for flag and thus the freshman at the line for Two Shots when youre looking at whether theres legal guarding position and thats what you have to have for there to be a charge call the Leal guarding position on an Airborne player and that was cup I that was flag excuse me cooper cooper cup Im my mind hes bad its on football it is on football but hes on my fantasy football team and he was terrible but anyhow Cooper flag is an Airborne player and so he had not planted that last foot he had the guy has to be in position before he plants the last foot and he wasnt see Cooper cups got me all Applause discombobulated lead back to six for Duke despite not making a field goal in the last four minutes and Counting Applause and again late in the shot clock phips long canle diving for the rebound but traveled in the process got to love that effort though from The Freshman fourth turnover on due and sometimes Matt as kiple just he has the ball you cant go sliding along the floor but sometimes its not a matter of what kind of shots you give up defensively but who youre giving up those shots to that was a three a wide open three by bips but he hadnt made a three all year this is a guy o Conor that George Masons got to get going just 0 for two to start this game and dribbled it off his foot six Patriot turnover gives it back to Duke now you talk about the versatility of Duke theres o Conor he is basically the starting point guard and hes being defended by kiple whos like 6 s Applause Mason Gillis kick out seon James back inside to Gillis head play underneath draws a foul and back to the free throw line go the Blue Devils you mentioned Gillis is a veteran guy and so you expect your veteran guys to make heavy heavy plays sees the defense coming he gets him right in the air bips is a great defender hes looking to block the shot and Gillis just fakes him off his feet Blue Devils in the bonus the rest of the first half oh Gillis was a really interesting portal pickup for Duke a guy that played four years at Purdue was vital in their success to the NCAA Championship Game a season ago and with all The Freshman on this Duke team how important is it to have a guy of his experience level particularly at the highest level of college basketball I dont know that you can quantify its just very important to have somebody to tell the younger players no no this is what we need to do but basically its their work habits more than anything else that the younger players can emulate final 2 and 12 minutes of the first half Duke on top 2316 that is erased by malawat thats a very optimistic drive right there trying to get it over malawat James left open good rebound by Anderson draws a foul on canle just his first and the Third on Duke but I think this is a critical last two minutes of this half for George Mason somehow theyve been able to stay in the game but you anytime youre in this building how many games have you seen in this building where Duke goes on some 0 run right before the end of the half and suddenly youre out of the game Johnson at three oneand done trip again for George Mason John Shire calling for his team to slow it down a little bit here with less than two minutes to go floated inside to malawat left hand no put back off the mark But the foul was there on George Mason and its number two on Emma juru well the only thing that was weird about that is malow watch actually dribbled the ball what a nice job moving with that left hand and again how many times have you said putb the Duke is just wearing them out on the offensive boards 10 offensive rebounds for the Blue Devils in the first Applause Music half well weve got SMU and Clemson covered on the ACC Network for their college football playoff first round games all starts Friday 4 Eastern with our special ACC PM preview show and continues Saturday before and after the games Bo Gillis almost had that on a a free throw and malow watch is a very good free throw shooter missed both of them now KD Johnson saying the balls a little bit slippery here and Byron Jareds going to wipe it off with the towel that was interesting never seen that before middle of the play and theyre going to honor it make sure that thing is dried up for the final 90 seconds and again Dan another the heck out of another big opportunity here for George Mason second opportunity for Duke results in no points still right in front of the Patriots what weve seen is their defense has kept them in the game and thats what your defense can do your defense can keep you in the game but eventually you have to put the ball in the basket and George Mason hadnt done that very effectively Patriots defense top 25 in the nation in a host of categories including scoring we are seeing that on display tonight in the first half John son inside amuru Maddox a three great rebound effort by bips and keeps it here hey Im really impressed with the way Duke is attacking these shooters on the perimeter they went after Anderson Anderson for George Mason an excellent threepoint shooter doesnt really drive it very much so they run at him force him to give up the ball and Maddox has not shot the three very well this year so far so hes a better guy would be shooting the three again KD Johnson right place right time rims it out Anderson wins it back for GMU less than a minute to go in the opening half Johnson gives it up to bips and it will stay here Duke has done a great job with pressure on the ball he sh looking up at the Jumbotron what is left of the Duke students after finals didnt like that call but nonetheless itll stay here and some love for Jared bips Haynes spin cycle and draws a foul on malawat and Haynes is slow to get up hnes just trips some Falls I mean I guess hes get his feet tangled up a little bit but Music thats thats what Haynes is looking to do is take the ball he can score inside with either hand but he likes to get that lefthanded dribble going and then spin to the Applause basket there he goes to the basket with the left hand off the side of the backboard Anderson trying to rip it away Duke basketball again malawat is 7 F2 with really long arms its hard to get the ball up over him and at some point you have to understand that canle into the chest of Anderson puts it in shot clock turned off for George Mason final 10 seconds of the first half Johnson a fade away rebound kiple three seconds kipple Applause George Mason goes into the but you get better you get you score more points when you run better offense and you run better offense you get easier shots Proctor sent Away by Jaylen Haynes now the big fellow running the floor and James is whistled for the block Jaylen haes looks at his head coach Tony skin and says my bad I should have passed it nonetheless a Duke foul W that the fact that James never got his feet set at all you have to have both feet on the floor facing the dribbler and he never did that and that collision and you dont you can understand James sort of turning to try to minimize the blow but if that blow is in Jamess chest then thats a charge again 68 265 and he left it off the front end behind the play numbers for the Blue Devil and thats how you shoot 20 you get you take tough shots and theres kiple thats thats just a great play six points now for the Applause Freshman George Mason hit just 1 three in the first half they were one for nine well off their Mark during this fivegame win streak in which theyve shot it better than 40 three times another tough shot by Haynes five to shoot OK Conor foul line pullup thats his game and he knocks it in hes really good at that and one thing that malawat is doing a great job of hes not letting Haynes go back to that left hand Haynes can shoot it with his right but thats a much more difficult Applause shot flag had seven first half points goes right to the 10 and draws a foul Applause well OK Conor with that leftand dribble and thats after an offensive rebound and cup is out there trying to prevent him from shooting the three but thats o Conors game hes really good off the dribble in the midrange Cooper flag okay Im not going to say Cooper anymore Im going to say flag Im done hows your fantasy team doing this year with Cooper cup very Applause poorly well this Cooper has been pretty good this year well he sure has the one thing that impresses me about flag among many other things he does such a great job maintaining his pivot foot he takes long strides but when he stops he maintains that pivot foot I mean he I mean just very skilled in in very interesting areas all right now this is a danger zone for George Mason Duke showing some pressure Maddox three ball and the woes from Deep continue for George Mason now one for 10 I think cup is 69 youre trying to shoot a three over him good luck and now a mismatch in the post on Newton and flag takes advantage double digits for Cooper flag and the the largest lead of the game for Duke if flag has that much time that close to the basket hes going to score 90 of the time inside to Haynes Newton Haynes put back sent away and its going back to the Blue Devils flag handles the ball so well he gets you in positions where you have a mismatch and again hes 6 feet n and hes just able to back down in against Newton and again unless youre going to come to double team him he he is hes really good with that turnaround jump Applause shot back to flag and he is taking over with 13 one one 60 Duke run Applause well John sh told us they havent done a lot to increase the complexity of the offense but what they have done is increased certain actions to get more out of Cooper flag maybe were seeing that here to start the second half flag I mean he handled the ball a lot in the first half he was two for 11 shooting its not like he didnt get his shots but here in the the second half early it just looks like hes gotten better shots and hes been able to convert OK coner drawing a double team finds Haynes George Mason shooting less than 20 from the floor flag waiting for seon James to get back into the picture and now the two lane transfer with the basketball flag extra pass proor puts in a three time out George Applause Mason Cooper flag in his bag to start the second half leads all scores with 13 and has Duke on a 90 run e Music all e e e Music welcome back to Cameron indor where Duke is on a 16 to2 run over the last 8 minutes in large part because of Cooper flag well and the other fact is flag has played very well but Dukes made four out of their five shots heres flag two for 11 in the first half two for two in this half the score was 206 with 4 minutes and 30 seconds left in the first half and we talked about how Duke can go on runs well they went on a 70 run to end the half and now they theyve outscored George Mason 92 to start this half Cooper flag has outscored George Mason in this half by himself Patriots looking for some kind of offense again Dukes pressure on the ball has been very impressive and their length has clearly been disruptive Phillips back out to Maddox scoreless to start the second half had seven in the first Newton and another contested three Off the Mark now o Conor dribble pullup no put back is good by nton but theyre going to wave the basket off and say there was a foul on Duke first Music Applause and that is number two on Cooper flag well this is a situation where flag shoves hannes in the back and that occurs before theres any shooting going on by George Mason George Mason could have used that basket I am extremely impressed with the way malawat is playing defense inside his help defense has really created issues oh thats a really strong take by Haynes slaps the floor on his way back Proctor malawat fighting for the offensive board and flag draws a Applause foul they need more of this from Jaylen Haynes and Company going into the tape of the 72 250 lb freshman flipping it up and in George Mason down 16 Applause to Applause you e Music Music well neither team has scored the ball particularly efficiently tonight but lets give some credit to the Duke defense who yet again tonight Dan has been exceptional on that side of to the floor coming into the game fifth in division one out of 353 schools in scoring defense and boy theyve been really solid tonight Cooper flag at the line for two shots I thought it was interesting with his good as the Duke defense has been and the rankings show that John Shire believes theres another level to it that his team can get to 15 for flag they lead by 18 hes got veteran guys in the transfer portal hes got new guys otherwise and hes trying to put the pieces of the puzzle Applause together Maddox to bips and George Mason whos shooting 35 from distance this year now just one for 11 tonight yeah but bips hadnt made a three all Applause year flag lost it but was bumped by phips and that is number two on the secondyear transfer from Sienna Conor and Newton and Anderson are the three best percentage threepoint Shooters on the team and theyve only taken five of those threes and none of them have made a three out of those five Applause Music attempts right in front of you 5 Seconds flag in the lane kiple trying to win it back and he will Johnson lost it out of bounds great effort Again by KH Applause kiple you dont get very highly rated in defensive stats unless you play hard and kiple plays hard and that was just a really smart play CR one of three duke freshman projected to go in the top 10 in this years NBA draft as brown finishes that beautiful play with a dunk you come and you try to take two guys double team con uh double team flag thats what happens hes a great Passer First point to the night for the Syracuse transfer gives Duke a 20point lead and Haynes gets tied up with brown and sells the foul ha steps toward flag nobody helps out and again Brown is a guy who just knows how to play he finds the open spots and flag finds Applause him into Maddox first points of the half for the leading scorer Darius Maddox what did Tony skin tell us this afternoon Maddox is going to have to have a big game and unfortunately for George Mason nobodys really had a big Applause game tend to shoot for Proctor p off by oconor three on Applause two Haynes right place right time puts it in and now hes grabbing his calf he is a demonstrative guy maybe cramping up a little bit as he hobbles to the end of the bench after that put back eight points for Jaylen Haynes HS it I mean hes in great position as he comes down immediately he grabs that calf and that youre right thats got to be a cramp he is being stretched out at the end of The George Mason bench and so in his place giovan uru comes in for George Mason George Mason for the first time tonight drops back into his Zone and again they theyve only given up 40 points here and were almost Midway through the second half their problem is they havent been able to put the ball in the basket Maddox Tony skin thought there should have been a foul bips drives right past Gils for two and we have seen that very few times tonight but George Mason is very good going toward the goal and I think John shy was a little bit irritated that saw that 60 George Mason run well be back in 30 seconds from Cameron indor Music Applause Music a little mini spurt here for the Patriots of George Mason draws him back to within 14 points and one of the things they havent been able to do is get to the Lane get to the get down the lane and that was a nice job by Emma juru screening off ground so he couldnt help out but for the most part Duke has done a really nice job staying in front of of dribbles dribblers and denying that dribble penetration Tony skin still working the officials thought there should have been a foul on the drive nonetheless that play resulting in points and a 60 run for George Mason their largest run of the game right and again points have been very hard to come by for the Applause Patriots out of the Duke timeout Tyrese Proctor with a basketball Applause Music George Mason matching up now flag with Applause five oh theres flag with the steal and draws a foul on Darius Maddox now Maddox had no idea that flag was there and that thats its a really tough pass by oconor you dont want to throw the ball into trouble Maddox has no idea that Flags there but Matt uh ok Conor could see him you dont make that pass four team fouls on George Mason still playing without Jaylen Haynes who did just return to the end of The George Mason bench and theyre only down by 14 I mean its not like its a 34point game they they still if they can get another little run going they can get right back in this thing Foster stepped out of bounds and well give it back to the Patriots getting stops hasnt been the problem scoring baskets has been yeah theyve held Duke to 33 from the field less than 30 from Beyond The Arc Dukes has scored 12 points off turn turnovers and theyre plus five in the fast break it t to shoot OK Conor with five well defended by canle and just had to throw it up there Off the Mark canle size I think really bothering o Conor watch out for Gillis and here comes KD Applause Johnson tried to sneak it through to Maddox nine turnovers on the Patriots and theyre going to win it right back not a whole lot of scoring in that last sequence we will step aside from Cameron indor Duke on top 40 to 26 Music Music for e Music Music for e Applause well coming up this Sunday after Christmas a huge quadruple header slate in the ACC womens Hoops starting at noon with Virginia at Notre Dame what a season Notre Dame has put together North Carolina back at it against the U and we round it out with number 21 NC State taking on Clemson at 600 pm Eastern all on the ACC Network and the ESPN app meanwhile back here at Cameron indor still a six so George Mason run over the last 3 and 12 minutes down 14 Darius Maddox with the basketball you just cant be pounding the ball youve got to move and pass because Dukes pressure on the ball has just been has just been dominated jayen Haynes back on the floor for George Mason with eight points points after suffering what appeared to be some cramping in his calf tend to shoot for the Patriots Maddox draws a double and its picked off by Applause Foster Gillis open three duke continues to struggle from out there theyve missed some wide open threes speaking of Anderson typically a very good threepoint shooter missing wide open and now George Mason one for 13 but they will keep the ball Anderson comes in at 50 from Beyond The Arc and like 90 of both his shots and his makes or threepointers thats what hes in there to do but he just hadnt been able to find the range tonight uhoh Anderson fouled by Gillis all kinds of bodies on the floor that is is the first on the Purdue transfer and the fourth on the Blue Devils and the following situation has been a factor in this game this is just a loose ball here until Gillis gives him the hip sends him on the other side of half court contact that results in a disadvantage to the defensive to the your opponent and advantage to you as a foul and that was pretty good hip check Applause Maddox just hadnt been able to get open Hayes against malow with 10 Duke brought a double but then the double backed off and Haynes was able to step through it if he can get to that left hand he can get it over malawat hes had a problem getting it over him with his right Applause nearly a 5minute scoring drought for the Blue Devils Proctor almost lost it across half court less than 10 to shoot flag jar loose Johnson wins it back Maddox Helter Skelter being tracked down by flag and now kiple doubled and theres a whist on bips and he doesnt like it and neither does Jaylen Haynes I think they called it on Haynes if its on Haynes thats his third it is on hannes and the fifth team foul on the Patriots now on the offensive end Haynes this is the first time hes been able to get steps right through see on James James stepped away from the double team and on defense he gets right up and look at his lower body going right into Colin kiple thats whats called a cylinder fou and you have this imaginary cylinder around you that protects your personal space if you will and you cant make contact like that in the cylinder meanwhile during that last replay another foul on George Mason against Zack Anderson thats his third and now Haynes will go to the bench with those three fouls Applause one more and Duke is in the bonus the rest of the way remember we started out saying how important free throws were to George Mason and theyve only attempted three in this game picked off by oconor tampy Towing the sideline and a thunderous by Cooper flly 17 for Dukes leading score its why you dont throw the ball in under the basket like that unless you know exactly who youre throwing it to better to just carry that one out of bounds and make Duke running out of bounds underneath play this a really tough pass he makes a nice play and just you know he never saw see on James but you got to give James some credit there too stepping back in not giving up on the play 12 Duke points on 10 10 George Mason turnovers and its back to a 14point lead for the number five team in the country Anderson with two rebound at majuru good luck against malawat itll stay here with 14 on the timer but there is very little room to get around the 72 Freshman well uru is 611 and weighs 265 lbs and in the A10 hes going to force his way around and through a lot of people but malawat is not only 72 he weighs 250 lb under 10 to shoot OK Conor trying to wiggle free Fade Away jumper wont go and malat the rebound cion James spin cycle rejected but a foul and that will put Duke into the bonus for the final 8 minutes and change of Regulation James does a really nice job at attacking off the dribble here and that foul was called on oconor I think nice job by bips coming over to help but Conor has really struggled today and hes been a key factor in this fivegame winning streak for George Mason and Duke has just done a great great defensive job against him theyve made him uncomfortable all night long well ACC PM with Mark Packer Taylor Tannon bomb weekdays for Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app every day during the week by the way George Mason foul trouble becoming a real problem OK Conor now with three Anderson with three Haynes remains on the bench with three meanwhile the Patriots won for their last seven Applause offensively James for Applause three Johnson and George Mason now one for 14 from distance as Emma juru puts the offensive rebound back he overpowered Malik Brown that time Brown not quite the bulk of Applause malawat Evans left open Cashes in from downtown thats what he is in there to do and I mean he catches it ready to Applause go hit four threes in the second half against Incarnate Word last week and that was last Touch by Malik Brown Duke maintaining a 17o lead finding points when they need them in control for e e Music e e Music Music now how did Evans get so open for that threepoint basket well lets start here and look at Malik Brown hes going to set the screen and now Watch What Happens here because Brown is coming back hes is going to set another screen but the big thing that happens here is you have going this way and then going this way the offensive player Proctor goes and he takes he takes the defender with him so it clears out the side so you have the screen there is nobody over there and when you talk about a guy who catches the ball ready to shoot that is a perfect definition of our friend Isaiah Evans and finally we get to break out the Telly Applause tonight meanwhile George Mason trailing by 17 Haynes kept it alive and now Haynes with 12 hnes is pretty good on his feet you know for a guy that a dancing bear 68265 its like a dlin Applause he plays hard he plays with an awful lot of emotion and enthusiasm uhoh flag Off the Mark rebound Brown kick out to Evans thats a three what a great job by Brown to turn around and find Evans you know a lot of times what we said earlier its not shooting the three but whos shooting the three and you can feel really confident with Evans out there hes defended by Brown goes right past him and lays it in brown didnt get any help that time Cooper cup was in position and didnt finish the play of course your head by 16 points theres no reason to get involved with that guy coming at you Haynes skip pass to Proctor James off the bouns counted in the foul kannes makes a mistake going out to attack on this particular play he runs out at seon James and theres just no way that that hes going to be able to defend him I mean hes Way Beyond the threepoint line if James is going to shoot a three out there you let him shoot the three you dont run out at him and let him drive right by you malat will keep it here and the offensive rebounding for Duke tonight has been spectacular that is number four on haes I mean its hard to block these guys out because theyre constantly Applause moving now wait a minute theyre trying to figure out malat going to the free throw and a little bit of a grin there from Cooper flag well flag you know if get a chance to go to the free throw line you go ahead malawat though he came in he missed both of his free throws today but he was 13 for 16 coming in one and one here as Haynes went to the bench with four fouls hes really been their only offense so how long do you keep him on the bench well at this point you know unless youre going to make a big run theres no reason to put him back in the game and we weve seen no evidence George Mason is going to mount anything like that down 20 added to a four fourpoint game with 4 and 12 minutes to go in the first half and then Duke went on a 162 run nice take there by Woody Newton fouled by malawat number two on the big fella from South Sudan and remember what we said at the start of the game that George Mason gets 24 of their points from the free throw line but for the most part Duke has been able to cut off those drives to the basket in to the Lane this is only the fourth free throw attempt of the game so its four points from the free throw line excuse me no youre right four points from the foul line tonight for George Mason out of their 37 that has not been their recipe for success Applause malat tipping it into the hands of KD Applause Johnson and thats a tough take by Johnson the Auburn transfer and again if those are the kind of shots that youre going to get its going to be hard to make a high percentage of them thats a really good play by KD Johnson but you just dont want to have to make shots that tough all the time Applause heres the Zone again they match up very quickly though flag Nifty as 19 hes just so smooth flag is going to the basket it seems every night hes flirting with a double double already four this season is two rebounds away from his fifth Music Applause and theres a foul on the floor after the Miss by KD Johnson and that will take us to our final media timeout in Cameron Applause indor ACC mens basketball is presented by Tio price invest with confidence Music Music Music e Music e Che Music well the outcome was not always in question tonight for John Shys team despite the 5639 lead with less than four minutes to go at one point they were in a fourpoint battle with 4 and 1 half minutes left in the first half but they have just gritted and thought their way to extend the lead and keep it and I think gritty is exactly the word to describe it and thats what John shy said to us earlier today that he thinks his team is just sort of toughed it out on offense that they havent been really smooth and thats what weve seen tonight but their defense has been outstanding and in particular I think Tyrese Proctor his pressure on the ball has really cut off the point of attack flag wins it back then draws a foul and one and one coming check that thats going to be the 10th foul Two Shots coming for Cooper flag and the second on Woody Newton Newton he thought he had a path and he just missed the ball and he got his arm tangled up with flag flag is everywhere all the time well Saturday ACC basketball returns to the ACC Network and the ESPN app as Cooper flag leads Duke to Georgia Tech and then our Prime Time West Coast matchup Cal Square off against number 23 San Diego State and for Duke tonight marks the end of the nonconference Slate Georgia Tech Will begin their conference play in Applause Earnest and Dan they they entered conference play having had a very successful nonconference slate including two wins against top 25 teams and they played a really tough nonconference slate though top 25 teams they played four games against powerhouses and they split them that January 7th game here at Cameron indor on ESPN against pit is a game that Im certainly intrigued to see Evans his third triple of the half better find him malawat with the eraser Applause and Maddox hits his first three of the game and the first of the half for George Mason its just really been a struggle for George Mason everything has been contested even that time flag was flying at him they hit a few more of those in the first tap and to start the second frame this is probably a different game but Duke made everything tough tonight Evans again Music what do you think about this Duke team are they clearly the favorite entering ACC play in your mind still after the first two months I I think theres no question about that I think that the surprise to me in the nonconference port of the portion of the schedule at the top of the ACC is that it appears that pit and Clemson are right behind Duke everybody thought it would be North Carolina and that the North Carolina still you know theyve got a really good team theyve struggled a little bit in the nonconference portion of the schedule but now theyll have a chance to get rolling in a very tough game against Florida tonight currently leading that game 8179 with less than 3 minutes to go that would be a huge win not just for Carolina but the conference as we move in ACC play Applause but thats I I think everybody thought Duke was going to be the best team and I think that right at this point in time that they are as I watch this Duke team so far the thing that has impressed me more than anything else is their defensive their defensive play tonight John Shire told us that he still didnt think they were as effective on offense as they need to be as he hopes they will be and I think thats a a tremendous assessment that you can see that tonight Applause I mean flag comes in on the season shooting only 22 from Beyond The Arc he makes that one and so now hes two for five on the night and you just expect that hell shoot the three better as the season goes on 24 for Cooper flag Haynes sent Away by malawat will go back at him oh thats a Nifty take with the right hand well we talked about the fact that can score with both hands but thats the first time hes been able to get it up over malow watch with the right hand tonight but how hard was that to score inside brutally hard and if you have to work that hard to score youre not going to score a lot of points and thats what we have seen tonight for George Mason I mean they have played hard this is a team that if they can just I mean theyre really good defensively if they can just get some scoring got to be a little more careful with the basketball they turn it over a little too much and of course a lot of people turn it over playing in Applause here flag inside to Malo watch fouled by Newton flag threw it up there where nobody else could get it except malawat and malawat didnt bring it down well weve got SMU and Clemson covered for their college football playoff first round games it all starts Friday 4 Eastern with our special ACC PM preview show and continues Saturday both pre and post Music game first season of the 12 team playoff two teams from the ACC in it and now Cooper flag will exit the game to a standing ovation after his fifth 20point performance of the Season hes got 24 points hes got nine rebounds hes got four assists hes got three Steals and hes got a blocked shot not a bad e another day at the office for the 17yearold Cooper flag final minute of action here at Cameron indor Duke will snap George Masons fivegame win streak and take a fivegame win streak of their own in the conference play taking on Georgia Tech in Atlanta on Saturday Applause this is an interesting play to say the least malawat on the drive draws a foul and another trip to the foul line for the Blue Devils malat thats probably the most hes dribbled the ball all year in one possession tough night for Tony skins team certainly you got to think with their defense though they will be a force in the A10 pick sixth in the preseason poll when youre talking about conference play coming up the 810 theyve theyve their teams have had outstanding nonconference seas in Rhode Island and St Bonaventure and Davidson George Mason Dayton beating two top 20 Big East teams very possible that come March the A10 is a m multi bid League George Mason hopes to be in that conversation but tonight too much difficulty scoring the basketball against one of the top defenses in the country and Duke will win their fifth Stak
