defense by the Mustangs SMU scored their most points in a game in 25 years 110 in a victory on Monday against Prairie View AM and here is boy Miller this time lining up against con Y clar into the lane Yan trayor off the Jump stop lays it off the glasses in treor the transfer from UC Santa Barbara with the first two beautiful job by SMU taking advantage of their size in the paint early in tonights contest tror starting his career in the SEC at Auburn both ball clubs is expected starting half court manto man Clary outside against the bigger Matt cross all the way underneath and out to the corner hubt is all covered up so Clary takes the three lots of threepoint attempts so far for State this season Hub tracks it down threepoint attempt back rib well Hub doesnt miss many had hit 18 out of 30 coming into tonights contest hit some big ones against Utah last Sunday no doubt about it hey Matt cross a deep one comes up short neither ball Club bashful about taking the quick outside shot so far now for Mississippi State they average 9 threes a ball game SMU at about 9 threes a game as well Applause for Mississippi State heres their starting five Clary Matthews an incredible glue guy Jones Jr hover and noo who gets on the board nice job woko positioning himself in the paint boy look at that double team in the corner so quick by Mississippi State one of my keys to this game is can SMU withstand the physicality of this Mississippi State team they will hurt you quick Bulldogs known has an excellent defensive team under Chris Jans in his third year as the head coach lets look at those keys well thats uh Mississippi state has to be defend the Mustang threes how about that job getting back in transition defense SMU blocking hubs effort yatu with his second block already the sevenfooter getting back cross the offensive rebound off the Edwards Miss well smart positioning by cross there for the offensive rebound he get all of the the 72 guy out of turkey to cross threepointer this time its bottoms a cross the transfer from UMass coming up big for the Mustangs got dinged up a little bit in the opener but he has come back strong he was honored for crossing a th000 career points before the game Herbert on the drive great shooting threes but also getting to the foul line cross pulls away the big board and SMU has been great on the boards this season Mississippi State normally a great rebounding team theyve struggled a little bit in that respect early on this season simply cuz theyre not as big as they normally are Edwards rocking the baby to the cup off the glass in Edwards not only playing good on ball defense but how about that nice kiss off the glass splitting the maroon shirted Bulldog defense little 50 run take a 72 lead for SMU Edwards following hovered wherever he goes on the floor now boy Miller picks him up hard mantoman defense early on for Andy enfields team Edwards knocks it away Miller has the steal it a 2on one cross flying in 92 lead a textbook transition basketball by SMU you cant do the two on one better than that SMU 20 fast break points per game this season thats second best in the ACC number 16 in the nation thats a foul on boopy Miller thats a tough assignment bopy Miller very very very quick but thats a tough assignment look at BJ Edwards great hands leading to this two on way one play nice finish by cross good pass by poy Miller Miller the Mustangs leading score but hes also their leading assist just going to say he made the nice assist to show us why he leads in that category six assists per game thats not only leading the conference and leading uh the SMU Mustangs but third best in the ACC Mississippi state gets Kean Murphy into the game and he pays immediate dividends the junior out of Birmingham Ramsey High School hits the runner well Murphy did a nice job of reading the SMU defense they just kept backing up and he jumped and drilled it Murphys coming off a big game as that foul goes on Cameron Matthews Murphy coming off a career best 18 points and 14 rebounds but its SMU often running early the ponies lead by five right coach Jan said this season well see a brand new style of offense for this Mississippi State team in the past theyve used that inside out style of offense but this season theyll have to switch it up he said because you know we have a lot smaller of a team this year so we cant play as download dominant we have to play more perimeter oriented basketball so theyre using threepoint shots more than they ever have before which capitalizes on their leading scorer Josh Hub who averages about 5 threes a game this season so coach said theyre really trying to tailor to that strength by utilizing the perimeter cross in and out on a deep one and Coach Hower he coach Jen even said hey we as coaches were kind of learning on the Fly about how were best able to score this season well thats a good point how theyre best able to score the good coaches adjust their style to the strength of their team he is one of the best at it Chris Jan of course had great success at New Mexico state and Bowling Green and numerous Championship junior college teams across the country the man does a good job no doubt about it in his third season as the head coach at Mississippi State 46 and 27 lot of neutral sight nonconference wins but not many wins in True Road games in nonon at least not last year as the shot by Chuck Harris goes begging but he is fouled Harris coming off back to back really nice games he had 21 at Butler 17 against prview AM well Harris is a proven Talent he was great last year in the American Athletic Conference hes going to be great in the ACC terrific Defender great great shooter Im very impressed John with the way smus moving the basketball here early against a very tough Mississippi State Defense this be very impressive so far got Cho picks up the foul he didnt play against Utah but get get some time out there early here Chuck Harris great foul shooter 85 coming in and goes one of two this trip coming off a career year last year and just 29 Points from 1500 in his career coming into to the night young man bringing the ball up for Mississippi State played at Penn State last year terrific player there almost 17 points a game last season for Clary who can definitely score but comes off here Harris around Clary on the pick and roll gou hes an excellent distributor no look pass extra pass Edwards three yes thats what Im talking about SMU great movement of the basketball perfect spacing on the court and it really started with yigu passing out of the double absolutely and its 72 he sees the floor so cleanly SMU up 13 to four shot looked pretty bad there and snu comes down with another rebound doubling up Mississippi State 8 to four trying to find some kind of balance offensively the Bulldogs treor on the drive up sit to the hoof for two what a take by the 61 Yan trayor and smus Dom well great concentration that time all the way to the rack nice finish trayor has four SMU getting contributions from across the board and theyre up by 11 Music a 60 burst over a minute span for SMU leading Mississippi State 154 and not much for Mississippi State on the offensive side either so far Jim palen well smus defense has a lot to do with it theyre dictating the movement of the ball by Mississippi State doing a great job on the defensive boards down ball is sticking on the Mississippi State side and the SMU side its moving Cho in the paint against big toou couple international players going at it the Miss didnt hit Rim six to shoot it John we got a really rockus crowd here at Moody Coliseum tonight is always across from us that student section especially vibrant tonight I think this is exciting here on the campus got an SEC team against the new ACC team lots of fun at SMU right now of course the Mustang football team playing at Virginia tomorrow with a chance to CCH its appearance in the conference Championship football match up deep three by claudell Harris comes up way short hes a guy that will trigger to pre on you and SMU continues to force bat shots well the size of SMU gives all opponents a lot of trouble SMU put out a very big lineup and played all Zone in the second half against Prairie viw AM in a big victory tonight not really go in zone they go in their Normal manto Man Edwards locks it up for trayor great job to get in the passing Lane by Harris Jr looking for some points the other way love pass up top kesan Murphy throws it down well not a good defensive transition job by SMU on that occasion we talked about how good SMU is in the fast break and they are Mississippi state is too 18 and a half fast break points a game 33rd in the country eatu knocked out of his hands by the smaller quicker Melendez SMU has 19 to shoot of course eigo missed the first two games of the year still some eligibility questions but he has made a big impact for the Mustangs in the last three games now you mentioned their game against Prairie View that was their last outing they didnt have a good first half but they had a great great second half coach infield said he was not happy with the effort are the defense in the first 20 minutes of that game but theyve come out here tonight full of eny Harris sets up cross he continues to pull deep threes that he says that Murphy got that tip no doubt about it nice job by the officiating crew got a good uh thre men crew working here Lee Castle Courtney green and KB verett cross trying to add that threepointer even more to his game not that he didnt do it at other stops but one for four still hes filled it up Five Points four four rebounds two assists so far for number 33 in white heres another guy working on his threepoint shot just off the mark by Keon Ambrose Hilton he says the rest of the team has really been building him up and giving him confidence to shoot that outside shot hover on the take sets it up to Murphy his threepointer a little bit long and here comes SMU that was a nice block out by Trey or there to get the break started for the musin Ry Miller out front leads SMU in scoring one top scorers in the ACC at 184 a game Harris the blow by runs into the double cross Miller 12 to shoot SMU with this four out motion offense Harris side steps wide open three offensive rebound and Ambrose Hilton is blocked Away by Kean Murphy athletic play oh great athleticism on the floor tonight that was a phenomenal block by Murphy Murphy may be coming alive he had his Breakout game last time out 18 points 14 rebounds he was so crucial in the win over Utah in the post Walker singled up comes up short nice on ball defense that time for the Mustangs great job by treor once again luy Miller off balance doesnt matter his first two yeah great body balance for boy Miller that young man knows how to play the game of course he was great hes been great in the ACCC for three years at wake far Murphy jump stopping the ACC logo how about that job by cross cutting off that Baseline terrific defense Murphy scooping to the hoop little bit too strong and cutting in on the backside for the rebound Melendez and he earns foul shots on the other side but rare offensive success for Mississippi State so far a head scratcher for Jans and Company so far in Dallas Music Christians team facing a first half double digit deficit for the second straight game but Mississippi state was able to pull out of it pick up the win over Utah last time out at New Mexico State before this one regular season championships four of them while a head coach with the agies and Conference tournament titles so he was going dancing and hes been dancing all both of the years hes been with Mississippi State as well back from the timeout RJ Melendez Puerto Rico at the line for a couple John both these ball clubs the coaching staff say one of their greatest strengths is the depth on both teams so far Mississippi state has played nine SMU has played Seven thats going to be something to watch here because this is a fastpaced very aggressive tough game Mississippi State changing it up defensively a little bit trying to put some kind of spoke in the wheel of this SMU offense meanwhile bulldog trying to get things going on the other end as well well thats a trademark of Chris Jans the Mississippi State coach they do he does like to change defenses didnt work that time great break without the ball by Harris and again yatu on the assist threepointer out of the corner by Harris Off the Mark rebound for boy Miller great Euro Step going over the top of Hub and fouled on his way to the bucket Kevin poopy Miller in a Flash Andy Enfield the head coach of SMU the head coach at USC for 11 years in Florida Gul Coast before that really I dont know everybody talks about his offense and his Pro style offense but man what a great defensive start to this game well man hes he knows the game hes a great great coach had the great success I first got drawn to his ability when he was the coach in Florida Gulf Coast and they upset that John Thompson coach Georgetown team and with much less personnel and hes he has done a great job since coming to SMU working this transfer portal in nil to Perfection he has a very good team and in one year too yeah its just amazing to me and I dont think he would have made the switch if he didnt think it could be an immediate were competitive type deal but hes put together a great great team when you have a university like this in the city of Dallas you got a lot going for you nice play good drive that time by hover on the board for the first time yeah so quick he is he is a dynamite player SMU they have got to keep him under control here tonight that was one of my keys we didnt get to talk about game opening up a little bit Mis intended pass and Kendo is called for the offensive foul meanwhile RJ Melendez really took a shoulder charge there he gives the thumbs up hes going to be all right well this is a tough break for Oquendo it really uh wasnt anything he could do about that he had to go get the pass and uh good team defense Melinda rotated over for Mississippi State Mendez in his first season at Mississippi State I Georgia I see Riley cougal has come on the floor now for Mississippi State he was a standout at the University of Florida last year one of their Premier Shooters in the Southeastern Conference got good size lets see if they get the ball to him for some perimeter action cuz Josh hubard attracts a lot of attention nothing from outside for hubard yet but he can get started in a hurry kishan Murphys been good with four points operating from the high post on yigu comes up short Melendez was there for the follow it didnt happen yigu is down its a four on five for SMU and theyre going to stop it back behind the play as ouu is still down in the Box area well Chuck Harris got a good tough rebound and got that transition break started for SMU but thats a tough tough break for SMU youo you know You got to hope the youngster is okay just a freshman at 72 that young man has a fabulous future thats a big ankle to roll if indeed thats what it was and at least able to come off under his own power good news for SMU but e to has been good so far thats a big loss hes got a couple of assists in his time on the floor y on trayor back in for SMU this mustang team has such versatility as well talking about it in the last game where they had a 69 two guard on the floor at one point in Tibet gorer who we havent seen as of yet and just a lot of different guys that can play several different positions makes you tough to guard it makes you tough to get past as well well stated they are a very very versatile team with a lot of Firepower in different spots talking about Firepower that little guy may not be big but he plays very very big hoopy Miller going up against Josh hubber you think theres a charge in hoopy Millers game tonight absolutely thats a big challenge hubard very much belly hood is one of the top guards in the country second team allc last year some tabulating him as a preseason AllAmerican this take by Melendez hes able to flick it in off the glass smus lead back down to 11 oh nice awareness by Melendez to go under the defense that time with the flip to the Music boet hand off Miller looking to operate deflected ball Ambrose Hilton has it in a double more good strength by Ambrose Hilton chck Harris adjusting to the left hand Matthews clears the car Melendez in transition stepping back but a quendo is there oh miss inside in one for Mississippi State as kesan Murphy is left alone against bopy Miller yeah Keon Ambrose Hilton had his back turned to the passer that time did not see the ball going in quickly nice job by Mississippi State recognizing bopy Miller running Murphy at 610 SMU was not able to get the help by Ambrose Hilton like they would like its big foul second on Miller yes he 38 left in the first half and Miller goes to the bench that was really a heads up play by Murphy to make that pass into who received that pass from the perimeter good job by him posting up quickly versatile blue guy Cameron Matthews is the guy that made the pass and now Matthews more than 200 Steals on his career defending Edwards up the floor a quendo left alone for three off to the mark long rebound Here Comes Mississippi State only down by eight after the poor start Matthews is left alone a quendo poers in for the board well you nailed it on Matthews a while ago John when you said how versatile he was that youngster can do a lot of good things Harris tough shot Murphy another rebound hes coming off a career high 14 thats a blocking foul local fans do not agree as o quendo picks up his first foul shots on the way for Mississippi State Mississippi State coach Jan said that one reason this team is so successful against such power programs early on in the season is that he preaches to the team that these games matter for March he said teams talk a lot about how these games will be in conversation to put in their tank when Mississippi state is in conversation to potentially be in March Madness he said of course the end games matter too but he said these games can really be a Make It or Break It situation in the long run Josh hubard fills it up thanks so much Bri and you Mississippi stayed on the road last year you know big road wins theyre such a huge factor in in March Madness and in seeding as y to is back out there and its going to St with the SMU they were only two and eight in True Road games last season hey still made the tournament cant take anything away from a great Chris Jan team but this is an opportunity to prove how good you are well theres no doubt about that of course that basket by hubard bringing him back within five points that was his first outside shot of the ball game comes into tonights contest hitting 60 of those threepoint efforts 18th straight game with a made three acendo in the midt ah how about the pass I really like the way this big guy passes the basketball yigao finding his teammate breaking into the paint thats already his third assist hover laying it up and kesan Murphy on the the other end Murphy coming off that 1814 rebound game and he is up to nine well thats the leading score making the assist to the number three score on this Bulldog team nice teamwork SMU trying to keep moving the ball up by five a quendo open from the wing bottoms oh nice job passing out of the corner BJ Edwards beautiful job on the assist on the other end Hubbert not just a threepoint shooter fouled by yigu the great free throw shooter heads to the line for a couple boy Andy infield right there you couldnt see him I dont believe on the screen but hes hot at his team for not playing good defense on that last transition by Mississippi State o quendo drilling it right there hes just got a beautiful follow through on his shot Josh Hubbert out of Madison Mississippi more than 4000 points in his high school career just a a ridiculous score and in the process uh Hub last year is a freshman 85 of the foul line yeah many people are calling him the best freshman in Mississippi State history thats a big statement theyve had some great players there but he had the numbers to prove it he came on the latter part of the season and it was just phenomenal hes the one that led him to the NCA tournament for the second straight year yeah thanks to the great SEC tournament run as well to really solidify that trip to the CAA Applause tournament Edwards out front with SMU up by six crosses back in crosscourt pass wide open look o quendo again backto back Triple A quendo plays with great confidence when he has that shot and hes squared up hes not hesitant about taking it at all good movement perfect spacing Again by SMU quo stepping into the starting lineup when cross went down with an injury and minute and a half into game number one cross now back in the starting lineup and aindo coming off the bench a really nice job tonight couple bounces hover cant make it go but staying with it cougal deep two and ULU brings it in nice job by the big freshman going and getting the long defensive rebound I like that as some news led by double figures a couple times its knocked away from hover but he gets it right back hover spots up for three in transition Way Off the Mark and is this going to count theyre going to count the basket yes and say theres a foul on the floor and the officials are going to look at it see if the ball got released in time by Riley cougal a look at it here after the foul on SMU tror well k b berett immediately called this bucket good lets lets watch it right here on the putb real quickly and then the foul was called so biggest Play Let Them sort it out and tell us what the result is youu with the foul so initially basket was called good well see if that happens to be the case or not as the officials take a look at the bang bang play and theyre going to tell us the foul was prior to the shot being okay yeah the officials are observing this to see if the foul was before the shot was taken I I think it was I think it may have been I mean just based on what youo did here so its the second shot I mean thats the foul yeah so yeah theres obviously the the foul was before after fot the review the foul occurred before shooting motion there is no basket the clock will be reset to 539 foul thank you yeah were going to have just a one in one common foul on Yu he quickly picks up his first foul SMU has two players with two fouls a piece a quendo and Miller seven team fouls so a one and one on the way from Mississippi State heres where the Bulldogs were able to make their comeback the other day on Sunday against Utah is at the foul line coach they went to the foul line for 33 attempts made 24 of them this is where they really made some hay in their comeback well as aggressively as they go to the rack theyre going to go to the free throw line a lot and and theyre a good free throw shooting team theyre coming into tonights game well Im sorry they they are not as good a free throw shooting team as I thought hitting 69 you need to be at least 70 or better theyve got some good individuals off rebound two of them three of them goodness Mississippi states going to get another shot a great offensive rebound by Shawn Jones and 17 offensive rebounds in the Utah win H comes up short culbert Del clutches the board pounded and SMU finally comes out with it Mississippi State really having a tough time finding the bottom of the basket shooting 25 SMU at 55 offensive f Edward yeah theyre getting him sticking that shoulder out right there there was a uh instant call Eagles pick were going to have a chance to take a look at it what you that that was very very close he he did stick the shoulder out a little bit but uh sometimes they call that partner and sometime they Applause dont Mississippi State trying to cut into the SMU lead even further SMU staying in this tough half court mantoman defense its been good all night long holding Mississippi State to only 22 points here with only 450 to go in the first half Edwards denying a couple triple handoffs finally inside to Murphy and he is called for the travel as he petts his way around Colbert yeah Colbert did a nice job of moving his feet there did not reach good defensive discipline by Colbert forcing that turnover SMU up 3122 Mississippi State a team that has popped 28 threepoint shots a game early this season but theyre just one of 10 from outside so far the one make by you know who Josh up going give SMU defense a lot of credit for keeping him to just one three here in the first half cross overhanded pass out of the corner CT offensive rebound thats a thing of beauty Two Shots Im going to tell you something John SMU does this really well you watch when that ball goes up from the left side they immediately go to the right hand side of the basket to try to get the offensive putb the highest percentage of shots come long theyre positioning themselves very very well for those retrievals and put backs and resulting fouls Melendez call for the foul Drell Co coming off of his best game as a Mustang on Monday against prair View AM now hes a transfer into the SMU program from Kansas State and one of the key pieces to help SMU pick up a lot of offensive rebounds they are 17th in the nation right now in offensive rebounding at almost 16 a game and theres a reason for that theyre very tall and theyre very athletic and that usually results in a lot of good offensive rebounding and evidently as you mentioned they do a good job of knowing where its going to be as well four minutes left in the first half approaching that point another double digit lead for SMU here in Dallas Clary on the pull up another big cord this time oo well quindo is having a good first half for the Mustangs hes knocked down two of those threepoint balls there he got a good tough rebound cross in a double team loses his footing o quindo makes the extra pass and brose Hilton bumped PL get time to shoot Edwards calls for the high screen tries to split the double team nothing doing five to shoot and its out of bounds off Edwards and thats a nice quick double team by Mississippi State forcing the Mustangs into that turnover Mustangs up by 10 with 339 to goed okay Applause Jo W yep its hubard Josh hubard that hes cousins Music with and theyre tossing to me correct yeah Music the blue hat on Dwayne Wade has like a bright blue hat on you see him right right Music okay SMU up by 10 big time matchups mean well Big Time Personalities in the building Briana senson who have you spotted thats right we have a very special guest here today NBA legend Dwayne Wade I asked him why hes here today and he said hes cousins with Josh Hub its his first time seeing him play and he heard hes been doing amazing things out on the court so he wanted to come see it for himself but Jim do you happen to see any similarities and styles of play between the two cousins well of course Dwayne Wade was 65 jumping jack hubs a 511 jumping jack hovert is great Dwayne Wade super great one of the alltime greats in NBA history I still remember when he was a star at Marquette University doing great things but its cool having him here in the building no its outstanding you know the thing about Dwayne Wade is he was Public Enemy Number One for Dallas Maverick fans back in 2006 you know time heals all wounds really does doesnt it well for most people but an incredible Ovation here in Dallas oh he did no doubt about it you know everybody respects what Dwayne Wade did over the years and steps out of bound thats two straight sideline turnovers for SMU right at just about the same spot Mustangs up by eight theyve got to keep their intensity Applause going SMU has been up by as many as 13 in this first half what SMU has to make sure they do is stop giving Mississippi State offensive re rebounds Mississippi state has 10 offensive boards here in the first half right there just talking about it thats 11 see thats going up tough cougal went right over cross that time cross had the position Riley cougal the H its a sixpoint game cutting that SMU largest lead more than in half Harris crosscourt cross Texas feet threepointer Bots nice job by SM coming right back to counter that aggressive offensive rebound by Mississippi State Matt cross with his second three Mississippi state has struggled from outside Matthews going to work dis loock knocked away Ambrose Hilton on the ground a quendo is to let the bodies hit the floor its SMU ball well both teams working so hard here tonight what a great contest we have the opportunity to see good early season matchup SEC and ACC there you go great look at it right there Riley cougal the transfer from Florida just up and over cross but here cross comes right back at him out of the left corner great job by SMU moving the ball quickly to the open shooter Matt cross leading the A10 an effective field goal percentage last season 59 in this effective field goal percentage not down down a couple threes already Chuck Harris with the dribbling Wizardry against Hub Ambrose Hilton through the lane awendo looking for his third triple not this time long rebound knocked out to clar and here comes Mississippi State trailing by nine hover in the corner too much space he knocks the bottom out well hes got such a quick release he may be only 511 but hes got such a great Le jump and he releases that ball so quickly defense has to be anticipating quicker more than 103s last year heu inside blows the bunny its going to be SMU ball yeah we hear some eager SMU fans hollering at yulu dunk it next Music time a quendo good for first half comes out and Edwards back on hes played well especially defensively iGo has such a phenomenal future just a freshman at 72 moving like he does travel y yeah he was looking inside and kind of in between what he thought he should do and what he should not do Mississippi state has the eighth best turnover margin in the nation through their first four games plus eight in the turnover margin and tonight theyre Plus five not even all the way through the first half and SMU led by as many as their team but Mississippi State could cut it down to a one possession game with a three that one almost went in off the deflection by Applause Music Applause Endo SMU shooting a cool 50 from the floor five of 14 from three Ambrose Hilton wraps around to pass extra pass by cross to O quendo his third triple of the first half I just cannot say enough about how well SMU is passing the basketball you can pass it faster than the defense can move smus proven it tonight oh Clary with a 61 guy standing over him knocks down a clutch three Bo what a game weve got two terrific teams battling out here at Moody Coliseum both manto man defense all the way its just starting to heat up as SMU spends their use it or lose it time out at the end of the first half SMU by six over the course of the night well both ball clubs are adjusting to the physicality of the other both playing very very physical both teams are playing very well on the offensive end I keep going back to how well SMU is facing the floor and how well theyre passing the basketball against this terrific Mississippi State Defense Mississippi State despite shooting only 35 from the floor still able to get that comeback win over Utah the other day only shooting 32 in the first half to smus 52 but right in it only five to shoot here for Edwards as he goes to work turning the corner two to shoot one throws it away long pass up the floor cougal cutting in and hes fouled with a chance to end the first half with a one and one well it was a real handicap for SMU not having boopy Miller on the floor here in the latter stages of the first half there was a notable difference in their port management with him off the floor its a great Point picked up that second foul now Chuck Harris whistled for his first a chance for Riley cougal six of eight at the fou line this season to go to the line for the 1 and one just three left in the half so well you got to give Mississippi State a lot credit for getting that ball up the floor so quickly and drawing the foul on SMU two seasons at Florida for Riley kou hes hearing it from the crowd front end no problem for Riley koug his careerhigh 25 against a ranked Baylor team last year for the Gator as a sophomore hes known as a great pure shooter and playing very well here in this heated contest tonight goes one of two to end the half SMU leads by as many as 13 but Mississippi States theyre known to grind it out on you and that is exactly what Mississippi state has only played 8 and 12 minutes the first half that could be a big difference maker for the Mustangs here coming into this second half of Action Now Matthews bashing his way inside and Cameron Matthews hits the bucket yeah Mississippi State cleared the side Matthews had a clear easy shot to the basket he took advantage of it nice opening possession by Mississippi State its his first bucket he did have five assists in the first half BJ Edwards meanwhile had five turnovers for SMU five of the nine thats something to watch Miller in the lane great T off tror to slam well there you see the effect of boopy Miller in the ball game he draws a crowd defensively somebodys going to be open when he penetrates using that quickness cougal starting the second half cougal in and out and back in again well kudle has been a big contributor for them tonight didnt get a lot of points but he had five rebounds in the first half including four offensive boards at 65 its a twopoint game remember it was a 13point contest hover takes it Applause away Mississippi state has never led a chance to tie or take the lead on this possession houg Clary Baseline hand off tie game Cameron matth lays at home well good start to the second half for Miss Mississippi State not so good for SMU they look a little lackluster coming out of the halftime Mississippi State coming from 12 behind Matthews has four points and an assist in this run to e Music in his career a couple of games ago against Butler was recognized before the game by his head coach and by the staff as well cross back in the game having a nice effort eight points five rebounds four assists but lead story of the second half is Mississippi States comeback we have not been knotted up in this game since it was 22 its 40 all yeah Mississippi state has outscored the Mustang 7 to2 in the first minute and a half of this second half of action Mustangs have got to get their intensity back they started the game the more intense of the two teams not So Much Anymore the adjustments have been made by the Bulldogs theyve got a deep team theyre bringing in the right guys as Miller attacks the glass Matthews a great defender hopping mad and Miller earns foul shots well FY Miller just has the ability to create things right here Mississippi State not sure what hes going to do he forces that foul nice job by the young man that has terrific quickness Matthews and I went straight up hands up came into my area but Millers prone to do that he picks up a lot of his points at the line yeah he came into the game averaging 762 from the charity stripe just a good good pure shooter hitting 70 uh 47 from the field hes just so quick and like I said he only played 8 and A2 minutes of the first half because of the two quick fouls that he picked up but thats what Josh hubard will do to you two of two trip for bopy Miller and he crosses the 1100 Point plateau in his career with that second free throw he had at least 20 in each of the first three games this season foru Mustangs Tred get back on the winning streak and stay unbeaten at home heres Hub stepping back didnt take the Deep two Matthews against trayor and trayor shoulders him and picks up his first foul of the second half second overall foul on Yan trayor thats a tough match up for trayor Matthews at 67 so versatile one of the real stands out in the SEC the last several years he started Matthews has started 41 of the last 43 games so hes got a lot of experience and how many of them has he closed thats probably the bigger question and coug is upset that he didnt lay that one home tried to make the extra pass do the unselfish thing 16 to shoot so Mississippi State taking care of the ball again but thats what they do this team does not turn it over much only four turnovers in the game theyve got the offensive rebound game going and now finally the balls going in the hoop theyve been able to get it back to nearly even here in Dallas yeah thats the reason why this game was close even though smus shooting so much better Mississippi State only has four turnovers to 10 for SMU and then you combine that with the offensive rebounding thats why Mississippi State has stayed close even though their field goal percentage is not good Miller caught in the switch didnt matter Matthews fumbles it out SMU by two Miller and Matthews hits it once twice and the third time its contact with the back of the basket the underside of the goal SMU ball 20 to shoot Miller looked like he was going to try to go behind his back at the very first move down the paint but quickly changed his mind when he saw the Mississippi State Defenders closing in rapidly remember not only scoring 18 a game but also dishing off morein six assists of all game Yu slips nobody to pass to makes that extra dribble move to the hoop oh a nice job by keeping the ball down low normally a 72 Guy when he bounces it its too high and the defense has time to react not that time the big freshman from Turkey getting it done for the Mustangs you notice how he bounced that ball so low when he made that move to the bucket AB thats a big time experienced move right there tror picks up his second watch this watch him he splits that defense doesnt give him time to come in and get the steel almost got the tie up but by bouncing it so low he was effective going all the way and getting the Finish great job by freshman game within the game hes Jim Hower Im John little Brie senson with us as well wide open triple kesan Murphy hits the three its a onepoint game well Murphys having a great outing for the Bulldogs here tonight what a shot that was hes he just keeps making big plays coming off the 18point outing hes got a dozen to lead all Mississippi State scores the deflection made by cougal its off of cross and Out Mississippi State forces the 11th turnover by the mustach or Riley cougal not a lot of scoring but hes making some big plays to keep state in the ball game cougle coming over in the portal from Florida after two seasons making that n transfer and hes looked good at a season High 14 against Georgia State hand off Hub three for the lead Off the Mark well did you see that vertical jump on that shot attempt by Hub goodness gracious hes only 51 but he can go up and over just about any Defender thats why hes so effective at my goodness only 510 yes exactly Music Applause Music first big test for SMU at home this season first big road test true Road game for Mississippi

the lead hover will do it himself move what a move that kid has got great Natural Instincts what a finish you have to respect him obviously at the threepoint line and knowing that the head fake got it done yigu tries to fire back and no shot hes fouled on the floor this one will go on desan Murphy Mississippi State leads for the first time tonight whoop hover the bucket stayed on top Music Music

always a fun team to watch in person at the Arizona tip off in Tempe UNLV on Thanksgiving Day and then Butler or Northwestern taking on pit that is an official ACC sec Challenge and then couple of regional matchups pray viw AM and MCN at home you can find that one on the U that MCN team dang good out of the South l boy Miller inside W round pass reverse lay in to put SMU back in front by Keon Ambrose Hilton oh a nice move without the ball by Ambrose Hilton that time finding the open spot for boopy to get this little shovel pass to him thats four assists for Miller against three turnovers Miller thought had a clean theft not so much its on Keon Ambrose Hilton the First on Ambrose Hilton and team found number three on SMU John Im just continuing to be amazed by the athleticism and the quickness at every position on the floor here tonight you can see Ambrose Hilton there getting the reach its great preview of what SMU is going to see on a night in Night Out basis in the ACC right well theres no doubt about that this is a a terrific matchup between two very very good teams keep saying Mississippi states been in the NCA tournament the last two years hovered way off there youa totally changing that shot at 72 he already has two blocks how about the block out by ose Hilton Harris misses from the elbow cougal finds Clary pitch back to Matthews SMU back defensively nice cut to the basket by Matthews but SMU covered it well Yoba couldnt pull down the rebound Matthews Cuts in for it cougal on the backside against Ambrose Hilton SMU wanted a walk foul on SMU its on Harris all this because of another offensive rebound by Mississippi State great Point second foul on Chuck Harrison offensive rebound number 12 for Mississippi State thats their first in the second half rather itll be number 13 once they update the stats here however when one of the interesting things is for Mississippi State despite the fact theyve got all these offensive rebounds they only have six second chance points well theyve been in position to get the pass back out and restart their offense yatu a little slow to get over fouls Murphy Ean Murphy continues to break out and be a factor heading to the line John you brought up a good point a lot of people think when you get offensive rebounds its almost automatic that you got the opportunity for the put back a lot of Mississippi States offensive rebounds have been longer they kick it out and get their offense restarted and that leads to more scoring opportunities weve seen that twice here in the second half already what have you seen from Kean Murphy hes coming off that big double double and following that up with a really big effort for Chris Jan tonight well hes their third leading scorer so hes expected to be a producer for this bow Club hes better all around than I thought he would be for his size he moves very very well well remember hes a guy that only averaged Five Points and three rebounds last year as the second one goes down one of two trip that time we may have a delay of game Applause here eigo doing a Public Relation job with the stripe shirts right now trying to tell him what to look for the Turkish ambassador to America American basketball yes hes are going to be a good one already is Harris turning the corner little push off Harris has been held to one of five shooting an off night for him coming off 17 and 21 in his last two yigu on the clear out gets low to the ground in the paint going up and a foul called igu fouled on the hack as cougal made that nice strong step to the bucket a couple of possessions back right here he probably should have gone ahead and taking that shot quicker he gave Mississippi State time to come in and almost double team him with more on the Turkish ambassador to American basketball heres Brie senson yeah poopy Miller described c igu as an absolute Game Changer he said his presence is a huge addition to this team its a hard to guard the 7 foot2 265lb freshman as we see him right now shooting free throws boy said a lot of guards would be really scared to drive theu and potentially getting their shot blocked so his presence is a real anchor to this team two for two trip at the line as well well hes now 12 of 17 on the year pretty darn good for a 72 freshman thats still actually learning the game hes a skilled guy he is I love the way he passes the basketball hes got got three assists here tonight thats been instrumental in SMU establishing this lead of course with experience playing against older players in European leagues that always helps flashing to the basket reverse layup ties it up and coming off the bench Melendez right right to the bucket without the basketball Ambrose Hilton just got caught right there did not Retreat quick enough Melendez has six Off the Bench in this game Mississippi State outscoring SMU 27 17 ball lost Melendez up the floor layup good to put Mississippi State in front by claudell Harris and nice twoonone game by Mississippi State there in transition handled the opportunity very well Harris dumps it off shot by Ambrose Hilton adjusted and a chance for the Bulldogs to grow there Lee yeah thats that athleticism Im talking about both teams with Mississippi State showing it right there on the Block opportunity HT Melendez threepointer its down huge triple well nice kick out pass to Melendez that time Mississippi State doing a good job right now finding the open shooter four3 of the season for RJ Melendez and its the largest lead tonight for Mississippi State they Trail by as many as 13 in the first half can SMU recover Harris shows and goes he attacks and one for Chuck Harris nice job using that left hand by Harris hes such a threat at the threepoint line John they have to come out guarding tightly when they do he can just give them the little ball fake watch right here they come tight he just blows by them nice concentration good finish for Harris on the drive to the bucket Harris appro a typical thre level score coming off his career year for SMU last season with a 43 41 82 slash and averaging 13 points a game well the thing about Harris hes a 46 threepoint shooter so they have to come out and guard him closely cant convert on the n one as Hubbert drives right takes contact cobbert there for the rejection and the Kansas State transfer coming over there under control getting the block and culbert sends Hub right into the lap of his cousin Dwayne Wade who helps him Music up e Music Mississippi State put up a fight in the first half in the second half and almost taken over well theyve done a great job in transition beating the SMU defense back off of turnovers and Josh Hub always in the middle of a good play this time on the assist kicking the ball back out to RJ melindes knocking down the three three putting Mississippi State up by three Mississippi states really struggling from the field in the first half at 32 but second half shooting eight of 12 from the field three of four from Beyond The Arc Mississippi State now finding their offensive rhythm in the second half theyre being a lot more patient John as uh we all know this teams got a lot of talent they just got to work for the best shot available and theyre doing that this second half from sharing the ball seven assists on eight made baskets in the second half great move love the way that cougal lost his man for two well that was a tough situation for o quindo to get caught on right there just oneonone against cougal down there 6 ft from the bucket should have had somebody coming and helping him Melendez getting physical with cross and whistled for the fifth team foul and for Melendez his third of the night SMU is much more effective when they get their spacing proper and they move the basketball with the pass sometimes they get too much dribbling going and it slows down their offensive Effectiveness SMU is a team early this season that has wanted to go fast shooting the third fastest of any team in the nation taking just about 14 seconds per possession but in this game theyve been slowed down only four fast break points Miller tries to turn the corner and of course you would expect a more physical game tonight than the other home games SMU has had well not a smart foul by Clary that time fouling the much quicker boopy Miller out there so far from the basket have to have better defensive discipline see if it becomes a free throw shooting contest down the thats a 16 foul on Mississippi State believe me fouls will play a big part in this game matches the largest lead from Mississippi State SMU trying to hang in there Miller in the corner over the top yo called for the foul yeah he pushed off there was no no doubt about that sure well have an opportunity to see the replay but just use those hands to get the push in the back third on Yugo yeah look there on the uh top of your screen he he pushed off to get the position to get the push back Kean Murphy Music out of the play fivepoint Advantage for Mississippi State looking for more SMU going Zone yes first time tonight weve seen the Mustangs go to the zone defense but Mississippi State adjusts very quickly nice shot good ball movement The Zone turned the tide against Prairie View here it leads to an open three and Mississippi states largest lead of the night at eight SMU trying to find their rhythm again cross the head fake inside and on that second head fake hes fouled and hits the line for two kesan Murphy his third foul nice pass by Chuck Harris to get the ball across the court there to Matt cross who was coming down the Bas line cross at is fourth division one School Miami then Louisville then UMass for a couple and now playing this extra year at SMU a career 79 foul shoot Edwards coming back in at a guard spot for SMU they also get a little bit bigger as Yan trayor is in this is the starting line up for SMU that help started so well tonight now quindo had that big big first half but uh has not uh followed up with that Mississippi State doing a much better job covering him after he scored 11 in the first 20 Applause minutes SMU minus 7 in the turnover big part of the reason the Mississippi state has the lead but there is going to be a kick on Mississippi State here so the turnover and then Matthews trying to kick the ball and prevent the breakout SMU ball yeah Matthews trying to force his way between two SMU Defenders right there thought he saw a crack in the Mustang defense good identification by this officiating crew by the way wasnt much of a kick but enough SMU would have loved the chance to break out meanwhile so its almost like a a veteran move by Applause Matthews those things need to ignite their offense once again has become kind of stagnant in the last several minutes long way to go what kind of adjustments defensively do you think Mississippi state has made well theyre just doing a whole lot better job on the screens out front for one thing but how about that that could be a Difference Maker nice job by Edwards goofy Miller drawing two Defenders and then Edwards knocking down his second three great take inside stopping short but Clary cant get the roll and the SMU fans Rising with their team down by four bopy Miller going to work turning the corner inside yigu the power dribble and hes F Well boy Miller making things happen not only scoring the ball but getting the ball in the hands of the big man good Court Vision by Miller I think he went low to the ground with the dribble one more time lets see were good to see the nice outside shot that time by BJ Edwards off to the nice assist by bopy Miller eighth team foul on Mississippi State here in the second half Yus first Miss at the line in this game hes two for three yeah now 12 out of 18 on the year hes got a nice Applause release one of two trip for yatu Five Points three rebounds three assists hes effective shots in 21 minutes SMU didnt stay in that zone Long John back manto man now on this Mississippi State Possession It took 1 three here comes the SMU crowd sensing how important of a moment this is in the game cougal stepping back barely looking at the shot he attempts the three in trayor fouls him three shots coming up for cougal well obviously not a smart play by SMU defensively right there treor just making the mistake of jumping right into him there was no no denying that fact and the bigger news for treor that is his fourth foul so thats an SMU starter and the first player for either team to accomplish four fouls in the game well cougal now with nine points in the ball game hes got six rebounds playing a really really good game did not start the contest for Mississippi State but hes been in there most of the game transfer from Florida having a big impact tonight now Chris Jan saying hes still finding out more about his team at this point in the season as any coach would be only five games in hes not sure who his best five are and theyre going to be different each night depending on matchups thats the only player that started every game is obvious yeah Josh hover so koule only goes one of three on that trip to the Delight of the Mustang fans as Miller draws a foul the other way and has a one and one for SMU Bo both ball clubs so aggressive taking the ball to the rack and in this case continuing to draw fouls Luffy Miller makes it happen for SMU you both teams already deep into the bonus 9 minutes left in this game yeah we may get down to a free throw shooting contest boopy Miller kind of guy that you want to pick for your team be a first round pick in the free throw shooting contest good on the front end of a one and one next foul on Mississippi State SMU will get the automatic two free throw tries nine team fouls on Mississippi State seven on SMU 10 points and five assists for bopy Miller six of his 10 have come from the free throw line and remember Miller only played eight minutes of the first half so hes basically fresher than a lot of the guards from Mississippi State HT coming off the screen floating three off to the left but an offensive rebound yet again for the Bulldogs and a great job by woko to throw it off of yigu and earned The Possession for the Bulldogs Mississippi State goes so well to the Long offensive carams that time just a great job by Moko going to get a long long rebound they kind of remind me of the University of Houston the way they pack the offensive glass and there you go offensive rebound leads to another basket its not always the putb its the result of the possession so now 12 Second Chance points off the 14th offensive rebound for Mississippi State and a huge one the lead is five igu grinding pounding marching and fouled meanwhile the wo he doesnt know what he did but Andy Enfield was standing there on the sideline barking for a call and he gets one two free throws for yigo well yigo I think hes just going to have to get a little little bit more confidence to take a quicker shot he can shoot up and over any of the Defenders that Mississippi State puts on the floor if he does it quickly once he gets that pass into the paint its one thing on The Scouting Report for IG Talon which something we found out earlier in the matchup is I mean obviously its 72 he could attack the glass if he wants to but he doesnt always do that sometimes he finishes with finesse and he finishes off and with good passes back out to the perimeter for quick shots hes got a really really good knack for finding the open man as we saw several times in the first half here tonight you toou leaves with six points three rebounds three assists a couple blocks and brings SMU back to within four Mustangs are in the double bonus Mississippi State in the single Matthews wraps it around great look inside and the easy finish for Melendez well Mississippi state is hurting SMU with quick moves away from the basketball to the open area and their teammates are finding them move without the ball a lost skill especially when Matthews has it that is seven assists for Matthews Miller no look Edwards not open rotates it out Ambrose Hilson Big Shot big result for ke on Ambrose Hilton well you get the ball in the paint and good things can happen quickly good Court Vision then for SC you cuts the lead down to three Hubbert ball fake pass Colbert wrap around pass Melendez firing back with three but Off the Mark bopy Miller tracks it down the crowd Rising here in Dallas s mute down by three Miller limited from the floor but po one here for the tie no foul call Melendez comes down with a rebound yeah thats as good a shooter as he is that was probably ill advised that was a little too far out with pressure hes over for three from deep in this Applause game we do a timeout hubard quick catch and release No Good by Harris and free throws for SMU on the other side as noo pushes down Terrell cber it is just starting to heat up in Dallas some beautiful signs some physical basketball SMU at Mississippi State Applause Music Applause Music Wonder Music Music hubber held a four of 14 shooting and two of seven from Beyond The Arc but Josh Hub I mean everybody loves this kid youre talking about the the preseason watch list for the the Bob Koozie award and the John R wooden award and the loot Olen award I mean hes one of five on that early season watch list its incredible the respect for Josh hubard this early in his career well and I just like the way he plays so hard on every possession offensively or defensively here tonight tonight held to held to 12 points but he also has five assists in the ball game so hes he is a complete all round player just starting his sophomore year pardon me but one of the things hes done so well early this season is stay away from turnovers through the first four games 13 assists and no turnovers and hub is doing it again five assists and no turnovers tonight thats why hes on that Bob KZ L partner Matthews turns the corner kick ball by Colbert as Murphy was cutting in well SMU was fortunate there to get that kick cuz as you notice Murphy once again Mississippi State continuing to break from the backside without the basketball for open opportunities it was there just didnt get the pass there Matthews such a good distributor with seven assists in this matchup Rising firing off the heel hes two of eight from Deep SMU can Tire Take the Applause Lead everything going through poopy Miller gets it back in the corner now Colbert quick spin Jam for the tie how about that drop that right leg go quickly to the bucket and get the jam what a play by cber reading the defense perfectly Clary over Edwards one great play follows another heads up job by Clary penetrating into the teeth of Mustang defense we still got six minutes to go maybe more in Dallas you never know great matchup between the SEC and the ACC hover called for the foul Edwards will have two free throws with Mississippi State over the limit boy take a look right here just a great job getting the ball in cobbert dropped that leg and went quickly nice job on the aggressive move inside transfer from Kansas State showing his stuff hes fired up partner hes fired up great athlete 40in vertical to go along with everything else that he brings to the table with that 610 235 lb frame started his career well at LSU and then on to Kansas State this mustang team came into tonights game averaging 76 at the free throw line that is really good and Edwards knocks down both here another brand new game for you with 545 to go in Dallas it is early season action it is just November but its got those vibes Applause Matthews into the paint again bounce pass hovert scoop no SMU pulls it away and a chance to retake the lead for the Mustangs Miller going to work pulling up cant hit it long rebound Clary trying to run out three on two dumps it to Matthews flying in to take the lead boy what a great concentrated finish by Matthews that was tough to do SMU right there in his face great job of running the floor by Mississippi Applause State the Bulldogs able to keep SM mu Bay aqu quendo stepping back yet three threes in the first half yeah probably a little quick on that effort for SMU threepoint take number 21 of the night Mississippi state has tried 23 of them flare outside Murphy Parks it and hits it Kean Murphy fivepoint lead for Mississippi State boy what an effort by that 610 youngster he can do it all very very impressive outing in all faces of the game following up his career high tying 18 with 16 tonight and were not done Miller culbert tips it out now smus rushing some threepoint efforts that would be to their advantage to work the basketball and get Mississippi State to foul again miss SMU gets two automatic shots at the free throw line on ever Mississippi State foul they already have 10 SMU last two possessions have taken quick threes yeah SMU their path may be from 15 ft out unguarded theyre 12 of 17 from the foul line in the second half Mississippi state is only two of five meanwhile Mississippi state has turned around their shooting low is from the first half shooting 60 in the second half clearly bumped fouled and that one is on M Miller Miller picks up his third of the game and clear shoots a one and one on the other side big buckets by the Bulldogs SMU in a little hole Music Music big early season test for freshman samit Yu and SMU and more are on the way way for the Mustangs including at that holiday Invitational coming up next week home game against Alabama State taking on Virginia to open up ACC play and then a big matchup in the ACC SEC Challenge on ESPNU against the Tigers and that game against LSU will be out in Frisco Texas its called a neutral court next year they will play in New Orleans I believe or Clary made a nice quick move getting into the paint to draw that last foul hes played very very well transfer from Penn State came in very highly B hooded as a scoring machine I think you mentioned earlier John he averaged 17 a game in the Big 10 last year and hit 81 of his foul shots hey you love crossover season because the 2024 NCAA soccer championships are upon us the number 12 seed SMU got a first round by they will take on Washington the Huskies coming to Dallas on Sunday evening on ESPN plus you can catch it at 700 eastern time what are we waiting on Applause here looks as though we may have a complaint of a fan that uh needs to be addressed perhaps and theyre trying to get the the sign away from some fans behind the shooting line and so Clary makes one of two Mississippi Tate takes a sixpoint lead a big early season test for SMU can they come up with key possessions clutch buckets Chucky Harris has been relatively quiet tonight lets see if he can make it happen how about that move by The Freshman that time John he read the defense perfectly saw no help coming he just took it to the other side of the lane with a nice finish its 72 thats extraordinary ability for such a young player look at this reverse pivot going into the paint no help coming just keeps going for the layup nice job thats you being patient thats what Im talking about dont take those quick threes so fast you can toer six and now give him eight big and one 339 to go cant hit the free throw the rebound knocked away and out of that challenge Clary tracks it down fourpoint game Mississippi State trying for the second straight game to erase a first half double digit deficit and come back to win Chris Jans team already forming an identity this year hover off the heel again and this foul goes on SMU pointing right at number three in white Chuck Harris with the hold a one and one coming up for Mississippi State oh a tough break for SMU right there looked like they were in perfect position for the defensive rebound and see cross pushing out underneath I guess thats they gave it to Harris oh har is coming in on Music okay so that means Melendez at the line as Chuck Harris has whistled for his third foul 19 foul now on SMU after this one Mississippi State automatically gets two charity CES MOS is two for two and he earns his Applause bonus Mississippi State only 10 of 16 at the line is this game but the second chance opportunities plus six margin in the turnover colum and big second half shooting leading Mississippi State to a full two possession lead approaching the threeminute mark smus loss was to Butler on the rad Mississippi State trying to stay unbeaten yigu not allowed to turn Baseline hell try to do it again he does it again so Maga T goes Lefty this time to the same results well the big freshman continuing to read the defense so well watch him watch him he sees no help coming he just drops that right leg when he sees he can turn back to his left nice job by the big fella I just keep commenting he is so mature for a freshman only playing in his what is this his fourth game exactly right missed the first two for games of the year for the mus things while his eligibility was being finalized all 11 of the 6 foot2 Turkish mens points have come in the second half and they have been big ones for SMU he has scored a third of smus points nice job by Boy Miller and the entire SMU team working for a better shot now here in the latter stages of the game getting it into the big fella two times in a row as Bri was telling us earlier these are huge games when it comes to positioning in March do you make the tournament or not do you get a better seed in the tournament based on results like this great job by Miller to get in the passing Lane come up with the steal yeah did a great job on that back door cut Miller hanging it falls off Murphy pulls down the rebound some numbers skip pass they find Hub quick Riser over the top g gotu off balance but pulls it down again a three Caya well SMU has taken too quick a threepoint shot Mississippi state did it right there as great as hovered is they probably should have worked for a little better one also he get to doubled and hes ha yeah no doubt there Cameron Matthews got him on the wrist with a hard grab I think thats five on him yep fifth on Murphy Murphy is the one that got the foul call instead of Matthews they wish it was Matthews but the third on Murphy Matthews away from what you see on the floor coming in to say hey I I think that was on me but uh to no avail well Murphy has 16 points for Mississippi State Credit to SMU for continuing to get the ball into the big fella here late in the game as you mentioned Murphy fouls out after another outstanding game 18 last time out 16 tonight a big part of the reason Mississippi state has this threepoint lead with 206 to play but they dont have their most effective big man at this point and I would guess the rest of the way as long as theyre given an opportunity SMU is going to try to get it into yo well theyve done it three straight times and has paid Big Time dividends Applause Music second one Off the Mark big rebound for Cameron Matthews hell bring it up himself talented guard forward guarded by cross Matthews dips the shoulder cross with a block shot and theyre letting him play now with Mississippi State leading by two great disciplined defense by cross watching this keep his hand straight up straight up thats the way its coached nice job by the 67 transfer from UMass he wanted the ball too and they may take a look with under two minutes left you can do it and see if on this play it ended up going off of Matthew bounce calls under further review or it was off of Matt cross who blocked the shot Music now both ball clubs continuing to play very very tough right there I just cant say enough about how disciplined that was by Matt cross not to reach keep those arms straight up he did it now well see if SMU gets the ball good go ahead John that was my fault no they only had two TR true Road wins last season as we get one more look look from this angle I I tell you on the first angle the one from the Baseline side I thought it was off on cross on that one it looks more like this one looks like its off on Cross oh thats see what Im saying but on the other side left hand maybe but uh on the other side it kind of looked like it was out on Matthews and remember the call on the floor is out on Cross yeah but as we were getting to I mean Road winds are so hard hard to come by against Power four programs and power five teams and Mississippi State only able to pick up two of those last year two true Road victories they both came in SEC play as they were building their case to go back to the NCAA tournament including a 20point win on the road against LSU this wont be a 20point victory but these are huge if Mississippi states able to pick it up well theres obviously a lot of basketball left to be played with a minute 53 the decision by the strike chks very important right now for both ball clubs SMU had the lead for most of the night midc half spur by Mississippi State helped them take the lead by as many as eight SMU led by as many as 13 in the first half heve been tied six times the lead has changed hands three times after further review the call on the floor stands the clock will be reset to 154 and 18 on the shot clock that it stands and that its not you know confirmed or reversed tells you its pretty tough to tell so SMU needs a defensive stop with a buck 54 to play 17 to shoot from Mississippi State after that cross block Mississippi state is so skilled at moving without the basketball SMU needs to be very very careful right here Matthews a guy that can distribute with the best of them number four at the bottom of your screen but instead its going to be Clary going to work Clary pulling up Clary no shot hes fouled on the floor by Miller so no and one no continuation here yeah that was the temp foul on SMU though he goes to the charity strike for two two shots both teams now in the bonus situation and the fourth on boy Miller and good call Y clar an outstanding free throw shooter as he lost his balance due to the Miller contact around 80 over the course of his career and 81 last season Clary puts Mississippi State up by three the second to make it a two possession game hes got it done its been a fun one in Dallas for sure and Melendez and Miller come together no call well good sportsmanship there on the part of both players in this hardfought game and the stoppage was just to make sure that the floor wasnt going to be wet on the next time down poopy Miller has been held below his numbers 10 points six assists can he play a big factor for m u sets up Edwards lines up the three offensive rebound by cross and hes fouled Two Shots what a great job by cross working his way inside the maroon jks to get that offensive rebound great thinking good Anticipation by the 67 senior remember how he talked about yeah he just broke right in there went right past Matthews great play by cross remember how we talked about his cross short arms the first one now SMU was so good early this season on the offensive glass not so tonight thats only their sixth offensive rebound well give Mississippi State a lot of credit on that thats part of The Scouting Report Miller has four fouls and so Harris comes in for him anticipating the defensive possession cross goes one of two hes back in double figures with 10 well still just a one possession game with a minute and a half lots of things are going to happen here in this last 90 seconds of action Melendez the advantage on Cross but you get t comes over to slam it off the backboard with a emphatic block as him you can tie on a three timeout Mustangs after the defensive play by the 7 foot2 igu well igu has been huge here in the last few minutes of this ball game scoring six points now coming back and make the difference on the defensive end great job of growing straight up on the Block coming from the offs side terrific job team defense for SMU thats the third block by yigu to go along with his 12 points and five rebounds last couple times up the floor offensively SMU has not gone through yiga toi do you think that changes on this possession well I think it should I would keep going into him he scored three straight times or got fouled he had no points at the half but now that they have started going into him he now has 12 points in the second half hes contributed as you saw in that last possession by Mississippi State hes been significant on the defensive end altering shots even if he does not get the block SMU calling the timeout to get their offensive leader booy Miller back in the game whos playing with four fouls smaller lineup on the floor for SMU as well three can tie it Miller is looking for yigao backing in onu doubl down wraps it around Edwards with nine to shoot curls in Edwards stop it lays it off to cross flying in lots of contact and he heads to the line for two on the fourth foul on Cameron Matthews very impressed with that possession by SMU they just kept working and working until they drew that all important foul and my apologies theyre going to give the foul to naoko and thats his fifth so another big man for Mississippi state is down due to fouls well and thats what I was talking about earlier John dont take those quick threes keep working it inside get to the free throw line it can make a huge difference get some good players on your opponent out of the game Mustangs doing it well right now very impressed with their patience to get to the chair strike on the last several possessions so coming in is Riley cougal itll be very interesting to see defensively the next possession for Mississippi State what kind of adjustments they make without their top two pigs crosses back at the line and this time hits the front end of two looks like Garners coming in for SMU get his size on the floor 69 another youngster from Turkey transfer from Arizona yeah they said they thought they brought him in for his offense but hes been really good defensively two for two trip onepoint game Ambrose Hilton in as well and Energizer bunny as the Mustangs get longer defensively with 53 seconds left Chris jams has three timeouts to use and one spent here with 50 ticks to go in Dallas and a onepoint game you cant ask for any more in college basketball game ear this is exactly what we anticipated onepoint ball game 50 seconds to go Im loving it partner Music Music Music Andy Enfield in this almost entirely new roster for SMU as Enfield comes in from USC retains three guys who played significant minutes last year and dips into the transfer portal elsewhere where well theyre taking on a team that has been a stalard in the NCAA tournament over the last two years out of the SEC a battle tested program in Mississippi State and the Mustangs taking them to the very limit 7675 with 499 remaining with Jim howler and Banna senson Im John little now SMU tried to bring culbert in but evidently he did not properly check in and so you ATU stays on the floor here at Moody Coliseum in Dallas where theyre looking to recapture the Magic Mustangs obviously manto man Matthews who else coming in to make the huge Play What a drive what a call coming out of the timeout by Mississippi State Matthews showing his great versatility on that penetration the eighth dime for Matthews as cougal on the Baseline Jam makes at a threepoint game now Mississippi State continuing to do good things with their movement away from the basketball Matthews on the penetration cougal finding the open Lane and he gets the Finish but the whole ball game igulu has been the biggest man on the floor by far it wasnt until late in the contest that SMU started making a concerted effort to keep getting it inside to him i guess Cameron m Matthews is going to pick this up this defensive assignment on yigu Matthews who goes at 6 7 be giving up s in to the big man from Turkey 40 seconds left SMU down by three Miller comes to grab it Miller crossing over Miller up fake in the paint tries to lay it off and the quick hands defensively of Mississippi State taking it away good double team in the back court but Mississippi state gets it across midcourt SMU can play defense if they want to but they decide to foul cougal here with 21 seconds left was that the right call or do you want to try to force a shot and get the ball back well thats easier said than done here was the mistake right here boy Miller got his Defender up and off the floor but uh good team defense good actions by Mississippi State Matthews Another steal he has moved into sole possession of third place all time in Mississippi State history with the steel numbers in this game and by the end of his career he will have more steals than any other bulldog in history so cougal with two shots either one could make it a two possession game and he leaves little doubts well cougal has come into the ball game not a starter tonight but very very effective 12 points now and six rebounds 5225 Mississippi states bench now outscoring SMU as the Mustangs called their final timeout 32 timeout with the Mustangs down by five to Mississippi State what a great close to this game by the Bulldogs well both teams have played well here later stages of the game but now SMU has to strategize not only on this possession but obviously what are they going to do defensively if and when they score what are they going to do once they get back so many things that have to be decided in advance when youre in this situation behind obviously SMU scores theyve got to get into the full court trapping defense do they foul right away thats the coachs decision if and when they score Mississippi State Adept at forcing turnovers hasnt forced a ton but enough 13 giveaways by SMU including that big takeaway that leads to the fivepoint lead with 21 seconds to play well a big stat in this ball game is the points in the pl 20 34 to 28 Mississippi states Advantage its an SMU team that its not marginally bigger but much bigger goopy Miller flying to the glass they dont want to foul him threepoint game with 118 left and now SMU sets up the press one time out left for Mississippi State into Hub double teamed in the back court and hub will have a chance to Salt it away 106 left on that Chuck Harris foul a nice job by Boy Miller getting SMU in position to challenge here late late late in this ball game he took it strong and got the Finish obviously they had the double team quickly they didnt get it bow but unfortunately a great free throw shooter like hub goes to the charity strike for Mississippi State Chuck Harris fouls out the fivepoint effort in 18 minutes SMU has five players in double figures as does Mississippi State Chris Jans hasnt lost a game at the division one level when hes at five players in double figures wow thats a pretty big statement right there thats amazing these are two deep skilled teams you both these ball clubs talk about one of their great advantages for the year is their depth and both teams showed it here tonight SMU had nine different players score Mississippi state had eight different players scor clutch free throws obvious L for Hub great great player SMU led by 13 in the first half for the second straight game is not what you want to do to a quendo have a chance at three at the line it does appear that Mississippi state will erase a double digigit deficit the thing were settled with in the first half and Come Away with a clutch Victory away from home last year it took until February for Mississippi State to pick up that first true Road win looks like theyre about to pick it up in November well that was a strange foul there why you would want to stop the clock and even let a possible Miracle Applause happen quendo had the great first half for SMU did not have the opportunity to score a lot in the second 20 minutes of action Applause Music muu bringing in some quicker longer players defensively try to force that necessary turnover or come up with an offensive rebound is a quo going to miss it on purpose and a foul is called quendo missing it off to the right SMU trying to pick up the rebound and get a quick three it doesnt happen here and the Bulldogs will come to Dallas and pick up a huge come from behind Victory well some very very impressive Moments by both teams here tonight but a very very tough physical Mississippi State team is going to Prevail 16 offensive rebounds plus six in the turnover category second half shooting of 53 including six from Beyond The Arc for Chris Jans team and maybe the mo of this squad this season is here a second half ball Club well this is another youngster Off the Bench that has come in and done a great job from Mississippi State scoring in double figures thats it from Dallas the final score Mississippi State moves to five and0 on the season Chans team stays unbeaten a key
