so competitive its the best time of year for college basketball fans and this league is very competitive in this afternoon we have two of the hottest teams in the ACC BC has won three in a row and Georgia Tech has won four of five should be a great contest Music as the Eagles and yellow jackets tip it is controlled by Jayvon Franklin and we are underway Kyle Sturdivant with a basketball hes been one of the top point guards in the ACC the last month he was named captain by Josh pastor recently is a three attempt by Lance Terry and thats a good start for the yellow jackets if he hits the three it could be a long day for the opponent and the hot shooting continues for Georgia Tech coming off a game against Syracuse where they hit 183s this is a team over the last eight games that is making over 40 percent of their threepoint test Earl Grant wants to take away the threepoint line from Georgia Tech by bicker staff to post who gets doubled and sealed off nicely as Bickerstaff is in the starting lineup as a senior heres a three and that one is good two consecutive threes that one by Debo Coleman you mentioned the game against Syracuse they won by 20 they hit the school record 18 threes they called it a popashot game well it looked like a popashot game in it they they picked up where they left off in Syracuse with two early threes Dicker staff Off the Mark the rebound tracked by Terry here comes the jackets Miles Kelly what a game he had against the orange with seven threes combining with Terry for 14 of their 18 threepointers and theres the Deep three and its good goodness my goodness theyre a house on fire Kelly with the three and the nine to nothing early run well great ball Movement by Georgia Tech but Earl Grant cannot be happy with how much space the Georgia Tech Shooters have had early in this game hes talked to his team about taking away the three CJ Pena making his ninth start another senior starting in the lineup by Earl Grant as its out of bounds but the threepointers are just magnificent for the jackets great ball movement for early Rhythm threes for Georgia Tech Boston College will have to tighten up and locate Shooters earlier and run them off the threepoint line now what are you looking for defensively for the Eagles as Sturtevant misses their first shot well Boston College is a team that can really pressure the basketball and their physicality on the perimeter and their effort needs to take Georgia Tech out of their Rhythm of the Princeton offense TJ Bickerstaff with a put back Bickerstaff has traditionally been one of the top rebounders in the ACC this year averaging five and a half boards per game second on the club good ball Movement by the jackets Terry gets in the paint for Franklin too strong off the glass but was that a good idea by Terry very good drive by Terry and fine Franklin just couldnt convert this Georgia Tech team is playing with a ton of confidence and that is not a welcome cell site for Pearl Grant no certainly not as he was injured the first part of the Season well see what happens here it looks like he just stepped on a Defender awkwardly we talked about how important the post was to the success of this BC team lets see if he can walk that off Pena the three and the rebound by Kelly DC off to a slow start Eagles one for six from the field and one of the things with Boston College our offense runs best when theyre playing through the paint theyve settled early in this game for perimeter jump shots without the ball touching the paint and opposed to noticeable pain on the Eagles bench Jane Zacharys been a big part of their success Music in the last month a league Bay Off the Bench vickerstaff has he sees Four Points he only averages five per outing and thats where Boston College needs to go with the ball they want to play through the paint we talked to Earl Grant before the game they are a paint team on the offensive end need to continue to attack the paint Coleman got his Defender Pena in the air cant make him pay for it good offensive Rise by Franklin Terry rims it out Terry a transfer for GardnerWebb hes been such an igniter for them his numbers staggering in their ACC victories over 45 percent from three and an N1 situation for CJ Pena and that will bring us to our lacrosse at BC he is always remembered by all in the BC community so a good touch by the Eagles to wear the red bandana uniforms as you check out the number 19 patch from akais uniform as the threepoint play is completed thats a seven to nothing BC run Steve wozrowski since they were trailing nine and nothing gonna be interested out of the timeout if NBC increases their pressure you want to pressure me Im gonna go buy you such a unique matchup at the center hes undersized quick good with the ball very difficult matchup for opposing centers CJ Pena with a three and he Nails it as its a onepoint lead for the jackets so Pena has given them a lift in his ninth start of the Year transfer from NAIA school also played Juco ball harassing defense from TJ bicker staff shot clock under 10 here comes Kyle Sturdivant against Zachary Kelly from 40 excellent defensive exchange there for the Eagles ball pressure the ability to keep Georgia Tech out of the paint force a long contested three pass tipped out of bounds by Sturtevant PC ball Boston College guards do such a good job of keeping their chest in front against a live dribble and it results into a desperation shot at the end of shot clock that is exactly what Earl Grant wants to see opponent sitting 37 percent from threepoint distance against the Eagles eight per game you see without posters on the bench Applause Music Ken Corral the offensive glass hes been a revelation for them from coming to Georgia and the pass thrown out of bounds a rare error by the jackets who only average 11 turnovers per game terrific job getting to the offensive Glass by McLaughlin and that is where BC wants to attack one of the things with the undersized lineup that Josh pastner has employed in these games they can give up offensive boards Kai Ashton Lake for the Nifty layup attempt Master Lankford Zachary and post accounting for nearly 60 percent of the BC offensive output the last 13 games skip pass Jaylon Moore with the three he only goes six deep what does that mean for the jackets well its going to be important for their main guys to stay out of foul trouble in the game this shorter rotation along with inserting Franklin at the five has been a key to Georgia Techs success over recent games Applause Music yeah we just received word that quick post will not return he is out with an ankle injury that is a huge loss for the Eagles he does so much for Boston College on both ends of the floor but especially the offensive end an enormous loss no doubt about that comes Franklin what a great move he is bouncy hes loose hes really six five maybe six six they list him his six seven but he plays like hes six eleven so quick off the floor and so good with the ball is a very difficult matchup because you have a ball friendly big which you dont often see in college basketball against Moore nice job to the cup and he puts it in hes good off the dribble isnt he terrific off the dribble Makai Ashton Langford is at his best when hes playing making plays off the dribble and attacking the basket the points in the bay plus six in the early going for the Eagles Ashton Langford averaging 12 points per outage second to post 16 and more converts on the Baseline move Jaylon Moore he is their sixth man he averages eight points and five rebounds Georgia Tech shooting 42 percent as a team the average 69 points in the post for Zachary Applause 13 seconds to shoot Applause Javon Franklin terrific from the high post put the ball on the floor and a quick jumper and Makai Ashton Langford right back at him multiple dribble Shifty changes speeds and is able to get an angle to the basket foul called by Jeff Pawn on Kyle Sturdivant is first with Zachary at the line Earl Grant likes to invert Zachary and post him up strong body guard very good in the interior and for a guard who can post up Earl Grant likes to take advantage of that skill set usually a good foul shooter you see at the line 72 percent as a team and theres your dunk from Jayvon Franklin thats why hes one of the tougher matchups in the league so quick out of that ball screen once the guard turns the corner its a race to the basket and its a race that Jayvon Franklin more times than not wins airball by Prince alif Bay The Freshman from Minneapolis UC has made one of seven threes Eagles averaged six per game shooting 32 percent from distance Applause and out of bounds and out of bounds but Jayvon Franklin was electric one of the more unique digs in the AC Kyle Sturdivant throwing it up and Jane Von Franklin knows what to do with it Applause Boston College Steve Josh pastner not happy with this one and he has a right to be not happy you can see there clearly uh Chazz Kelly deflects the ball out of bounds Josh pastner normally pretty reserved on the sideline but anything but reserved on that and its Josh is reacting like that he was sure of what he saw because that is thats not a normal reaction for Josh passman and could have been a technical foul call about Josh pastner but there was not you see comes away with it Jazz Kelly on the floor a freshman from Houston finds Bickerstaff on the Baseline Eagles playing without quick post whos out for the game with a apparent ankle injury is Mason Matson misses the three heres a three off the line good pass of the post and a conversion by Jalen Morris so Georgia Tech has advertised you mentioned it they moved the ball well theyre really moving the ball down the floor and BC has been slow to match up in the half court great pass by Sturdivant and Jalen Moore has given Georgia Tech a huge Lift Off the Bench we have another full day of college basketball on ESPN on the app were highlighting these three the top teams of the Big 12 square off at four Eastern number nine Texas hosting number three Kansas then its Duke of North Carolina and at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific the top teams of the Pac12 get after it number four UCLA whos number eight Arizona Applause he meant to do that and TJ Im gonna throw it off the corner the backboard be ready used to call that a Duke practice right thats right hes Sly what a move Im more but an awkward shot and the Eagles come away with it so a little sloppy on both sides too filling out process in the first half how does BC adjust without post is Pastor Langford takes it to the rack well that that possession was a great possession for the Eagles without posting the game I think theyll go five out and really look to open up the floor and create driving lanes for their guards to get downhill exactly what they did there for Makai Ashton Langford Eagles shooting 44 percent like fruit has four his brother tomorrow anchored is not playing today with an illness Stir of that this little step back that was crafty by Kyle sturdivan whos been an enormous part of their success seven of his last nine in double figures shooting 41 from three to Langford and air ball and here comes Lance Terry Terry is a Marathon Man doesnt take a seat on the bench stolen by Matson Applause terrific Fast Break by Boston College turning their defense into offense and with post out of the game its going to be very important for the Eagles to create some offense from their defense Bickerstaff has given them a lift with eight points not a premium offensive game Terry good idea by Terry or no when he gets in there that was a tough shot a little midrange photo contested when you get into the paint a lot of times the kick out is your best option these the Eagles 343 pointers turn around Bickerstaff and the rebound by Franklin Manning the break transfer from South Alabama pulls it back out for Sturtevant Georgia Tech shooting 50 percent theyve made three threepointers and nine attempts in the post for Franklin three no good launched by more here comes Zachary he ran into the defender Sturtevant but clocked in at an offensive foul AJ Desai the official quality offensive foul on Devin McLaughlin his first Music great job by Jalen Moore has been a terrific addition Off the Bench for Josh pastner Quentin post is BCs best player and among the best big guys in the Atlantic Coast Conference 16 points a game six rebounds but those stats dont tell the full story he is a guy on the offensive end that is a catalyst for everything they do and today before the game we talked to Earl Grant he talked about continuity being one of the reasons for their strong play of late you hate to see it for Quentin post and for this Eagles team they will have to Rally without their star player it happened up to 1718 mark of the first half when Georgia Tech LED 92 so you just done a good job thus far in his absence but well see how that carries as you see Georgia Tech has already locked in as the 13th seed hell play Tuesday in Greensboro the Eagles and clinched the nine with a win and a Syracuse loss that will be a buy that means they play Wednesday they clinched the 10th seed with a loss or a Syracuse win the Orange take on awake Forest later closed for McLaughlin too strong foreign here comes the jackets and a steal by Ashton Lankford he does that often two per game Coast to Coast cant convert two makeable shots in the last two possessions by BC got the ball close to the basket just could not finish Applause Kyle stroderman her Captain for Miles Kelly boy dont see that often he had seven threes against Syracuse the other night dont forget UFC 285 tonight from TMobile arena in Las Vegas another stacked car with a long away to return of Jon Jones taking on the champ Cyril gone for the heavyweight belt plus valentinas sevchenko defense her like Flyway title against Alexa Grasso eight car begins at 10 Eastern on payperview prelims at 80s do not ESPN ESPN Deportes and ESPN Plus see with post out BCs really trying to spread the floor opportunistic post there by Pena who started out his senior afternoon strong yeah bigger staff have combined for 16 points Applause 10 field goals nine in the paint for the Eagles playing without their seventh footer defensively Boston College has done a much better job of late of taking Georgia Tech off the threepoint line more on the offensive putback and program was worried about that simply you needed better positioning on the offensive glass Applause its in for Langford Eagles around the perimeter for Kelly or out one in for BC Kelly five to shoot Baseline try to get by Terry payneard and punched away for Sturdivant ugly possession for the Eagles the drive and a foul Coleman aggressive and contact by BC Evo Coleman an attacking driver one of the better yellow jackets at getting to the foul line and then attacking the offense of glass jalon Moore with the put back he has given Georgia Tech a huge Lift Off the Bench yeah more its double digit points and 13 games are jacked up because of the Paul Mr two compressed consecutive foul shots its free bacon cheese fries from a local restaurant well that would get me fired up too go wrong with the broadcasters qualify for that thats okay Im with you on that one make that a double quiz and good news for the Eagles is that fans have showed up today students are on spring break but despite the bad weather fans are here how to sell out but still a nice crowd Ashton Lankford rolls around and hes missed three layups theres more arounds the board Terry Baseline oh my goodness posterizing opportunity missed it wrong drive by Lance Terry everything but the Finish Applause whered that power come from oh my goodness Zachary and the foul by Jayla Moore but Lance Terry strong Drive attacking the basket BC trying to take away the three opens up the driving lane and Lance Terry great move everything but the Finish find the portal for Jayvon Franklin and Lance Terry Zachary converts picker stop back in from McLaughlin Terry that number tells the story with 11 threes in his last two in the last eight games thats a starter two 29 points per game combined think about Terry in their five ACC wins Play the full 40 minutes of nearly all of them with the exception of Syracuse when he played 39 yeah Josh pastner for good reason does not like when Lance Terry is off the floor and he and Jayvon Franklin in the last eight games have taken their game to another level do you ever play a full 40 in five straight games I wish I I would have but uh I didnt have much say in it back in the day Im guessing your coach probably said thats not happening files Kelly whos number four point lead but for players its its a players dream oh yeah players dont want to come out strong drive by Jaden Zachary best attacking the basket I love it John Josh is fighting for his team and talking to Josh a couple days ago he loves this group and he loves how theyre playing and hes fighting for his kids you know theres theyre in his mind theres still a lot of basketball to be played his team is playing their best basketball in the season and they want to continue to build on the momentum theyve created here at the end of the regular season heading into ACC tournament play we have another full day of college basketball today on ESPN and the app Zachary completes the three were highlighting these three games the top teams of the Big 12 square off at four East to three Central number nine Texas hosting number three Kansas then the big one Duke in North Carolina and a 10 Eastern seventh Pacific the top teams in the Pac12 get after it number four uclaos number eight in Arizona the defense on the weak Side by Prince salip Bay Here Comes Makai Ashton Langford another wild layup attempt the rebound for Franklin three by Lance Terry hes got it look out Lance Terrys dangerous big fivepoint swing there Langford had a chance to get to the basket takes a wild shot in the paint and it leads to a transition three for Lance Terry whos one of the hottest Shooters in the ACC conference right now three by Prince salip Bay two wild shots for BC the last two times on the floor thing that Boston College can afford to have have Quentin post is such a key for them on the offensive end when you get it close to the basket you have to finish yeah they call Post the Transformer because he can do so many different things inside outside he shoots 40 from three hes out for the game with an ankle injury a runner by a league Bay so three straight misses for the Eagles games only been tied for 19 seconds Georgia Tech has led for 17 minutes of the half Georgia Techs playing with a great deal of confidence Boston College is trying to find their footing without their best player its got to start on the defensive end try to create some offense from your defense which Boston College is capable of doing but not if Lance Terry continues to make shots at their frequency he is doing eight games since he was out with an injury shooting 47 percent averaging 14 points theres contact on Ashton Lankford foul on Lance Terry thats his second Georgia Tech has gotten great opportunities from behind the arc pushing it in transition that time Lance Terry is the beneficiary of a good Depot Coleman pass they made their first three threepointers since that point theyre one or 11 from distance a leave made drive and an offensive foul Lee Cassell said Debo Coleman had positioned do you agree I would like to see it again yes that is a charge got there squared up feet were stationary good call by the officials and you can sense an air of frustration for the Eagles missing Clinton post does so much in terms of facilitating and and running offense as a center for Boston College theyre trying to find their footing without their best player thats a good observation if you see Steve has three turnovers two of them on offensive fouls Applause good motion by the jackets and a foul on Jayden Zachary big motion from Georgia Tech that had some of the dribble Drive flared to it with multiple handoffs trying to create a gap and a scene for Terry to attack but to your Point Georgia Tech loves to run the Princeton offense which is a spacing and Rhythm offense and they are in Rhythm to this point in the game Coleman blanketed by Ashton Lankford one to shoot and he hits it my goodness Tebow Coleman beating the shot clock tough shot one of BCs better defensive possessions of the half of course the tough contested two d Holmen calls Bank seven to nothing jackets run waning stages of the first half Zachary spinning in the paint that was Nifty strong move by a strong guard getting downhill he is very effective as an offensive player Terry with a three and that will do it for the first half Josh Pastor his animation continues throughout he has been extremely vociferous a sixpoint lead for Georgia Tech significant in a lot of ways and we saw their one for ten from three post is their best threepoint shooter hes a 44 percent threepoint shooter lets see out of halftime if Boston College can get in better Rhythm on the offensive end did you see wearing their red bandana Jersey zip Jayden Zachary three off the line and the put back Miss by Ashton Lankford whos missed four high percentage shots in the Boston College team when they watch this tape theyre gonna see how many missed opportunities they had close to the basket those are shots especially with your leading scorer out that they have to capitalize on thank you thats delay for two for eight from the field rims out for Miles Kelly who had a quiet first half for the jackets with Five Points hes had some good looks early in this game shots that he normally especially recently has been automatic on Boston College cannot continue to tempt faith and keep leave him open on the perimeter Prince Louise Bay started in the second half did not start but first but with the injury to post hes in there a jack of three from CJ Banyan not a good look no Earl Grant wants his team to attack the paint regardless of the defense that Georgia Tech is in they started the first half settling for for threes they need to get it in the paint and when they do they have to finish at a higher level for Zachary joined to the backcourt by Ashton Lankford trying to knife through good pass TJ Bickerstaff lays it in terrific drive by Jaden Zachary feeding TJ Bickerstaff whos been terrific on his senior afternoon here for Boston College theyre going to need other guys to step up on the offensive end Georgia Tech read by as many as nine in the first half Sturtevant back irons it Zachary has the board right behind the back dribble in out of bounds though as he hits the back of the basket in frustration and its been a frustrating afternoon to this point for Boston College on the offensive end but give Georgia Tech Credit some of the reason for the lack of flow and Rhythm on the offensive end is the fact that Georgia Tech is changing defenses effectively and keeping Boston College guessing in the half court how does that take a team off its offensive control when you change that often on defense well theres a moment where the offensive team at times can stop and try to figure out what the defensive team is doing instead of just reading and reacting and playing out of Concepts regardless of what defense Georgia Tech is in off kilter and Earl Grant told for the game hes as everyone that knows when they play Josh past the team theyll do that switching defense maybe within a possession even as Kelly is at the line after the foul on Zachary his second and talking to Earl before the game we asked him you know how what do you tell your team with all the changing defenses that Georgia Tech runs they said we want to keep it very simple and above all else play through the paint and when theyve done theyve gotten good opportunities they havent finished them at the level theyre capable of but they need to continue to attack the paint their offense runs best especially with post out when they do complication matters with him out of the lineup paying you the drive to put back by Bickerstaff oh hes industrious off the offensive glass he has 12 points one shy of his season best output against Detroit Mercy he had 13 against Antoine Daviss Detroit Mercy Squad Franklin from the elbow that was special that young man has a pretty shot has not been able to knock him down with the frequency were accustomed to seeing especially of late but one of the better young Shooters in the Atlantic Coast Conference also one of the most approved players in the conference if not the most improved Applause on his fourth wide open threepointer he was set he was in Rhythm good shot and a big basket for the Eagles and he has 11 points and Up and Under move by Jalen Moore but he misses the high percentage buddy lob and intercepted by Franklin who had it covered in the post Kelly the three no and the rebound by CJ Penn Pena Applause you didnt like the lob by it Makai Ashley well at this point with the offense struggling like it has theres no reason to take unnecessary risks and thats what that pass was but TJ Bickerstaff in his final game at Conte forum packing the basket has been Boston Colleges most impactful player to this point wants to finish with drilling by a point nine to four run to start the second half TJ picker stops Steve wozowski a big part of it TJ picker staff with 14 points and CJ Pena with 11 the two seniors who started for Senior Day celebrations have 25 of Boston Colleges points and TJ Bickerstaff has been a huge reason why Boston College is still in this basketball game transfer from Drexel that number is telling nine to 30 for the rest of the team 79 for Bickerstaff from the field completes the threepoint play Applause hes Steve wozziehowski Im shot me to perel producer Russ Ken director Mike Baker an outstanding crew Dave Flores great help at the table Mr stats hope youve enjoyed it thus far Kyle Sturdivant tries to penetrate her out Zachary he does its blocked onto each side by CJ Pena how do you like that tremendous help side defense by CJ Pena out of time out to passner has gone to try to create drives for his perimeter guys and CJ Pena says no thank you Applause Terry to the rim fectoon hes a strong strong guy he has played so well of late for Georgia Tech as Josh pastner mixes up his defense again you know its been very effective in keeping Boston College out of rhythm on the offensive end keeping them out of the paint its been very effective this afternoon for Georgia Tech a league Bay off the double and he converts third tie of the night Prince Philippes been quiet freshman out of Minnehaha Academy played with Jalen Suggs and Chad holmgroup at High School in Minneapolis I saw him as a freshman in high school at Minnehaha he is going to be quite the player for Earl Grant as he continues to grow and develop his game good move by Franklin thats a pro move in the post so quick off the floor hes at The Rim and his Defender more times than not is still on the floor thicker staff to Pena and he hits it so CJ Pena rbcs offense in the second half that has made his last five shots well Pena and bicker stats have been BCs offense one of the things Boston College will need going down the stretch is for Juan or more of their perimeter guys to step up particularly Makai Ashton Lankford for him to get going would really be important for this BC team about the defense by Bickerstaff ceiling off Terry nice to lay for the love a league base got it thought about the dunk but thats not better of it as the Eagles have a twopoint advantage and a timeout Georgia Tech largest lead of the game for BC TJ picker stop triggering it on the defensive end Steve doing it on both ends TJ Bickerstaff kayash to Langford part of the group but TJ pickerstaffs defense we showed to you before the break he erased Terry and then that triggers the fast break but TJ Bickerstaff is playing with the urgency that you would expect to see from a senior who is playing his last home game Bickerstaff and Pena got the start today and they are rewarding Earl Grant with inspired play and your Senior Day 1998 Duke and Carolina you had 11 assists what was it like for you as its pinned by a league Bay on Terry or good defense by the Eagles well the Senior Day Celebrations can be very emotional and they certainly were for me and we played North Carolina with the ACC regular season Championship on the line were able to come back from a 17point deficit in the second half so I have great empathy for these seniors and the defense continued the kai has to lay for disrupted a shot of Terry Applause Zachary hes got it for BC they have a fourpoint lead as theyve had the upper hand in the second half outscoring with Jack is 188 and it feels like Boston College has seized the momentum theyve been able to turn their defense into offense Georgia Tech is not nearly getting the quality of shot they had been getting earlier in the game credit Boston Colleges defense Jayvon Franklin a Kyle Sturdivant and the board for elipe DC is plus 11 in points since the post injury such as fluke well theyve settled into the game especially in this second half theres in a theres an adjustment when your best player goes out and and guards not only in the ACC but nationally he is a tough cover he can shoot it he handles it and he makes outstanding decisions two for Jayden Zachary TJ bicker staff leading the way for the eagles with 15 on the bench for a respite Zachary is one of three eagles in double figures with 11 Jason Matson on Kyle Sturdivant Terry ran into Zachary Zachary in an offensive goes off the board says AJ decides on Zachary his third the defensive pressure for Boston College has ramped up Jaden Zachary moving his feet very close to drawing the charge on Lance Terry right there but I like the the effort energy on the defensive end for Boston College has been far superior in this second half to the first half certainly Earl Grant talked about that at halftime why have they neutralized the jackets with three for 13 and a half for the field well the ball pressure for Boston College has gone to another level in this second half and run Georgia Tech off the threepoint line that time Lance Terry taking what the defense gives him not a threepoint shot but an attacking Drive Lance Terry playing at an incredibly high level superb athleticism from the GardnerWebb transfer deep three for Ashton Langford he gets his first triple of the game welcome sight for Boston College Ashton Langford has not had his best game today maybe that threepoint shot can get him going a very important piece for this Boston College team through Cassell calling the foul on Ashton Langford our NBA Saturday primetime game on ABC in the ESPN app is a terrific Eastern Conference matchup between Joel embiid in the third place Sixers and Giannis of the second place bucks who won 14 straight the coverage begins with an NBA Countdown and eight Eastern by Pacific Applause and another quick foul on BC thats the second on CJ Pena initiating crew we Cassell AJ Desai and Jeff Bond and some pensive moments for Earl Grant Applause Boston College has done a very good job on Miles Kelly the Sharpshooter from Georgia Tech only one for six for three thats short on the three for Tebow Coleman whos been hot and cold all year usually if Coleman Terry and Kelly shoe well the jackets are tough to beat its been the case in their five ACC wins and Mason drains the three a ninepoint BC lead largest of the game and thats what Mason Madsen gives Boston College he is a threepoint specialist for Earl Grant and Miles Kelly with the answer Applause rifles the 132 BC run Big Shot for Georgia Tech right there Miles Kelly has struggled from behind the arc just his second three of the night and knocks down a really good look Boston College could not give him that much space delay of game warning as well as the Eagles have not missed a shot in their last nine attempts and a steal by jaybon Franklin against Kelly in the open floor and look out Franklin gets up limping two guys landed on Jayvon as the defensive intensity is cranked up Steve Pastor changes defense to the matchup Zone Franklin with really good anticipation and then a four car pile up on the transition Drive lets hope hes okay we already have one star centered down lets hope Jayvon Franklin is all right first Kelly on The Freshman from Houston her first foul in the Freshman from Houston Chaz Kelly Music hopefully you dont see one of those four car pileups on your ride down to Bristol Connecticut later Amen to that Applause Miles Kelly for Coleman directing traffic Applause Music Applause Eagles on a plus 12 scoring advantage in the second half but well look out fouls Kelly two straight threes for him and we got a threepoint ball game defensive breakdown allows Kelly to see it go through the hoop two in a row for him that is dangerous because he can put up points in a hurry for the yellow jackets up to the Madison three Miss madsons brother plays for Utah twin brother and Georgia Tech played Utah on November 21st they lost 6864 theyve had their fellow matsons Kelly block Well Done by Devin McLaughlin fifth block of the game for the Eagles the average six and after Labor just lost the ball Kyle Sturdivant and the board for Terry good Hustle by Lance Terry eyes to three and he buys the three what a stretch for the jackets they are on fire nine to nothing run Ashton Lankford compounding a mistake he dribbles it turns it over and instead of sprinting back he wants to have a conversation with the official which leads to a wide open Lance Terry three veterans got to be smarter than that at this crucial moment Eagles careless with the ball in the last 90 seconds and Miles Kelly has been an igniter for Georgia Tech a long with Lance Terry is Josh pastors animation continues hes been active throughout the game but how about this shot by Lewis Terry Lance Terry has been a hot shooter you cannot leave him open yeah Boston College with three turnovers in their last four possessions Lankford turns it over and instead of sprinting back and getting on to the next play he wants to have a conversation with the official and that leads to a lance Terry three for a senior on his senior day he has got to be able to move on to the next play if you do not exactly what happened a Georgia Tech three will be the result the veterans got to show greater maturity for his group especially down Clinton post and surprise you in that game summary you just saw BC plus 14 points in the Fate playing without their seven footer from Amsterdam just beating the shot clock TJ Bickerstaff who had a few minutes on the bench you see his scoring drought and 225 on the last four minutes segment Georgia Tech reestablished momentum starting with Miles Kelly open threes and fortunate there for Boston College going under a three for a guy whos just hit two in a row as Kelly for Devin McLaughlin Ashton Lankford air ball and loose ball foul on TJ Bickerstaff as he pushed Terry to the floor and thats the second foul on Bickerstaff Virginia clinches the number two seed in Greensboro at the ACC tournament with a 15point win over Louisville good to see Virginia get back to their winning ways this month has been a struggle for them especially on the offensive end a much needed win for the Cavaliers heading into the ACC tournament Applause she upset them at County forum on February 22nd 6348 quick storming yeah and they were tremendous in that Virginia game their defense was aggressive and disruptive and Clinton post healthy for that game was a dominant player third foul on Bickerstaff with Terry at the line Applause final seven minutes where are you going on both sides PCs offense what do they have to do to break this 320 scoring drug well this BC team is at their best when theyre attacking the basket they need to be smart about taking advantage of the opportunities to get the ball in the paint if the defense converges thats when the threes will be there inside outside threes but it needs to start with a paint touch for Boston College to Harold Grand toast we want to play paintball Grant skips it for Zachary the three hes got it Jaden Zachary with 14 points his first three of the game the fifth for the Eagles in 17 attempts and they grabbed the lead again big shot by Jayden Zachary he is one heck of a competitor when the games on the line more times than not he steps up for this Eagles team Applause Sturdivant hes been quiet but not that time tough shot for Kyle Sturdivant step back three over top of a hand Applause yeah he uses seven of his last nine and double figures he has seven points four rebounds and three assists hes their Captain hes been a major part of their success throughout February now early March and a good backdoor pass to McLaughlin excellent ball movement excellent interior passing by Boston College and that is what erroll Grant is talking about when he says they want to be a paint team get the ball in the paint and and see what the defense gives you and take advantage of that good execution by capacity College stir to that back irons the three Here Comes Ashton Langford good decision to hold yeah Georgia Techs done a good job throughout the game getting back in transition and making Boston College play against their half court defense and Georgia Tech continues to mix up their defenses trying to keep Boston College off balance Im Kyle Sturdivant as Sprint sale got harassed but the threes for the Eagles Zachary the first one and then the match by Georgia Tech and Lance Terry Kyle Sturdivant with the step back three BC and Georgia Tech trading threes here late in the game Georgia Tech in the matchup zone and as much as BC wants to get it in the paint Georgia Tech wants to protect their Pate defensively good catch by Bickerstaff the Glock did fire the pass out of bounds probably should have shot the ball with less than a second to shoot it Applause look for something at The Rim Applause for McLaughlin trigger and thats a violation shot clock violation turnover on the Eagles theyre nice Georgia Tech only five turnovers 11 turnovers per game their lowest per game average since 199293 take very good care of the ball big reason why is Kyles start event Josh passner sings his Praises as a leader and a floor General Applause no turnovers in the second half for Georgia Tech Sturdivant patient Eagles keep it alive Here Comes Makai Ashley for the Providence transfer runs into a wall and an offensive foul Japan was all over it official and kayash the lake for his tough day gets longer its his second foul great play by Debo Coleman knows Langford wants to get to the rim great anticipation gets set and a terrific charge for debate Debo Coleman giving up his body for his team I really like his game hes a winning player he does the little things as we just saw that makes this Georgia Tech Team better Applause yeah theyve been quietly feisty the last eight theyre five and three just asked Syracuse what happened the other night a 20point loss by the yards what a block on the weak side six blocks for the Eagles Applause great pass but a block by Jayvon Franklin its a block party Steve Kelly good defensive anticipation on both sides really good job for both teams getting back in transition after the block shot Jayvon Franklin powers in oh you think might have been a foul but no call three by Kellys got it big time shot Miles Kelly hits it the best threepointer to shoot is a threepointer after an offensive rebound Georgia Tech Corrals the offensive rebound swings it around the horn for Miles Kelly great 13 points in the half for Kelly has 18 overall Zachary gets it back and Georgia Tech basketball he sees story drought again 255 but Miles Kelly what an answer they move it around the horn Miles Kelly gets his feet set and when he gets to know seven and a half minutes BC Five Points five turnovers well BC has an Achilles heel throughout the season it is is extended periods of time where they can go on scoring droughts and especially with post out of the game there there really isnt an easy answer on how to break that without him post out left with 1718 to play in the first half with an ankle injury Mattson brings them off their feet that County forum with a threepointer two big threes in the second half for Mason Madsen thats what he brings to the table Boston College is a team that can struggle from behind the arc Mason Madsen is their threepoint specialist seven for 19 on three is his last four games Sturdivant almost a steal by Applause beautiful shot he has terrific form he said it the pregame Miles Kelly is a form shooter huge answer for Miles Kelly from NBA range and he gets his feet set and has time and space hes as dangerous a perimeter shooter as there is in the ACC rims out for Mason Matson with 122 remaining timeouts you see in your stream bc3 Georgia Tech Two Applause offensively what are the jackets doing here in the last 70 seconds as they sway it to the corner broken play look for a ball screen here at the end of the clock sturda van hoists now oh my goodness Big Time shot the senior leader Kyle Sturdivant with a huge three for the yellow jackets two threepointers coming at Key spots Miles Kelly started it NBA range feet set you can put it in the books with Miles Kelly then a broken play Kyle Sturdivant has to take it into his own hands and raises up off the ball screen you can see why Josh pastner loves that veteran leader its hard to run a business on your own make it easier on yourself with Shopify you can have everything you need to

Bristol and cant ask for better action than we have for you on the ESPN family of networks Georgia Tech said throughout the game if they hit their threes this just didnt theyre a dangerous team they started four for 20 since that point seven for the last nine on the triples well one of the things that has been a theme in the Strong finish for Georgia Tech is their ability to knock shots down from behind the threepoint line and even when they were four for 20 they kept hunting good shots and they knew it was just a matter of time before they were able to knock them down Boston College here is going to have to try to get something quick Langford goes to the rack and he draws the foul you like the decision very good decision you want to try to get something quick if you can get fouled stop the clock extend the game smart play by Ashton Langford to possession game follow Miles Kelly is first two shots scoring droughts have reared their ugly headed four times for BC in their 15 and 15 season weve seen two in the second half one of four minutes another one of three minutes look for BC to extend their pressure itd be a hard trap on the first inbounds pass and try to anticipate Maybe create a steal in the full court they pick up pressure and Zachary fouls Kyle Sturdivant four fouls on Jayden Zachary Sturdivant to the line Sturdivant at the line with 10 points first time hell take a foul shot played 37 minutes they go six deep riding this rotation for the last eight games and every as they shorten the rotation they became a better team yeah and their their team has responded this is a great uh team in terms of chemistry that Josh pastner has put on the floor during this strong stretch run and Big Time Shots by Sturdivant their captain to give him a sixpoint lead dicey pass behind the back Ashton Lankford rebound Franklin Sturdivant and hes fouled third foul on Makai Ashton Langford theyre going to make a living at the line in the last 25 seconds frustrating day for Earl Grant BC led by nine at the 1008 Mark in the second half they were up 5546 Applause unfortunate love for the Eagles we talked about their lack of continuity throughout the better part of the season and early in the game their star player goes down just doesnt appear Boston College had enough to overcome that today and give Georgia Tech Credit they are playing extraordinarily well shot by Zachary in a foul after the rebound by jaybon Franklin foul on Devin McLaughlin so with an eightpoint lead hits these two he put it on the board for the yellow jackets Javon Franklin has been so impressive to me in preparation from this game as a center he is such a difficult matchup for opposing centers because of his speed his athleticism and he has got a worldclass motor and two points shy of his sixth DoubleDouble in his last seven games he is 14 rebounds and eight points and two big misses well at least the Boston College faithful will get some bacon cheese fries there you go two two misses at the line by an opponent picks up the bacon cheese fry for you but dont shoot it the big number on the board is going to be your final result Georgia Tech has won six of their last nine they have big time momentum going to Greensboro on Tuesday afternoon as they beat the Eagles by eight give Josh Pastor a ton of credit being able to reinvent this team in the month of February so they are heading into March playing with as much confidence as any team
