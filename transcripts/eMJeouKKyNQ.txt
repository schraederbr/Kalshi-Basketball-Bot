Music Matt Potter round out the officiating crew these two teams played three times last year pit won all three including the finale in the ACC Music Applause Music tournament first touch for jayen low low making his fifth straight start the tip in by feder Rico is not there and by Dango with the rebound starting lineups for georia Tech Dongo scored in double figures and 10 straight theyre still really waiting for Miles Kelly to break out and ibrahima Sako makes his second start of the Season that fifth player in the starting lineup for Damon Stout often a revolving D very NBA like yeah a lot of it based on matchups of who theyre playing what The Scouting Report calls for but if you like offensive basketball and Pace in the threepoint line this should be a great game to tune into both these teams rely heavily on the threepoint shot and transition so look for a lot of uptempo basketball here tonight no good by kaasi Reeves who was a blond shootaround and now a redhead here for tip time starting lineups for pit Carlton Carrington they call him bub he has been one of the top freshman in the ACC this season Hinson 7 for seven for three again stuk had 24 points in the win and feder Rico feder Rico played well against Georgia Tech in the three games last year and there is Nate George picking up right where he left off the last couple of games had an unbelievable performance at Clemson a double overtime Victory hit the shot to send it into overtime made a big one in double overtime and you can see just playing off the dribble playing with a lot of confidence knocking down that tough Music Applause three here is Carrington NBA Scouts love his upside and now Hinson pits leading score through traffic blocked and it goes to Georgia Tech George leading the break pit gets Applause back Kelly from the Applause logo and anytime you play a team thats shoots a lot of Threes this see another one here pretty good look there for Jaylen low little breakdown defensively from George detect long shots equals long rebounds pit made a big point today in shoot around use those long rebounds to try to start their fast break George lost it going up against low Reeves left it short he may go back to being a blonde yeah he came came in to shoot around with blonde hair show up at the game with red hair so uh based on his performance tonight well have to see what color it is tomorrow but in that corner he does not miss very often feder Rico feder Rico lost and pit off to a rough start 0 for five from the field and now a turnover there is Jeff cable their head coach its a team that they shot it well nonconference their shooting woes surfaced in League Play but theyve actually shot it better on the road than at home yeah you dont see that very often and you we asked him today said look is this just a matter of you guys simply not making shots or is there more to it he said look I spent a lot of time trying to figure that out were getting good looks we just havent been able to knock him down as long as we continue to take good shots he feels confident his guys can continue to shoot well Henson took good shots and he didnt miss on Saturday hes backing down Sako using that girth and you played in the old Big East pit always had a guy in the build of a Blake Henson well Blake Henson is such a matchup problem because hes a terrific threepoint shooter has not shot at well as of late well at Duke was seven to seven but before that was struggling a little bit but he can do just that Uss a size post up hes strong just a a tough matchup for anybody trying to defend him on the run out its Zack Austin the twohanded hammer and right there on point turning defense into offense got the rebound one dribble out up the floor Zach Austin a great save by fed Rico Zach Austin one of the best athletes in the ACC getting way Above the Rim on that finish Austin a transfer from higho where he averaged 14 a game the last two years also was one of the best shot blockers in the country George that doesnt go offensive rebound Reeves George attacks a pretty good offensive rebounding team and Ka Rees known as a shooter not necessarily known as somebodys going to crash the glast hard but that time just unchecked for and able to get the easy finish the lob to Austin playing Above the Rim yet again you got to like the pace if youre this one if youre a basketball fan this is up and down early and a great uh back pick on that set the L pitw worked on that set for about 5 minutes straight in shoot around today and knew they were going to be able to get one Dongo through traffic coughs it up they wanted to make traffic around Dongo that was an emphasis in practice yeah there were four guys around the ball that time and they did a good job of getting the deflection creating the steel now carington a four time ACC rookie of the Applause week Hinson likes this matchup no help and Hinson able to draw the foul well we knew this was going to be an offensive battle and both these teams doing it in a variety of ways Nate George picking up where he left off from last week knocking down the early three on the other end Zach Austin playing very very energetic personality and you see that energy and that enthusiasm came out after one of the best road wins theyve had in a long time just an unbelievable performance in Cameron indor not an easy place to go in and win obviously and uh you know hes had a great career at pit hes gotten better each year and you know it was really interesting watching him today at shoot around he just hes the energy guy for the whole team and not too often you see that from your best player but it just it was contagious and he really seems like he loves to play basketball and you just got to love to see that he was blowing kisses to the Cameron crowd a flock of birds in front of him well not a lot of players get the opportunity to go into carer indor and get a win so he he took advantage of every second hes a guy who was a twoyear starter at Old Miss Miss then transferred it to Iowa State didnt play in his two seasons there due to a medical condition so to stay in shape hes playing pickup at LA Fitness in Orange City Florida he said they talked a lot of trash there and he would talk trash to elevate the intensity of those games comes back to pit last year was a revelation for the Panthers and this year the third leading score score in the Music ACC Kyle stur of into the game and that is T far gorei the UMass transfer for three and Georgia Tech a team that will allow a lot of their guys to shoot with confidence from behind the ark and Damon stmy says you know what if youre open Let it Fly and as a player you got to love to hear your coach say that just giving the Ultimate Green Light the ultimate confidence as long as its a good shot go ahead and shoot it Henson backing down George and the lob to feder Rico feder Rico and that may have looked like an accident but it wasnt pit works extremely hard whittenberg on line one to throw that lob and Blake Hinson had a chance to for a little baby jump hook but he saw feder Rico cut into the basket and uh just threw it up there and said go get it Claude and thats Debo Colemans three no good here comes low stur it takes it away the veteran against the Applause Music greenhorn they got two ball handlers in now Georgia Tech does with sturdivan and the Freshman George Georgia te a team that will set a lot of ball screens and Pittsburgh worked hard today on their different coverages theyll look to switch a lot theyll look to trap at times theyll look to go under so far doing a pretty good job of communicating possession arrow to Georgia Tech on the jump ball what are the keys to defending those ball screens well communication is where it starts I mean if if you dont talk youre not going to have any idea what youre doing and hands high hands on a team that shoots a lot of Threes is the next one but its all about just urgency defense is all about urgency as long as you are the aggressor and the initiator more times than not youre going to be the one thats successful M George second in the ACC the re beakman in assists finds taon Claude now here comes Coleman shot clock at five kapari gets free lets it Fly offensive rebound Claude stur of it open and hits and to me Kyle stur is the guy when he plays well Georgia Tech plays well well comes off the bench but really gives him a spark seemed like their vocal leader today in shoot arounds very very capable threepoint shooter you see right there that stroke look pretty good thats a much needed bonus for Damon STM off that bench low wild shot the tip and it comes back to feder Rico Henson draws the contact and get the whistle and now Jamie lucky Blows the Whistle are theyre going to talk to see if a foul was called well I guess the issue is the clock yeah I believe the ball hit the rim I dont think it hit the rim I think Georgia Tech actually took possession of it and so thats why that clock should have reset all the way to 30 Jamie Lucks going to take a look here at the monitor yeah cuz that ball I dont believe is anywhere near hitting the rim Blake H trying to draw the foul and you see yeah see Georgia Tech never actually gained possession yeah should have stayed at 13 which Im sure it will but good job there by Georgia Tech Blake Hinson known for that little step back with the shot fake that time just stayed straight down went straight up good no call there now you brought up Kyle sturdivan in that win against Clemson 18 points coming off the bench he flirted with a triple double in a game against Boston College where Georgia Tech was right there and thats been the story for Georgia Tech this season so many times in these conference games theyre right there and just cant close Virginia over the weekend they had an 11point lead in the first half and then late in the game theyre trying to come back uh mcne keeps hitting one three after another and they could never quite get over the hump its a young team learning how to win learning how to close well we asked Damon ster today we said what whats the the thing the two freshman really need to and the team overall really need to improve on and he said learning how to win its that simple you know when you got a freshman point guard and B Dongo in the middle is a freshman a terrific freshman when youre relying so heavily on them theres going to be growing paints and it really is a matter of two or three plays here and there throughout some of these games losing by six losing by eight and they just got to learn how to win Music games pbgh basketball its going to be pit basketball and like we saw 13 to shoot there was no shot clock reset possession was never established the ball never hit Grim so pitell inbound 13 to shoot Georgia Tech with a onepoint lead both teams two and five in conference Music play Austin the high point transfer will send it in and GMO Diaz Graham into the game for pit 25 and blue Applause Carrington contested hits thats why the NBA people love his upside no question about it hes got great size for a point guard you see the stroke right there that was a good defense by Georgia Tech shot clock was just simply running low so bub Carrington had to shoot it and its amazing when the clocks running low like that even though you know its not really maybe a good shot you know you have to shoot it so you shoot it Loose of with confidence Georgia Tech almost exclusively taking threes 12 12 of their 14 shots from Beyond The Ark Austin catching release comes to Applause Music gari kapari on the drive and its tipped to ishmail leet leet had been in the starting lineup got hurt missed a game and since hes come back jayen low has stayed in as the starter hes played so well but leg it gives you something off the bench as a veteran with experience yeah just getting back healthy I think is the key for him you know he hasnt necessarily done anything wrong to not get back in the line just guys in front of him are playing Music better able to draw the foul on stur of it Panthers by two almost Midway through this first half PN Vish Ro David patet with you Georgia Tech collecting to just take threes 12 of its 15 field goal attempts from three yeah we knew coming into the game you see the glaring difference there and when youre a team that relies very heavily on the threepoint line I mean its its p or famous sometimes now conversely B Dongo is a terrific post player and so not one shot attempt in this basketball game so I have a feeling Damon STM may have addressed that in this last time out says guys we got to try to get the ball inside here maybe play inside to out a little bit more and some of those threes may open up Miles Kelly and B Dongo Georgia Techs top two scores without a point so Music Applause far Carrington drives on Kelly donga went for the steal and Carrington draws the Music foul you know the difficult thing about defending a team like pit and a team like Georgia Tech for that matter is because of the way they shoot the ball and because of the volume of shots that they take their spacing is very good so its hard to help you dont want to overh help and then allow a wide open three and that time buob Carrington just put his head down again low shot clock and was able to get in the lane and draw the foul going to the free throw line and Miles Kelly just picked up his second foul and it looks like hell stay on WE remind you two of the top teams in the SEC square off tomorrow night number eight Auburn whos won 11 in a row taking on Rival Alabama at Coleman Music Coliseum for No Bad Blood there take number two GE well now Kelly comes to the bench along with Debo Music Coleman Dongo puts it on the floor spin move and did everything but finish and we just talked about it getting him going little isolation set there at the top of the key and a pretty good move just unable to finish with the left hand but G Modz Graham 7t going to be tough to score in there over him Diaz Graham gets the friendly roll may have shuffled his feet yeah did a good job though keeping his balanc but Pits going to have to keep taking advantage of of throwing the ball inside you got Diaz Graham very skilled in there obviously blank Hinson able to post up as well feder Rico not as much of a postup guy but still able to finish around the rim get a foul here on Pittsburgh on that Baseline Drive but you know for this pit team who again relies on the three very heavily priority so far getting the ball in the lane and trying to trying to win this game by making a lot of twos you see pretty good defense there by Kae Rees but Diaz Graham just using his length to score over the top and recognizing the height advantage of the mismatch yeah did a good job early in this game of of taking advantage of the switches and getting those mismatches and throwing the ball inside out of bounds to pit George early on has been a little erratic at times yeah you know may that first three kind of got him going a little bit but give pit and their defense credit theyve done a very good job of sticking to The Scouting Report you know they were very detailed today going over their game plan and what they wanted to do and so far theyre doing a very good job of it on the defensive end that time Diaz Graham had the size Advantage just too many dribbles and Georgia Tech takes it away yeah you got to recognize right right there Georgia Tech had three guys sitting in the lane got to use a dribble to bait the defense draw them in then kick it out get a better shot on the opposite side Tango with his first basket you know and watching him the last couple games I was blown away at how skilled and how athletic he is for a freshman you know a lot of times for freshman especially post players theyre very raw theyre just not as polished but he is really skilled can score around the rim uses his strength can face you up and you see that time right there just put it on the floor able to Applause finish a turnover by pit and Jeff cable raved about this young man today said kind of laugh said where did where did Damon St find this young man you know just kind of came out of nowhere a little bit of a diamond in the rough and you see just really really skilled 69 good size good strength and plays stronger than you would expect for a freshman yeah big assist to assistant coach Carl Hobbs who had been with ruter recruited Dongo two ruter and then when Damon statamire brought Hobbs over to Georgia Tech Hobbs convinced Dongo to come with him here comes Stan offensive rebound Reeves falling down and gets the whistle thats the second time here in this first half where kaasi Reeves has just simply run in from the corner you know hes such a great threepoint shooter you kind of forget about him from a blockout standpoint and the shot goes up and Zach Austin just get caught ball watching a little bit there boy Reed is just being aggressive and getting the offensive rebound chance to knock down a couple free throws here now we showed you the graphic coming out of the last break the disparity between threepoint shots and overall field goal attempts for Georgia Tech well since then concerted effort to take the ball inside yeah you dont want to fall in love too much with the threepoint shot no matter how good of a threepoint shooting team you are you know and pittss done a very good job getting out extending their defense taking away a lot of those open looks so you got to have a nice balance of the two and Damon stod in that last time out certainly made that point said guys if were open by all means shoot it but lets get the ball inside get to the rim a little bit more and able to close this lead just a little Applause Music bit Henson wants it low almost lost it batted around carington kicks to the corner Hinson a long three to beat the shot Pockets good hes made his last eight threepoint shots and that ties cam Johnson School record for most consecutive threes made that was a good 10 ft behind the threepoint line as you see a great finish there by by Nate George on the other end but that looked effortless I mean that was Steph Curry type range right there that was a very impressive three from Blake hon low the smooth leftly shot back to back threes by pit they were 10 for 20 from distance against to Duke well thats the kind of three that Jeff cable wants there was a paint touch first they got the ball in the lane Inside Out basketball get the defense to collapse and hell be happy with that shot attempt all day Dongo cannot finish feder Rico the rebound and jump ball is the call possession arrow Applause pits Pittsburgh a team that relies very heavily on the three have a lot of guys have the womens basketball matchup of the night Thursday at 8 Eastern 5 Pacific on ESPN in the app its the only undefeated D1 team in the nation number one South Carolina taking on Angel Reese Kim M sequin Blazers and LSU Dongo with a block at The Rim pretty good set there coming out of timeout by Pittsburgh and Zach Austin had an open straight line drive to the rim but a terrific block hon meets stament George had trouble with it still time on the shot Music clock stur ofan zippers inside high off the window and gets the home roll the home roll off the top of the backboard but a good no call there on the out of bounds that ball stayed on this side of the of the backboard but a nice touch there that was a little bit of a horse shot thats a Applause letter feder Rico turns it over we talked about Blake hinsons ability to post up G Modas grammed their confident throwing the ball to inside you know just not sure theyre quite as confident throwing it into feder Rico feder Rico not that he cant score in there but wanted to get the ball reversed to the wing one more time to get a little bit better of an angle to make that post entry pass its hard from the top of key with that straight on postentry pass cuz naturally the offensive player posting up is going to have to step off the block and it kind of defeats the whole purpose of throwing the ball inside and Georgia Tech gives it right back Yellow Jack its only three of 12 from three 7even of 21 from the field and yet only a four point game with six minutes and change to go in this first half well you know whats interesting after that previous timeout we had talked 12 of their 15 shots have been from three they had five straight shots from inside the arc after that timeout so clearly a focal point to try to get the ball to the rim was a contested shot by George Hinson is there to Music Applause Music clean low the tip in by feder Rico not Music there sturen kangaroos inside blocked by Carrington gets it back hits the rim and corraled by Leed on the Baseline Damon STM wanted a foul call there certainly was a lot of contact especially on that second chance opportunity there but officials letting them play here early on this first Music half Henson on the drive through the contact and now well get a foul its against Hinson an offensive foul late call there by Jamie lucky yeah Defender certainly looked like he had good position only question was were his feet outside the restricted area and yeah good job there by Debo Coleman a stepping in got his feet set yeah hes there thats a good call by the officials a little late on the whistle but I think they got the call right and you know its gotten harder theres a big emphasis this off season with the the block charge call trying to eliminate a lot of the slide in at the last second and get the call so I think theyve done a good job of trying to clean that rule up its the hardest call in basketball to make by far but they got that one right right there and Debo Colemans probably the one guy if you need somebody to stand in the tracks with hson coming hes probably the one guy that can do it as stur Nails the three again Kyle sturen coming off that bench knocking down his second three and you know Georgia Tech as a team when the ball doesnt stick on offense theyre very very good their ball movement is very impressive they have a tendency at times ball would get to a guy they stop moving a little bit they stop passing they try to go a little isolation and just not as successful when they do Applause that leg it turns it over six turnovers for Applause Music pit good job there by Pittsburgh in transition defensively getting back after the turnover Coleman dips in off the window didnt get much Applause Music else Carrington drives on stur of it theres the double and Coleman picks up the foul and cheap foul there at the top of the key D STM pleading his case saying how about that same call down at the other end and you know pit had success early of taking advantage of a lot of the switches from Georgia Tech and getting the ball inside we saw blank Hinson a couple times early on with a mismatch in the post and now trying to take advantage of the switches up top and drive that ball and get in the lane but Georgia Techs done a good job the last few minutes of contesting around the rim and not allowing anything Music easy Carrington from 18 knocks it down he had been in a shooting slump coming into this game seven for his last 35 seems to be unlocked tonight well you mentioned it earlier the the NBA potential to play at the next level you just see such a good size and the elevation on that midrange jump shot I mean theres not much you can do from a defensive standpoint on shots like that low picks up the foul Georgia Tech to the free throw line when we come Music back off a few rough shooting nights on the season his numbers for a freshman are terrific and if youre one of the mock draft people and you look at the various draft boards he is anywhere from top five top 10 all the way to the second round there is a wide variance you would think another year at pit could really raise his draft stock and make him a Bonafide lottery pick maybe at worse but there is a smoothness to his game yeah thats the perfect Bo for it is smooth I mean knocking down a three earlier right before the break there little midrange jump shot and thats the one area I would assume the NBA level type people want to see him improve upon the most from a consistency standpoint you know hes got good form it looks very good coming off of his hand you just got to be a little bit more consistent with it but again hes only a freshman hes halfway through his freshman season of college basketball with another summer another offseason to work on that its only going to continue to improve significantly but leads the team in assists and right on Q a turnover right there I guess we were talking too highly about him but you know the the the ceiling is is very very high on that young man yeah his first game with pit triple double yeah its pretty impressive I dont care who you are but you know that was Pittsburghs eighth turnover of the game on the season only average 10 as a team so he got to do a better job taking care of the B basketball cuz when they have done so theyve been very efficient thats whats keeping George attack in the game good defense by feder Rico Dongo has been a nonfactor in this first half miles Kelly the yellow jackets leading score on the bench with two fouls does not have a point in this first half you know its been Georgia Tech bench that has kept him in the game Kyles third event with eight points Off the Bench just keeping it close and and theyll get a blocking foul on kapari and that move again by Carrington I know he missed its a pretty miss it is yeah and it was just a good move getting downhill to his strong hand his right hand and you know that right thats a good call and that was the point of emphasis we were talking about earlier you see gapar is just not set yet when Carrington left his feet the big change this year was when the defender gets his plant foot set to jump so the the whatever the last foot to touch the floor is left or right foot the defender has to already be set by the time the offensive player even goes into his jump and its going to be a lot harder to take charges you see right right there certainly getting that call Music Music right eight points for Carrington to lead all Panthers stent leads Georgia Tech with Music eight Music Kari and heres Carrington thats rebound to number Applause five Le it from Deep rebound Reeves yeah thats just a thats a tough shot not that hes not capable of making it see good transition here good ball movement from Georgia Tech and Reeves no good he came into the game shooting 50 from three in conference dames stms got to be pleased with that kind of look thats transition basketball four or five passes hit the open guy just unable to knock it down but you know Pittsburgh in the half court defensiv hes done a good job on the high ball screen they havent switched which has allowed feder Rico to stay on his Man by Dongo and that has allowed Pittsburgh to not allow Georgia Tech to get the ball into the lane easily Hansen goes right at George its batted around to Dongo I think Blake Hinson may have been a little surprised at how open he was right there almost too open kapari Corner three not there Georgia Tech four for 16 from threepoint range yeah both teams just ice cold here over these last couple minutes and getting pretty decent looks just unable to knock him down and you know in games like this when youre not shooting the ball well you got to rely on your defense the better defensive team is going to win you cant let your offense dictate your defense Carringtons got 11 and again thats just isolation basketball sometimes good offense beats good defense and Damon STM going to get a timeout here with about a minute to go before half well be back in 30 seconds Georgia Tech has missed its column for pit its been the eight turnovers thats whats kept Georgia Tech close yellow jackets have not shot it well from the field or from three Georgia Tech has done a decent job of creating Second Chance opportunities by hitting the offensive glass you know when youre not shooting the ball well you got to try to create extra opportunities kaasi Reeves a couple times crashed in for an offensive rebound and you know its just when youre a team that relies on Perimeter shooting you just got to put the emphasis on on taking good shots you know sometimes youre just going to miss theres nothing you can do about that but you just got to take good shots Dango puts it on the floor and lays it in for two you see the skill level again just isolation top of the key didnt really have anything in the dribble handoff action they were trying to run and said you know what sometimes you just got to do it yourself and a good Strong finish in the lane over feder Rico whos a very good Defender hint in the tough basket its going to be scary where Dongo is a year from now no question about it and talking to both these coaches today I mean give assistant coach for Georgia Tech bonsy Wells a lot of credit in helping develop him over the course of the season and you know again hes a guy like bub Carrington on the other end with with another off season to work on that skill the uh the potential is Limitless out of three second differential between game clock and shot clock sturen pulls up hes got 10 in the opening half final ticks Henson lets it Fly and it doesnt go and that takes us to halftime Henson with nine car pit done a good job of limiting their opportunities to shoot as well yeah and like we mentioned you know Miles Kelly picked up two fouls didnt play much the rest of that first half so look for him to be aggressive here to start this second half but this this is the guy right here by Dongo really got to get going little isolation here to get him the ball in the block see if they can get him going right here out of the gate he works against the 610 feder Rico and quickly draws the foul on the Junior from Finland and if youre feder Rico using your size and your length just wall up dont reach dont break your plane anytime you break your plane and your hands come down even just a little bit thats going to be an automatic foul just use your length to your advantage there Dongo as a freshman the one area he has been inconsistent is at the free throw line below 60 entering today came in averaging 13 points almost nine rebounds fourth in the ACC in rebounding look pretty good on those two right there but maybe thatll be kind of the the Catalyst that gets him going here a little bit but I love Damon STM coming out of halftime and saying we got got to get him going lets get him a touch on the Block right away Hinson using the shot fake and called for the offensive foul thats two on Hinson yeah great shot F by Blake Hinson but you got to know youre probably just not going to be able to get all the way to the rim the defense is just too loaded up and a great job there by kaasi Reeves of getting in getting his feet set was there in plenty of time so good call by the officials ball going down the other way and again another Pittsburgh turnover nine turnovers for p heres Kelly looking for his first basket going right back to that same set try to get Dongo Another Touch on the Block here Tango bodies up feder Rico gets deep and gets two yeah good finish there pretty good defense pretty good footwork by Dongo not to travel when he catches it off the block like that Id like to see him maybe face up a little bit more but did a good job there of being patient and getting to his spot so clearly we know where Georgia Tech going with the the ball inside right away Austin Baseline gets clobber here comes Reeves George has a trailer in Kelly Reeves catch and shoot the corner three where he is lethal time out Jeff cable a 70 run out of halftime for Georgia Tech and this is what Georgia Tech needed coming out of that locker room couldnt ask for a better start for Dam St Meers group but getting the ball inside lets play inside to out getting out on the break great pass to Reeves in the corner Georgia Tech taking a lead had his players in college but they almost did both were participants in the 1994 final four stouty and Arizona fell to eventual Champion Arkansas in the semifinal Arkansas then beat cable and Duke in the championship and that was the Nolan Richardson team with big nasty corus Williamson Scotty Thurman hit that big three toward the end of the championship game Cory Beck 40 minutes of hell yeah 40 minutes of hell was too much for both these teams to take on that year and one of the best defensive teams in the history of college basketball by far and if youre a point guard Im sure Jeff capable was more than really willing to take on that challenge but you just knew it was going to be a long night playing against the Razer backs that year Jeff cable flanked by his brother Jason you saw there on the left a moment ago and Damon statamire hes got a few uh old teammates in the building bony Wells is on staff and well get a shot of him here in a moment Rasheed Wallace is in attendance sitting court side those Trailblazer teams that almost got there in the late 90s early 2000s Here Comes Carrington man there is a lyricism to his game and a great set there coming out of the time out great ball movement Jeff cable have said a couple times earlier in this game the ball was just sticking too much and that time the ball didnt stop moving bub carington no hesitation putting it on the floor and a great finish at The Rim heres Miles Kelly inside to Dongo theyll go to work on feder Rico Carrington comes up with a steal gets it back from low Carringtons open follows his Miss low for three it doesnt go low came into this game shooting 41 from three in conference two pretty good looks there for pit in transition and not the offensive rebound and again Georgia Tech is making it a priority they are getting the ball inside to number 11 in white that time a turnover Pittsburgh is going to make it a couple adjustments here you saw the the trip prior to that one where once the ball goes inside and he puts it on the floor you dont want to go right away on the Trap give the post player a chance to pass out of it you want to wait till he dribbles go right away Jaylen low was able to get a deflection and created that steal but Georgia Tech got to continue to get the ball inside the Dongo feder Rico almost lost it looking for Applause help thats not the guy you want dribbling if youre bit nor is it the spot where you want to be without a dribble stuck there in the corner great defense by Georgia Tech and only 6 seconds left here on the shot clock on the underneath out of bounds plays low will inbound the reigning ACC rookie of the week Hinson from the corner and the rebound by Sako if Georgia Tech goes back inside to Dango we saw the double come on an earlier possession this Music half how much of that is just to plant that seed in his head because in the first half he didnt really see many double teams yeah but you got to keep getting it to him though I mean you want to almost draw that double team as a post player its a compliment to be doubled in the post because that means the other team doesnt want you to score but you got to you got to know when to pass but you also got to know when to be aggressive and make your move right here isolation use a dribble to bait the defender that time great move going away from the defense knew the double was going to come from the middle and just an unbelievable spin on the Baseline and a great finish that looked like his assistant coach bonsy Wells back in the day it did and hes been working on post moves with bonsi it seems every couple of games he adds a new wrinkle to the next scouting report as we get a foul away from the ball now there was a game earlier this year against Boston College where he was showcasing fadeaways and turnarounds and he knocked down a three early in the year he was a guy working off pick and rolls offensive rebounds putbacks and he just continues to get better exponentially well down here on the defensive end because of his athleticism hes able to switch a lot of ball screens and that has given pit here a little bit of trouble we see a tough shot there by Leed shot clock again running low and thats about the fourth time this game where pit has been able to knock down a shot at the end of the shot clock pretty good defense there by Georgia Tech just a a tough shot by legett first basket by leot who led Rhode Island did scoring last year Reeves the floater soft touch well because of his ability to shoot the ball so well especially from the corner his favorite spot you got to be there on the catch and what reev did a great job thereof was driving the close out get into his right hand his strong hand if youre Pi you got to keep him in the corner and not allow him to drive middle Hons got nine coming off that 24point game Leed thought about it and then force that one up heres Applause Music George George down the lane throws it toward the rim and Dongo with a dozen doing most of his damage with eight in the second half well it looked like Nate George was actually trying to throw a lot to Dongo rolling to the basket but couldnt quite tell if it was a shot or not but nonetheless the result was the same Dongo with the off rebound and Georgia Tech has come out on fire offensively here in this second half Carringtons had an answer for pit feder Rico will head to the free throw line Georgia Tech has its biggest lead of the game they were down four at the half of five five minutes and change into the second half with quality big man this is compared to the freshman year numbers of some other notable ACC big men and remember NORAD omir played his freshman season at Arkansas State yeah this pretty good company to be in obviously no telling what the future holds but if this young man continues to work has a great tutor and bonsy well sitting over there on the bench and uh and he has just been really really impressive not only tonight but watching a couple games leading up to this one I mean he just he gives him a different element he he gives them the interior presence where they can throw the ball inside and play inside to out which one is only going to help their perimeter shooting ability he was a bit raw as a prospect coming out of high school and know there were little things damid statamire telling us a story just watching film and how to watch film and the things you want to look for those are things that b Dango has a eagerness to learn how to do and do better its a guy whos working to make himself into a really good basketball player in this league well it starts with a desire if you have that and the workout then good things are going to happen and uh you know he certainly seems to be embracing this and has played a big impact for his team low had the block Sako couldnt get the follow and the battle for the board won by Claude hes Music trapped and it looks like he got a did he get a timeout I think its going to be a turnover looks like going be Pittsburghs ball its caught dead in the corner right there and tried to throw it off the Pittsburgh s leg but instead just threw it out of bounds six turnovers now for Georgia Tech George picks up low full court Jaylen low the grandson of the great John Lucas II former number one pick in the 76 draft carington with good Music position over kapari 15 for bub Carrington you know if he had a chance to shoot three different times on that possession he caught the ball in the block kicked it out caught it in the corner could have shot the three turned that down and instead took the toughest of the three options with a pullup jump shot and make made it look really easy George with an open look it battles out offensive rebound Claude and two shots coming for the transfer from Western Carolina this is the second or third time in this game where we have seen the Lost Art of the midrange jump shot from buob Carrington I mean that is just effortless and smooth and you know we talked about it earlier in the first half if he can become a a knockdown consistent shooter from behind the arc Limitless potential for that young man so you remember in baseball many years ago where they said batting average didnt matter and it was all walks and on base percentage then everybody started throwing 95 and all of a sudden hey putting the ball in play is a good move and now batting average starts to matter again you get the sense were coming there with the midrange jumper well I always laugh great analogy there with the baseball I love that but the I always laugh when people say the analytics right you know in air quotes show you got to shoot a layup or a three okay what if youre wide open from 15 I think Kevin Durant may have something to say about that Jimmy Butler Demar D Roz and just to name a few Rip Hamilton made a career out of him well if you score 30 points does it matter where it comes from its still 30 points at the end of the day I mean Im not a math major but 30 points is 30 points no matter how you get it well there is this way of thinking these days that if its not a threepointer if its not a shot in the paint or a free throw its not a good shot yeah and I I dont subscribe to that theory at all and there are a lot of coaches that have been very successful playing that way but its the new age of basketball you just got to shoot as many threes as you can hope to make them so on and so forth well Bob Carrington seems to be proving that wrong a little bit here tonight no Georgia teex win in this basketball game oh COI Rees the throw down where did that come from got to be the hair the answer at the other end by Diaz Graham I have a feeling were going to see that dunk on Sports Center just a couple of times later tonight my goodness and he may be a redhead for a few more Music Applause games pit can tie with a three Panthers led by fourth the Applause break shot clock at eight low driving on Claude the basket plus the foul he showed it against Duke on Saturday put into the starting lineup five games ago not afraid to take the big shot offal we never know what the sports center top 10 is going to hold but I would be shocked if this isnt in there coming up kaasi Reeves with the Highlight Reel reverse dun on the free throw Baseline we got a onepoint game here in Atlanta with guo Diaz Graham the sophomore from the Canary Islands where you played pro basketball has hit a couple of Threes afterwards providing Jeff cable with some solid minutes off the bench and hes taking the crowd out of it after they had a moment to rise up yeah much needed boost offensively and only had two M threes in conference play coming into this game but knocking down both those looked really confident doing it Dongo how about the way he could catch and finish in midair yeah that was a really impressive finish cuz he was not necessarily in position to catch that it was a tough pass and just a great finish there by Dongo Diaz Graham colliding and we get a foul and hes down number one G Modz Graham took a pretty hard fall there and trying to drive to that hoop lets hope hes okay Music appears to be okay here as we take a look and oh yeah landed awkwardly on that left leg but got up after just a few seconds going to stay in the game so lets hope hes okay Music Applause and no free throws the foul was on the drive heres Carrington hes got 15 to lead all scores over to low freshman to freshman airball Austin saves it didnt hit the rim I dont know if they saw it leot puts it up and the Rhode Island transfer coming off the bench and gets a big bucket and a really heads up play there obviously it helps when youre right in front of your own bench and everybodys yelling at you that the shot clock is low but very easy in that situation not realize how much time was left but a good job by Le mil Kelly almost turned it over he still has not scored Georgia Techs leading score averaging 15 a game at two fouls in the first half was on the bench and it really just hasnt been a factor tonight you know its amazing it never ceases to fail when you get in early foul trouble like that how you just cant get into Rhythm no matter what happens throughout the course of the game you just cannot get into a rhythm Reeves the corner three too much and a shot clock violation Diaz Graham tipping the ball hes come off the bench and provided some Elite minutes yeah some good energy there on the defensive end and a very good possession defensively for Pittsburgh just not allowing anything easy and certainly been a game of runs here after a little bit of a sloppy first half offensively for both teams been a game of runs here in this second half couple lead changes and Blake Henson has been on the bench for Pittsburgh throughout this run of there so curious to see how much long he sits over there on that Pittsburgh bench Pitts made five of its last six that one almost went in battle for the board and the foul is against Georgia Tech will get Reeves the crowd wanted an over the back F there but theyre going to get Georgia Tech with a grab on Diaz Graham trying to go up for that rebound and Pittsburgh starting to get a little momentum here after a little sloppy starts of this second Music half 15 points for Carrington Lowes got six to go along with three assists entry pass Diaz Graham hes got 10 and Diaz Graham worked extremely hard that entire possession of wanting the ball never stopped the smaller Defender was trying to get in front of him in front of and he just kept moving his feet showing his hands and a great pass there by bub Carrington away from the defense and kodz Graham has been the offensive right spot here for the Panthers in this second Applause Music half George to Sako and the foul committed by guo Diaz Graham about arms and legs flailing when he hit hits the deck yeah the skill level he possesses is just really impressive and its very very typical of of foreign players European players just they work on that skill level at such an early age and obviously got to get stronger and get in the weight room which thatll come over time but you see knocking down two threes easy dunk there couple impressive blocks in this game so again another one of these younger Pittsburgh Panther players that has a lot of potential summer 202 to he played for Spains u20 team could have played for the u21 team this past summer decided to stay at Pit and the two things he worked on were strength and conditioning got in the weight room and it may not look like it but he added about 10 15 lbs and hes working really hard right now as we see Le it not able to knock down that three they Georgia Techs doing a lot of switching on the ball screens and theyre trying to take advantage of that mismatch in the post unable to get into there on that last possession and a foul on the floor its going to be on low his Music second for the Blake Hinson with the three fouls remains on the pit bench sixth team foul on pit so one more in Tech in the bonus and with this mediate timeout coming up here pretty quickly Jeff cable probably just trying to get through that Mark before he puts Blake kinson back in the game Coleman from the corner got it and that is what Bongo brings to this team by being able to throw the ball inside cuz now a sudden you cant play him oneonone because he was able to score in here in the second half that time they brought the double great kick opposite an extra pass to a wide open pman in the corner knocking down the three a much needed basket from Georgia Tech leg it Baseline Drive reverse layup not there and well get a Music push willll step aside pit clings to a twopoint lead on the Music road games with the exception of the Clemson game last Tuesday when they rallied back late forced double overtime were able to win now theyve had leads in lot of these games they had a sixpoint lead in the second half today unable to close out yeah again it goes back to when you rely on freshman as much as they do especially at the point guard position theres just going to be a bigger learning curve from a growth standpoint on howting to close out games especially in conference play conference is a whole different animal the pressure is higher the stakes are higher obviously and uh unfortunately theres nothing you can do to expedite that process these guys just have to go through it and the Clemson game last week was huge theres no doubt about it they were down they were down nine with under 2 minutes to go came back tied it obviously went to double over time able to get out of there with a victory but you know its its just going to be a game by game situation where the difference between winning and losing can come down to one or two plays its the margin is that small and with pit you saw them withstand and take some Haymakers from duke they were able to get up off the canvas they end up winning against Cameron Indoor on Saturday and I thought a big play in this second half kaasi Reeves had the big dunk Georgia Tech went up by six and pit responded trying to grow from that win on Saturday on the road at Duke well the very next time down after the the Highlight Reel dunk for Pittsburgh G odz Graham knocked down a three in transition and you know youll trade a three for a two any day of the week and so you know you see it and now pit obviously a little bit more experienced at certain spots but for them to be able to make that kind of run especially with Blake Henson sitting on the bench thats a very welcome sign whos now back in the this ball game and see if he can get it going here for his team offensively low and the Calls going to be a foul against Georgia Texas Jamie lucky theyre going to get Music Dango and clearly just not anywhere in position there and you know if youre Dongo Id like to see just go up and you try to block that shot its the odds are against you with with the new emphasis on the rules of the block charge and trying to take one now weve seen a couple in this game but because of his athleticism and his length dont try to block that Id rather see you trying to get a foul at least trying to block the shot that situation seventh team foul against Georgia Tech we remind you tomorrow the Huddle crew will reveal this seasons ACC football schedule theyll break down each team including new members Cal Stanford and SMU its a 2hour special that starts at 5 on on acc Network and ESPN 2 low gets one out of two so all the fans of current ACC members can decide when they want to book their flights to Dallas or Berkeley or I still cant get used to that its going to take me a while to get used to those two schools being a part of the ACC Dongo catches inside cant lay it up this the bunny low to Diaz Graham nice hand Hands by George to poke it away yeah save the basket there great Hustle by Nate George but a great pass by low and rewarding his big man for running the Music Music Applause Music floor no team has led by more than six tonight Leed turbines inside and pit has the largest lead by either team yeah that was a tough finish there by ishma legot but thats about the second or third time here in this second half weve seen him put the ball on the floor be aggressive and able to finish thats thats what we talked about getting him back healthy is only going to help this pit as the year goes on stur at the lob to Dango and Jeff cable very frustrated right here in front of us G Modia Graham did not need to step up so early to help on that when you do that you leave the basket exposed and that was an easy read for Georgia Tech great finish there by dungle in the Applause Music L low who has been brimming with confidence of late and shows you why and thats frustration there by Damon STM and his coaching staff thats a scouting thing Jaylen Lows lefthanded when hes isolated at the top of the key you got to force him back to his wheel we can which in that situation would have been his right hand Miles Kelly wants it he is without a point he has not gone scoreless in a game since February of his freshman season which was a game coincidentally against Music Applause pit pit can Applause extend what is its largest lead of the night and they head the mismatch ins sou kle stur event guarding G mod Diaz Graham like it got the step and then hacked by Kelly who picks up his third foul and ishma lean just putting his head down and saying Im going to get to the rim just unable to stop him and just drawing foul and being aggressive and you know this Pittsburgh team seems to have found a rhythm here and again you see him just putting his head down oneonone and clearly contact going to the free throw line Jeff cable telling us and shoot around alot who had been starting hurt his shoulder missed the Louisville game Jaylen low was playing well and so low stayed in the starting lineup and Jeff cable wrestled with that decision leading up to the Duke game Cameron Indoor tough environment for a freshman low more than handled it was exceptional on Saturday 17 points couple of huge Threes And if this is your starting lineup with low in there and Le it coming off the bench Leed Diaz Graham these are players who can provide a spark outside of your starting five now yeah both these teams have gotten very good contributions from their bench tonight Pittsburgh here in the second half been the reason why theyve been able to retake this lead largest lead for pit stur of it from the elbow hes got a dozen and good job there splitting the ball screen so Blake Hinson jumped out a little too far there but great read by Kyle Thurman Georgia Tech going Zone I was curious to see if they were going to play this theyve gone to it a little bit more as of late try to get Pittsburgh out of their Rhythm try to stop some of that dribble penetration leg it gets inside blocked thats Claude Stant the other way driving on Diaz Graham and able to draw the Music foul should be a good finish pit up by seven Georgia Tech to the free throw line line on the other Music side minutes ago last week at Clemson came back tied it went into double overtime ended up winning so theyre not going to go away by any stretch imagination for pit you just you got to take care of the basketball theres been a couple timely turnovers in this game now theyve done a better job here in the second half but you got to take care of the basketball you got to be strong the officials are going to let you play in situations like this this has been a very physical game I dont see that changing here over the last couple minutes so you got to be physical you got got to be strong with the ball on both ends and uh the team that normally rebounds the ball especially on the defensive end better normally wins games like this Sturdivant at the free throw line where hes an 87 shooter on the season the only player left from Georgia Tech 2021 ACC Championship team now some pressure little full court 221 here try to slow down and Georgia Tech going to stay with this Zone we successful in at that first possession the only issue you run into is this slows the game down even more and when youre down carington from 18 hes got 17 on the night I mean that is like a layup to him the way hes been shooting that ball tonight he hasnt missed one of those yet I mean he just loves that 20 21 foot pull up jump shot and a nice high ball screen there against the Zone active Hands by Diaz Graham he tipped it into the back court Dongo retrieving shot clock down to 10 Dongo driving on the spard and hes got two shots coming and again that is the second time in this second half G Modia Graham just goes straight up as soon as you bring your arms down theyre going to call that a foul if you go straight up youre seven feet you got long arms just go straight up you see straight up straight up and all a sudden you do that its going to be a foul every time if he makes it over you he makes it you can always get a basket back but you cant get a foul back now the clock stops and Dongo go into the free throw line with a chance to put a couple more points on the board while the clocks not running below 60 on the season two for two Applause Music Applause tonight make or miss here still a twopossession game so Georgia Tech if they want to can afford to play a couple more possessions of that zone just got to be aware of where carington is obviously but you got to limit pit to one shot at it you cannot give up an offensive rebound if youre Georgia Tech staying with that two3 zone how does pit want to attack they love to get the side ball screens here get the overload and that time leg It Wide Open in the corner and a great extra pass by Carrington P Georgia Tech got a little confused didnt communicate just a little overload send the man through to the corner two on one a great extra pass and a huge three by Ishmael legan that was Jaylen low and its another big three late in the game by low Reeves from long distance from maretta time out Georgia Tech a much needed answer there for your Georgia Music Tech still a twopossession game here Georgia Tekken try to pick up bu Court coming out of this timeout try to disrupt Pittsburgh a little bit you had it right Jaylen I got way ahead of myself I got too excited but just a great extra pass wide open in the corner Jaylen low has not shot the ball well from behind the arc but a huge answer from Kae Reeves on the other end you see neither team with a foul to give here so you want to play aggressive defense but you dont want to send anybody to the fou line but I have a feeling Georgia Tech probably going to get out of that zone hit scored twice on the last two possessions just trying to pick up man but again it comes down to the backboard force a tough shot but you got to limit him to one shot then you got to go quick down on the other end cuz the clock is slowly but surely starting to slip away and something to remember neither of these teams particularly great free throw shooting teams pit especially coming into the game 65 from the free throw line in their seven conference games thats last in the ACC full core pressure now Carrington kept it alive and you got three quality ball handlers in leg It Low and Carrington right now for the Music Applause Music Panthers shot clock down to 10 Le it over George that time ishma Leed hits the three and Pittsburgh extends to a ninepoint lead yeah isma Leed only three made threes and George with the answer out George the Freshman coming up here in crunch time a few moments to go low now its George Georgia Tech just hoping they can get one stop somehow to try to cut into this lead two huge answers but you cant trade baskets here with under two minutes to go that was the end of the Virginia game for Georgia Tech they needed to come up with that stop and kept on giving up up big three to Isaac mcney Carrington has the mismatch here on Claud trying to knife through the defense and bailed out by the foul its on taian Claude yeah it was about 25 good seconds of Defense there and Carrington did a good job of not settling for the tough step away three a lot of times at the end of the clock you see a guy just bail out and shoot a three but that time decided to get in the lane Drew enough contact there in the officials eye going to the free throw line subti Ando take a look here it looks like he got tripped a little bit by Claude there on that drive and carington three of four from the free throw line tonight CL getting banged up a little bit on that play but Georgia Tech going with an offensive lineup here officials are going to take care of a little bit of a wet spot on the floor there so maybe a free timeout for both is a free timeout 126 to go pit up by six Panthers playing the second of three straight Road games they beat Duke on Saturday after this they go to Miami on Saturday kans reeling a little bit having lost four out of five then you got Wake Forest you got Notre Dame the wakes a team I know they got beat up pretty bad by UNC last night but Ive seen wake in person a few times thats a Bonafide NCAA tournament team and now that youve got deari Monsanto back in the lineup coming off the bench youve just added one of the best Shooters in the ACC NC State on the road is a tough out and listen I I think a lot of people are doubting Virginia and yet they somehow keep findings going to Charlottesville trying to get a win is never an easy thing to Music do Georgia Tech goes to blackburg on Saturday and then they got that Tobacco Road Gauntlet Carolina at home NC State and Raleigh Wake Forest at home as well that could make or break your season those next four games no such thing as a night off in conference play especially in the ACC itll be a one and one for bub Carrington an 80 free throw shooter came into this game in a massive shooting Slumber seven for his previous 35 but six of 10 tonight and he gets the first free throw and that makes it a three possession game with less than 90 seconds got them both and two big free throws to make this a threepossession game and if youre Georgia Tech you got to go quick now you dont have to get a three but you got to go quick and get into your full court defense right away theyre going to get Hinson thats his fourth foul and its going to be a one and one here for Georgia Tech yeah thats pretty much the last thing you wanted to do if youre Pittsburgh right there and Blake Hinson knows better as soon as the official Blues whistle he knew theres no need for that if they score they score but you dont want to stop the clock and put them to the free throw line now they have a chance to score and sub and set up their defense and Reeves an outstanding free throw shooter at 83 both teams now in the double bonus from here on out Geor and what that does is allows Georgia Tech to sub to go offense defense essentially take your offensive lineup out put in your better defensive lineup going to pick up full court here to try to create a quick turnover two possession game 120 and Ticking Dongo picking up leot near Applause midcourt Pittsburgh going to try to get telling his players to go deep yeah Pittsburgh going to try to get a high ball scre scen here to get the switch that they want the mismatch Georgia Tech trying to trap wet wiggles out of the corner tough shot knocked away here comes Georgia Tech kapari to the basket blocked by Diaz Graham and if the foul is on Diaz Graham hes done thats five his fifth foul he is fouled out two shots good def on the other end by Georgia Tech and good job by by kapari just being aggressive know you got to go quick little step through there and got contact and again Georgia Tech going to the line clock stopped get a chance to sub with five fouls here both teams get a little bit of a free timeout you know we mentioned it Georgia Tech last week down nine at Clemson did not go away and here again tonight down six with a chance to cut this to a fourpoint game with 49 seconds left so you know you dont want to be in this position but when they are in this position they do great job of fighting and Claw on their way back and how interesting for Georgia Tech their leading scorer Miles Kelly not on the floor he has bit of blutarski tonight no points came in averaging 15 a game held to eight against Virginia couple of early fouls in the first half never found a rhythm yeah when you when you pick up two fouls like that is just so hard to get in the flow of the game and big Miss there by Georgia Tech kapari on the season 10 for 17 from the free throw line entering tonight he gets one out of Music two 6964 49 seconds to Music go and they get it across and now the foul by George good job there by Pittsburgh with the Press offense got the ball in the corner but quickly got it revers to the other side of the floor leg it going to the free throw line we in conference play 6 and9 but tonight two and two leg get 85 on the season substi number three Debo Coleman checks in for Georgia Tech this is a big one this makes it a three possession Music game missed it hit with a smaller defensive line up here is going to look to switch everything around the perimeter George has hit some big shots of L thats a three air ball leged his fouled down low and pit with a chance to ice this game from the free throw line a great play there by jayen land of being there he knew Nate George was going to put that up got a hand up contested it got a piece of the ball great defensive possession there for pit at the line Music Music Music Applause eightpoint game less than 30 seconds to go Music Stant no Jeff capable yelling no foul and Georgia Tech not fouling here final ticks barely got that ball over half court there A lot of times its easy to relax well pit follows up Saturdays win at Cameron indor with another road win here at Georgia Tech 10
