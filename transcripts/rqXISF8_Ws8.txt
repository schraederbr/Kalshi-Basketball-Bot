takes up so much oxygen I mean what theyre doing really with that starting group this year but theyve moved a little bit away from the Mover blocker more to this threegame concept a lot more movement and Niche more screening more room to break off for drives Music Applause and interestingly enough they have a better offensive efficiency this season than defensive efficiency And to clarify theyve always been a very efficient offense as Franklin picks up the foul oh my God Music Applause we welcome those of you who are watching UCF and USF anishra Chris patola Wake Forest and number 10 Virginia at a Rowdy and raucous Lawrence Joel Coliseum the Demon Deacons 100 at home theyve beaten two ranked teams on this floor including a win Tuesday against Clemson Virginia rides in on a fourgame win streak Andrew Carr nearly traveled it looks like itll stay with Wake Forest eight seconds on the shot clock neither team off to a great start wake a couple of turnovers early Virginia one of ten over five for three Tyree Appleby inbounding Hildreth trying to follow his shot and it comes to Kihei Clark you know its been a cold start like you said he needs for both teams I actually think they both have gotten good looks the shots that Virginias got on this end their movement has been good theyve gotten open shots that they have not hit and theyre an open layup there or at least a layup you should finish if youre Hill driven freshman Isaac McNeely in there Jayden Gardner and Gardner knocks it down from midrange a Gardner and Native of Wake Forest in North Carolina which is not near here its near where you live about two hours East and the Raleigh area Music Appleby against Kihei Clark a match up to watch its terrific its worth the price of admission I thought another turnover by wake wake will have todays inside especially if Virginia continues to play small theyve got caparo in there right now but wake has some big bodies down low and I think thats why Tony Bennett went to Capitol early guy whos only played nine minutes total in their last two games Gardner over Carr rebound Beekman new 20 Clark lines it up he cannot connect and we get a foul down low the offensive glass has been an early storyline Virginia has not shot it well but theyve taken far more shots early in his game than Wacos because of that offensive glass Music you know with this Tempo Anish theres going to be low possessions I mean thats how Virginia plays historically low possessions when you can buy extra ones foul line offensive glass often turnovers those are the cheap stuff in a low possession game Clark again and theres his first field goal he was over three now six points away from passing Corey Alexander on Virginias alltime points list Hildreth down low spin cycle and able to draw the foul hes so good as a guard with his physicality in the low post and hes gotten so much better I think the game has slowed down for him you know hes a driver but he can also do that kind of Barkley move like he does there where he can get his back to the basket back you down a little bit and make a shot hes not been great from the perimeter only five of 18 from three in conference play but hes got a triple double so far this year he had 17 and 10 in that win over Clemson the other day a really tough hardnosed dude right now hes playing the best ball of his brief Wake Forest career sophomore from England scoring up more than nine points per game from last year yeah it sure is you know I thought the experience He and Matthew Marsh got last year didnt play a ton of minutes in Niche but it was a traditional progression learn as a freshman get some minutes make the most of it and then when you become a sophomore both those guys have been given their opportunity youre talking about Player Development whats that I dont know what that is anymore I thought youd just leave and go somewhere else Applause and theres that threegame concept weve been talking about you know Virginia going much more to that especially when they go with that smaller lineup as Kate Shedrick comes in now to replace capro a lot more movement a lot more driving opportunities I thought the the big thing against Virginia Tech for Virginia they really drove the basketball I think Tony Bennett leaning in offensively this year and they have been uh better certainly over the last few games on that end than they have all season that last foul was on Hildreth Cedric lost his shoe so playing with one sneaker Clark another three its good hes got six I love how he didnt have a sneaker and yet they still throw it to him on the Block he said go get one big fella and he was trying to balance while sliding on his uh ankle socks or kneehigh socks you know its two threes in this game already for Kihei clock look at him no no shoes no service no problem right out to Clark got pretty good traction with the socks there you know Clark had two threes in that game the other night again I thought he took the Padula matchup personally like he was going to go after him DA Clark didnt have any threes in the three games prior so four threes in the last two games we have seen him evolve as an offensive player in his five years 39 from three this year for Clark a career best Appleby that was tipped by Virginia 12 to shoot car gets rid of it quickly Williamson now in there for Wake five to shoot Appleby has to let it go and thats why hes number two in the ACC in scoring especially late in the clock I mean youve got it its tough because he could go right by you I mean hes just an outstanding offensive player with a tremendous amount of freedom from Steve Fords Franklin answers at the other end you know the other thing with Applebee thats so impressive Anish is hes really liked by his teammates I mean hes averaging over eight assists a game in conference play which will make you like a guy but the way he plays you gotta have teammates who like you because again hell take some shots sometimes with that freedom to make you scratch your head Hildreth turbines to the rim Music Clark over to Shedrick now McNeely the freshman Franklin lines it up and smooth hes playing with so much more confidence this year hes playing his best in a Virginian uniform theres no doubt about that Bobby Clinton now looking for help will be hounded by Clark and he throws it away Kim Hildreth he is a strong driver the guy they call Artie Arman Franklin has been playing his best basketball in a Virginia uniform over the last three weeks and he knocks the three down there Anish but I think hes been more of a basketball player of late not just a shooter you know came into Virginia with that reputation out of Indiana I thought it put a lot of pressure on him last year to make shots I think his mind is more free go back to their Carolina win he had nine rebounds in that game even though he was over five from three hes just I think when he starts a game aggressive as a driver like he did against Virginia Tech I think its opening more things up for him what impressed me the way he bounced back he had that game in December against Miami scoreless over seventh in the field in the seven games since hes averaging better than 15 points per shooting 52 from the floor of those games Music last year you saw extended dry spells that would carry over from game to game theres Franklin again and that one rattles in and wake showing a little bit of a defensive change zone out of the timeout and a nice job by Franklin filling that corner and then here you know we talked about the matchup on Applebee all day now youve got Rhys Beekman a little more length than Kihei Clark Monsanto quick release and we get a foul on car Applause its a nice weapon to have Anish in this league you know with the really good guard play we have to be able to have two guys in your backcourt like a Kihei and a Reese big now you can throw the kitchen sink at Applebee who has a chance to give Wake Forest backtoback ACC Player of the Year as they had alondus Williams last year who came over as a transfer from Oklahoma Appleby a Florida transfer McNeely the three and after a slow start the shots Monday at 7 Eastern on ESPN and the app Virginia Tech will play host to Duke of the Blue Devils at home knocking off number 17 Miami earlier today then at nine number two Kansas headed to Waco to take on Baylor you cover the Big 12 as well that is a highly anticipated game its kind of become the Marquee game in that League the last few years as Appleby misfires Baylors the hottest team in the big 12 and if you havent seen chiante George the stud freshman for Baylor and obviously Grady dick for Kansas theres Franklin again no hes got it going seven straight made field goals for Virginia Franklins got 11 now three of four from downtown Music Monsanto working on Franklin Williamson no good rebound who else Armond Franklin everywhere vanderplas back in there big size advantage and Franklin finishes and thats another element vanderplas gives Virginia the ability to pass as a big and thats why he works at that four position hes getting a match up and wake was aggressive came with two and did not cover down on the back side Franklin was wide open a very nice pass by vanderplas Music parades made field goals for Virginia after getting off to a two for 14 start Applause Monsanto from 18 and rebound vanderplas its made 15 of his last 26 from deep and that is Beekman and Virginia has now hit seven of 13 from downtown and it is 17 unanswered to the Cavaliers and these are clean looks I mean he was allowed to just step into that in fire wake not an overly aggressive defensive team in terms of extending Carl lost it on the way up he was fouled Applause I mean this has got to be better defended especially after Virginias made a few Appleby Is Not only was he late kind of half closed out Music continues made nine straight shots theyre on a 170 run theyve assisted on 10 of their 11 made baskets identity of this team we always think defense even though sometimes we forgot how efficient they were on offense but this season Chris is Virginias true identity more of an offensive team I think it is I think their ceiling is they have certainly been more efficient offensively this year than they have defensively and I dont think Tony Bennett gets enough credit for the offensive coach he is you know a lot of movement this year theyve gone more to that threegame concept hes found a lineup that works hes got more shooting on his team its a very good passing team theyre one of the best teams in the country an assist rate youve made the point they dont turn it over and so I think he has figured out you know theres its a very versatile team they score in a lot of ways they know where their shots are coming from but they can hit you in a lot of different areas and even early in this game when they started two out of 14 a lot of those were good looks Virginia still hasnt turned the ball over Music Applebee meets Clark now Franklin Clark thought about it shot clock down to four Franklin shot clock at two and Franklin cant get that one to go its knocked out of bounds last touch Virginia and then you add to their offense the ability to offensive rebound which they have done early in this game theyre vanderplas almost almost comes up with another one Rhys Beekman is on the bench he picked up his second foul Music Clark guarding Appleby eldreth has been successful working inside a few times today car shot clock down to five the double doesnt come and he misses falling away and the rebound is pulled down by the Freshman Ryan Dunn six foot eight wiry three blocks and backtoback games a chance to be a real good one for Tony Bennett vanderplas posting up the smaller Applebee and able to draw the foul Virginia again sing the mismatch and exploiting it and theyve had that a few times you know weight getting caught in some switches theyve had vanderplas on Appleby a couple times and have not gone to him there just a nice nice job positioning toss over the top to get the foul fourth team foul against wake Franklin with 15 to lead all scores hes got as many as the Deeks thats what hes doing differently that drive right there and again I think the offense facilitates that theres more room for those types of drives Applebee forced it you got to be careful if youre awake 16 point deficit against Virginia is not the same as if youre playing somebody else Music on Wake has has not proven they can stop Virginia yet you could have set that to Mozart the ball movement and its Franklin in the corner 18 points for Franklin he has outscored the Demon Deacons with five and a half to play in the first half Music foreign over Franklin continues for Wake Forest it has been a minute since their last field goal Virginia on a 221 run over the last six minutes Franklin from Deep short and well get a foul down low if its on vanderplas thats his second and it is its an easy game when you share the basketball I mean this look at that onehanded pass out of the post and around the horn and theres that Armon Franklin and those who put the possessions I mean Franklins had a good first half but those are the possessions that Virginia is starting to have where you dont really know who scores you just know Virginia scored what a textbook possession that was its been the quality of shots sure has and then conversely wake has has not gotten good looks now were making a lot about this Virginia offense lets not forget they can still play a little defense now they havent lost that completely Hildreth backing down done and able to draw the foul you know its a wake team two a niche that has been really reliant on making threes I mean theyre making over nine threes a game theyre shooting almost 40 percent from three in conference play Kihei Clark just picked up his second foul so foul trouble now something to watch Clark has two Beekman has to at Vander plus has two Music Sunday on ABC its an ACC womens basketball matinee Diamond to Johnson leading number 20 NC State and lift and Louisville coverage comes your way at one Eastern Music Wake Forest has got almost seven minutes since its last field goal Virginias made 11 of its last third team from the field Cavaliers eight of 16 from Deep Clark The Savvy vet in there with the two fouls finds Gardner and the rebound to Monsanto Monsanto contested able to knock it down and that ends the field goal drought but its those kind of shots for Wake theyre not really getting into their offense well he could shoot right over Kihei Clark who was on him and Clark with the two fouls you dont want to initially push up but thats what Monsanto wants he wants three McNeely answers man they are smoking Hots and its a multitude of guys I mean thats where the versatility and the number of guys making shots for Virginia can be overwhelming Neely now 16 of his last 27 from three Monsanto at the other end hes a real microwave youve got to do your work early with him you have to play him before he catches the basketball McNeely Applause offensive rebound Franklin Clark back to Franklin whos been hot and a rebound by Monsanto Monsanto thought about it tried to draw the foul it was tipped itll stay with Wake Forest Armon Franklin got a piece Monsanto giving the Deeks now Virginias got 37 theyre on Pace for 80 and under Tony Bennett when Virginia scores 80 theyre 461 Monsanto has been the offense for a wake hes got 11 thats his first twopoint field goal the lob and the Finish Jayden Gardner and again too easy for Virginia a set play out of the timeout well executed Gardner got a screen for McNeely a back screen wide open Monsanto and that is his fourth three and right now he is singlehandedly keeping Wake Forest in this game foreign Applause game this season with four threes for Monsanto hes got three games with six Beekman back in there with the two fouls shot clock at seven Music Franklin over Carr air ball Applause oon there is a window right now for Wake going into halftime yeah a little bit of momentum here its a good point youd love this to be shrunk to single digits and Appleby really has been a nonfactor in this first half Santo camping out in the corner he wants it hes got it I had to give it up shot clock into single digits Hildreth posting up McNeely Gardner coming over to help Hildreth the spin move inside and able to draw the foul thats that Barkley back down that he loves hes hes got a gritty grinding game to him and when he gets you in here especially a matchup like McNeely on him Virginia tried to bring the double with Gardner over the top and I spin to the Baseline there by by cam Hildreth you know hes from uh Worthing England do you know that uh the actress who plays Brienne of Tarth I dont know if youre a Game of Thrones guy Wendell and Kristen shes from Worthing England how about that My Game of Thrones man Im A Game of Thrones nerd clearly theyre speaking my language now right off the top oh yeah I did not know that so cam Hildreth and Brianna Vitara Folk s Wake Within single digits Virginias largest lead was 19 Gardner looking for help Franklin Baseline and the putback there that is Francisco caporo last year he was Cafaro this year he says call me by my real name Cafaro and what a pass from Arman Franklin Music Appleby driving on Beekman whos got the two fouls and the putback Matthew Marsh thats what he does sure is he was on the spot and thankfully he was because that was really well defended on Appleby by Beekman Virginia holding for one final shot and Marsh commits commits the foul its a good foul theyre not at the limit and make Virginia reset here Music only the fifth team foul so wake has one more to give Franklin will inbound maybe in Williamson checks in for Wake Forest and now Tony Bennett calls the time out 54 seconds to go Franklin has been Virginias top scorer hes the games top scorer 18 points four threes in the first half and whats been impressive Virginia 41 points nine threes zero zero turnovers and the balance has been outstanding thats kind of whats defined in this offense over the last handful of games here number of shot makers the movement is really tough to guard we talked about how good a passing team this Virginia group is Music and really you know Wade gets back into this game because of the threepoint shooting for Monsanto the question for wake at halftime is where are we going to generate offense Appleby who came in averaging 18 a game number two in the ACC only five points on two of six Hills worth only one field goal hes done most of his work the freethrow line five seconds to go Beekman to Gardner nearly stolen away Gardners got to put it up and he is fouled on the shot so two shots coming it is on Monsanto his first thats a bad foul by a red shirt junior he should know better you got to make Gardner make this shot I mean this is going to be a tough shot car is there youve got some length he should be up closer but Vermont Santa to even be involved in that is unacceptable Gardner comes up short his numbers down this season his minutes are down part of that is the emergence of some of these other pieces for Virginia Isaac McNeill Ryan Music Ryan one out of two Williamson from half court we had a little bit of a duel in that first half Demari Monsanto hit four threes Armani Franklin had four threes Virginia on the road up 10 at the break 282 with the Joel since the beginning of last season and theyve beaten two ranked teams here knocking off Duke and Clemson on Tuesday Virginia riding into this game on a fourgame win streak vanderplas puts it on the floor against Carr Appleby came over to help vanderplas off the feed from Clark and another three that is 10 now for the game for Virginia thats the versatility they started vendor Plus on the Block it was a broken play he floats out to that threepoint line such a tough matchup how does wake the entire app will be going well Virginia Credit them weve talked about their offense they did a nice job against Appleby put multiple guys on him were very aggressive in ball screens he just didnt have a lot of movement a niche Hills Rift down low and called for a travel hes been working the low post and Franklin did his best not to seat any ground at that time Hildreth got caught you know clearly Virginia came into this as you would expect Tyree Appleby is not going to beat us and then were going to play those other guys off of him the game we view it as us versus Appleby Applause Appleby has not scored since the 12minute mark of the first half came into this game second of the ACC and scoring and that was just a Im going to get mine drive right against Kihei Clark well hes not averaging 18 in this league for no reason and thats where hes got to start youd love to see him like that anise Drive the basketball Gardner no good Applause Santo he led wake with 14 in the first half four threes Appleby driving on Clark and thats going to be three on Kihei Clark and thats the other reason why driving its good especially in that matchup you know if youre Virginia or any team against Appleby you cant get caught watching him dribble especially in isolation because hes a very willing passer to those other guys one of the reasons hes averaging eight assists a game in conference play it does not get easier for Appleby monsantos three not there Clark exits so now youre gonna have to deal with Reese speaking Music is that has the mismatch against Appleby they couldnt get it to him now they do shot clock at six and vanderplas stepped out of bounds you know it was interesting talking to Steve Forbes about Virginia he mentioned Ben Van Der plas about four to different times in the conversation hes been the real Difference Maker for Virginia over the last three games Music just committed Virginias first turnover Applause and vanderplas inserted into the starting lineup two games ago making his third straight start its the small lineup thats worked well Monsanto beats the shot clock his fifth three and Wake Forest with an eight you got to keep riding that wave because thats a tough shot but its what carried them in the first half hes got 16 to lead to the Deeks Armon Franklin leads all scorers with 18 Beekman hesitates now Gardner Baseline short a chance to make it a two possession game Appleby kicks to hildren and the three foreign Music Hoosier said you cant get caught watching the paint dry you cant get caught watching Tyree Appleby operate because hes a very willing passer Kim Hildreth hes wet in SEC Sports the experience in 3D February 17th Wake Forest trailed by as many as 19 they have closed to six and since Kihei Clark left the game with his third foul awake goes on a 70 run if youre an opposing team you feel much better playing Virginia when Clark is not in the game and as as an individual if youre Tyree Appleby as good a Defenders Reece beakman is hes not Kihei Clark Kihei Clark is a dog hes a foxhole guy hes going to get into you theres no back down and I think Appleby senses that such as how needed he is in this game so youd rather be okay with going up against the length of Beekman to be clear I dont want to play either of them but I feel much better when Clark is out of the game McNeely in there for Virginia driving on Hildreth lost it and the crowd does not like the foul call its not really what McNeely does its you know if youre Steve Forbes youre like man he puts it on the floor and we foul him you send him to the foul line for two cheap free throws a guy who is all threes 77 percent of his shots from three I like his nickname man they call him iMac well youre an Apple guy in the nil world now that means something but it does former Mr basketball in West Virginia hits the free throw Beekman picks up Appleby right on the logo Applebee looking to shake Beekman good pass Carr down low and it rattles home for the Delaware transfer Andrew Carr hes been quiet but he has been so good of late guy who was recruited to play behind Jake laravia sped up his process from the radio left hell drip the Steal Monsanto was calling for it Hildreth didnt see him and able to draw the foul and momentum right now has shifted the pendulum has swung to wake with 15 43 to go in the half Music Im your glitchy WiFi which means youre smart home Joel We got a ball game here and foul trouble becoming an issue now for Virginia Reese Speakman just picked up his third Kihei Clark picked up his third earlier in this half but hes got Clark back on the floor so hes willing to play one of those guys with that foul trouble and hes as you said youd love to see Appleby remain aggressive particularly off the dribble Appleby Baseline Dunn Corrals the Caribou they love that out of bounds play they run that three four times a game foreign Franklin has not had many touches in the second half Clark on the drive Hildreth got a piece of the ball Clark recovers shot clock did not reset and done with the three just as fourth of the season his minutes are way up hes played 40 minutes combined in their last two games coming in I think Tony Bennett has found something with Ryan Dunn hes down with the circle of trust ACC High 25 minutes against Virginia Tech the other day Carr drives and able to draw the foul and done still down underneath the Virginia basket thats the versatility of Andrew Carr play inside he could play facing up and I said a moment ago he was recruited to play Steve Forbes recruited him out of Delaware to play behind Jake laravea and he was actually their best player over the summer and Steve Forbes saying he leveled out a little bit in the fall but with no loravia here kind of sped up his progression and hes really coming on hes got double doubles in their last two games I think it was that Rutgers game of Niche where even in that physical game a game they lost you could start to see Andrew Carr start to figure it out but he was a big player here Tuesday night 18 and 11 in the win against Clemson Tigers came into the game 70 in the ACC that was their first loss in conference both of these teams six and two in League Play tied for second vanderplas backing down Carr Carr got a piece of it Mildred strong drives foreign McNeely launches in and out and wake can make it a one possession game Appleby to the 10 and called for steps thats the right call foreign Music Music its about an eight stepper what was he grabbing his wrist grabbing his wrist now holding that left wrist not a Euro Step its a Eurasian step two continents Clark playing with the three fouls Franklin with 18 none in the second half puts it on the floor and hell get two free throws thats what hes been doing this season taking the ball to the basket more with a threepoint shot at times hasnt been there hell drive the ball and hes become a more consistent player and I think thats where the half court offense they are running and hes that threegame concept versus the Mover blocker has opened up more of those drives you know they get the movement they get the screening and then Clark Beekman Franklin can can break that off and get into that drive to the basket Virginia Notre Dame womens basketball tomorrow 2 pm over on the ACC Network a chance to watch a little more Hoops before getting your Sunday football fix this is a pretty nice appetizer before some playoff football says its a good crowd Ive seen it Wake Forest in a long time Steve Forbes has reenergized this fan base reenergized the Joel mainly the block on Hildreth you think about where this program had been for a decade plus you know in purgatory or worse in the ACC Steve Forbes takes over a couple years ago we showed some progress last year 135 in League Play and now if not for maybe a better nonconference schedule or a few more nonconference wins they would have been right there in the NCAA tournament its not often teams go 135 in the ACC and miss out on the dance yeah well and for Steve Forbes if youre trying to beef up your nonconference schedule youre also doing it you dont know who your roster is going to be so I think you know he goes out he schedules Rutgers they got a really nice win at Wisconsin you know that twopoint loss to LSU you wonder if that comes back to haunt them a little bit but youre assuming if youre Forbes that Jake laravey is coming back and then larabio is too good he ends up being a first round pick but its becoming harder and harder to schedule not only with transfers and whatnot and the movement but also how whos going to be good how do we determine whos going to help our Analytics Music junior college coach where youre piecing together a roster year in year out season by season its helped them and youve seen what hes done with an Applebee with an alondis Williams the loravia McNeely knocks down the three and hes becoming a dead eye shooter now three of five from downtown better than 50 over his last six plus games Appleby whistled for the offensive foul you cannot on that that shot before my McNeely you have got to know Personnel you cannot help if youre Damien Williamson that one step he takes towards the basketball allows a threepoint shooter a guy who only shoots threes and who has been on a heater over the last handful of games that is over help and its a bad defensive play slow and that is set back by Matthew Marsh surprisingly only his third block of the season that is surprising you know a guy who only played 79 minutes all season last year another one of those sophomores who has stepped into a lot more minutes hes done a nice job this year hes worked a lot with the strength and conditioning coach gotten stronger got bigger got faster imagine the pickup games he and his brothers theyre all about the same height okay its about fighting wrestling turns into a rugby match race Beekman picks up the foul and that is four now on one of the Premier perimeter defenders in the country so beekmans got four Kihei Clark has three and now itll be Clark on Appleby seven point lead for Virginia theyve led by as many as 19 Appleby looking to shake Clark driving against Dunn and a foul on the floor before the shot its on done his second Music Forbes thought it should have been a shooting foul thats already 16 fouls now for Virginia so awake the bonus from here on out 1206 to go second half Virginias halftime lead was 10 Appleby over clark Kihei pushing for Virginia fifth year senior and a turnover for Virginia just their third of the game different vibe inside the Joel here in the second half Music Melbourne underway Australian Open coverage begins tonight at 7 Eastern on ESPN plus coverage begins on ESPN2 at 8 oclock and you can watch Coco 9pm tonight Music wakes guards this afternoon Appleby and Hildreth have drawn 10 fouls combined and you start to say whats changed this game well it started with foul trouble for Beekman and he had Clark yeah its a good point you know go back to that Clemson game Appleby Drew 9 000 that game took 14 free throws Music Beekman on the bench with four fouls Clark has three Appleby goes right at him flips it reverses it but didnt get ripped I mean thats a perfect setup out of the timeout youre isolating that right wing to try and get a foul on Clark you gotta have a stronger finish look there if youre Appleby Appleby three out of ten Franklin for three rebound car Monsanto straight away in and out this place would have erupted if that would have got in until four threes tonight Music Gardner down low Franklin got his man in the air and then missed the bunny missed layups Appleby going to work on Clark spin cycle inside and draws the foul its its going to be tough for Kihei Clark because theyre just going isolation out and hes got a ton of space and the freedom to go and the freedom to go to work Its just tough hes too Shifty he reminds me and I I mean this is a very poor mans form he reminds me a lot of Allen Iverson hes got that slight body frame he throws his body around incredible freedom very Shifty can make tough shots hes got Iverson vibes its gonna be hard for Kihei Clark particularly in foul trouble a niche to stay in front of that yeah four on Clark four on Beekman app will be the 24 year old Florida transfer began his career at Cleveland State named a few days ago to the midseason Oscar Robertson award watch list and he can score he has been a double figure scorer and all five of his Collegiate Seasons that hes played in Virginias lead down to five Franklin in the low post Gardner with eight to shoot kick ball Carr that resets the shot clock to 20 again trying to run Appleby down to the block Applebee switched on to vanderplas just cant make a post pass and a foul before the inbounds its on Hildreth this second McNeely a three short Appleby driving on McNeely kicks to Monsanto the quick release thats the ball the ball drive and dribble Y open drives floater too strong Here Comes Monsanto hildred kicks it back the trailer foreign erplas the three quiets the crowd its a big shot from a guy who has hit some big shots in their last few games what a weapon vanderplas has become Appleby Monsanto at the other end yes Tyree Appleby occupies attention to the defense of the opposite side Bobby Clinton runs the floor and a little fleskies slush these potatoes went from once said so we got a threepoint game in each Virginia led by 19 with 5 42 to go in the first half Wake Forest has cut the lead all the way down to three and we made this point earlier Chris big down 19 against Virginia feels different because they can suffocate you by grinding the clock playing slow and thats almost the 30point deficit or a 25point deficit against anybody else the fact that wake is close to within three tells you how good this team is on this floor vanderplas inside against hildred and awake can tie with a three Applebee and that is a block on McNeely his second foul awaken the bonus so a one and one for Tyree Appleby and 82 percent freethrow shooter its hard to quantify what Virginia has lost with Clark and Beekman in foul trouble defensively it starts there but secondarily offensively those two guys calm this team down certainly Kihei Clark meat drives this engine to not have those two guys is a massive deal here for Virginia be interesting to see an East how long Tony Bennett Waits I was going to ask you at some point do you put one of the two in just a neutralize Appleby I think the closer you get to that four minute TV timeout I think youll start to see you know I think theyll sprinkle those guys back in and then trust that they wont foul a onepoint game the closest its been since 1514 turnover Applebee the other way for three for the lead and going the other way its a foul against Wake Forest Marsh I dont mind the shot from Applebee its shots hes taken all year and as I like to say if youre okay with a guy taking a shot and making it you have to be okay with Tyree Appleby taking that shot and missing it so momentum shot those are those Iverson Vibes Im talking about youre gonna have to live with some tough ones wake his beaten two ranked teams at home 100 with the Joel Franklin open three hes been quiet in his second half only one point he had 18 in the first 20 minutes Appleby driving on done locked by done set three blocks in backtoback games and then they get Bobby Clinton The Freshman from Sweden with the region you know when youre a big guy you can meet somebody at The Rim you might get beat meet him at The Rim with one of the means is you might get beat but if you stay with the play you can meet him at the backboard thats a big time block on an outstanding offensive player by The Freshman Ryan Dunn he is going to be a good one for Virginia older brother Justin played baseball in the ACC first round pick is a pitcher out of Boston College now with the Cincinnati Reds Virginia with the lead and Beekman and Clark back in the game with seven and a half to go both playing with four fouls Applause Bateman Baseline Drive bumped no foul off of Monsanto nine to shoot what do you tell a player when they come in with four fouls with this much time left well hopefully you dont have to tell these veterans too much Anish hes got to stay in a stance try to stay in front and in a pinch dont commit the foul and your weight if youre awake youre going right after Appleby wanted to picked up his dribble Franklin picks up Hildreth 15 for Hildreth Appleby with 11 it was right to work on Clark good help Music clock down to eight Mildred posting up Franklin feed to the corner Carr the three that would have been for the lead and its snatched by Dunn and you made this point earlier Tony you bet Bennett telling us its us against Tyree Appleby all those other guys have to be aware of the foul trouble Clark and Beekman are in Beekman and well get Carl with a foul Music Virginia to the line a one and one whos now in the bonus and thats the matchup thats two drives that Beekman takes on Carr I actually thought it got fouled on the Baseline on the last possession but they pick it up there you know thats the game of matchups we knew coming in in each Wake Forest much bigger up front when Virginia has this lineup in best crowd of the Season at home for Wake Forest they woke up from their Slumber really late in that first half when the Wake went on a bit of a run Applause B in the paint teardrop not there thats a gimme getting what you want I mean that is on the doorstep and they fell asleep defensively Franklin the easy flush and a timeout by Steve Forbes you had a chance at one end and then a breakdown at the other if youre Steve Forbes but theres nothing you can do if youre Steve Forbes you drew up the play you wanted I mean he got right on the doorstep and then here just a breakdown in your your transition defense and a nice job by Franklin seen a couple of those types of cuts from the weak side its good to get a dunk see if that maybe gets him going he was so good in that first half particularly from three in the second half Virginia shooting just 25 percent they didnt turn it over in the first 20 minutes theyve had four here Franklin with that dunk as 21 his fifth 20point game this season eighth as a cavalier Music 601 to go what does this game come down to comes down whos able to execute in the half court Anish I mean its you know again its Tyree Appleby the damage hes able to cause and its not necessarily his bucket but what hes creating for others Music Applause field but he does have five assists he leads the ACC in that category Carr backing down the Freshman Dunn swoops in batted off and the long arms the great wingspan of Ryan Dunn Coming away with the ball you can see why Tony Bennett likes him in there as long plays with a really good motor good athlete driving on car kicks to the corner done for three Line Drive comes right back to him hes called for the offensive foul thats three undone Applause Music Applause Music thats a good call youre just trying to do too much you know nice job following up his shot and in a good heads up defensive play by Andrew Carr Applause Music served the deck Miami and Pittsburgh Miami lost to Duke earlier today Clemson at seven and one leading the conference Applause car against Dunn and he traveled Applause thats done I mean he is just Andrew Carlton sped up and you know collapsing folding chair there Music Clark from the corner puts it on the floor drops it off Franklin through Tremonton and Dudley emphatic put back Music foreign close to within one a 60 Virginia run Appleby against Clark and not much Kihei could do with the four fouls but you got to make a decision if youre Tony Bennett because that was well defended by a guy with four fouls are you gonna bring help are you gonna have guys come over to help on that drive 13 now for Tyree Appleby Beekman works the Baseline Applause almost a threesecond shot clock at two Clark lets it Fly and fouled on the threepoint shot by Appleby Applause well have to see this one yeah thats a foul Applause The Venture X card from capital this is a massive play and a fivepoint game under four minutes theres no question thats a foul he hits him on the elbow and if youre an official standing right there which is where the official was hes going to call that its not a smart play by Tyree Appleby that is not a shot that Kihei Clark is hitting at a high percentage and this game has a chance to go to eight points if he bangs down all three of these free throws that is a massive foul in this game Kihei Clark a 74 freethrow shooter winningest player in school history making his 126th career start today and he misses the first seven starts away from tying London parentes his school record chasing down John Crotty on the alltime assists list as well foreign Music with that free throw hes got eight points in the game and is now tied with Corey Alexander our colleague on Virginias alltime scoring list point lead for the Cavaliers Music Beekman marking Monsanto skip pass Appleby brings it down shoots over clark Marsh added the rebound and lost it and a foul is called Down Low Applause defensive possession by Virginia first of all you made weight take some time and they have done an exceptional job without high ball screen today Anish where you know Appleby in that middle third of the floor you get that rim run all the time by Matthew Marsh or Andrew Carr and it usually results in a dunk Virginias done a nice job with that today four fouls now undone Marsh a 41 freethrow shooter just 13 of 32 prior to that Music Randy gets them both so Dunn Kihei Clark and Beekman all with four fouls and all on the floor Applause and its an offensive foul Appleby sold it vanderplas picks up his third Applause theyve had that a lot today that mismatch Van Der plas had 235 pounds geez just discards still 175 pounds Tyree Appleby Virginia with one time out wake has two three minutes to go at one point it looked like a Virginia runaway and an allen offensive foul on Marsh officials taking control of this game whether you like it or not I was not a fan of this call at least live I mean hes just trying to to me thats not a moving block hes actually trying to get out of the way of Kihei Clark but I guess the official saw him is trying to set a screen while moving Appleby shading Clark Beekman from Deep wow the three is there big shot and a shot it didnt seem like he wanted to take but hes actually shooting a very high percentage from three this year 48 Monsanto forced it and thats thats not a good shot and thats the dimari Monsanto kind of shot hell shoot you into a game but he could take some bad ones in some big spots awake has missed seven of its last day Beekman putting it on the floor could not maneuver around a car we come up on two minutes to play Beekman step back long two airball Music working on Franklin and they get Franklin with the foul Two Shots now for cam Hildreth who is eight for eight at the free throw line and the stripe has been a big advantage today for wake it has its really been a her offense you know it was Monsanto in the first half and then really just driving it and getting to the foul line in this second half for Wake Music Laughter Monday Duke and Virginia Tech Blue Devils coming off a win today against Miami and Cameron Indoor Virginia Tech one and six in League Play but much better than the record indicates that theyve got Hunter Couture back Kansas Baylor The nightcap at nine one out of two for Hildreth now heres where Virginias dangerous they practice their offense with the shot clock winding down so this is nothing new and youve got to get a stop here because you cant you cant play these out much longer with three to shoot Franklin gets the roll to kill him you know you didnt have to foul there yet but you had to get a stop and the lead now back to 10 thats what the margin was at halftime Monsanto from the corner his sixth three of the game fourth game with six or more threes Hildreth to steal Blakes still alive Monsanto again hits a careerhigh 25 for damari Monsanto seven threes and awake pulls to within four its the many moves of damari Monsanto he is a wild card emphasis on wild he takes some shots and if youre Steve Forbes you have to live with because he can do this thats a big time shot hes got tremendous positional size about six six and he has started to hit that shot off the bounce and how about a turnover Niche a team that rarely does that especially that guy Kihei Clark a big turnover at Center Court leading to another transition three Music Virginia led by as many as 19 looking to hold on this would be a big road win for the whos trying to make it five in a row awake has not lost on its home floor this season the Demon Deacons have beaten two ranked teams and they come back and somehow win this game after being down 19 to Virginia yeah that says a lot about where this team is headed when they were just down 10 with about a minute 20 to Virginia and still two threes how does he six points put you right back in this game to the extent that you dont have to foul here like play this out trust your defense I think you could afford to be aggressive but again youve got to get a stop in a defensive rebound Music Virginia will inbound they can run the Baseline Van Der plaster inbound Don Franklin Clark and Beekman on the floor for the Cavaliers Appleby Hildreth Carr Monsanto and Clinton for Wake Applause stay with Virginia knocked out by wake Beekman Dunn and Clark all have four fouls Music Applause Clark clears to Beekman and now we get a foul its Hildreth Music Two Shots you know clearly obviously Steve Fords wanted them fouling there you know they had taken by the time Virginia got it over was about 20 seconds on the shot clock Im in favor of playing that thing out trust your defense get your stop again he makes both of these and and now youre at a differential with 41 left here Music Virginia just hit the 70 point threshold 90 this season when scoring at least 70 Clark with that last free throw just past Corey on the alltime scoring list do you really hit that home were gonna get that in Ill hear it from him when I see him Applause both free throws good 7367 still a two possession game Applause Monsanto trailing the play Appleby down the lane against Franklin missing the layup and now you got a foul and they finally do so Kihei Clark to go to the line with a chance to ice this game yeah I think if your Tyree Appleby after this game theres been a few of those bunnies around the Reminisce too many today too many in a game like this against the team like Virginia where your margin for error is very thin you have got to make those layups around the room Appleby just four out of 16 he came into the game as the accs number two score and you know you cant say enough about what the experiences meant for Virginia yes youve got young guys like McNeely and Dunn making big plays but Clark and Beekman the ability to come back with four fouls to stay on the floor thats been the difference and how about the head coach trusting those guys I mean he put them in I thought it was going to be closer to that four minute timeout he put him back in right under eight minutes and thats a thats a head coach whos been in a lot of Wars certainly with Kihei Clark and Reese Speakman he trusts those guys and to do that particularly with Clark on Tyree Appleby that was a heck of a job here by Kihei Clark Music Virginia returns to action next Saturday Boston College comes to jpj that came on the ACC Network wake goes to Pittsburgh on Wednesday a pit team that is far more dangerous than anybody thought going into the season Monsanto tries another three its not there batted out to Hildreth Monsanto again Franklin pulls it down thats all she wrote Virginia hands wake its first home loss of the season the Cavaliers make it five in a row we talked a lot about Virginias offense and the identity of this team taking shape we saw that again they went to the smaller lineup even with foul trouble to their guards this offense gave this Virginia team a cushion in the first half this is an offense
