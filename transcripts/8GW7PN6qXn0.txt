Music and we are underway in John Paul Jones Arena its Virginia that starts with the basketball the team going through a difficult stretch so a good start would go a long way they need to see the ball go in the basket early manto man for Boston College Day Day Adams cant connect and based on the way Virginia plays theyre going to drop back theyre really not going to try to go for the offensive board so its a oneandone kind of thing and as you look at the BC starting lineup Elijah strong again not in the starting lineup he stays out with an illness and we mentioned venning but the Eagles have gotten pretty good guard play out of Donald Han Jr and Josh Beetle its venning who has it here fading away with the shot clock winding down and thats Off the Mark no good you take a look at the Cavaliers starting five you picked out Elijah Saunders pregame Applause Dan Isaac mcne has it here trying to get him hot his shooting stroke hasnt been what Virginia fans have come accustomed to in his first couple years here in Charlottesville he started out very well he has tailed off recently has Isaac mcne but hes a guy whos capable of really lighting it up from out there and one of the reasons hes tailed off a little bit is the teams that are playing Virginia know that and they try to get all over it mcney has it here shakes free and hits him and thats a really good spin move by mcney Dion Browns trying to guard him but as soon as he got away from Brown venning couldnt get out there fast enough to get Applause him and this were talking about McNeely hes more than just a stand still shooter nice screen by Kofi just gives him enough room to get open for that jump shot and the game was stopped because they threw some streamers that went on the floor and Roger s went over and said stop that and theyre making the announcement that the next time that happens and it wont because it only happens with the first shot of the game that therell be a technical foul well you just said it what does Virginia need to see the ball go through the hoop McNeely does that opening the scoring with a three venning answers with a nice take and see now thats a problem because venning outweighs Kofi by 40 lbs and if youre going to let him get going on the dribble Kofi cant stop him on the inside Kofi answers with a nice knockdown jumper of his own but see thats going to be hard for venning to guard too good big man battle shaping up in the early goings here match up to Applause watch heres venning double team comes in for Virginia venning only has 11 assists in 18 games so thats not a bad strategy kick to the corner shot clock down to three thats no good from Dion Brown well Brown was a big scorer at UNBC last year but he hasnt been able to put up those kind of numbers at Boston College certainly not an ACC play where the Eagles have struggled just one and six and theyre lacking that consistent scoring threat something that Virginia can empathize with heres Elijah Saunders and that rims in the San Diego State transfer hes been the most consistent scorer for Virginia this season hes 68 240 lbs McFarland is 64 so if they can get Saunders isolated down on the inside thats Advantage Virginia and McFarland forced into the starting lineup because of strong Strongs illness so Boston College starting with a smaller lineup than theyre accustomed to playing with and a turnover this an outstanding start so far for Virginia theyve made a couple of baskets theyve taken advantage of some mismatches Buchanan is going to come in the game now for Kofi and Buchanan hes a guy had a big game against Applause SMU a Virginia has made their last three shots not many times you can say that during whats been a difficult stretch five game losing streak for the Cavaliers are hoping to snap it here at home heres Andrew roie and now McNeely tees it up for Saunders Day Day Adams has to let it fly at the end of the shot clock he misfires see when venning goes to help as he did that time Buchanans got to get himself closer to the basket Applause venning I mean he can take the ball from outside and get all the way to the basket hes much more athletic and mobile than you Applause think AES on the drive in attack mode kicks to the corner Ro a three nothing but the bottom of the net thats a great job by roie to go find the open spot and roie he has shot the ball so much better this year than he did last Applause year a Virginia terrific start a team thats desperate to see the ball go through the hoop theyve got 10 points in the opening four and a half everything right except they shot four for 26 from Beyond The Arc today theyve made their two of their first four threes but theyve also been able to get the ball inside again we said venning might be a problem and he scored all four of Boston Colleges points but nobody else has scratched Applause yet heres Fred Payne the sophomore into the game off the bench for the Eagles McFarland lost his pivot foot and thats a travel McFarland is 64 but he is a very aggressive player hes a transfer as well scored he scored more than a thousand points in his career hes an excellent re rebounder he was trying to beat mcne off the dribble and as you say just dragg his pivot Music fo Andrew roie on the drive trying to spin his way free good defense but a better bucket by Andrew roie he has five for the Cavaliers in the opening five minutes just size and strength inside for thats a really good Music play off the backboard that was actually a pass intended for Jaden Hastings it was way off the Applause mark back to back turnovers for Boston College lets see if the Cavaliers can continue to capitalize a thats an over back mcne didnt get his feet down in time well he was in the back court jumped in the air caught the ball and landed in the front court so thats a backourt violation and thats a situation where I think that was Sharma that was throwing the ball back there you just hang on to it its not that its not that desperate a situation very clearly a violation an early 8 point deficit for Boston College they trying to shake off what was a terrible second half against Duke but a lot of teams are going to have not their best basketball playing the Duke Blue Devils Duke is a different animal you cant say the wheels came off in the second half for Boston College its more like Duke removed the wheels thats just the kind of team they are through eight possessions in this game Boston College has turned it over four times the Virginia Defense has been really good you know and during this fivegame losing streak Virginia has allowed 74 points per game to its Applause opponents The Freshman Sharma picks up his dribble finds Blake Buchanan giv go and Buchanan hammers it home just outstanding ball movement and player Movement by Virginia Boston College is chasing and thats not what you want to do on defense Virginias opened up a 10point lead on a seven nothing run and thats the Eagles first bucket in two and 12 minutes Josh Beetles a guy who can go get you a basket sometimes he looks like hes a little bit out of control but charma cant connect on the Applause Music Applause triple bes a guy who likes to attack the basket does that here working against the freshman and the floater does not fall Music Road finds Saunders this is Virginia basketball well theyre playing a little FAS than normal you dont usually see them try to convert on a break like that but that that gives you an example of the strength of Saunders you went with the left hand that time got the ball in the goal ricochets to the corner actually led to a pretty good look but McFarland couldnt VAR it just feels like Virginias getting everything they want off defensively the passing has been very crisp I think the movement has been has really good and heres the screen and roll and theyre afraid to leave Saunders so McFarland doesnt get over in time and then again this is Saunders Now power and thats a good fake and again he protects the ball with his body and uses his left hand I dont think you could ask for a better start if youre a Virginia no if youre head coach Ron Sanchez youre thinking this this is what Virginia basketball can and be he believes in this group and even though theyve gone through a difficult stretch on this fivegame losing streak theyve come out and looked a lot better tonight and mcne adds another three hes got two triples early and that was just the ball he picked up off the court it was not even going really past to him but how alert is that just pick it up fire Applause kick to the corner wow and Boston College buries it Donald Han Jr the Eagles leading scorer with his first basket of the night and that was a very tough shot but thats the kind hand is one of those tough guys who can make those shots charma step back and it drops and its a three thats all going for the Cavaliers tonight they have made nine of their first 13 shots and four of seven from Applause three sometimes this game is is that simple right it is that simple nice move and a great finish Chad venning hes been the bright spot for Boston College well so far venning hasnt been catching the ball on the low post and powering it to the basket hes been catching the ball away from the basket and driving it into the low Applause post ases into contact and thats a charge Luca Taves got Applause there of Virginia doubling up Boston College 2211 Chad venning ripping the rim off there has been the bright spot for the Eagles he Music fantastic basketball game went to overtime Virginia woned and thats just the state of college basketball The rosters turn over and now they find themselves at the bottom of the conference just fighting to get into the ACC tournament let alone talks of a quarterfinal appearance and Benning and Hastings are playing at the same time theres a mismatch inside Ames is trying to guard him down there Hastings couldnt pass out of it good help defense by Jacob Kofi and it forces another Boston College turnover thats five in this first half for the Eagles and thats really hurt Boston College theyre not scoring a lot of points because theyre not getting shots up theyre turning the ball over that three goes off the mark isan Sharma The Freshman hes not shy to let it fly hes already hit one tonight well no hes not and when youre open you have to shoot that three now that was a little deep and I think Virginia was a little early in the shot clock the Cavaliers have done a really good job moving the ball and getting Guys open both on the inside and from threepoint range heres V went to the spin move couldnt knock it down and that was a back to the basket move and Ro really helped distract him coming down with the double Applause team kof he catches it up there hes got to turn and face the basket he faces it this time in attack mode layup doesnt go follows his own Miss kicks it out Saunders a three he hits it Applause talked about Saunders his ability to play inside and outside and we have seen that here in the first 11 minutes of this game Saunders a perfect three for three from the field theres nothing ER Grants defense can do against him so far well and that time Boston College venning and Hastings knocked the ball away from one another and so Hastings comes out of the game McFarland comes back in Applause Lua Taves loses the handle tees it up for Han Jr and heres Chaz Kelly into the game a deep three Han junor left it short now Boston College really didnt get anything on the offensive boards and thats a place where a lot of teams have feasted against the Cavaliers Saunders got it again and Elijah Saunders back to back threes that he knew that was going in the basket while it was in the air headed to it Saunders has 10 Boston College as a team only has Applause 11 Taves it did not drop Bon College taking tough shots meanwhile Virginia getting anything they want on the offensive end time out Earl Grant its another eight nothing run for Virginia Boston College has fallen in shots well and six of those 12 shots are threes and Elijah Saunders we talked about him power inside and the ability to knock down a three and hes got four field goals hes four for four two of them are threes two of them are Applause inside it would so so important for Virginia not enough people talk about it is they play their best defense after a make they can set their defense very good in the half court and they made 12 of their 18 shots they set their defense and they can create turnovers like that thats why the offensive rebounds they give up and the turnovers really hurt them because you cant set your defense against that kind of stuff Boston College forces a turnover over there three on two McFarland right to the rim lays it up and in see thats youre playing in transition and Ive always thought theres no such thing is transition defense you got to set your defense in transition its really Music Applause hard Saunders righty hook falls off the rim no good now again I theres no I have no problem with them shooting the ball early in the clock but they need to get better ball movement than that venning he had a step on Buchanan but Blake Buchanan recovered well there how about Buchanan Wrestling the ball away from literally wrestling it away Applause from Saunders tried to lob it up to Buchanon he wasnt ready for it well he was ready for it but venning was ready for it too and so venning got that 270 lbs in there and just forced Buchanan out of Applause Music out oh when Boston College has been at its best offensively tonight theyve gone inside to big number 32 Chad vck right youve got theyve got to get ball movement on the exterior they cant just look inside all the time McFarland steps in lined it up and Way Off the Mark and again when they have had open shots theyve had a tough time making and we mentioned he was in Southeast Louisiana scored more than a th points there so hes a guy who can really score Roy hes been aggressive driving to the rim again leaves it for Buchanan nothing he can do against venning he just bounced off he drove the ball just bounced off Applause heres Josh Beetle he lost the handle and a travel Beetles trying to make something happen and I dont know that you need to make something happen by driving the ball in that situation at least trying to get if you cant get by your guy on the perimeter then pass the ball this is really a good job by Ames to stay in front Beetle gets up in the air with no place to go thats one thing the Cavaliers have done well theyve kept their man in front of them theres havent been a lot of drives to the basket Applause mismatch inside hes got seven Ines on Fred Payne but cant cash in on him tab suddenly going a little bit cold and nearing a threeminute scoring drought Donald hand junr draws the foul and Boston College will go to the free throw line for the first time tonight now hand is a 90 free throw shooter so thats not a bad idea for him to drive but venning was all alone inside a bounce pass is two Applause points and Jun has four points tonight the leading scorer for the Eagles our Wednesday ACC Network mens basketball double header this is tomorrow night right here on acc networ Syracuse at clemon and Florida State at Cal tips off S eastern time Music tomorrow so Virginia a little bit of a scoring drought here and Boston College really needs to take advantage theyve chopped four points off the lead but they still have a ways to go well the best stretch of the season for Boston College was early in the season in the Cayman Islands where they came back three straight games to win it was a calling card for this team early that they could chip away at leads theyve lost that in ACC play roie out of contact no call and buchanons there to clean up the spill put that one in the Playbook Drive lose the ball inside missed the shot tip it in so that ends the Virginia scoring drought and Boston College looks up theyve gone six minutes and only made one basket defense continues to be outstanding venning fading away and it falls off the rim venning needs to go to the basket Virginia doesnt really have anybody that can contest him when he gets close mcney lines up the three it if hes going to do that then the defense Boston College defense is really in trouble because that wasnt completely uncontested but that was great movement What A Catch and shoot H MCN a perfect three for three from deep and Deion Brown a scoop to the hoop answers timeout Virginia desperately need an ACC win Dan but Virginias come out and and executed real well they really have and Ron Sanchez was upset with Elijah Saunders that time because Brown just drove right past him to the basket and thats really the first time weve seen that tonight T Murray into the game for Virginia find charma wide open in the corner couldnt vary it Sharma thats his job is to shoot threes they prefer he make a few more but that was really good Movement by Virginia got a wide open shot good movement there and a Monster Jam Chad venning he has eight of the Eagles 19 he went out and set a screen and Virginia for the first time really in this game did not defend that well we thought venning would be a load inside and so far hes been exactly Applause that MC Neely heat check and he buries it Isaac mcne four for four from three in this first half and hes made him picking the ball up off the floor that time off the dribble catch and shoot hes just really on fire so far here today the last two games Virginia has only average six made threes in the entire game they have eight made threes in this first half Boston College has only made one three and Boston College does not have an offensive Rebound in this game and thats a place where Virginia has struggled shot clock down to five Sharma the floater doesnt fall but it stays Virginia basketball T Murray kept it in play thats just great Hustle by Virginia theyve made all the winning plays of this first half mcne is first Miss of the night too much on it and that long rebound gives Boston College a chance to get out and go this is where you want the B to go and Junior stood up by mcne though pay splitting two good take Fred Payne with a head of steam Fred a power drop down to help out against Donald H Jr and as a result that gave pay just the lane he needed Applause Virginia was an odd lineup in the game at TJ power tane Murray both on the floor we got Anthony Robinson and isan Sharma two freshman good time to remind you ACC gymnastics Sunday afternoon top 25 match up with Stanford at pit coverage begins at 4 Eastern well that odd lineup just got shifted around Elijah Saunders back into the game for Virginia hes been terrific in this first half hes got a tough matchup against McFarland McFarland has the advantage on this end Saunders the advantage on the other Music end thats a great block out right there theyve been letting n Neely handled the ball in the last few minutes Roadie wide open in the corner and he hits it everybody getting in on the party in this first half and its a season High 41 points for Virginia in a half of basketball thats just great drb of penetration by your 68 240lb Applause forward and Boston College continues to be ice cold from three they are one of seven from deep pay a lot better going to the rim backto back baskets for the sophomore thats their first offensive rebound and their first point after an offensive rebound but again they get that drive into the basket 5 seconds for Applause Virginia and a foul on the floor well thats foul is called against Applause Music Applause Hastings thats his second foul in this first half he fouled out of the dke game just playing seven minutes well thats I can appreciate that thats some real aggressiveness there you play seven minutes you foul out but theres been so few fouls called in this game its still not a oneonone situation Roady Hees it never got a clean look heads to the locker room with Virginia in the drivers seat 4123 so youve got to do better than that youve got to get some turnover youve got to get some easier basket and that all starts on the defensive end of Applause course double team comes in on venning he was the bright spot for Boston College in the first half Beetle denies a screen kicks to the corner Deon Brown drills the three to start the second half and brown scored 20 points a game at UNBC and theyve been waiting for him to get rolling here in BC knocked it down right in front of the Boston College bench trying to jump start this second half day day aims no Applause Music Applause good Virginia stays in the manto man and its been very Applause effective hand draws the foul going Baseline against roie and Donald Han Jr very quiet first half well Virginia has done a really nice job keeping the ball away from him Donald H Jr only attempted two shots in the first half made one of them 90 free throw shooter he only went to the line twice of course he made them both now what another foul on the floor on Kofi he fouled venning that time and venning is just a load for him to handle in there Virginia only committed three fouls the entire first half they committed two in the first minute of the second half and I think thats because Boston College has been more aggressive on the offensive Applause end Beetle tried to get it in and another foul call and thats a foul that youre going to get called every single time youre behind somebody as McNeely was behind Brown and you reach around to try to get the ball thats going to be called a foul every single time Beetle aggressive take too much on it and thats something Boston College wasnt able to do very successfully in the first half and that has Drive the ball to the Applause basket Kofi sets the screen goes to the basket now trying to back down venning that wont work McNeely who was red hot in the first half picks up where he left off and now a chance for a threepoint play the oldfashioned way youre so worried about his ability to shoot the three that time they got out on him quickly and he just went right by first very good screen and he is able to I mean thats a heck of a move in there floater in the lane M mcney started the season well but this is the best hes looked in a while shooting himself out of the slump here at home already up to 15 points he draws plenty of attention from all the other teams and I thought the fact that Saunders got going so quickly tonight really helped free up mcneel Applause and speaking with Virginia head coach Ron Sanchez before the game he said thats what we need more of where both of them are on the same night instead of Saunders being on one night mcne being on the other theres Beetle again Beetle trying to force things that time he stepped out of bounds youre Boston College you dont need to force things you need to move the Applause ball venning bulldozing Day Day Ames whos in the air flying to the rim Ames is a guy who likes to take the ball to the basket as well and that time boy he draw a crowd and venning is a big big crowd to draw with 270 lb flying into 185 lb in as Applause the Sunday three womens basketball games for you right here on acc Network tips off at noon eastern time with Florida State in North Carolina then Boston College at Wake Forest and Virginia Tech at NC State you those were only the second and third free throws for Virginia Applause tonight not a lot of whist in that first half Denning never got control good defense by The Freshman Jacob Kofi a really good hustle that time by Dion Brown MCN wasnt able to control the ball because Brown was right there fighting for it Applause mcne on the ground rips it away from Dion Applause Brown deep fre mcne after making his first four threes hes missed his last two you know youre feeling it when you try one from there this is just too much dribbling the ball by Dion Brown and really nice hands by mcney then great hustle to tip the ball Applause back Chaz Kelly into the game its his 22nd birthday today junior from Houston Texas now McFarland into the paint lost the handle Falls to venning back to McFarland who triggers the three no good but an offensive rebound and an easy clean up for Deon Brown now we have not seen that tonight but thats an example of what Virginia has struggled with much of the year really good defense on the shot but then simply not able to get the defensive rebound foul called on the floor and your defense doesnt stop until you have the ball so that was really nice play by Virginia to force a tough shot but then BC converts on the offensive rebound third previous players under Applause review you see Donald Han Jr was shouting at the officials to take a look at this well Donald Han Jr reached in and the foul was called before Ros arm came up now the interesting thing is there was no call made on roie on that play So unless youre going to call flagrant foul I mean you cant change the call at this point and there certainly was contact there but but nothing flagrant nothing flagrant junor from the basketball game he comes up and you know he brings that elbow around well it was already going to be a tough mountain to climb for Boston College on the road trailing by nearly 20 but to do it without your your best player and your leading scorer well so they they called a foul on hand down there it was a non shooting foul and even though there was some contact between hand and roie after the foul they werent looking at that they went and they looked at that previous play and they called a flagrant two on Donald H Jr threw him out of the Applause game do you think what we saw the look that we got was definitive enough to eject tan junr for a flagrant 2 wow that that elbow came up and that looked intentional looked like he lined him up and hit him so I I I certainly think I certainly think that the officials could look at that and they could find uh they could find that that was enough now certainly Earl Grant would have a different opinion about that but certainly I think there was enough there they could have called a flagrant one but they decided and remember the difference between a flagrant 2 and a flagrant one flagrant one is excessive flagrant 2 is excessive and extreme and I think that met the definition a tough take that falls off the rim Roger SS blows the play dead and that foul is on Saunders and it looks like were going to review that believe it or not this play is under a view as well oh right there and thats thats why theyre reviewing that Elijah Saunders he gets his elbow he gets his forearm right into the face of Chaz Kelly and you have to say if you just ejected Donald Han Jr that looked very similar was an elbow it was intentional and it was high well I dont know that there was the violence there but certainly you could make the argument but how about how about Roger Ares getting on the a system and saying not just the play is under review but believe it or not this play is under review in the middle of your screen Saunders just shoves him Applause away so I think thats definitely a flagrant one and in this situation after they just threw somebody out of the game you have to be you have to be aware of that as after view white number two has been ejected for a flagrant two foul you go Boston colle will shoot two shots and get the ball Applause wow so weve had guys ejected on backtoback plays yeah Im wondering how much game time elaps between those two objections it couldnt have been very long not very much a few seconds so now its Boston College to shoot to and Elija Saunders whos been terrific Up Until That Elbow for Virginia is done for the rest of the night now Chaz Kelly on the season its interesting hes at the free throw line only a 59 free throw shooter Music normally but of course hes he went to the free thr line CU he was the guy who was F so only 49 seconds between ejections I dont know that Ive ever seen two ejections on separate plays 49 seconds apart for two yeah totally different totally unrelated Applause y Boston College down 17 without Donald Han Jr but Virginia without Elijah Saunders 11th turnover against the Eagles Virginia tried to give it right back to him and it hit Chaz Kelly it will stay cavalieres basketball this has been a very chaotic start to the second half has for a relatively quiet first half in terms of fouls yes or good Rhythm to the game particularly for Virginia that has all gone away in the first five minutes of this second half but this this first five minutes of the second half is more of what we expected you know two teams really going after one another but again Virginias ability to shoot the ball sort of deflated the Boston College defense but theyve come out here very strongly in the second half Virginia continues to capitalize on a strong pick and roll game Buchanan the flush there contested three no good and Buchanans there to get the rebound thats a tough shot wide openen look kofy cant Applause connect double team comes in on venning kicks it to the corner nobody was home again venning has played 18 games coming into this one and his his prior games he only has 11 assists so if youre going to double team the guy thats the guy to double team well Boston College has 12 made baskets and 12 turnovers its not usually a good recipe McNeely contested three no good long rebound Boston College trying to get something in transition perhaps theyve struggled in the half court set log venning had a mismatch on McNeely and a foul comes in and that foul is going to be on McNeely but when you miss a three like that youre going to get a long rebound and Boston College actually got four guys down the court quickly and a great job by venning to get down underneath the basket and create that problem for Virginia Applause tomorrow night on acc Network double header tips off with Syracuse at Clemson and then Florida State on the west coast taking on count if you have not seen Andre sto yakovich play the son of NBA great Pia sto yakovich he is a delight to watch play he plays for Cal well he really is hes I think hes one of the starovic that is is one of the best five players in this league Id agree with you I think two of the top five play on the west coast well Maxim Reno has certainly impressed from Applause Stanford with 18 teams theres a lot of players in the its hard to keep track shot clock down to seven see too much dribbling for Virginia here in this possession theyve had success moving players and moving the ball bothy he has to hoist it airball and a shot clock violation that possession never got off the ground this is a Virginia offense its not going to work if guys are just dribbling around well for all the good passing and Rhythm that Virginia had in the first half it feels like theyre out of rhythm in the second half and understandably so cuz the game had so many stoppages with the two Applause ejections Lefty hook no good for venning foul on the floor and Jay you said it after a first half where there were hardly any fouls called at all the fouls were just piling up now thats another reason why the game flowed up and down in the first half there werent very many fouls but to that point Virginia had 10 assists in the first half only one in the second half so far well they scored a lot more baskets thats true they only have two made baskets in seven minutes of basketball and yet they still control a 17point lead well their defense has remained very good Ro right to the rim for Applause two its going to be interesting with Saunders out of the game you probably see more of Kofi and Buchanan playing Music Applause together oh my that was almost quite crafty from Dion Brown spun his way free everything but the Applause finish and because Virginia is now playing the larger lineup Boston College is going with a couple of big guys Hastings is in the game along with Shonda Shonda 68 200 lb of freshman hadnt really played very much but they really like his potential Applause no starters in the game for Boston College right now all five of these players for the Eagles have come off the bench tonight pay the steal and the scoop to the hoop for two and that Boston College you know you do it with defense you get a turnover get an easy basket you dont have to play against that Seth Virginia Defense which has been very tough Applause tonight well Virginia has led since the beginning of this game they got up 14 to four and theyve led by 10 or more ever since thats why another easy make for isan Sharma just got way too much space for the Freshman man Sharma thats unusual for him he usually just shoots threes coming into the game 50 of his 57 field goal attemps were from three he doesnt Shoot Many twos Chaz Kelly lets it fly from Deep thats off the mark Applause Bon College really trying to turn up the defensive Applause intensity good contested shot there for Boston College theyve done it on possessions like that but they failed to string them together with enough consistency to tonight can they do that in the remaining 11 minutes jump ball is the call possession arrow with Virginia and the Cavaliers still well in control a 19 point with you Virginia has opened up a 5334 lead although even though which is one point more than they had at halftime even though its been a very uneven second half for the Cavaliers in the first half they shot 55 in this half 33 in the first first half they made nine threes so far in this half we played almost halfway through they havent made a three and I suppose all that matters is the scoreboard and said thats all that matters theyve added to their lead but theyve done it in a less comfortable way well youre not going to play perfect basketball for 40 minutes and if you can struggle a little bit and still extend your lead thats a real credit to your defense Ro contested take gets his own Miss fresh shot clock thats five offensive rebounds in the game for Virginia and theyre usually not a very good offensive rebound great pass and T Murray easy finish through the back door again thats what we saw in the first half of Virginia really good movement without the ball and this is actually the Cavaliers largest lead of the Music night good look knocked down by Fred pay Fred paint is a freshman that they really like they think hes going to be a very very good player very athletic enthusiastic strongly built thats the thing about both of these teams you look at the roster and there are a lot of underclassmen with a ton of talent and you just hope that they stay in the program and these coaches get the opportunity to develop them but in todays landscape you just never know well thats thats part of the problem for coaches you just never know of your players whos going to come back this is just a really good pass Chaz Kelly lost track of tane Murray you know one thing you have to do is know where your guy is and continuing with that thought about you just dont know what youre going to have from year to year I enjoyed our conversation with Boston College head coach Earl Grant whos in year number four is head coach for the Eagles he said I used to love year four in a program because year four is really where you take off he goes now it feels like every year is year one well and you have to really sympathize with him because Boston College like a lot of teams they lost most of their guys that guys who were coming back you know are now playing at other schools and so here you have a 20 win season you think okay if we get everybody after back we have a chance to really take a step forward and you lose your guys and thats why going into next season hes placing a premium on retention you know if youre going to go out and have to pay players pay the ones you know and not players that are in other programs the Virginia Defense continues to be suffocating in this second half really tough for Boston College to get good looks at the basket for the most part Virginias defense has done a nice job keeping ball at Boston College out of the lane with the dribble Buchanan fouled I think Blake Buchanan has provided a big boost for the Cavaliers tonight I think so too and that was going to be a very tough catch McNeely trying to lay it off but Buchanan was in a crowd he was fortunate to keep the ball can its six points tonight all of them have come in a screen and roll game hes got six rebounds to go along with it misses the front end of a one andone chases down the rebound and keeps it alive thats the first oneonone opportunity weve had for either team in this game Virginia just quicker to the ball tonight M for three got it Isaac mcney buries another one thats his fifth of the night and that was one of the toughest ones hes had all game that was not bad defense by Boston Applause College trying to answer KY Shonda with a three speaking with the Eagles coaching staff they like the 68 stretch four says he can shoot it but can he make it true you can shoot it anybody can shoot it no Im Im joking of course they really like his skill set that time that was very odd Boston College they allowed themselves to be blocked out easily nobody going to the offensive Applause fors Murray there to clean up the spill Anthony Robinson rocks the rim and thats a great play by Murray once he got past his man outside all he had to do was get it over the outstretched hand inside if that ball goes off the backboard its an easy basket nice job by Applause Murray Banning been quiet in this second half but fights his way and muscles it in and Robinson has gotten some more minutes here in the second half after Saunders was ejected and hes done a nice job battling against Applause Music Applause venny the mcneels made five threes tonight six isic mcrey there he is the Cavalier fans have missed him we talked about Virginia after last time out they hadnt made any threes in the second half well they changed that theres another DC turnover Murray been aggressive on the drive threw it away that Applause time counted plus the foul but it is all Virginia Isaac mcney six of Virginias 11 made threes only the third time this season Virginia has made more than 10 threes in a Music game so has two of Virginias nine Applause steals now if youre Virginia youre 6 minutes and 26 seconds away from probably the closest thing to a complete Game a full 40 minutes that theyve had under Ron Sanchez this season well its certainly a game where all their elements have worked theyve made threes which is what they have to do they havent given up too many points off turnovers or second chance Applause points and the other thing their defense they have forced 14 turnovers we mentioned they have nine steals couple of blocked shots so their defense has been outstanding but it really their offense that got rolling tonight it was mcne who set the tone with that early three and it helps that he made five more of them but I agree with you Dan consistent team effort on the defensive end tonight L pain snakes free hits the three Fred Payne has been the bright spot for Boston College in this second Applause half 15 points for pay to lead all Applause Eagles now pay is an effort guy who can make a three now what Ron Sanchez wants a timeout despite what has been a comfortable score line shot clock down to two The Freshman didnt have his eyes on the timer he did draw a foul before the shot clock buzzer sounded I think he did have his eyes on the timer and Im not sure whether that was a pass or a shot and the question for the officials now is did that foul occur before the shot clock buzzer and theyre going to have to look at that and Im not sure that it Applause did previous players under riew for a timing issue and thats the timing issue when did the foul occur isan charma sorry for the inconvenience Two Shots okay that was a Applause quick its not even close I mean it was two seconds on the clock when the uh the file occurred well charma is doing some things that he hadnt done all year hes attempted four twopoint field goals in this game Jay and coming into this game its seven all year twopoint field goals attempted and that was only free throw number seven and eight for him on the season so hes been shooting twos and driving the ball to the basket good for him so seven attempts through 18 games and four and one there you Applause Music go Kelly draws the foul on the floor but Boston College in the bonus so hell shoot one and one one of the few times in this game that Boston College has been able to get one of their guards pass the defender out on the Music Applause Music perimeter Thursday at 10 Eastern right here on acc Network after our womens basketball double header the nothing but neet crew will have you covered tell you everything you need to know in the world of ACC womens Hoops weve got you covered all season right here on acc Network now we werent sure how Virginia was going to manage after Elijah Saunders was ejected earlier in this second half but theyve fared pretty well theyve kept this game in control good pass to TJ power he can knock down the shot and thats been a problem for power all year long he just hasnt been able to convert from three and thats where he helps the team the Applause most now speaking of Elijah Saunders hes really the one that got the Cavaliers started he scored inside early made a three early and theres venning he has played very well early in the game but the Cavaliers have contained him fairly well since a flurry in the opening Applause moments power Tangled Up and he lost it stolen away and its pain the steal and the score well that ball just got knocked right out of powers hands just you know not strong enough to hang on to him 17 points for pay which leads Boston College Applause tonight power tangled up with Jaden Hastings we step aside Virginia 3 minutes and 39 seconds away from snapping their five game losing streak here in Charlottesville Dan boner Jay alter 3 minutes and 39 seconds remaining in this one and Dan for Virginia they have dominated the extra possession points well and the extra possession of course a turnover is an extra possession for the team one team and second chance points that comes off an offensive rebound and look at that in their five game losing streak minus 50 tonight plus five and of course when you get that plus five an extra possession point point and youre making a lot of Threes thats a pretty good formula do you think for Virginia if theyre moving forward even if they could keep that even it would serve them well you just cant be minus 27 well no theres no question about that you they have to survive with those kinds of we said before the game they had to survive inside thats like the second chance points and then they have to protect the basketball and so if you do those things then you have a chance particularly if youre shooting the ball well you can play with about anybody Big Time Jam Anthony Robinson rocks the rim for a second time tonight and he has played pretty Applause well now the young bigs I you know Kofi Buchanan and Robinson have been very impressive tonight and Robinson with a few more opportunities because Saunders got thrown out of the game Dion Brown didnt know where he was then looked up and he was under the basket well I think he knew where he was all along again he was a big time scorer at UNBC but of course playing at Boston College is a step up and sometimes it takes those guys a while to adjust Canon draws a Applause foul this is just a play where venning is forced to come and help out and Robinson does a really nice job stepping to the open a if he stays out there on the elbow then nothing happens but he recognizes that his man venning is going to help and he finds the open spot nice play Virginia up over 70 points tonight that used to be you know the magic number they are 171 and 11 with scoring 70 or more points you know obviously a lot of that under Tony Bennett Applause I remember also what we said during their fivegame losing streak their defense was given up 74 points a game and we still have two minutes to go but theyve only given up 52 they have been great on both sides of the ball for most of the night and thats a good sign for Boston colle that brown has been so aggressive and successfully aggressive on the offensive end the suits Donald Han Jr has gone out both Fred Payne and Deon Brown have had the ball in their hands a lot more and theyve done a lot with it on the offensive end BCs actually scored seven of their last nine baskets they just cant get a stop on the other Applause Music end well Robinson that time was out of bounds and the mistake that he made there was trying to throw the ball back he comes down and if he goes right back up of course doesnt help if youre out of Applause bounds Brown tried to throw it away and inste he found a cavalier here and Day Day Ames throws it down thats actually his first basket of the Applause game so Virginia has not only made threes they have had a couple of dunks tonight and a block from Robinson everything going the way the Cavaliers on a Tuesday night here at home in a get well game after a five game losing streak they have red the ship in convincing Applause fashion I guess now the question becomes how do you build on this strong performance of youre Virginia well you get one strong performance and then of course you got to be consistent you got to try for another one thatll count and one opportunity for Jaden Hastings but the way you build on it is you protect the basketball you dont turn it over you dont give up offensive rebounds to your opponents and you make threes that has to be the formula for Virginia also it helps if they dont get guys thrown out of the game but they lost Elijah Saunders but managed pretty well without him but Boston College lost Donald ham Jr Applause Ron Sanchez instructing his team to just dribble out the final 13 seconds 74 points on the scoreboard that is the most points scored this season by Virginia Applause Music a good start for the Cavaliers they got up 14 to four and kept their foot on the gas a 7456 win for Ron Sanchez of the Virginia Cavaliers
