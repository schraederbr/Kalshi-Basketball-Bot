Saturday and snapped a fourgame losing skid But tonight they are facing the Tarheelss here at Chapel Hill And great to have you with us tonight as we are underway Syracuse will take the first shot A lot for Syracuse is how they start this game versus Notre Dame They started the ball moved around They had energy Everybody was involved defensively Thats what allowed them to get off to a great start David George the point guard out to the logo coming off a very strong game 10 assists but he will misfire immediately High rebound tap to Carolina And here they come Dixon Derek Dixon the freshman just recently inserted into the starting lineup And a kid from Virginia has cheering made a profound difference He will swing it Heres Treble on the attack Thats what he does Slashing inside cheering gathers his own miss looking for help tripled up out for Young who will lift and off the back of the iron and tipped out of play to Syracuse Lot for North Carolina stems from them trying to get the ball to the rim In their last game they were eight of 31 from the threepoint line versus Georgia Tech And one of the priorities for Huba Davis is to get multiple touches down low on the block Dominate them by playing inside out Donnie Freeman leading the Orange in scoring 18 points a game He did not start the game over the weekend for the first time this year Held to just seven points Out for Kings who had 28 He had a game over the weekend against Notre Dame He kicks it out for Starling the 64 senior Hell pull up and pop and knock it down A lot for Syracuse is getting to their spots on the court as we look at North Carolina starting five Derek Dixon Jaden Young Seth Trimble Caleb Wilson Henry Vasar as well Guy that can stretch out the floor A great feed to Wilson will slam it down Thats what their bigs are so good at doing Both guys are intentional passers and have great vision and can read and react So much goes through those two Wilson and Bessar as they combine for 37 points a game Like 44 of North Carolina scoring Cams trying to answer over the top Its tapped right back to him He gets a short one that wont fall His rebound slotted away Besar got a hand on it cheering Thatll trigger the break for North Carolina coming in number 14 Besar Yep Its Wilson He gets position and lays it in cheering applause Now the McDonalds AllAmerican who went home to Atlanta last Saturday and dropped in 22 along with six rebounds and five assists He has had a spectacular freshman season Itll be his only one at North Carolina Hand it off to Star trying to drive and a reach in and a foul with 1731 to go here in the first half You know so much of the priority for North Carolina is getting the ball down low Caleb Wilson doing a really good job of sealing his man Vesar good job turning and facing This is that little pick and roll they do What a luxury to have two bigs that can bring the bigs on the perimeter and play that high low basketball style Speaking of bigs when Carolina came out right before the pregame introductions you pointed something out that Caleb Wilson led them out Well traditionally guards are the ones that lead their teams out on the floor before the game starts but Kale Wilson is the leader of this team He was leading the team out He was the most vocal person today in shootound He was the one the freshman was directing everybody where to be for scattering report Great save there and the deflection by Vesar and thatll go the other way cheering And that foul will go against North Carolina And theyre going to get Caleb Wilson for his first Well the first Duke showdown coming up on Saturday here at the Smith Center at 630 on ESPN Tar Hills also go to Miami and they have Clemson coming up on March 3rd cheering As far as the games really circle on their schedule a collision at Big Court as Starling went backwards out of bounds No foul called on this Yeah No thats no foul on that Coming off shoulder to shoulder Jay Young bumping shoulders The body of William Kyle the third knock JJ out of the way That is a grown man body Ill tell you that Freeman will launch from the wing Cant knock down the triple Syracuse not a great threepoint shooting team 34 but they can get hot They hit 10 of them this weekend They had 11 against Illinois State Nixon Wilson back to the guard Got a really good look but couldnt hit it And Syracuse was the only ACC school who returned their top two scores from last year going to turn that over on their second turnover But that has not really translated Jay yet into a return to glory for Red Autry in the Orange Yeah JJ Stland was a guy last year that averaged 22 points per game uh in his last two games against North Carolina as well and trying to find his footing offensively You know one of the things for North Carolina to do in this game Donnie Freeman is the leading scoreer for Syracuse He is guarding Caleb Wilson They should make it a priority to get Kell Wilson the ball Thats how you attack the other teams best score You attack them on the defensive end Stevenson is open Rebound tip control by the Orange Syracuse also a very tough stretch beginning tonight at Carolina Then at Virginia they still got SMU and Duke to call Turn around Just dont love that possession Youre right Nobody came down The ball didnt have any energy and no other players were involved It was come down isolation shot early in the shot clock George with the foul on the arm Both times a little chilly shooting the ball so far Molly McGrath joining us in just a moment talking about this weekend that is right around the corner for Carolina and Duke All right sound makes boys free tshirt tshirt cheering Heat Heat Well always a gigantic tip off Its coming up on Saturday at 630 Number four Duke and number 14 North Carolina And just maybe an idea that thats what everyones talking about Molly McGrath great to have you with us here on Big Monday But you were basically polling the student section today and I know exactly whats on their mind Yeah OB I brave the student section They all agreed that thats the game that they have their eye on One fan I spoke with said thats all theyre thinking about tonight He said this game is kind of just a warmup for the Duke game but looking ahead has really hurt UNCC in the past They have struggled in the game before the game in recent years And star Caleb Wilson admitted this week feels different He said its more exciting But he pointed to their leadership core himself Seth Trimble Henry Vasar and said Theyre keeping this team focused And coach Hubert Daviss message to his team is simple Gus is worthy of our full attention Well they need it tonight But six on the board and Caleb Wilson the guy getting it all done so far Whoever started this narrative that Caleb Wilson cant shoot the ball from the outside I dont know what the hell theyre talking about I mean that thing looks smooth It comes off the hand the right way and this is the type of activity on both sides of the ball that make him so elite Now that would have been I mean the roof would have come off if he had gotten that pass through after the double deflections and the theft on the other end of the floor and most players when theres a hesitation with shooting the ball You can tell there was no hesitation there That is sheer confidence That thing is smooth Now as Molly talked about North Carolina being one and five in the games leading them to Dupers North Carolina the thing thats really hard about when you play in that rivalry is having veteran players on your team who have played in that rivalry before That helped me a lot my freshman year The only veteran whos played in this rivalry before is Seth Trimble and uh you know hes going to have to get his lieutenants ready for battle in a game where just the thickness in the air is quite different than any other game they ever experience Top lean and shot there by George wont go Meanwhile Syracuse is on the table tonight Dixon with a pull up pop Nice strike there to bury a three He hits 41 out there applause So Carolina grabbing the early 92 advantage Syracuse was talking during their workout today They have to make some early shots because this this game is the kind of thing that could get out of hand pretty quickly if theyre not careful especially if North Carolina starts knocking down shots from the outside Derek Dixon a guy that has the starting lineup role here with this team struggled a little bit as of late especially in his road games playing out west Which leads me to a different point will be can we use one style of basketball in every conference You know are you playing with a Nike solution ball Youre playing with an Adidas ball one school Its just one of my pet peeves as a shooter The way the ball spins off the backboard the English is different when the ball gets wet The way you can shoot it is different There should be one basketball for the ACC or one basketball for the SEC or the Big 10 And that is it Youre here Second shot here for Kyle the third What an interesting looking corkcrew shot Well he only makes 50 at the line So you can see why And thats a huge issue for Syracuse Theyre the worst foul shooting team in the ACC at the bottom at 63 Basar getting up there but a miss again coming in averaging 17 and nine George ping the deck Syracuse stuck at two points coming up on six minutes into this contest Freeman nice touch there as he buries it North Carolina is switching a lot of the action Thats where Donnie Freemans going to have a huge advantage being 69 to shoot over the top of the smaller Seth trimmer Again SUs top score came off the bench just seven points on Saturday Everybody said he handled it well He was not hurt It was a strategic decision Bogots on the drive and no one picked him up He lays it in Luca Bogots 66 junior from Montenegro cheering cheering Freeman gives off to the point guard 63 junior from Toronto cheering Freeman again one of the most reliable shooters period Popped it up No whistle Thought he had a foul in transition Trimble on the attack Its blocked from behind and a good stop by Freeman So 1310 left in the first half at Chapel Hill I dont know what to say here other just to watch it Whoa How do you get to that point shooting foul shots Its a serious question I mean I I I dont know how to answer it I um you know look Ive Ive seen some unorthodox shooting forms before but Ive never seen something where the ball kind of has a solid word spin to it Deflected by Tyler Betsy and a whistle stops the clock And the foul will go on Luca Bogots Thatll be his first And coming up next were going to send you out to Lick on ESPN and the ESPN app Darren Peterson maybe the best player in America and number 11 Kansas taking on JT Toppen another whos been spectacular and number 13 Texas Tech If Darren Peterson were healthy I think he would be the national player of the year Guys only played 11 out of 21 games but I think the national player of the year is Cameron Boozer right now just for the style in which he plays But theres no doubt about it After that last battle we were just in launch for game day And it was Darren Peterson versus AJ Debons Even though Peterson didnt play the second half his 18 points cemented him as the first pick in the 2026 NBA draft Hey Donnie Freeman starting to get going a little bit here for the Orange as they cut it to 11 to six Trimble again undaunted down the lane Thats his game He is coming at you 110 you know when he broke his left forearm in a freak weight lifting accident when he came back he was so cautious as a driver And this is the next iteration of who Seth Trimble is Hes a guy that is aggressive attacks the rim and I think by him attacking the rim it has allowed other players to really find their shot selection because it forces the defense to collapse coming in averaging 15 a game The senior from Wisconsin had a solid game Saturday against Georgia Tech with 18 points He was out for 42 days with that broken arm Sed against Kansas in a game in early November Came back to hit a couple of giant threes in the win against top 25 Virginia and he had 16 in that game without a turnover And hes huge in this attack for the Tar Hills Yeah hyper efficient last two games 36 points on 20 shot attempts How about a guy thats been here for multiple years and hasnt just jumped in the third quarter to get more money other places Hes fought through Sadique White into the game 69 freshman Syracuse of good size The lean in the back shot That wont go but a whistle Cayenne Anthony the 66 freshman getting into the fray and he draws the foul Anthony SUs top recruit this season the son of Syracuse legend Carmelo Anthony Just love him sneaking the ball screen and going back into the defender utilizing that taller frame Good concentration there Thats how he should be He should be getting to the free throw line at least eight to nine times a game But the way hes able to attack off the dribble and he has a deadly jump shot so he can throw people off to a pace Syracuse loves his mentality So even Keel plays the game very calmly Number 36 overall recruit in the SC next 100 and those sons of great players been around a lot of great teams and great athletes kind of tend to be that way Well I think hes seen it all Seen it all Right By the way when you see it with your dad every single day in workouts youve seen it all So a 128 lead for North Carolina and the ball Carolina does a good job hanging on the basketball Only 10 turnovers a game for Hubert Daviss team A great hedge there by Donnie Freeman to get out on both the shooter The shot up the air ball knocked away So the Orange with an opportunity to cut this lead Betsy who hits the threes gets it downstairs They want Freeman to touch it again laughter cheering Betsy off the fake Freeman from the corner and a whistle along the baseline with about 11 and a half to go here The first half Low scoring so far Boats will pick up the foul A lot of respect for all of those banners upstairs That goes for Jay Will as well here at the Smith Center More in a moment The worlds hero of the game fire marshal has been in for the last seven years leading the fire safety section with environmental health and safety here in Carolina His team provides fire safety expertise conducts

students as well as outside fire police department has made the EHS fire safety a strong and reliable source for all of us here at Carolina Please welcome tonights window world hero of the game joined

exclusive part of the One more time Thank you ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Target where wellness is perfectly picked for you Jay Will is spectacular talent his own right in the ACC looking up at those banners before the game Michael Jordan Bill Ford Vince Carter James Worthy Billy Cunningham It goes on and on here at Chapel Hill As a young kid I had dreams of coming to North Carolina I would come here and play in the Bob Given basketball tournament and just stare in awe at some of the names that you see up there And obviously you know Michael Jordan stands out Antoine Jameson cheering James Worthy but Phil Ford was a name that always stood out to me for you know alltime leading scoreer here at North Carolina until Tyler broke that record you know 99 and 24 in his time here and took North Carolina to the 1977 national championship game But the amount of legends that have stepped foot on this court is just overwhelming with greatness Edwards with the foul to put Freeman at the line Was that weird for you to hear me say that I wanted to come here as a player No I knew the story and I knew the regard that you held North Carolina basketball in Mr Cup check right there at midcourt 1976 ACC player of the year I mean the talent on display here over the decades is mindboggling Just mindboggling And the Syracuse kids when they came in last night to shoot around here and loosen up a little bit They were all looking up in the rockers Nice little play there to get it downstairs to Basar too applause They were taking it in too Not that they necessarily knew every name up there Well Red told us that they didnt know a lot of the names up there other than Michael Jordan Michael obviously stands out off the back of the iron by Anthony That wont fall cheering I mean you got to give me James Worthy Thats a gimme isnt it And a whistle off the ball with 1046 to go in the half A lot for North Carolina has to do with their high low action there Good job by Versar sealing his man off and finishing on the opposite side of the rim using that rim for protection You think about if this young man were still playing at Arizona where he played last year he led them in plus minus and hes so effective and efficient on the court Just always having impact on the game Is great right now Theyll roll it to him and hell take the hit applause He can do a lot of things He can hit the threepointer too Hes 26 out there Yeah Two two bigs on the court that both can spread the court do it in the open court but you can invert that screen and roll because of their passing abilities and both of their shooting abilities frankly Hes coming off 20 points 12 rebounds against Georgia Tech on Saturday Drops in number one His mom was a professional table tennis player which is timely because I knew you were dying to see Marty Supreme at some point I mean you put me on game during the break I have to be honest with you the fact that you know the name of that movie right Well its culturally impressive Pretty popular Im a big shallow fan Nominated for the Academy Award and Off the Iron I heard youre a big basketball fan as well Did you happen to play a little bit in your Dave back during the Syracuse days Not obviously I I played you know pickup games and stuff like that very badly Nice reverse there wont go for Anthony but called a lot of games as a student on WER radio at Syracuse University the best communication school in the country As my wonderful friend Shawn Mcdana says the Harvard of Central New York Hes right on the money Wilson going in strong and hell draw the cheering foul applause Well I would love to look at some evidence from your playing days Look at this right here Oh I did not know that Who is that guy Thats the great Mike Trico right there Wow Okay we got music a couple other Look look at Who is that guy Thats me And thats the guy who never saw the ball because all Trico did was shoot What a hairstyle How music would you categorize that It looks very different now Very 1984 I would say That was very much in vogue back then In vogue In vogue for about five minutes applause Yeah And you know its still its still its still its slightly similar a little bit you know somewhat but it it has some product in it now Just a little bit laughter Wilson swishes that one and he has eight points Theyll be your man of many talents right And of little heights and a timeout applause and cheering because they could not get it in North Carolina with some stout defense So well take the break about halfway through the first half of Chapel Hill North Carolina by seven What a head of hair Welcome back to Chapel Hill Now before the game UNCC star Caleb Wilson stopped to sign a shirt for a fan And you have to see the excitement on the kids face afterwards And coach Hubert Davis raved about who Wilson is as a person saying he loves how invested he is in this program and this community And Wilson told us I knew there was a high probability Id be a oneanddone So I wanted to have a legendary status where people remember me when Im gone That was my whole thing I want to have a lasting impact relate to the community So I always try to do things with the fans to let them know that I support them the same way they support me OB Well that young man as you mentioned Molly made his month applause maybe his year to get that jersey signed from his idol Caleb Wilson Well Hubert Davis told us during practice today that his team had a lot of nice guys on it Ill tell you one Caleb Wilson is not a nice guy He is a competitor He is fierce I said this during the open He reminds me of a young Kevin Garnett Kevin Garnett was one of the most competitive people and he found a way to get himself to an angry place so he could compete each and every night and that is the type of energy that this young man plays with Hell kick into the corner for another three that wont drop and the foul will go on North Carolina and the swap by Jonathan Powell is first Now Huber was saying you know I got a lot of nice guys on the team I need a couple of them and he wasnt talking about Caleb He said a couple of them to be a jerk for about two hours Thats all Little bit of a jerk Theres nothing wrong with being a jerk by the way I mean uh some of the best and most competitive players in the world were those guys Michael Jordan was that Isaiah Thomas was that Kobe Bryant was that LeBron James at times can be that I mean thats the competitive edge that you need to get the best out of yourself when you talk about playing 40 50 games throughout the course of a regular season Youre not talking about being a dirty player Youre not talking about treating fans poorly or the media badly But youre nice You called them jerks We would call them something else but this is rated PG We have to be very clean here Yes 934 to go But I think your point is well taken Freeman at the line 79 cheering Had some big games 27 against Georgia Tech 25 against Florida State 172 And you know what I remember your playing days I mean you played with that edge that I would say you know in the parlance of of Hubert thats a bit of a jerk on the floor Well just cuz I wanted to be the best and coach K was great As you cheering watch Basar knock down a three We have talked about his ability to extend applause the defense knocking down that shot which opens up lanes for Wilson and Trimble to drive But if youre not competing dont be on the court Kobe Its its that plain and simple And I think in todays age with NIL you know some kids can become fat cats They get money early They dont want to compete They think the thing is supposed to be given to them And nothing in this life is given cheering buries that three and North Carolina opens up their biggest lead so far Time out on the court 232 the Tarheelss Well we said North Carolina came music off their last game shooting eight of 31 from the threepoint line How many steps did he take Goodness gracious But its good Count it Race race North Carolina up on Syracuse 2312 here in the first half This is called the moonwalk but doing it the reverse way 1 2 3 four man That is James Harden 20 Remind me And that was another one Well they got that one Thats a cheering travel against Syracuse and to five times That was by any stretch of the imagination Im ready to give a good going to break highlight OB and I just see eight steps right Well theyll miss one every once in a while inside cheering What a slam Thatll make a difference since he came off the bench And this is an eight nothing run And this is a danger zone for Syracuse And 8 and 12 minutes to go in the half cheering Kyle up top Hands off for Freeman up against Face Off The onehander and hes the one guy getting it done right now His 10 They worked a ton in shoot around on snaking those screens coming back into the defender keeping him on your back for a little midrange shot Dixon intended for Wilson to take it away Kings who has been very quiet coming off 28 this weekend and thatll go against Syracuse with 757 to go Not a lot going their way right now Thats on Kyle his second Well if you take your eyes off the defender right there a little jab step and a strong finish by Pal North Carolina up going into the last part of the first half Dont smile Lets see Dont smile cheering cheering Im sorry cheering cheering applause and cheering What the heck is that cheering Now back on Roy Williams court and Thursday night we have another ESPN play for K womens basketball double header number 17 Duke squaring off against number six Louisville Thats at seven Then fourth ranked Texas hosting number five LSU Both available like everything else on the ESPN app And the Hall of Famer himself in the stands has got a rousing ovation Roy Williams Just one of the alltime best coaches to ever coach the game A threetime national champion Has coached so many greats And the thing I love about Roy Roy is never afraid Obie to speak his mind on a lot of issues And uh he lets the cheering world know how he feels constantly And I respect the heck out of Roy Williams as a coach and as a human being Theres a lot of chatter here Chapel Hill whether to renovate this building which has been around over four decades at Smith Center or build a new one Id like to see this place renovated They saw the baseline Hes had a really good first half Mustling his way inside Couldnt finish it though Syracuse has to find a way to get some point reduction from somebody other than Donnie Freeman who has 10 of the teams 14 points And that was one right there Great job by George slamming on the brakes He knocks back his first basket So in dire need of a run here in these last seven minutes How about that tremendous move off the window after the crossover the play of the game so far Seth Trimble just attacking doing exactly what Huber Davis wants him to do 247 attack mode George pulls up from three Got it Syracuse a team that can get those going doesnt happen that often but they do tend to get them in bunches 2719 They showed that when they beat Tennessee the game came down to the wire versus Houston This team has the talent to compete Its a matter of them putting together all the pieces Two very impressive wins tough losses too Boston College the host That was clean and Freeman comes away with it Nathan George the point guard with Georgia Tech sitting here looking at the stat sheet Caleb Wilson is plus 14 in his time on the court thus far Are you kidding me Plus 14 George takes the hit Hes off to the line Sele right there You try to jump back on towards that screen and that is an NBA like shot Woo You go this way I go that way And the softness off the glass Saw my partner do that once or twice 607 to go in the first half George with another one coming Hes 80 at the line Now I can barely jump over a penny Stevenson back on You cant jump over penny anymore make him Thats Im just getting old now Thats a problem I dont know whats happening George the junior from Toronto One of two The rebound deflected to Powell So Syracuse has made a mini run here to pull within seven On the bounce its Wilson Hes been a little quiet the last five or six minutes Hes going to turn and fire Rebound tipped Stevenson just beat everybody and a missing close Thats where you like to see Jiren Stevenson be more active getting offensive rebounds doing a lot more of that dirty work Its a guy that can obviously extend the floor from a shooting perspective but you like when hes aggressive down low on the block Some kick ball and theyre going to say off at George who tried to make a move there Thats his seventh turnover I really think Stephvenson is one of those additive pieces that can really help North Carolina explode to the next level You see what Caleb Wilson could bring to the table You see what Henry Vesar could bring to the table But this guy last year played for Alabama and he was knocking down threes He was an exciting player to watch And him trying to find his rhythm with the other players on the floor I think could take this team to the next level Averaging about seven points a game for Hubert Davis Hes got it now Wilson with another touch Wow Spinning to the cheering baseline and whistle Bert Smith calling a foul Well coming into play tonight in the ACC Duke remains number one and undefeated in conference play as they get ready for North Carolina coming up on Saturday on ESPN As weve said though do not sleep on the Clemson Tigers at 8 and one I mean Brad Barnell just does it each and every year They just win a lot of games They do it collectively as one unit Obviously applause RJ Godfrey is a really talented player but they do it one as a whole And then you think about a team like UVA and Tess the Ritter one of the top players in this league as well An older team that doesnt play UVA style basketball They actually love pace and they play with a lot of adrenaline and they can knock down threes from a long distance And in North Carolina right there as well NC State playing better lately as they are seven and two in the league Good things happening in Miami too CC has been a tough lead George has the last six points for Syracuse but Freeman ends that with a rainbow shot He has 13 in of the first half And just poor communication right there between Stevenson and Wilson Both going with the roller and not staying home with the shooter Dixon will swing it Stevensons open Burries it A triple cheering applause 3223 cheering George to Freeman Moments ago hit a long distance shot Trying to get closer this time And Molly McGrath he has an array of moves offensively Theres no doubting that He is 15 Yeah hes really getting their offense going and he told us he found out the day before the Notre Dame game that he was coming off the bench for that contest and admitted this last week has been really hard on his confidence because he couldnt get into a rhythm when he came off the bench And he stressed he wanted to get that confidence back tonight through defensive hustle plays A steal a block taking a charge anything to make an impact on the game keep that momentum rolling So hes playing to get his confidence back Kings wriggles free underneath and drops in two And the first basket for Nate Kings a senior 28 against Notre Dame this weekend But that has tightened this thing up 3227 to getting a little bit restless here at Chapel Hill Dixon on the drive and dish underneath Stevenson cheering to finish it applause Tell you Donnie Freeman reminds me a little bit of AJ Debons is able to get himself to certain positions on the floor where he can score over smaller guards Syracuse has hit their last six shots up in for Sari but a nice dish 3 minutes before the break Theyre seven for seven the 69 product from Guinea transfer from Georgia Tech Tell you both teams are really gassed right now Ive seen multiple players pulling on their jersey to get out of the game But these are the type of moments that define teams You got to play through this Wilson again in the painted area and a foul again as hes headed to the strike applause So weve got a timeout 242 to go at Chapel Hill Syracuse making a run Yubra Davis looking for a big win right in front of the Duke game on Saturday Thank you snorts L I A C A R O L I A R I A R O L I A C A R O A R O Down to five Well North Carolina has led by as many as 13 but Syracuse has cut this to five And itll be Caleb Wilson at the line where he makes 70 McDonalds AllAmerican now Certainly looking like a first team collegiate allAmerican and maybe a lot more honors than that A lot of mock draft sites have him slated to be top five I I truly think if you were to compare him and Cameron Boozer Cameron Boozer has a higher floor but I think the ceiling for Carrick Wilson is higher overall Syracuse breaking the pressure Tough leader that wont fall for White North Carolina hustling back defensively Great contest by Vasar there just going up vertical Bogots out of the lane for the long jumper got it from the corner Treble on the money Six points for him in the first half And it seems like every time the Orange make a run the Tarheelss have an answer Kyle handing it off Heres Betsy from the lane Kyle would have kept his dribble He had a free lane right to the rim George penetrating slipped a little bit almost lost it Shot clock down to one Its expiring They never get it off cheering applause Turned it over eight times here Red Audreys team Nate George driving into those trees Having the athleticism of Caleb Wilson breathing on your neck and Basar down there with that long wingspan waiting to contest your shot just really deters you from getting close to the rim Freeman had been out for a quick breather and Aubrey bringing it back in Meanwhile Wilson with it Another impressive first half for North Carolina He comes up to set the screen Dixon inside cheering and one applause Boy the freshman great command of the body to make that shot They open it up 4029 And this is what I was talking about You you come off this play here a little DHO He had that lane to the rim He didnt take it Paul reverses Here comes another ball screen And Doris finds himself in the lane but theres just nowhere to go with that defense from Wilson His ability to slide his feet on the perimeter makes him such a utility player And not only can he block shots down low not only is he disciplined on the block but also you can switch with him on the perimeter late in the possession And that is a monumental attribute to have for a player his size Dixon completing the threepoint play Kings with the foul cheering And approaching the final minute before halftime at Chapel Hill Beside swaps that one away Triggers to Wilson on the spin Waits cheering and on the reverse Lays it in cheering So North Carolina getting real comfortable again before halftime Theyve been doing it with defense cheering applause Shot clock violation last time down for Syracuse Its down to five now on the baseline The jumper wont go for Kyle A 5second differential between the game clock and the shot clock And Hubert Davis will burn a timeout here with 28 12 seconds before halftime Are you kidding me Caleb Wilson Great hands by Vasar right there Freeman was looking opposite Basar with the hands losing the dribble having a spin move keeping his pivot foot planted and finishing on the left side of the rim Look at that Look at that You know how hard that is to keep that right pivot foot planted and not let your momentum take you and drag that for a travel The balance that Kale Wilson has with the footwork shows you continuously why hes going to be a superstar in the game of basketball Is 13 points here in the first half on his way to another 20 points or more here tonight At the moment is 20 points per game average or a North Carolina freshman record Thats great anywhere here that is really saying something in this building You know when I think about the top five players coming up for the 2026 NBA draft I obviously start with Darren Peterson AJ Debansa Cameron Boozer Caleb Wilson and then probably fifth I would throw in Kingston Flemings You know a guy playing for Houston right now and you know hes a dynamic guard that could do it in a variety of different ways But you know going through the own my own mock draft I have 12 freshman being taken in the first 12 picks of the NBA draft Are you kidding me Amazing Amazing Shot clock down to five Basar will kick for the corner and a long jumper on the money by Powell He hits the three Time to get off a heave here for Freeman He gets it up in time and he banged it in and itll count and needed that So Freeman its every season he has been at the helm for Syracuse and a loss tonight would leave them at 13 and 10 and two under 500 in league play Had a quick start for Kevin Wilson his first touch of the second half Syracuse going to that zone the way you beat the zone is having a playmaker in the middle of it Wilson doing a good job of turning facing recognizing what the defense gave him and knocking down the cover You know Molly talked about Syracuse passing the ball getting more people involved They had two assists and nine turnovers in the first half That has been a huge problem Stling knocks down two for Syracuse this season And its really been a jackpot because their opponents have turned those turnovers into points in transition They were losing four consecutive games That happened far too frequently A foul here will go against Donnie Freeman Number two What do we see in the first half against Notre Dame We saw the ball move from side to side And when the ball moves with that pace it has energy and it keeps everybody engaged offensively We have not seen that thus far with Syracuse A lot of isolation basketball Asar reaching up keeping it alive He grabs the rebound The second chance to the Tarheelss Rifle to the corner back for Young downstairs for Bayside They moved it beautifully for two applause and he has eight Kyle just not fighting enough down low on the block Aar didnt get pushed off the block Just had great post presence down low Circus just not stopping North Carolinas offense on the weave Stley shovels it up there Nice touch for two give you six going right to Wilson Quick strike He beats everyone to the ball Backs cheering it on Tremendous effort and he has a chance for a threepoint play Thats the way you attack the other teams best player You attack them on defense Huber Davis talked about that before the half making it a priority Okay Freeman you got 18 points Im Caleb Wilson Im going to attack you every single possession See if I can get you in foul trouble Caleb with 17 Hes already set a Carolina freshman record for the most 20 point games to start his career Freeman heading for the bench He has 15 of at least 20 points and on his way to another one tonight Threepoint play the chance Not going to let you save all your energy for the offensive end Im going to make you work on the defensive end just as hard Starting being chased by Young up against Bessar That one will roll off the iron but a second chance thanks to White and the rebound Pull a pop Little flag away off the iron by George picked cheering up at midcourt Starley straight on and another miss in one of the line Trimble all the way through A block Outstanding defense there by Kings Syracuse got lucky right there Nobody stopped the ball Trible was able to get the ball from one length of the court to the other George lifts rebound tapped Another second effort for Syracuse Kings over the top The tip wont drop Kyle is cheering certainly a guy who can climb up there in the Raptors but the play didnt work Wilson on the back down Hes denied a foul applause That foul there Thats where as we watch the evolution of Kell Wilsons game when he turns over that right shoulder hes eventually going to learn that left hand He extends that left hand He had a nice easy left in leg but bringing the ball back to his right hand is what forced the foul So the freshman who had a big day in Atlanta over the weekend against Georgia Tech really nice homecoming for him against the Yellow Jackets 226 rebounds five assists and will shoot again I mean Dave just the activity level that he has is ridiculous I mean hes flying all over the court And the one thing about Caleb Wilson that I enjoy is that he plays with great joy and passion You can tell he gets lost in the flow and rhythm of the game You listen to him in a practice as we did earlier today Complimentary of his teammates Hes always talking to teammates saying nice job nice shots One thing that Hubert has talked about what a wonderful teammate he is Kyle on the high post needs some help Kyle trying to spin this side Stick it right Shot clock at three George has to heave it up there but didnt touch anything and out it goes cheering and applause You know OB Molly had some great stories on Kale Des She told us today Molly you were telling us about how competitive he was Is there any color you can provide to that Yeah you know hes kind of wise beyond his years and he really thrives off of visual motivation And Wilson taped the March Madness logo above his door in his dorm room Taps the logo every time he leaves to remind himself what he came here to accomplish He also has his goals for the season written down in his journal He told us he journals every single day And he said after a bad game hell write down a list of everything he could have done better And then hell rip it out of the page crumple it up and throw it away to quote physically discard any negative feelings or thoughts He was just wise beyond his years Young with the drive will clean it up with a slam cheering Jay Will does that too Only its my mistakes He writes down every single one And Paige after page Thankfully you do burn them later Appreciate that Thats after I tell Jimmy Thats right George out the window for two Nathan George eight points But that vision board is important to see what you want to accomplish and and you have to see it to believe it right I think a lot of players talk about what they want to do but they dont carry it with them daily For Caleb Wilson he makes sure that he sees who he wants to be on a daytoday routine applause Picked up the high rebound He draws the foul on his way to the basket When we come back well Syracuse fans were reminded of the glory days of Orange basketball over the weekend and music the late Lawrence Motton More on that poetry and mode when we come back music music to cost the world famous tickets closest person to the NCO dead center court 25 gift But the pink chicken Very nice And Syracuse basketball will always love Lawrence Motton May he rest in peace Saturday at the dome in Syracuse Number 21 the alltime leading scorer in Syracuse basketball history who passed away suddenly at the age of 53 last September Jay Jay Beheim standing on the court bearing his name and moved to tears and many on hand had to wonder can Syracuse return to those elite teams that Lawrence Molton was such a driver back in the 1990s 2400 points had a spectacular career Lawrence poetry in motion players youve seen in ACC history also along with Syracuse and do believe that Syracuse from a talent perspective can get back to being a national title contender It is one of the blueb blood brands in our game of college basketball and with the recruiting talent that theyre able to bring in Obviously NIL is something that everybody needs to adapt to but theres no reason why they cant contend to be the best of the best Syracuse has not played in an NCAA tournament since 2021 We watched Indiana football win a national title this year Anything is possible For decades the tournament was a mandate for Syracuse as they try to get back to that Starling wants to attack and spin That wont fall So a 20point lead here for North Carolina On target for three and thats the biggest lead tonight for the Heels a season pro out of Europe Theres Stling up top Anthony George George will find White Hell let fly and way too strong Ball just not moving the defense from side to side Trying to make that bounce pass deflected and just watch Jiren Stevenson sprint down the court here Chop goes up They secure the rebound Watch his sprint Him sprinting down the court leaves Bogan to the opposite side for that shot and forces Sterling to sit in the paint and and those are the kind of plays thats why you want your bigs to sprint towards the rim It opens up three shots on the outside They land back for the triple The last shot they changed to a two but that one no question about applause 63 38 and its starting to turn into a runaway for North Carolina with the next one coming up The showdown with Duke of course Freeman for Betsy Seth Treble is Donnie Freeman outweighs him by about 15 20 lbs They cant back him down low to the basket And a miss in tight Trimble really playing some sticky defense Trimble has the body and size It reminds me a lot of a former teammate I used to play with named Dante Jones and just a absolute pitbull and you can put him on smaller guards on the perimeter You see now this year where he played against Darren Peterson just made life miserable even though Peterson still had a pretty you know talented game But you can also put him on bigs too where he cant be back down The crew had dinner in Chapel Hill last night In fact Caleb Wilson came in at one point as he was grabbing a fight You were telling some great stories A foul here on the baseline Thats with seven on the shot clock about Duke North Carolina your days in the rivalry I think people will be fascinated to know that during the summers players from both sides would get together Okay youre telling that story Youre not talking about the one in me or the library right Not the one Okay The as far as getting together on each others courts like at Cameron and here to go toetotoe with each other Well every every summer we would come over here to Chapel Hill and play against the best of the best I mean we would play against McInness We would play against Vince Carter would come back and play Staff would come back and play Joseph Forte Ed Cota thats what we did And guys would come over to Durham and they would play as well We got into some very heated battles Sometimes fights broke out but it was all part of the rivalry and thats what made the rivalry even more passionate when we stepped our feet on that court Smart shot there by Bovas just kept on trucking and lays it in draws the foul You know speaking of Saturday upcoming its going to be heavily relying upon Hubert Davis and the staff along with Seth Treble to help the players on this roster to understand how thick the air will be and and what this rivalry will mean Uh this place will be jumping It will be prolific It it will be a different dimension and energy than what it is right now Your first one going into it Who told you what it was going to be like applause I had Shane Badier and Chris Carowwell tell me but I I made a pretty bad mistake You know Carolina had taken Ronald Curry over me to come here and play basketball here and I I told the observer how much I wanted to play against Ed Cota Everybody kept talking about Ed Cota being the best point guard in the ACC and I felt like I was better I got my tail kicked that night and I found out quickly I got to keep my mouth shut and not give the opponent any ammunition Right in that rivalry thats going to be job one right Yes A foul with 1308 to play in this contest and North Carolina with a big 6640 lead But a star matchup coming up on Saturday on ESPN as Duke and North Carolina resume the ancient hostilities Boozer and Wilson toetotoe NBA mock draft Boozer right now number three and Caleb number four And the interesting thing that we saw early in the game Caleb Wilson led his team on the court for the pregame warmups Cameron Boozer also leads Duke on the court for pregame warmups You Thats a rarity You dont see that often in basketball people Its typically the guards that lead their teams but these are two bigs that are great thinkers of the game that are leaders of their respective teams and are incredibly competitive in each and every possession JJ Sarling off the screen for Freeman Thatll drive back The star will hook that one up Have a while with the shot applause North Carolina really putting the hammer down the last three or four minutes in particular Besar hands off for Powell to the Ps and Powell here with 1243 to go as he hits the deck Henry Basar plays like hes 67 But hes a sevenfooter Hes a guy that you can utilize on the perimeter Hes a guy that challenges every shot vertically at the rim He deters and changes the trajectory of shots just by his mere presence He and Caleb Wilson have combined for 22 double doubles this season Pretty remarkable Went from having no front line last year to now having one of the best front lines in college basketball That quick Now Carolina in great shape for their 18th win of the year Still about 13 to go But Pal with another shot coming Jonathan Pals starter West Virginia last year does not start for North Carolina He makes one of two So the lead ballooning to 27 for the Heels for Stling Shot clock down to nine deflected away Thats the reason he could go get that in the back court cheering Anthony goes up No that wont drop Rebound knocked down a play by Syracuse That was a high quality shot by Anthony They worked on that all day Snaking off that screen and getting to those midrange jumpers just not able to knock it down but has a very high IQ and a good feel for the game Syracuse is hopeful tonight that they could do a little trap of Northern of North Carolina on their own floor after the weekend downstairs for Vessar cheering who will slam it in applause What great continuity action there just having his head up making the right play at the right time Visar giving him a target for the slam Timeout 1145 to go I would always tell my bigs call for the ball Give me something to throw to Bogamox knowing that coming off this play here Basar giving them a target The Tarios up 29 Good luck Lets go to our heels 2023 Got to reload Good morning In an effort to kick off Black History Month the NBA had their inaugural Pioneer Classic where the Celtics defeated the Bucks where they honored some incredible AfricanAmerican players such as Chuck Cooper Oral Lloyd Nate Sweetwater Clifton So we decided to do our own version of that in the ACC We kicked that off with Bill Jones First and foremost the first black player music in the ACC in 1965 following up with the North Carolina great Charlie Scott the first black player to get a scholarship in the year 1967 And then Charlie Davis here 1971 Wake Forest the first black player to win ACC player of the year I love Charlie Scott growing up Big Celtics fan And you wonder how many of the players in todays game understand the role that Charlie Scott played here at the University of North Carolina and how it broke the barrier for so many other incredible players to actually really take their place here in the level of greatness at Carolina Dean Smith right there beside him 11 and 12 minutes to go North Carolina big night Theyve had a lot of them with so many great players 6940 on Syracuse Here you go Hey open Good morning Lets go Heat applause cheering applause Heat cheering Well these two Caleb Wilson and Henry Besar not only tonight but all season long they have been the engine for North Carolina They just play inside and out North Carolinas been very intentional about getting the ball to the post and Wilson and Vasar have absolutely delivered We talked about this game being the game before the biggest game of the year which is the Duke North Carolina rivalry and how North Carolina came out in this game How they executed the sense of urgency the energy they play with set the tone for how they would play on Saturday night and they have done exactly that They have delivered early in this game Good ball movement up top for Evans Shot clock to seven for the Heels Bogots back to Evans Want a jumper Well they did everything they wanted to do there Pal with the miss but Vesar keeps it alive Evans again North Carolina up comfortably at halftime but then they went on a 238 run to this point Probably put the game well out of reach but still about 11 minutes to go 6940 And our starstudded ESPN NBA Wednesday double header comes your way Nuggets in Madison Square Garden taking on the Knicks at 7 Eastern And the Thunder Square off music against the Spurs NBA Countdown tipping off coverage at 630 Now we just had a great moment here during the break Steve Kersner our dear friend here at

very well known Very very well known Yes theres no debate on that Theres no debate on that North Carolinas got a great communications program Tremendous Im just saying thats not the way you said it during the break So I said Hey Kersh I said Bob Dick Stockton Marv Albert Ted CP Mike Taro Can I go on and on Jason Bedetti Kevin Brown there a lot of us who went there A lot of us who went to

Caris Hes the best the best Evans in transition North Carolina putting a hammer down in the second half in particular Its called he hits the triple Thats a clinic on how to beat the zone Ball rotates over from one side to the other You hit the post Basar looks right in the corner Knock down three Freeman had a big first half with 18 He was a oneman band as he draws the foul but they needed two more just like him to put up those kind of numbers Has yet to score here in the second half And so at this point of the game North Carolina is up 32 points And I just want to be able to articulate what I just saw on the last possession cheering Caleb Wilson was visually frustrated that he did not get into that passing lane to get that steal I mean up 32 points with 938 left to play in the second half And thats the level of competitive fire that is within Wilson That doesnt matter time and score He is playing hard regardless Hey the Dicky V Galla is coming your way and we want you to get on board if you can Well give you more details about that in just a moment Dicky V does this every year raffling off an opportunity to win a sensational sports card all to benefit pediatric cancer

and the stop by Vesar applause 14 for him So the lead expands to 31 shot got a great look off the 10 Thats going to be off on Syracuse off the body of Kyle Well Hubert Davis told us today during the shoot around for North Carolina we dont even talk about Duke until the game in front of Duke is over At the very least you can start thinking about what hes going to say when this game is over Impressive performance for the Tarheels No question about that Meanwhile Syracuse about to drop to 13 and 10 Heres Trigger from the corner Life doesnt get easier for Syracuse After dealing with this they now have to go play against Virginia on the road We may mention a test Ritter one of the top players in the country for Ryan ODMs team And they are not your fathers Virginia basketball Theres nothing slow about the style of post play Wilson went for the stop but couldnt quite get it Threeman in transition and backs cheering it down Hes had a very strong game individually anyway 21 points But again throughout this game hes felt like hes all alone Yeah I really feel like Nate George is one of the guys that can not not only create his own shot but can get other people going But they need to play with a better rhythm and pace in which they play And it feels at times when Syracuse you know get stuck their offense gets stagnant and they go to a lot of isolation basketball Kyle with foul number four as he hits Wilson Caleb Wilson showing up as he has all season long in a big way for North Carolina the freshman Hes been terrific again here against Syracuse snorts Tonights game is the grocery challenge Our contestants tonight are Hayden and Will work for MC RJ to see who can get the most basketballs into their shopping cart first On your mark get set go Aiden is wearing a short

a hot dog Heat Heat cheering Heat Heat Im not as he goes to the foul line And Henry Besar a 7 foot junior from Estonia A dynamic onetwo punch And for more on Caleb lets go to Molly McGrath Well OB Wilson told us he leaned on veterans like Henry Vasar when he was adjusting to the college game He said that relationship really empowered him to take on a leadership role as a freshman And he pointed to their chemistry saying Yeah we make each other better because were unselfish for each other If one of us is having a good game or has the hot hand we encourage each other lift each other up Our priority is winning And you mentioned Hubert Davis said The best thing about Wilson is what a great teammate he is Just to add to that Molly the beautiful thing about having guys like Caleb Wilson and Henry Basar theyre naturally communicative And that is so imperative when your front line who is the backbone of your defense is communicating on what youre doing defensively to your guards on how they can apply pressure or when a screen is coming from the right or from the left So not only they giving you points productions and rebounds but theyre giving you great communication which is the backbone of everything you do Wilson grabbing a rebound here Messar dumping it down low for Wilson and a turnover with 702 left 76 to 45 Hubert Yon Derek Dixon telling him he should be in that short corner Thats where the pass is supposed to come from Base on Swished in by Nathan George as he gets into double figures with 11 Trible on the way Wilson will turn and fire Cant knock that one down And the heels one and done North Carolina will beat Syracuse twice this season George bump there and hits it As we approach the sixminute mark again classes were cancelled here in North Carolina today after the big storm over the weekend Wilson on the baseline Another foul against Syracuse So the fans have had all day to get ready for this one And coming up our Tuesday night ACC Network mens basketball double header It starts at 700 Eastern Fourth ranked Duke will be hosting Boston College And then its Penn battling number 18 Virginia All coming up on Tuesday 70 at the line in and out of number one Hes nine out of 12 at the line tonight And he gets the second 22 points for Kale You can put that in the book every single night Hes going to get 20 points or more Rolls in for George The shot for 553 plus a foul on the play So the basket go two and thats going to go against his second Like I said earlier multiple players are still competing Everybodys competing at a high level Just because North Carolina is up by 25 points does not mean that they are done competing Its the same with Syracuse Suare one and one after that whistle 7752 into the double Besar is open Here that one Its a good threepoint man Very good in fact at 46 Anthony to the right side hits the deck Hell draw the foul So Carmelo Anthony Sun to the line This has been a struggle for him Its been a struggle for the entire Syracuse team all year He makes 59 Unfortunately for the Orange that puts him about average for a Red team Theyre only 63 in total cheering Think about Camila Anthony leading Syracuse to the 2003 title Its one of those miraculous runs with that team and the poise If you talk about some of the elite freshman able to get their team over the hump which is a rarity within college basketball and some of the great players in Dwight at Marquette or Kevin Durant at Texas what Melo was able to do up at the Carrier Dome leading into a national championship volumes about him being one of the most prolific Olympic scores and teammates weve had in the game of basketball today With that Syracuse team firmly on his back carried them to a national title for Jim Ahs feed into that paint for Vesar and a foul on Syracuse So well check out whos heating up brought to you by Direct TV Certainly that man in the middle 22 and eight made six out of 14 Spent a lot of time at the foul line as well tonight You talk about I could easily be 30 I could easily be 30 and 15 And thats the type of energy that Caleb Wilson plays with consistently And theyre going to need that type of performance on Saturday when they go against the front line of Duke University and Cameron Boozer Both Basar and Wilson need to hold down that front line with Boozer and Gungba and how they play Looking forward to that match up That duel applause is always among the most entertaining games in sports Pick your sport North Carolina and Duke First of the two meetings Where would you put that I mean youve called Red Sox games for the longest time Is it the equivalent of Yankees Red Sox It certainly is It absolutely is Its right there on the very top run Theres no question about it So many great players come through that way Its staggering on the turnover Anthony just very deliberate and how he attacks the rim cheering and get a shot off in a variety of ways Very crafty of a player Great players and great coaches rivalry fan base is almost swung away and a rejection by Anthony tiptoeing in Hell drop in two He breaks through double figures The answer to a 10 cut back to 78 to 60 with about four minutes to go One thing with this zone Syracuse have been able to keep Carolina out of transition applause and forcing Carolina to be patient and value the possession cheering George over the top Nice play by Suare against Fingerton side to the net and Hubert Davis to go to his bench here down the stretch with about 320 to go for Dixon and just clipped that out of play turnover for North Carolina tonight with 315 on the clock North Carolina sailing to a win here against Syracuse in the ACC on a big Monday Well we see Darren Peterson up close Coming up next number 11 Kansas and number 13 Texas Tech and Peterson projected to number one in the upcoming NBA draft Had 18 points in that first half matchup against BYU and AJ Debansa Played limited minutes in the second half Didnt need to as Kansas won that game You know think about as we look at Caleb Wils there 22 points OB eight rebounds Hes a plus 24 for the game and hes drawn nine fouls 10 of 13 from the free throw line Just doing it every which way possible Stevenson racing ahead Its batted away to save the slam Under three minutes to play Now I forgot about this rivalry I started receiving texts from old friends considering I owned a house down here for 16 years and my next door neighbor whenever North Carolina would beat Duke in a rivalry OB my house would wake up the next morning and I would my house would be toilet paper all over the yard all over the backyard everywhere on my property for the whole day and the next day I would wake up again and it would all be cleared out so it was all fun in the rivalry but thats what my neighbors did to my house can you believe that so the people who tpd your house came and cleaned it up they came yeah theyre respectful its a respectful rivalry actually wonderful its a wonderful tradition Not that you want to repeat it every just so you know Never did that to them when we won All ourselves so high were standing But I love the idea they came and tidied up afterwards Like we made our point Freeman spins to his right and banks in two Hes had a big night 23 points for Donnie Freeman Well you realize as much as all of us have on each others teams We all support each other And like I said some of my friends with the score at Carolina uh you just you have a lot of respect and admiration for what both programs have been able to accomplish A Kyle with a vicious slam He is a high rise a great leaper Only down 14 points So a timeout Carolina has seen that Giant lead whittle down to 14 8066 lead was 32 Like a game sports How good is this rivalry I cant believe it Fans hes next Caleb Wilson has arrived The full bag of tricks from Camboozer Duke Carolina always delivers music Well the game coming up on Saturday Duke and North Carolina as great a rivalry as there is for my money in all of sports collegiate professional anywhere on the planet And you played in it one of the great thrills of your lifetime as a player I mean I remember my first game literally I was so exhausted for warmups because I was so hyped to play in that game It It takes something to experience to settle into that game And look we just came off an incredible matchup cheering and applause between Darren Peterson and AJ Debons And now we get a chance to see the battle of the bigs cheering Cameron Boozer against Caleb Wilson And the depth that both teams have There is no doubt like Jay Bill said that game always delivers It will deliver again at 630 on Saturday night Well I think Hubert Davis would have loved to have seen his star freshman sit out the rest of this game but hes bringing it back on now as this one gets a little bit closer than he would like But what you love about Syracuse is the game is not over until the final whistle is blown A team down 32 points finds themselves only down 14 cheering Feeling and believing like they have a chance with 214 left to go Wait a foul on the Orange 211 on the clock So Red Autrys team continuing to battle here down the stretch Red is a Syracuse player Appeared in three NCAA tournaments He played with Lawrence Motton and he was very emotional today as we talked about the halftime ceremony at the dome this weekend How much Motton meant to the Syracuse program at a time where they were regularly in the NCAA tournament often a threat to go to the final four 8266 George trying to bounce inside and denied by Treble Three from the corner and a whistle on the play The act of attempting a three Starling gets hit as he is fouled on the play and Powell put his hands up immediately to his head like what did I do And thats number five Well just the worst thing to do when theres two minutes and 3 seconds left to go in the game You encroach his position his landing position That is a foul and you stop the clock and you give them three free throws to get this back into a game Its the last thing you want to do is stop the clock Davis stopping him before he takes a seat Stling will have another one coming Hes only 52 at the line So Pal on the bench Number two for Stallone He has another one coming after this Talk about Syracuse shooting 631 from the free throw line which is the second lowest mark in division one basketball and he made them all to give him 11 points And not pressure here for the Orange Stevenson on the baseline does eventually get it in under two minutes Wilson back to the point guard and hell take some time and run some clock Wilson the turnover for North Carolina Dixon had base in the middle of the floor wide open Just tried to thread the needle on the pass Just a 13point game Hell take the long distance shot and swishes in a three cheering Wow 10point contest With under 90 seconds to go Stevenson has to call a timeout Nobody saw this coming about 5 minutes ago This was blowout City Still a 10point game with a minute 25 to go but Syracuse had quite a run here 8272 A timeout Lets toss it to the studio Kevin Connors Kemp thank you very much North Carolina had a 32point advantage but Syracuse has caught fire and made 11 of their last 12 And now if youre Syracuse you have to apply pressure You have to try to force the ball towards one of the corners of the court where you can use the baseline and the sideline as an extra defender and be disciplined try to get a steal and try to convert very quickly Its only about 8 and 12 minutes ago is 32 Thats the last place you want to catch the ball Thats the last place you want to catch the ball cheering on the line and turn it over You want to catch the ball in the middle of the court Thats exactly what Syracuse wanted them to do A lot of fans had already headed for the exits when it got to 32 They can be forgiven for that Inbound for K He hits a three Wow You got to be kidding me Stevenson can run the baseline Crosscourt and back to him 110 to go You dont need the foul You can play straight up Stevenson gets across midcourt A 3510 run for Syracuse A sevenpoint game Bes is Treble taking and draws the foul with 509 seconds left Really smart move by Seth Trimble not to settle for a three and to attack the rim I cant tell you how many players in college basketball would step into that pass and shoot a three but getting to the free throw line was a smart play Draw the contact get to the line He makes 70 there Kyle is fouled out 69 senior is done Wow And Trimble shooting two shots Who would have guessed this was be becoming a game again It looked like it was just absolutely over It was a 32point lead Obie and a 3510 run by Syracuse Thats enough Treble to shoot again You just if you look in the eyes of every Syracuse player they are communicating They look like theyre all interconnected Theyre talking They believe they can win this game Well you were part of one of the great minutes of college basketball the American Minute against Maryland applause Starts to feel a little bit like that But is there enough time 37 seconds left Starting going to get a shot up there Tough angle but he lays it in And theyll press again 8377 You dont want to throw the ball towards the corner Stevenson trying to get free and hell draw a foul Carolina has flirted with that multiple times Theyre just running directly to the corner and that is the most optimal trap position So to put North Carolina at the line theres 68 and Stevenson for two and a reliable 77 at the line and shooting two drops in number one applause So the fans who stayed cheering some of them in a state of shock had ever got this close awaiting the second foul shot and he makes the four applause Stlings going to hurry 35 left JJ Stling to drive it That wont fall Rebounded away by the heels and Treble will draw the foul cheering 279 left applause Once again Seth Trimble doing the dirty work You saw him not settle for the three the possession prior Drove to the free throw line Made one free throw and then securing the defensive rebound with two hands And thats what you love about him Most guards try to go up and grab that thing with one He grabbed it with two and secured it Hey Kings just fouled out So the senior from Salem Oregon hits the bench and Seth Trimble back to the line Senior hits number one applause Now closing out games is difficult especially when you have a double digit lead You become a little bit content You settle into the game instead of keeping your foot on the gas versus triple digits cheering applause They got it back to 10 Less than half a minute to go Stling to push it Tiptoeing in Left it short Grabs his own miss cheering Long shot by Anthony No that finds away 14 seconds to play Wilson comes away with the rebound and they will not foul anymore cheering North Carolina will win it a little hairy down the stretch but they win this one in the ACC in a big Monday
