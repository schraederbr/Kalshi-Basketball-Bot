you know to have him in the lineup its like uh its its security Jamir Watkins is a scoring machine and he leads the conference in going to the free throw line so look for Watkins to shoot a lot of free throws first in that and first in free throws made this is the Freshman dequon Davis who will run the show number five rare freshman starting for Leonard Hamilton Watkins into the center Yan three pump fakes and kicks it back out shot clock down to five on this first possession touch shot by Watkins doesnt go and Marty Soko with the rebound yeah good opening possession by the Bears good defense in the post and a very nice job of challenging shot on the perimeter B will start Wilkinson the former sub Campbell black Shir petritis the transfer from the Air Force Academy and Soko one of the best rebounders in the conference blackshire with two on the shot clock blocked by Davis wikinson throws it up but its a shot clock violation well and heres FSU batching the defensive brows thats a really good opening possession as well you know youve got to keep youve got to keep Cal in front of you and FSU has worked hard at that at both their practices last night and today shoo on we mentioned Watkins and Davis Taylor Bol Bowen Malik uans the center Justin Thomas starting normally a reserve but Chandler Jackson is not playing hes got a groin Applause injury so Justin Thomas from Baton Rouge Louisiana gets the start Yan with a nice tip and Florida States on the board first yeah Ks got to watch out for the offensive glass because thats what FSU can do they can pound you on the glass so theyve got a secure defensive rebound Applause Wilkinson the Lefty to blackshire former Grand Canyon standout kicks it out Campbell no good sooko had it lost Applause it inside to ball Bing who is fouled by blackshire thats good strategy by Florida State Dave theyre trying to go inside theyve got mismatch there with the shorter black shirt trying to guard perimeter players who are giv away about four or five inches so look for that matchup to continue Mark Madson told us obviously a huge loss not having sto yakovich but he said the way Florida State switches 125 not really going to change how they run their offense no thats the good news but you know you its always tough to replace a guy that youre leading score because hes done it every night for you leik went inside spinning on sasoko and off the glass yeah I dont know how he got that angle I thought M sasoko did a really nice job of creating no angle to the basket but that was just a great backside pickup and shot Applause May Campbell with the floater Cals on the board Now cal can get that because mfsu is going to get out there in the pass Lanes they going to gamble sometimes and if you can just stay solid you can get some shots Watkins first Music Applause two 62 NOS mentioned one four the last five conference games play about 10 or 11 deep Leonard Hamilton has used as many people as anyone in the ACC sh looked like it got blocked but Wilkinson somehow got it to go he always gets to the rim Dave thats one of the things he does so well he can shoot it but he can drive you and really can finish his too hes got Great Lift uh great explosion and great change of Base speed Wilkinson called for the foul so yeah you can see when you when Wilkinsons got the ball in his off hands he just creates a little space he can use either hand and he finishes B Bowen had the block and kind of just missed it went underneath Applause yeah Watkins Rises Applause off each team using a lot of clock coach on their possessions yeah they do is that by Design or the D is just that good I I personally think its a defense they forc to do things you normally dont want to do I mean then a turnover with 4 seconds on the clock yeah because as you mentioned d Thats a short clock Soko breaks up the alley Now cal has numbers Reus petritis and he lays it in good possession for Cal they get out in the break and youve got to do this against Florida State you know if you can get some fast break opportunities you can get get to them before the defense sets tied at six Soo Watkins Watkins runs it Applause Music Applause down to a cutting ball Bowen who got blocked sokos already got a couple and out of bounds ball goes to Cal well take our first timeout how about defense leading the offense Cal Bears were down early but you know what if you protect the rim good things will happen they do that Soko on one end Andrus petritis split North Carolina he didnt play great and Cal still won at NC State without him playing terrific no and theyre fortunate they have a young man by the name of Jeremiah Wilkinson whos uh not just your normal freshman he can play uh hes getting the nod tonight hell be just fine because he gets it done pretty much on a nightly basis yeah almost 12 points a game off the bench and now making his first career start thats him with the ball Zero Joshua Ola Joseph into the game and into the scorebook yeah he plays well I tell you at home he really has a comfort level but he knocks down to three he does that really really well and his teammates look for him well he started 10 games plays a lot of minutes and super great athlete brought him off the bench and hes done very well coming off the bench for Mark Matson and there he gets a steal yeah great double team they knew there was a mismatch there and they doubled What A Catch by Soka wow what a rim run twoand catch textbook and finish at The Rim nine nothing Run for the Bears Yan guarded well tough shot no good and sokum pus both get it Soko gets the rebound already has three blocks does Big M very underrated Defender Dave he plays well he uses his body bodies you up he doesnt foul you a lot but he makes it hard to go over the top and as you mentioned he can block some shots Leonard Hamilton needs just four wins for 200 career ACC wins its in his 23rd season before FL just a remarkable job for the seminal uh just his career has been Applause stored Wilkinson going right at traffic and laying it in yeah he makes it look easy Dave he gets in traffic as you mentioned but hes a able to elevate hes strong he does not mind contact you got to play him all the way through may even need a second Defender to come at him its an 11 nothing run by C another board by Applause Soko turnover there and here come the seminal Davis The Freshman lost the ball Wilkinson The Freshman finds ol Joseph who reverses it 13 nothing run and Leonard Hamilton calls Music timeout great surge by the Bears theyre getting it done on the defensive end and theyre converting offensively Cal has made seven straight shots and they now lead this game 156 playing well at home in the ACC Music Applause 15 to6 Mark Matt Club beating Florida State early on in his second year former twotime AllAmerican at Stanford yeah tell me about him I had to face his butt a number of times and what a competitor and great to see him in coaching hes hes uh hes made for coaching and now hes sitting in your old SE yeah he sure is but Ill tell you hes done a great job just getting his team programmed back you know you talk about uh you know having put together a new lineups you know the games Chang now with the portal things are happening but uh hes built his program and thats a big win that his program came away with North Carolina State huge win after a tough loss in North Carolina we mentioned jir Watkins ability to get to the free throw line he scored double figures in 15 straight games hes tied a season high with four threepointers versus Louisville but he has attempted coach 153 free throws more than anyone in the conference now 154 and hes made 116 more than anyone in the com and you know what add 25 steals 12 block shots about a 4 to1 assist to turnover theres nothing this young man doesnt do but unfortunately hes they two men down on their team Leonard Hamilton having to go with a shorter bench hes used to a longer bench so its going to put a lot more pressure on jir to to step up and carry his team a little bit why is he so good at getting to the foul well hes strong hes hes angular you know and change of Direction so many players need to learn from players that that can do that when you change directions change speed with the ball great things happen dont want to play at one speed speaking of changing directions how about the jemi Wilson show and go show and go I mean he plays at different speeds its just really a pleasure to watch Watkins from Deep thats a three well hes going to have to do that Dave unfortunately he doesnt have the luxury of playing Mr unselfish tonight hes going to have to put some points up for his team which he can do Wilkinson with six already in his first career start Christian Tucker into the game thats 22 his first shot he tried to dunk it no good m got it hes got it blocked by B Bowen how about two a block dunk and a block Point Blank shot by the seminal now Mahoney for three no good a great possession for the seal they needed that youan that looked easy well they can do that they get up and down the floor and if youre the Bears you cant celebrate on makes you got to get that back with all your numbers and get the ball stop Boston holon Off the Bench hes number three guarding Wilkinson trying to slow The Freshman down but now they switch him off Wilkinson left open on the switch off the mark Watkins with a Applause Music rebound so well take a time out Watkins is going to be a scoring machine if Florida States could to stay in it at least according to coach brwn and this worked Music AGP tragically passed away in a motorcycle accident atics has been in Partnership for the years Family Help UC our stent on the import ofy and Applause initi Mar Soko has given the Bears a big boost a huge boost Dave watch what he does his impact on the game I mean hes at The Rim get that out of here hes playing great defense he gets to get that out of there and now he RI runs I mean he just beats everybody down the floor and puts his head down down and just gets it done I mean watch him here hes the last man under the basket and now he gets out and just Motors I mean coaches love this tape just Motors down the floor R makes a be line to the rim catches over the top finish I mean thats textbook textbook basketball three rebounds three blocks from Toya funga Mali has been a great inspiration to the people in his home Village more on that later but now gets a break and Lee Dort part of the twoheaded monster that plays the fan from Matson in as Soko gets a Applause breather the runner is good and Jerry D is on the board for Florida State 1714 and he can score that was designed play coming out of the timeout great great execution by the seals if youre Cal now you got to Beware of the press because the seminal will extend full court theyre going to try to get you if youre lazy with the ball or just get you on a short clock so you have to handle pressure they make it uncomfortable for you to handle the ball and so uncomfortable that Mark Matson wants a timeout you know and I like that about Coach Manson I mean you know you say well I use that timeout you know you havent even gotten it in and havent had any problems so far but you got to do what you got to do so you talk about it even if you dont want to use a timeout well be right back in 30 seconds Applause Music Florida State on a mini run of their own 7 nothing to make it a threepoint game and now a little pressure see if the timeout by Madson worked it out Campbell gets it across the timeline yeah theyre more of a mantoman pressure team not Zone team but you got to be careful they get their hands in the passing Lings Mahoney back door had nowhere to shoot it Ola Joseph open for three he had nowhere to shoot it but Joseph was Johnny on the spot spots up where he should be in the corner and knocks it down shot two threes made two threes and Cals up by Applause six Thomas lobs it up to Yan who caught It reversed it hes got good hands with the spin great great hands not only does he catch Dave uh he finishes he puts the right angle and and and English as they say on the ball he he uses the backboard its your best friend sometimes Applause Campbell looking for Dort couldnt find him so keeps it himself floats in the air no good lead Dort with the rebound misses the put back to Mahoney h of Applause Joseph now Mahoney going right at youan Lee Dort got in his way yeah he was trying to set his screen but he ended up becoming interference now they got a real short clock about 6 seconds left not a lot of time here for a play youre going to have to get it in a guard hands and drive it or throw it directly into the block good job by the seminal lard Hamilton we mentioned in his 20 third season yeah coach am he hes gotten it done I mean everywhere hes been his teams have won blackers got to shoot it Wilkinson does has it blocked Justin Thomas with a great defense Applause you see the seals trying to get in the lane against Music Applause Cal dang for three perfect yeah he can shoot it glad out can shoot it elard Hamilton loves this young man and talks about his ability to knock down threes a onepoint game favor of the Bears yeah the seminal have done a great job the pressure is bothering Cal they got to get it over half court they do now they got numbers boy coach Florida State just makes you do things you dont want to do now they thats how they play Dave and lenon Hamiltons trademark and his coaching staff thats what they do they just try to take you out of your comfort zone make your entry passes a little further on the floor get you out of your operational areas blacker fouled on the threepoint shot and Javon blackshire will go to the free throw line and shoot three yeah thats just an undisciplined play I know coach H not happy about that you know young players have do that but you got to just challenge up you youd rather see a player make a three than go to the free throw lines its just you know thats just a cardinal rule when youre playing defense you dont get in you know your challenge up that was more of a challenge out big difference reminder we got a Full Slate of college basketball lined up for you on Saturday February 1st it all tips off at 2 pm Eastern with Florida State taking on Boston College followed by Virginia Tech versus Virginia then well cap it off for Stanford battling SMU at all right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app you know Dave even with stokovich out you can see the Bears are freely substituting they still believe in their depth and thats going to be a factor in this game because Florida States down too many blord misses both but petrius the birthday boy turned 22 today with the offensive rebound yeah why Applause not Campbell blocked petritis quick flick no good sasoko had a chance at it here comes Holt lobbing it up butuk couldnt get it and who else was there Soo absolutely Wilkinson what a shot hes just hes lethal in transition Dave you better get him stopped early not late he uses his body to block the defender in a way well beyond his years dang hit one now hes got another no you you got to you got to get out on him he gets his rhythm youre in trouble Jeremiah Wilkinson always probing I I really like what he does with the ball hes puts pressure on hes got eight right now to lead all Applause scores again you see Florida State getting out the passing Lanes had a timeout coming but both teams have have a couple things to talk about how about the defense Dave take a look at the defense by Cal he gets it started on the defensive end and what a you got Marty s Soko just going up and denying and then who do you have on the other end the Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson on the finish for two you got to Chuck a lot of that one he knows how good the weathers been but you know Houstons the same way right now theyre down theyre out closed school for 2 three days the warm weather cities Dave arent used to snow you know you and grow up East Coast me Midwest were a little different uh but it can it can really waye you NOS came out here Monday so they got out here ahead of the snow and the weather out here in Northern California has been very nice cool in the morning absolutely up to 65 sunny in the afternoon this guy has been hot all day Wilkinson Campbells got to shoot it theres one on the clock finally realizes it no good and petritis had a shot at him Applause almost Watkins almost lost the handle got it Applause back Holt comes off the screen and is wide open but left it short yeah pulled his string a little bit he couldnt believe how open he was petrius nice pass too for the D Reus petrius getting it done to his big fellow whos having himself a game petrius his birthday supposed to be getting the gifts not giving them GI that keeps on giving but hes doing how about that maluk somehow snuck it in in yeah the 7os arent going away Dave youre going to have to get some stops of your own if youre Cal Cals playing outly well offensively but youre going to have to do something just to really you know make the the semos feel you a little bit Campbell getting pressure from Watkins who dives on the floor and theyre going to call foul on Watkins well I I I like the effort I know you get the foul call here but I just love the effort of Watkins you know their star player you know hes getting up a little slow but let me tell you thats hes hes sending a message da speaking of sending a message Soko is really really sending a message today well hes capable you know hes a guy early in the year that the Bears were very high on and hes not going to give you a big numbers but he impacts the game in so many ways I mean thats what he does I mean he runs the floor if youre playing with him you know hes going to get ahead of you on the break and so keep your head up and look for the big fell I think he could do that more often got great hands great fet and he finishes and what has he been doing defensively blocking shots and making it really tough so uh you know if youre the Bears you got to keep your eyes on MAR Soko and keep keep beaing was not a huge window and petrius threaded the needle perfectly now there at to monitor checking on something David Im not sure if it was on the last play it looks like a clock issue I think both teams playing at a pretty frenetic Pace but its been an interesting game you know the Bears obviously shorthanded in terms of their star player out and now youve got the seminal who are down two players and thats been a trademark their depth so both teams having to make some adjustments and you know we joked about this in shoot around Dave I I I made this point that the players dont care right you got players out coaches the media everybody makes a big deal like guys been out if youre a player on a team you look for those opportunities you dont want to hurt wish on heill on somebody but you just want a chance to play Applause so they added about 6 seconds to the clock made it 645 and now were back underway with the Bears whove made Seven of their last eight field goal attempts you see the seminal theyre trying to push the Bears out on the floor yeah I mean any more theyre going to be on Coach Ben Brons lap Wilkinson no good and sasoko bumped to B Bowen yeah you know you made the point earlier Dave about the seminal and that theyre a team that plays differently and what do they do what what does that mean they get out there they they deny passes they keep you out in the perimeter they try to keep you out of where youre trying to go and if youre a team that plays against them you got to be strong with the basketball and you got to try stay try to stay aggressive and they play oh did you see that Watkins just slap the hand of all the Joseph off him he was a good job by Crawford not calling anything but hes hes tough kid both kid pretty tough physicality there theres a turnover Here Comes blackshire Javon blackshire lays it up no good P trus trailer now that was a birthday tip theres the theres the gift and if youre Rus Petrus you know you you make two or three of those plays a game thats what he does no one plays harder than the former Air Force Academy standout that tremendous addition to the Bears program Davis wont go Thomas great offensive rebound kicks it back to the Freshman Davis ball Bowen for three out of bounds off the noes and Cal will get it yeah couple good looks for Florida State Bears were fortunate there but they theyve now got to solve this press and stay aggressive offensively Applause Bears coming off their first road ACC win that happened Saturday at Raleigh at NC State yeah huge win blackshire jumped up left his pivot foot and that is a travel and again Dave thats Florida State thats what they do theyre theyre long in every position they challenge you and so you got to stay glued Stay Stay grounded Music Applause Davis waves off the screen by y now they go the other way back to Watkins Watkins Rises and jir Watkins with another hoop yeah has something to say a little bit to the Cal bench just to like Im back Im here you better get somebody to check me very confident young man personally I like it you got to stay confident especially when youre on the road Watkins has Applause eight and now reaching foul on Malik Yuan I dont know if Id be saying that to to Mark mson though theres aot a bunch of guys Id say to Mad Dog is not sure I want to get him do you want to yell at someone whose nickname is mad dog no hes pretty tough guy hes one of the fiercest competitors Ive ever coached against but as you know one of the better guys in this business better better human Music be Davis and blackshire thats two tough guys now Thomas switches off to blackshire shot clock down to seven Wilkins The Freshman has to go shoots the three after pushing off no good petrius tips it alive Here Comes Watkins has B Bowen and B Bowen with the finish and how about the look from Watkins Dave thats a great poised assist on the break tied at Applause 27 petrius left alone in the corner nothing but a foul underneath as Soko had good position and Drew the foul on Florida State so well take another TV timeout Florida state has come back Cal had a run and Florida State had a run and I think both teams saying its going to be a tight game throughout the nice dish and Pa Bowen with the Music Finish to retire my yeah that was I was going to there too theres no mystery where that came from coaches arent going to get to get out there and do that youre 610 yeah later on in the show is the steel dayquon Davis and the Freshman lays it in well show a graphic of great 610 skiers itll be a short graphic yes it will itll feature bull b thats pretty unique story from Vermont but theres the Bears now turning it over on an out of bounds under out of a timeout uncharacteristic you dont want to do that now you got the seminal take their first lead Applause da Campbell spinning on Thomas Cs gone late into the shot clock every possession that Jumper by Wilkinson off B Bowen up high for the rebound defense defense nice defense by Wilkinson whos doing it on both ends well he he he has to because hes given up about seven or eight inches down there on the Block Florida state has some long players in the roster and theyre playing Applause them dang to inbound Applause it Thomas all the way cant get it to go Soko with another rebound Wilkinson the Lefty spots up no good Thomas left alone Wilkinson with the rebound hes doing everything and drives past everybody and missed the layup and a late whistle but hell go to the line and shoot to yeah theres the body control Dave you were talking about earlier he does have that he gets into you hes got a guy thats a foot taller but he goes up and he just waits for you to kind of come down and then he finds a way to get in your body and gets two free throws so Jeremiah Wilkinson whos got eight points four of 10 from the field has not shot a free throw yet Super Sub Off the Bench but made his first start today and making the most of it he reminder Sunday afternoon do not miss our next ACC gymnastics meet as 15th lank Stanford squares off against 25th ranked pit at Fitzgerald Fieldhouse our coverage begins at 4 Eastern on the ACC Network and the ESPN Music app we mentioned coach Wilkinsons 117 ranked second nationally Off the Bench for people who had not started well that stat no longer applies hes a starter now as B Bowen traveled yeah thats a big stat I think you know you give up the streak if you if you need a guy to step up for you but that was a pretty interesting stat and now Jeremiah Wilkinsons getting an opportunity to start hes good enough to start really Dave but sometimes coaches just like you to come off the bench and and produce and dont want to change you know your format and its funny even though the entire world knows hes lefthanded he still gets around you to the left but he can use either hand and thats the beauty of uh players who are ambidextrous work Ola Joseph has been hot from deep and continues to be he knocks it down plays with a great comfor home he has 11 and has not missed a field goal hes four for four well fans arent going to like the ball here on the near side they thought Mark Matson saying look I dont think he got any help I think he fell down and obviously Clarence Armstrong saw it a little different but you look at Ola Joseph Dave I mean when he spots up hes got range hes got size so you got to get out there but he shoot over the top of you and hes got a really good stroke hes hes really knocked the shot down for the Bears this year two fouls on Wilkinson and he takes a seat you dont want him picking up another foul with two minutes left no you got to you got to S Davis The Freshman delivers I like that thats just a simple take what the defense gives you and he knocked it down big basket a onepoint cow Bear lead yeah if youre the seminal now you dont want to get down going in the halftime you battle back you want to try to keep things even or maybe sneak Applause lead petritis Baseline leaves it for Lee Dort Lee Dort blocked from behind but they will call the foul on air maluk well maybe not a bad foul Lee dorts had a really solid year but hes hes you know hes at times struggled from the from the line but you can see hes really good around the basket and look at the drop off by Rus petrius you just got to love playing with him and he just gets up there and uh you know pretty good defense I thought but uh Ds been working pretty hard on his free throws as of late see if I dont jinx him friendly roll on the back rim Applause there people always ask me of the so youan and Watkins both with two fouls coach which is you know I mean 140 left theyre not going to pick up a third theyre not playing some that hes got to watch right yeah I think thats smart I really do petrius the hustle guy on his birthday does what what he does just keeps The Possession alive does it all the Applause time Ola Joseph has not missed yet petritis out hustling everybody missed the easy one next effort good Rus petritis no not to be denied just second effort third effort to he is Cal up by four closing in on the first minute in the first half and petrius with a rebound black Shir body control no good petritis he made that happen to Campbell blacks here no good and a foul against C that would have brought the house down Dave he hits that and giving the Bears a really nice cushion going in to lck all because as you mentioned Rita petritis I mean my goodness hes Applause everywhere patrus has six offensive rebounds yeah how about that thats outrageous hes feeling it he must know its his birthday its my day but played at the Air Force Academy where he had to get up every morning at 530 am and was graded on how well he made his bet yeah I would have flunked that test on two on two counts you would still flun that test yeah the early RIS and the main B yeah yeah you drk it twice well if if youre to the the seminal now youre going to take a little bit of time youre going to let Cal come back you know and theyre going to have some time left but you would need to get a good one B Bowen second effort is good yeah big basket now if youre the Bears you got to come back down the floor not turn it over youre going to get the last shot and see if you can extend this lead maybe stretch it out to at least a two digit two double digit lead now barring a disaster Cal will lead at the half Campbell spinning finds an opening didnt go but the tip by Lee Dort is good right at the buzzer huge tip by Lee Dort thats what he does hes around the basket with the ball first shot no good Yan with the rebound for Florida State well I like Justin Thomas on on Wilkinson cuz youre now putting a player whos you know got some range on him thats a pretty good look Justin Thomas a great defender from Baton Rouge Louisiana said most of his family watching today back in Louisiana Watkins inside got everybody up in the air and got a foul on sasoko mty said wait a minute you and push me after the fact but theyre not going to call that they will let Watkins go to the free throw line I think fals doing a good job here not going to call itless its getting out of hand but watch the move inside here Look At the Hop step there thats a great move inside to draw the foul really good job of using that jump stop uh and explosion we mentioned that Watkins leads the entire ACC in free throw attempts and free throws made by the way two fouls coach now on MAR Soka yeah and whats going to happen now if if youre Florida State youre going to try to take advantage of that but uh youd like to get him on of the game hes been a force for the Bears he is you will mention that theres a capable replacement in Lee Dort uh but Ms certainly having a very good game so far twopoint gain Cal with the lead and the ball youll see Florida State switching one through five theyre pretty much can play the play the ball no matter who they are they switch up on you Wilkinson Fires for three and the Freshman continues to be hot you have to get out on Jem Wilkinson thats not a challenge youre just too far I mean hes hes not going to respect that he will knock it down and he did after all hes done but thats his first three of the game he can do that but hes been such a good driver Yan cant get it to go but B Bowen with the offensive rebound Thomas left alone Off the Mark and petritis with a board but B Bowl stol it goes to Yan Yuan misses the L P trus with a rebound theres two point blank shots by the seals sasoko running the floor Euro Step count it unbelievable the catch the Finish Soko and petritis knocked it out of bounds off Davis but they say it went off petritis seminal keep it yeah might be lucky its not the last two minutes of the game they they could have reviewed that might have gone did sure did but how much isoko just running the floor again I mean hes getting up and down the floor Rim running and Applause finishing Davis back out to Thomas back to the Freshman now the leading score Watkins Watkins inside gets a man in the air misses Yan keeps it alive fresh 20 b Bowen left for an easy D yeah unself play great look by Malik Yan thats just an unselfish play nice job now DJ Campbell pushing it and draws the foul on Watkins and thats going to be three fouls on jir Music Watkins well lets look at the last basket by Florida State I mean you can see in here the ability to keep the ball alive on the glass and then just a drop down for the the easy two and right now Ben Leonard Hamilton and his assistants Stan Jones are discussing do you keep Jam Watkins in there jir Watkins he has three fouls well if the games close you might if its starting to slip away You got to play him thats been the formula at least over the years that most coaches would use blacker no good and petritis called from behind yeah he he does what he does hes a pest and hes not going to stop being a p even if its his birthday hes going to go out and be who he is but uh you know you you mentioned an interesting thing because as a coach what do you do with three fouls because you put him in and you leave him in he gets four that really put you you know behind the eight ball but if you take him out you your team can go nose dive right now he is in and Applause Music playing Malik Yan going right at Soka Music and another rebound by mty not easy to go over the top of soku he does a great job establishing post defensive Applause presence b b and block it P trus cleans it up why not Dave its only his birthday let him go get one big fella go CL throw it down 4437 count DeQuan Davis with the runner and you see the SE are not going away they youre going to have to stop Applause them but gals been pretty good offensively blacker for three sasoko tried to tip it B Bowen came down with it Watkins lays it in thats answers the question Dave why why you keep in you need him on the floor how at that for a basket bullied his way inside with his body one possession Applause game Florida States won four their last five conference game Cal coming off the big win at NC State for their first ever ACC Road Victory Campbell spinning got it back yeah 7s having trouble securing some of the defensive rebound Cal really pesy on the glass and a foul on Taylor B Bowen and thatll take us to our first mediate timeout in the second half Reedus petritis is 22 years old today played at Air Force came here no one hustles or plays harder in fact hes already got seven offensive rebounds all by himself but the main man for Florida state is Watkins and the seals are only down three Music your way and so its a time to step up when people need you and uh youve seen some great stories and you know that same thing is going on down in some of the bad areas in the United States where otherwise you just got to step up during tough times Music Applause Music gal inbounding under their own hoop and they find Wilkinson and Jeremiah delivers again his second three how about that play call by Mark mson for the wide openen three cin corner there that just a great look and he knew who to get it to Wilkinson Wilkinson leads everybody with 16 but Watkins comes right back now he wont let him separate B hes that good a competitor I mean Cs trying to pull away on a normal day Cal maybe hes up double digits watching says No not tonight Im I got something to say about it and hes doing it and thats why you called it right coach thats why hes staying in with three fouls you need his offense hes too good P trus Cuts back door reverses it no good sooko had a shot at it up ahead to Yuan lays it in and theres a rim run too theyve been looking for that all game they finally got it and dont look now sa its a twopoint Applause game Campell pulls it back out Applause Music Applause petrius blocked by B Bo sasoko tried to dunk it and Drew the foul thats how good Marty sokos been tonight they every time Cals you think theyre going to walk away and not get a score hes there on an offensive rebound hes there securing the ball getting to the foul line hes put his imprint on this game I mean hes hes pursuing the basketball thats what good players do shot goes up he gets great inside position goes up keeps it up doesnt dip the ball draws the foul three fouls on Malik Yuan sokos a great story coach hes given a student visa so hes not allowed to profit from nil when he was at Michigan State he started a a nonprofit to build an elementary school in his hometown of Tanga foa before that you had to walk 2 hours there and back there was no school near him then he established a well to bring in clean water and now a hospital where pregnant women can be treated all right in his hometown of Tonga forya I say Hometown I said that to him he goes its not a town it is a village Y and when Monty goes back there he is a hero and rightfully so great story great kid I mean and Ive got to know him throughout this season hes Applause Music Applause special 4945 cow oh cow looking like theyre going to play a little Zone how about this for a change of pace maybe thatll slow down Watkins who has 14 for the Applause NOS dang with a long three no good Soko another board yeah I like the z d petrius up ahead tried to get it to Ola Joseph stolen by Watkins Watkins lays it in on the other end and now he has 16 now he makes it look so easy Dave hes got the ball in transition just keeps the head up keeps the ball on a string and finishes and you called it coach he is not letting the seminal get too far separated black Shir blocked from behind Soko Soko offensive glass and a foul underneath yeah those are hustle plays by Soko but you know Watkins is hes a big time player hes done that we talked about 34 you know double figure games on of 35 last games played I mean hes not going to let his team go down and hes a competitor hes a fighter and if youre Cal you got to find a way maybe to put a second defender on him hes that good four fouls on Malik Yuan who now has to sit yeah thats significant maluk comes back in a lot of basketball official get the ball to uh blackshire wasnt ready JV wasnt ready for it and said look come on I got to tie my shoes and you know coach you ready for this stat Cal has 19 offensive rebounds 13 defensive rebound thats incredible thats getting thats thats being aggressive Applause Music blacker off the dribble goes right at the bigger men ball blocked Here Comes Applause Den bour catches it now Watkins in the corner hes going to try to isolate you if you can offensive foul and thatll be the fourth on jir Watkins and now Leonard Hamilton will have some tough decisions now thats a huge play and guess whos involved once again it draws the fourth file Rus petritis and really Im not sure that the position was there was the off arm that caused it because Reus was still moving day but the off arm created the separation so Watkins sits yeah good break for the Bears that might have gone the other way but the off arm was the determining Factor so Watkins and Yuan both sitting with foul trouble see if Cal can take advantage Ola Joseph called for a carry yeah I think there was a hesitation he he rested in his hand uh thats a carry the ball the hand gets under the ball and then moves without you know dribbling it so good call by the officials Now cal will go back uh to the Zone Christian Tucker in the ball game veteran guard two three was effective last time with all the adversity the NS still hanging around just down by two dang left alone in the corner the tip is good B Bing above everybody yeah big time offensive tip Dave tied at 49 seminal wont go away I Ive been so impressed with their tenacity being a couple guys down and out down Watkins their leading score theyre still competing theyre the second tallest team in the nation theyre using that height to their advantage yeah its paid off be have been good offensively so seal are still going to have to get some stops only the Blue Devils taller in the nation and in the ACC Ola Joseph no good Davis The Freshman high up for the rebound defense defense dequon Davis draws the foul on Reus petritis so well take a break but the seals two men in foul trouble but still tied at 49 that has continued to be his strategy no and I think its a sound strategy I mean you can build in numbers and Mark Matson not too dissimilar in terms of his bench hes hes playing without his leading score and theyre theyre still producing and theyve got some guys that can play coming off the bench so you got to do that as a coach oh a defensive laps in the easy dunk for Florida State if they take the lead I think there were some confusion it appeared uh day between whether they still in man or still in zone I think some guys were in one and some guys were in the other so uh un unfortunately the Bears great break for seminal Deng has six in the corner Kell answers with the three cow retakes the lead well he can do that too thats a big basket to re you know to answer the the Bell there because you know the seminal have chance to extend the lead ball Bowen maluk lost it got it taken away lost it again here comes Wilkinson what a pass to ol of Joseph counted in the DK dve thats getting it done in transition how about the presence of mind to drop off and the rim run watch this play on this end here it is look at that wraparound full court pass it comes up to a streaking ol of Joseph wow for the dunk and the harm and the foul that was the assist of the night and to a right guy Ola Joseph has made five of his seven shots he now has 14 now that you know the Bears have had to do this because the semal have been so pesy theyve had to come up with some big answers and they have Music ball Bowen too strong and a tie up arrow goes to Florida State well Mark Manson not going to argue it he just said look we got to be a little tougher with the ball I like that coach how long do you leave Yan and Watkins on the bench they each have three fou you watch the score day but you also got to make sure they dont get cold and get stiff on the bench you dont want them coming back and not being effective so theres two factors you look at the score and then just some time you cant let him sit too long turn around good boy I just I I keep saying this but the seminal they they wont go away and Cs giv them every emotional play and shot that youd think would have extended this lead coach I said three fouls obviously they both have four fouls yeah four fouls so you have to determine you know when youre going to get them Watkins has been their biggest offensive threat now hes not going to be there in eternity thats for sure ol Joseph Lee Dort KS it in yeah hes had some big footb Backs from bears one right before half and that was huge oh 18 to 14 points a game is what youre missing when you have Lins and you and out of the lineup and Coach to your point if you sit too long you get rusty and lose your momentum dang misses Dort clears out ball gets to Turner dang almost stole Applause it Wilkinson for three ball on the floor bodies on the floor and now he jump ball and Cal will have this one hey you think these teams arent hungry today everybody on the floor loose balls mean a lot and these teams arent afraid these players arent afraid to get after it great action but you you know again your question I think you got to look at this you got to look at this but I mean first of all just look at the intensity you know both teams just not not afraid to get down there down and dirty and you you see everybody Joseph on there getting the tie up and thats a big basket for I mean a big possession for Cal to to hold on to that possession Applause Music see if we see mty Soko back in this game soon has had a tremendous first half in early second half as the ball goes through lead darts hands yeah I always had a philosophy I dont throw it above their head I throw it at their face because players going to catch it if you throw it at their face theyll catch it Dave I used to have that at one of my drills is that true thats true I said throw as hard as you can right in their face theyll catch those the hands will go up they wont drop those theyll go through once and they hits them in the head Dave theyll continue to put you R over their head thats what happened went right out of bounds not a bad philosophy no was pretty good Im sure your players loved you for that drill that we did that every Applause Music Applause Music Applause day back Davis inside tough shot defended well but B Bowen got an offensive glass he loses it that was a foul foul yeah good call uh but again this the seal just scrapping I mean theyre in there making something out of nothing and as you mentioned two players down starter when theyre leading assist guy out Swinton out and their two scores out he a reminder on Monday night dont miss our 2hour special is the Huddle cre will reveal this seasons ACC football schedule theyll break down each team and they look at Key weeks and specific matchups our coverage begins at 900 Eastern here on acc Network and the ES have Applause app bang spinning inside hes double team double dribble thats a turnover and a nice job defensively by C no great job because they had black Shire in the hole there having to guard a much taller player giving away a foot in height but the Bears did a great job of converging down and they do that they swarm the ball very well nice Music Applause Music Applause job blackshire pulls up the three ball was tipped so its way short but sasoko cleans it up and another offensive board and hoop for mty sasoko yeah hes been around the basketball around the rim all night long def defense Music Soko has 10 points and eight rebounds Campbell missed Applause Music it d is swatted by sasoko hes got four blocks Campbell Tucker to petrius petrius is fouled and he will go to the free throw line yeah great look by Christian Tucker the no look dropped it off to try to go to the line this has been a physical game bodies flying everywhere no team pulling away Cal trying to but Florida State wont go anywhere look out for that camera Campbell and youre not the only one Reus Petrus now one free throw away from his first career double doubles got nine points and 10 rebounds on his 22nd birthday there it is double double for number 31 yeah what a what a great performance and hes had to do that because the 7 old you know theyve stepped it up now but looks like theyre going to go back here just going to settle in see if they can get some executive stops which theyll need to put this team away Yan is back in the game with four fouls so is Applause Watkins Yan misses Watkins tips no good Soko with the board thats probably one of the easiest shots jir Watkins has missed I mean Point Blank just got it up there too quickly Mar Soko one rebound away from a double double Applause Music blackshire pulls back petritis right place right time again he has double trouble down there the Soko keeps it alive try to Johnny on the spot grabs it puts it in the basket Watkins first shot from coming off the bench cold but trius with eight offensive rebounds for the Bears theres that double team inside B Bowen couldnt get it to go now he hurried a shot cuz he had a mismatch black shirt no good B bone up high Applause b ball blocked by sasoko hes got five Applause blocks I dont think that sokos had a bigger game all year as hes had tonight Dave hes been on fire Here Comes Davis oh Yan tried to tip it no Yan again got it Music Applause Music the lead is Applause eight Now cal content to use a little clock coach on each possession yeah smart you dont want to let the Florida state get the Rhythm and score without taking some time Campbell sliced in did everything but lay it in he drew the foul DJ will go to the free throw line and shoot two well and Cal can do that theyve got tremendous oneonone players that can take you off the dribble theres not really a guard in this lineup guard or small forward that cant beat you off the dribble so its hard one of the hardest things in college basketball is containing the basketball you almost need a second Defender and Cals really good at you know spreading you out and taking you and by the way thats something that Andre sakovic has done all year hes been one of the best effective drivers but you know how about Ks performance in the wake of sto yakovich being out their leading score not in but theyre still playing a reminder on Sunday weve got three great womens Gams lined up for you 13th rank UNC hosts Florida State at noon Eastern then BC takes on Way Forest and after the gymnastics meet between Stanford and pit at 4 we will wrap things up with 20th ranked NC State hosting Virginia Tech at 6 Eastern all right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN d been impressed as I said with Florida State theyve just theyve stepped up but Ive been equally impressed with Cal because theyve stepped up to match the Florida States effort Watkins the left no good Soko another rebound well hes been Applause everywhere another solid performance from na Soko who has 10 points 11 rebounds and a careerhigh five blocks the high Archer by blacker he waited for all the Defenders to go up in the air come down into the crafty blackshire with the teardrop Cal with its largest lead timeout Florida State the California Golden Bears making a run without their leading score blackshire waiting for the whole world to come come down and then he goes up coming in people thought he was overhyped I dont I dont think they hyped him enough sometimes hes hes got a great IQ but hes skilled hes tough and I mean watch what he does this year hes already put his mark on college basketball Florida state is one of their last 13 you put any Merit into its pretty tough for an East Coast team to come all the way out here and play in these type gam I always think its tougher for a West Coast team to play because of the time zone but I the point is and your point is though daav youre right this cross country is is is its never been seen before its the first time really college basketball youve seen cross country League matchups it just doesnt happen three time zones uh guys playing you know with Barrow sleep youan with an offensive board lays it in and gets fouled and just what Leonard Hamilton wants a hoop a free throw and a stopped clock yeah thats a huge basket now can get down in again back to S single digits and and DeMark Matson not happy about that that opportunity to secure a rebound but uh look at the the some those keeping alive but you know you talk about cross country tracks and uh you know youre going to see some teams and some players that are going to go through a lot just because of the time change and their sleeping habits its tough it really is third foul on sasoka but they were pretty resilient D I remember you know you got to throw it out just its the same for both teams Applause Wilkinson going at the much bigger un defended him well trying not to pick up his fifth foul ball goes to Florida State and we take another timeout 341 remaining its m Bears up by 10 ass so mer Applause Music with Music Cal leads by 10 341 left in the second half Florida State a Monumental effort but right now Now cal has played very well theyre not in the lineup with their leading score Andre stovich so Wilkinson is first career start as 16 Reus petritis his first double double at Cal and Marty sissoko coach a careerhigh five blocks to go with a double double in points and rebounds yeah hes been phenomenal I think hes been really in many ways player of the game although pus you can make the case there and Wilkinsons done what he pretty much does every game but you again youre leading scores down and you have Str to step up they stepped up because they faced a really uh I think an aggressive and hungry Florida State team whos given him a lot tonight here Florida State now down by 10 under four to go whats the strategy well you got to put the ball in Jamir Watkins hands hes got to make a play for you he spins and does just that just didnt go Yan with a layup yeah might have been fou in the play but he got to where he wanted to get to Yan makes it A8 point game yeah and Coach Madson talked to his team specifically The Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson say he take some time were in the bonus lets not be in a hurry next time we go to the line we shoot two blacker also has shot a couple long threes early in the shot clock not needed with this big lead petrius inside Lees it first na Soko petrius with another great assist no hes just a hes a great teammate I I cant say enough about ptis he just really gives you what he what you need Watkins no good petrius with another rebound right sokos around to basket thats pretty good return for your for your dollar put in his hands hes finished for you Florida State cannot go bucket for bucket they got to get some stops now now you see Cal taking a little more Applause time loocks on their side Campbell no good you in the rebound noes trying to push theyve got a five on four as Campbells trailing and the Freshman Davis lets it in Campbell now pulls it back smartly using some clock eightpoint lead and now under two minutes they can play the clock out maybe for possession then state may have to play the foul game Applause ball will stay with Cal yeah I dont want to foul now on a short clock Manson will call a timeout struct his team exactly what he wants on these final few seconds of the shot CL yeah any foul and Cal will be shooting at the free throw line and Im sure hes going to tell his team that day you you got to remind players sometimes they get amnesia you get excited they coming up a big win against North Carolina State but now theyve got to you know try to secure one at home hey reminder we got a Full Slate of college basketball line up for you on Saturday February 1st thats next Saturday at all tips off at 2 Eastern with Florida State taking on Boston College followed by Virginia Tech versus Virginia then well cap it all off for Stanford battling SMU at 6 its all right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app coach whats your biggest takeaway of this game so far with like Florida State playing with Wilkinson whos whos played with trouble you got to look at his performance and again hes got the start hes going to get minutes whether he came off the bench or not but hes delivered and a lot of times guys go in the starting lineup Mark mats and I talked about that previously the season do you do you put him in the lineup or does he change what he does sometimes you like to leave a guy doing what he does but he has made made uh you know it hasnt affected him starting hes played awfully well hes carried this team offensively he still does what he does he gets to the rim uses either hand you know he maybe made one mistake down the stretch this game with that illadvised drive and turnover but hes going to give you uh a solid game so I like Jeremiah Wilson he averaged 12 points Off the Bench I can tell you what he averages as a starter 16 cuz hes only played one game as it started yeah I could figure that out too but but you know hes hes delivered and the the bottom line is you know some guys like the pressure and like the opportunity to start but sometimes they dont handle the pressure he has handled it the assignment I think he hes comfortable doing that you know its scary if Cal can get stovich back you know to add him now to this mix the way they played they they put on a pretty good show tonight against a very game 70 Squad he was Cs first signing under Mark Madson Id say it was a good one yeah no he was an important important signing now they can review this theyre not going to because its under two uh but I think if youre Florida State you got to try to get something pretty quick you cant Applause wait its an eightpoint game still plenty of time for Florida State Watkins had to go over Soko Yan didnt get it ball goes out of bounds itll stay with Florida State Reus Petrus says please review that yeah its reviewable it is thats what uh know players have their right and plus its a free timeout I I like this rule uh Florida States missed so many opportunities Dave inside I bet theres been about four or five point Blake tips but but lets look at this I think Watkins probably hit the ball last and you know a birthday guy knows you know hes on it hes going to be lawyer when he stops playing he made the made the right review but I like this rule Dave Id like that you can go to the monitor because these are twoo important of calls and and the officials you know we talked with the officials all three before the game that they they acknowledge that the monitors has made their job a little bit easier they have a tough job but the monitor can make it easier and definitive looks like that should be CAL ball absolutely if it is you could add to petritis 12 points points and eight offensive rebounds and 13 total rebounds a pretty good eye for referee I would say exactly lets give it one more look just to make sure its got to be remember when you review it and change it Dave its got to be definitive it cant there cant be any question its got to be absolutely unanimous do you think that is unanimous well it depends what angle you look at the one angle you and I just saw the second one looked pretty unanimous that last one was not as conclusive as I would like to see if youre going to reverse the call but this this is a big call with absolutely 128 left in an eightpoint game no they can cut it to two possessions on a main basket if they retain possession but you know youre youre Florida State youre talking in the timeout now of maybe who you can foul I think its off Watkins coach but I dont know if they think its definitive enough and thats what theyre going to talk about to overrule it yeah thats what theyre going to talk about and its got to be thats the rule you cant invent your own interpretation here its got to be unanimous um complete overrule now theres three officials somebodys got to break the tie thats true I told him that before the game veteran officials and they are going to keep it here which Im okay with because if its not definitive play on and and so and Mark Matson and staff will you know they understand theyre up now look youre up youre up eight points you Florida state will keep it and Reus petritis got the first thing wrong hes gotten wrong all night well he might not have been wrong we dont know thats a good point Applause Watkins deep in the corner Defender stays down Watkins goes up he now has 18 smart not to foul you give him that shot dont foul stop the clock and now you dont want to turn it over a good timeout by Cal because dont look now its a twopossession game plenty of time left so youve got to get the ball in youre probably going to get one crack at a steel a trap and then youre probably going to have to play a little bit of a foul game I dont know if you can play this all the way down the shot clock they theres just not enough time really to to to come back if you if you let too much time go off the clock coach Florida state has two timeouts left Cal has one Cals already in the bonus Cal has a couple fouls to give before Florida state will go to the free thr yeah well I think the more significant uh you know Factor now is what do you do if youre Florida State if you dont get a five count a turnover a 10sec count foul right away yeah then I think it comes across the 10sec line you got to play the foul game I dont know you can exhaust 35 or 30 seconds here theres just not going to be enough time left on the game so well see I mean you got to trust your defense a little bit you dont concede anything you try to get a steal if you can you dont want to give up anything over the top here though in the event of a jump ball Florida state has the arrow Cal breaks the press and theres the foul by Davis yeah and Im okay with that that thats you give yourself every opportunity to get a steal but now youve got over a minute to play a lot of possessions even if you give up one or two free throws maybe you put down get a three so youre still in position to claw back in this game Cals not out of danger so Campbell whos perfect today from the free throw line two for two and is an 80 free throw shooter at the line first one rolls in oh for roll Applause Campbell has nine and the lead is eight Applause one minute left as Davis goes down the lane draws the foul lets see if they call that on Soko yeah thats they called it on Wilkinson thats a good move by for the seminal because now you stop the clock and set up your press third foul on Wilkinson here it is you hes a little out of control now Davis lets the defender fly by by threepointer out Soko with another rebound Campbells ahead of everybody Campbell strip from behind by Davis what a defensive play yeah that was a really big time hustle to come back and stop that from becoming a really a dag or two you know again what do you do if youre Campbell you think you got a clear layup you dont really see anybody behind you coming that hard but boy thats hustle in Pursuit you could also dribble it out maybe and take some more time but you know its hard when youre full steam ahead to the Applause rip Cal got lucky ball went out of bounds but they say off Thomas Bears keep it not sure you dont review that too I would gives you a free Applause timeout probably going to be a quick foul again a quick trap and a foul Campell trap split it Runner good no hoop no basket they call that on the floor Mark Matson said what I played in the NBA that should have been continuation well that was a uh that was a quick trap he split the Trap youll see it producer all on this watch this replay there there was the reach in good call not a lot of contact but you saw it it was to reach in stop the clock Campell back to the free throw line still perfect five for five now you make this a double digit lead 10 points thats going to be tough for the seminal theres just not a lot of time left in this game but if youre Cal the last thing you want to do is stop the clock and foul Florida States got to go in a hurry Watkins for three no good dang with the rebound got Applause it you know your your Florida State Im or your Cal Im okay with that because it just they had to take a little time get it up the floor but its still you got to still play the uh safety game turnovers a no no secure the ball whos got the next jump ball its Cal you got to know that coming out of the timeout so if you get tied up youre okay get tied up but we talk about spreading the wealth coach five double digit scores yeah in points stepping up for Andre stovich now thats thats what you got to do when youre a man down Dave you you step up and I think Mark madsons team has always preached dep their coaching staff has always talked about their depth and its really nice to see when your team can step up and give you a performance uh when you need it and unfortunately Leonard Hamilton doesnt have that luxury uh with two of his guys down so uh but you got to play I mean uh you cant feel sorry for yourself you got to find some ways this ball gets inbounded do you foul immediately yeah I I think you have to I mean you might get a quick trap but if you they split the Trap you know they go deep going they went through wide almost yes they did now no one gets to wel in the foul now finally yeah maluk reaches in so there you you lose some valuable seconds and you know you dont probably think that Wilkinsons going to miss free throws hes hasnt missed too many tonight no he hasnt missed any hes two for two yeah so hes pretty tough but Cals got some good free throw shooters and some pretty good ball handlers but you know this a time really to go back reflect back what Rus petrius and what Marty coko has done for their team tonight has been really no and they can build on this they were very happy to come back with a win against North Carolina State but they certainly wanted to come back and get a win to that tonight just to secure some momentum a maluk fouls out physical game trying to guard Marty Soko is going to foul out a lot of people he was on fire Music tonight 27 seconds left Watkins no Soko another rebound and he is foul now fans starting to finally celebrate bears giving their Hometown fans something to celebrate for here at schools back in session and it makes a difference cuz you got your home CR your super section year and its been special here through the years of Cal band ma sissoko 12 points and 13 rebounds and five blocks oh by the way a career high hell remember this game and I I think the Bears can build on this because hes given them just a real effort what an effort tonight and hes an effort guy pretty good stat line 14 and 13 take five he can take Music it GIS with 8 seconds B bour hits the three but its going to be too little too late as theres 43 left p trius a little careless on that Applause inbound final 32 seconds left Mark mson still cant sit down thats how it is in coaching Dave just never never relax no you dont and and hes going to win this game but Ill tell you this team had to work and they did work they did great effort sooko good catch he doesnt have to do anything he can run it out and the bears with an impressive win without their leading score 7768 yeah I Dave I I really you got to give your ti
