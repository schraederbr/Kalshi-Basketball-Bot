the flu But Miller is back on the floor tonight And Ben Hammond will get the start for Mike Young to be able to match up a little bit with Bookie Miller Virginia Techs going to start in a 131 zone defense with great length on the top of the floor Mike Young says I feel like I need another pitch against this highscoring team Its something that hasnt seen a ton of And the Mustangs score against it with cement yolu 72 center from Turkey Yeah Yukatu is big and strong around the rim Hes a terrific finisher with two feet in the paint He is a challenge every night in this league Virginia Tech coming off a win over Cal on Saturday Moving past backtoback gutwrenching losses against Wake Forest and Stanford Both coming on last second threes Neo of Dallas the phenom from Greece misses Virginia Techs first attempt The Tech will pick up a mantoman defense So zone on mix man on miss to start the game Cory Washington lines it up and its an air ball from Washington who its been up and down in ACC play for Andy Enfield in year two Yeah last year one of the big surprises in this league their first year in the ACC This year Anfield knows it Theyre expected to contend in this league Last year 13 wins in league play tied for fourth got him in the NIT They were on the bubble but this year theyre squarely in right now according to Joe Lonardi Just glad that just about everyone is healthy at this point The flu ran through SMU last week as they prepared for Clemson and Duke Jaylen Bedford all the way to the rack Back in his home state from Austin about 3 hours south Thats Bedfords game right there Hes terrific on the ball defensively and he is a hard driver against a closeout Vidia Golu the tallest player in the ACC at 72 got past Christian Kak and he scores again Yeah when he makes up his mind that he wants to be aggressive like that play right there that is tough to deal with You got to have better pressure on the ball and try not to let him catch it so deep Hammond leads Virginia Tech in scoring an ACC play The skip over the head of Beford Thats what we illustrated in the open the double to the block They want you to throw it over the top Really good defense by SMU Seven years for Mike Young with the Hokes He knows this team has a high ceiling when theyre healthy and that is the key word Toby Lau nine games Tyler Johnson out again Hammond with the steal and the transition bucket And Hammond with another steal This time blocked by Igolu Gerak the follow off target And Ben Hammond is such a spark plug for Virginia Tech Jerome Pier Jr misses the layup This will be SMUs pace right here Up and down And Virginia Tech can score now They average 82 points a game And the quick pass Bedford too strong and cleared by Miller Whoopy Miller third in the league in scoring over 20 points a game One of their five in double figures Washington draws the foul Now Ben Hammond making an impact making his fourth start of the season tonight I mean watch how sloppy this is right here I mean youve got to anticipate Hammonds got a hand in the passing lane Its an uphill pass Hes trying to pitch it and then he makes another terrific play Just erases that mistake Now Washington at the line after the first foul of the game 83 music on the season ranking seventh in the ACC Boopy Miller leads the league at 93 One of the things you can count on from Mike Youngs team is they dont turn it over they dont foul and they do a pretty good job of keeping the ball out of the paint Now the difference is Eglu at 72 got great position early And Tombs is going to get an early checkin based on his incredible performance at Duke The young freshman 23 points set on 10 for 12 from the floor against the Blue Devils Breakout game for SMUs highest ranked freshman recruit And scoring over Tombs is Ammani Hanssbury Virginia Techs leading scoreer at 16 per game Really nice job in the twoman game on the naked side of the floor keeping the weak side busy so you dont have help at the rim Toby Lau also on the floor for Virginia Tech third game back from his foot injury that cost him nine games Heres Tombs freshman against freshman over Actales And Tombs with a soft touch The gifts are evident Tombs from Amarillo in West Texas but played his high school ball here in the DFW area at Dynamic Crest cheering They bring two to the ball screen trap on Dallas Bedford the step back over WASHINGTON AND HE CONNECTS Thats a three And Feders really got his motor going early here in the game and hes been terrific on the defensive end early Hes got the Pierre matchup when theyre in man Hes got 10 friends and family seated behind the Virginia Tech bench Again back in his home state from Austin Tombs for three in and out He can hit that shot Hasnt taken a ton of them so far in his freshman season Theyre going to trap that ball screen on the side They in trouble and its off his foot out of bounds to SMU You got to know theyre trapping that ball screen music A Dallas dribbles to the side of the floor and he gets trapped And then right here Tombos taking it right to the freshman Neo Abdales Bedford with the triple music Virginia Tech roll it They go four out one in And the way they move the ball and his teams are really good when they share it Right now 52 of their baskets are assisted I think thats a low number for his club Cory Washington is fouled beyond the ark Hanssbury cant believe it Three free throws coming Cory Washington with a triple and Hensberry is in his landing spot Thats a foul And Avdal is slow to get up Actually hes limping off the floor to the end of the bench So Cory Washington will get three free throws here Hansbury with his first but Buck marked this moment here with Neil Aales having to head to the bench music And Abdales the 69 point guard from Greece leads this team in assists top 10 in the ACC screaming Cory Washington puts a lot of pressure on your defense because at the four spot he can really shoot it He can really stretch out your defense around tombs Debbie you were at Clemson last week when SMU lost to the Tigers and Cory Washington went scoreless He fouled up and he didnt tell the coaches he was really feeling the after effects of the flu in that game We didnt know that he had had IVs and that he was not feeling well at all cuz he didnt want to tell the coaches cuz he wanted to play Following up with 11 against Duke Bedford has been in attack mode since the ball was thrown in the air and Bedford is headed to the line This is the play before with ADA getting hurt Looks like he uh hits his gets his foot caught on Cory Washington Hes over there massaging his left knee Maybe that IT bands got a got a shot And the last thing that Hokeie fans want to see considering all the injuries that they have endured already this season The Wild just got back Tyler Johnson out for a fifth consecutive game but Antonio Dorne is back The freshman center from Germany He missed the last five with a back issue cheering And we welcome those of you watching here on ESPN News at Moody Coliseum SMU trying to move back to 500 in ACC play Virginia Tech trying to move above 500 Ted Emmerick Debbie Anteneelli our entire crew Geron Pierre Jr knocks it down to give SMU the lead Its a really good call off the dead ball situation in free throws to get Jeron Pierre Jr going a little back down Barkley move to the block Weve got SMU five players that average in double figures They lead the league in scoring but dont sell out on their defense I think their defensive effort is really good most nights Jaylen Bedford the Texas native has been aggressive in his return to his home state Couldnt get that floater to drop Washington in deep against the sevenfooter Dorne Ball tapped around and controlled by Bedford Benford off the screen from Dorne Ben Hammond such a spark plug Making his fourth start of the season tonight and over the 72 Yigu He hits really nice job of not over penetrating You know if you get that deep Iu is going to block your shot One of the top shot blockers in the ACC And Boopy Millers fouled by Ben Hammond on the perimeter Watch Hammond right here Hes going to come off two screens First Lel and then Dorne And he doesnt over penetrate Pulls up and hits the midrange jumper Hammond had a 30point game against Virginia That triple overtime win on New Years Eve to start conference play Getting the start tonight because hell be tracking Boopy Miller quite a bit right now trying to keep up with BJ Edwards off the hands of Ilu and a foul Antonio Dorne the freshman sevenfooter against sevenfooter trying to keep up Well they need Dorne and his size and frame against Egu Hes got five fouls to give and Mike Young doesnt like to foul but hes going to need some muscle on the block to be able to match up a little bit with number 24 in white Dornes first action in ACC play after dealing with that back injury You can get gives it to Edwards and Edwards couldnt get it to drop an offensive rebound Its Jermaine ONeal Jr the freshman and yes the son of the former sixtime Allstar What a play He just rips that rebound away off the miss from Hammond SMU on the move The top scoring offense in the ACC 89 points a game PIERRE BIG REASON WHY AND an opportunity for the transfer from Jacksonville State music When you have this much firepower offensively and youre used to playing with a ball in your hands if you go rebound you can get in transition and up the floor And thats exactly what weve seen Geron Pierre Jr do twice Hes been on the defensive glass and hes initiated their break Debbie he hasnt been at his best as ACC play has started His numbers a little down Hasnt been as efficient as he was in the nonconference but as Andy Enfield says its all about shot selection for him fitting in with Boopy Miller and BJ Edmonds Well when you average 22 points a game from in your previous school youre used to having the ball in your hands a lot And when you have this much balance and youre playing with this kind of talent sometimes you just got to go to the glass and generate it yourself And thats what hes done You can see hes got a motor on the boards tonight Foul was called on Germaine ONeal Jr there his first Hansbury can get into some maybe pick and pop action as well with Ilu guarding him They could put him in some ball screens He likes to play in drop coverage and Hansbury has become a really good threepoint shooter for Virginia Tech Virginia Tech couldnt cash in there but youre right Hansberry guy that another player that the Hokes can play through and even more important right now depending on how Neil Abdales is doing Abdales is back on the floor Shaken up earlier Jaden Shu picking the pocket of Pierre Hammond feeds it to ADL Hammond all day to think about it Offensive board by Hansberry Dallas swings it and the extra pass Lel off the mark Hes hit only two threes all year When Jaden Shu has a look at the basket and hes in the slot he needs to take it Being unselfish right there Ju hit 42 of those Toby Lau has hit two on the season Edwards cut off Hate to shoot for Yugatu the post over Hansbury Too much on it but an offensive board by Jim Shot clock doesnt reset because it didnt touch the rim And its a shot clock music violation against SMU Timeout in Dallas as SMU music tries to make it back to 500 in ACC play music And SMU had a onepossession game in Cameron inside two minutes Poopy said Im feeling amazing Hes yet to really get going in this game but Im sure hes got to shake a little rust off from missing a couple of days of practice with the flu Crazy Andy Enfield told us Hubby Miller lost 7 lbs in that bout with the flu last week but has been practicing here early in the week Bedford misses the scoop and its cleared by SMU Miller has not taken a shot from the floor yet I think he tries to get everybody going early and then hell pick his spots that is his spot down low Couldnt finish what Jamie Tombs does I think Andy Enfield likes playing with Igolu and Tombs together As Tombs develops as a defender hes going to get more minutes Thats a lot of size for anybody in the league to deal with on the front line Virginia Tech has missed its last five shots They havent scored in almost three minutes Late in the shot clock in the hands of Bedford again Lau trying to create over to Abdales Neil Odoll has not hit the three in ACC play so far Just 22 Good Beautiful Tombs understands when THE DOUBLE COMES DIVE TO THE BUCKET which is exactly what he did Really good read slashing met by Tombs but he draws the foul There are 33 NBA scouts representing 30 teams here Yeah how about that Well theres 30 teams in the Who said multiple is the question Multiple laughter Checking out Neo Abdales the freshman from Greece 69 point guard I talked to a couple of scouts in the building and asked about him specifically and they love the way he doesnt get sped up They see all of his skill set Oh Tom what a wild finish there at Stegman Coliseum We welcome you to the Hilltop here at Moody Coliseum in the ACC SMU and Virginia Tech going headtohead SMU trying to get back to 500 in conference play A clean start offensively for the top scoring team in the league at 89 per game and a balanced effort so far Five different players scoring Germaine ONeal Jr one of them the son of the 18year NBA veteran That one doesnt drop but itll stay at this end for SMU Boopy Miller is back in the lineup Did not play in Saturdays loss to Duke with the flute He has not scored yet We were told maybe there would be a minutes restriction but so far it looks like the normal Poopy Miller outside of the lack of score Well SMU started the game getting points in the paint going inside the Eat at 72 and Virginia Tech doesnt have anybody that can match up with that kind of frame Off the M for three and its pulled in by Ammani Hansbury Virginia Techs leading scorer and rebounder head to Christian Herd surrounded inside and its a tie up Virginia Tech ball thanks to the arrow and Jaden Shu was spotted up in the deep corner the best threepoint shooter on Virginia Techs team number two in Orange Keep your eye on him on this out of bounds play Theyd like to shake him free for a triple 43 on the season third in the ACC Dallas sends it into Hansbury The West Virginia transfer The skip Bedford back in his home state of Texas off the mark The offensive rebound here A shoot in and out Long rebound and looks like music itll stay with Virginia Tech Looks like there was a foul Boy BJ Davis Ray was chasing after it for SMU Ted I think the coh refs were coming together to make sure they got the call right Eric Lewis came in and had out of bounds Virginia Techs ball So just Hokes basketball No foul on the play And another crack at it for Virginia Tech Shoot gives it up Heres Hanssberry Kudak An offensive rebound Another chance for the Hokes Bedford tes it up and that goes down A triple The first field goal for Virginia Tech since the 1349 mark And a timeout music music You give Virginia Tech enough opportunities eventually going to cash in and Jaylen Bedford sure did Well its just a really good job of moving the ball and playing off the glass Right as soon as Gerdak gets the rebound hes immediately kicking it out to the three Nice ball fake to set up this triple for Bedford Abdales with that 69 frame Sees over the top of every defender that comes at him Yeah Abdales 69 not really the next Greek freak He is not in the mold of Giannis His role model is Luca Donuch That is his style of play Just an ultra playmaker as a freshman Igatou throws it away A turnover by SMU Its all about real estate for IU If he catches it with two feet in the paint hes going to score it But if you can push him off the block or up the lane just a little bit and make him make a decision with the basketball you have a better chance of defending him You see Virginia Tech enduring quite the drought but still within four here Just over eight and a half to play in the first half Hanssberry on the move He muscles it in with a foul That is a wait room bucket for sure Ted He fakes the dribble handoff and turns the corner This just a big time move by Hansberry fake the dribble handoff and get to the paint handle the contact and get a trip to the line Debbie its his third school in three years from Illinois where he barely played a couple of years ago West Virginia definitely a contributor for the Mountaineers last year but man he has taken his game to another level this year at Virginia Tech I asked him if he minds playing undersized and he said Im not undersized He was quick to make sure I understood that at 68 I was considering him undersized considering your point guard 69 and he usually has a taller defender on him 240 lbs on that 68 frame But he also told me how hard hes worked on his skill set to be able to pick and pop and add that to his game consistently Bedford kicks it Ben Hammond and out to SMU music Virginia Tech two of nine from beyond the arcy year old son Joey at the time And uh Germaine saw us invited us into the locker room really made a big deal about my kid and gave him a pair of shoes And my son still has those shoes and its a part of his shoe collection that hes very proud of So I thought it was pretty cool and I hope I get to tell Germaine myself that story Did Joey ever put them on Uh when he was 10 he put them on Yes But uh no not him in a game No way No those are in a special spot in uh in his room Crafty move by VJ Edwards a senior from Knoxville former Tennessee Volunteer now his third year with SMU Virginia Tech two for their last 12 from the floor Theyre shooting just 33 They run good false action get moving off the timeout and they go single side twoman game and Hammond gets to the rim Really well done by Mike Youngs team off the timeout Hammond now with six in the starting lineup This is the fourth time this season for the Hokes Washington tough shot from the baseline Thats a really good offensive play Good defense better offense Heres Abdales A reason that 33 NBA scouts are in attendance tonight Yes 33 scouts from 30 NBA teams Late in the shot clock Hansberry got double Gerak is fouled Geron Pierre Jr the last line of defense Well we got college basketball after after dark 11 Eastern on ESPN 2 tonight We are off to Provo 11th ranked BYU hosting TCU and a chance to see another player that NBA scouts are very much interested in the Cougars AJ Debansa Debonsa is really mustsee TV one of the top freshman in the country Of course the ACCs got a lot of good really good freshman including Caleb Wilson at North Carolina and Cameron Boozer at Duke who leads the nation in scoring Waiting for Muel Brown from Louisville to get back for the Cardinals And all those scouts are watching this game tonight in person Im sure theyll have the TV on watching the next one Yep Go back to the hotel Check out AJ Debonsa in action Former number one player in the ESPN 100 Could very well be the number one pick in the NBA draft this summer Ruby Miller returning from the flu that kept him out Saturday against Duke Miller over two from the floor Hasnt scored yet third leading scoreer in the ACC and the foul is called here I was going to say Hammond is doing a really good job of tracking Boopy Miller Its part of the reason why Mike Young gave Hammond the start tonight music Little over 20 points a game for Boopy Miller Now hes going to get a chance to see a big basket at the free throw line He is third in the league in scoring right now And Debbie what what is also standing out about Miller this season its an efficient 20 and a half points per game Hes so close to the 50 40 90 club He is the music best in the ACC at the line at 93 shoots a three at 43 and just under 50 from the field I think he has really worked on his game Andy Enfield told him If you want to play in the NBA there not a lot of 511 guys in the NBA that average four assists And he has upped his IQ his level of play Hes terrific in ball screen action and he leads the ACC in assists right now at 71 A rare miss at the line for Poopy Miller Came in 98 of 106 Thats like you in the offseason D free throws Youre better than that Wow On the attack Oh my goodness Boy hes got a 49 and a half vertical for a reason We just saw it right there Hang time Ammani Hansbury out of the game right now He picked up his second personal and that foul against Miller So keep an eye on that for Virginia Tech as Miller hits his first field goal I love the ghost action on one side of the floor for Andy Enfields team especially when its Poopy Miller So tough I mean they run that ghost action usually in the middle third A lot of teams do but they run it on the side and its really can be confusing for the defense And what did SMU coaches say at shoot around today Virginia Tech doesnt handle the go screen well Expect a steady diet here tonight cheering Shoot from the corner An appropriate name Jaden Shu connects Thats his game right there He gets his feet set in that deep corner Really stretches your defense Jones off way off the mark I dont think thats the first option Dallas offline and Germaine ONeal Jr with the rebound for SMU Edwards working against Alleswell erases it Loose ball coraled by Tombs ONeal on the drive and the pull up is short Toby the wall really doing a good job on the glass right now Chance to tie or take the lead A Dallas wants the lead and its in and out for the freshman from Greece Edwards got everybody off their feet and turns too strong with it Mike Young wants his team to settle down right here I try to get Jaden Shu going His have done a nice job hanging in there even though they have not been that clean offensively tonight So here comes Shoot off the stagger A run off by ONeal Jr Six to shoot for Hammond over Miller Couldnt bank it in cheering now Miller on the move Got cut off and Bobby Miller knocks it down He called for that step up and BJ Edwards ghosted out of it And thats what Im talking about right there Ted because it just makes the defense hesitate Are you switching Are you staying And just for that half a second and thats all that groupy needs to get past you So five for Miller Low from the outside Thats a swish JUST THE THIRD THREEPOINTER OF THE SEASON for Toby Lau That looked pretty good coming off his hand and confident to take it He was two of 15 on the year coming in Miller misses a three Low Another rebound The pass ahead shoot GIVES VIRGINIA TECH THE lead for the first time since it was 98 music at 69 You can see over the top or through Great advanced pass and shoot music runs ahead of the basketball to Gil High School The Hippos the great mascots here in the state of Texas and Bedford the well earned breather at this point Hookies have the lead So they go Spain action in the middle third and Virginia Tech does a really good job defensively of getting a deflection So still SMU ball with 12 to shoot What a toughminded team on the road Virginia Tech Miller over Hammond Nice close out by Hammond Washington cleans it up Seven offensive rebounds for SNU Plus five on the glass in this first half A Dallas thought about it trying to shake Pierre Oh Dallas with the footwork How pretty was that So when you come to defend him right now at 22 from three youre not going to come all the way out with a long close out You need to play him as a driver and especially with the smaller guards he can back down and score Tombs answers for SMU as the lead seesaws back and forth Now Andy Enfield has high praise for Tombs He was telling us today at shoot he missed the first two months of the season And hes really coming along of Dallas the rim with the three Miller the long rebound Mustangs on the move Sets up Pierre for the triple Two for one opportunity here for Virginia Tech as SMU is really pushing tempo That was SMUs first three of the game See how quick the Hoks want to be Like you said two for one opportunity Lo on the take and he draws the foul So Abdollis is 0 for four from three So when you come out to defend him dont take that shot fake Stay on your feet Instead he just takes you down in the paint and uses that 69 frame And on the other end Pierre advanced pass up the floor He runs to his spot and Boopy Miller does a really good job getting an advantage there twoonone in transition You know Andy Edfield says maybe last year Boopy Miller forced things a little bit Now he is actively looking for his teammates in exactly that kind of situation Low at the line for Virginia Tech I think his tendency is to get everyone a touch get them involved and he has done that for SMU They have played eight players and seven have scored And he leaves the league in assists and he understands who to get the ball to when and where I call that the three Ws of a good point guard Second half though cheering Ted hes going to be looking for his own offense So Virginia Tech is going to get the ball back Twopoint game and about an 8sec difference between the clocks A Millers pass intercepted by Abdales using his length to his advantage and Lel fouled again Really good read defensively by Abdales and Low is doing a really good job getting to the rim right here Boopy turns it over He doesnt turn it over very often That uphill pass Virginia Tech ready for anytime you pass it from the baseline back up to the top or from the wing back to the top of the floor Thats a great time to try to get that pick six cheering Wow Three for three at the line tonight 77 on the season Now Lau just got back for Mike Young This is his third game back after missing nine with a stress fracture and his left foot Had surgery December 4th Had a screw put in and theres no more minutes restriction for him even though hes coming off the bench since returning Final 10 seconds Pierre against Bedford launching from deep So SMU cant extend the lead but they do have the onepoint lead at the end of the first half And Anfield walks off shaking music his head disappointed in that last possession Virginia Tech hanging in there even though Ammani music Hansberry their top score was dealing with foul trouble didnt play the last few minutes of the half Off to the studio right after this Eight points six boards for Tombs coming off his breakout game 23 points in that loss to Duke on Saturday when SMU did not have Boopy Miller Miller has the ball now Of course back on the floor tonight Five points three assists in the first half for Miller One of the best point guards in the country coming in I think Boopy will get going here in the second half Hell start calling his own number a little bit more Washington trying to drop it off and in a tangle Yiglu hitting the deck along with Hansberry and its a tie up SMU ball Boy Yiguto its 72270 hitting the deck And like you said in the first half Monty Hanssbury uh hes not exactly undized even at 68 in the middle at 240 lbs himself Yeah See I think IU is a rim roller Hes a lob catcher Hes a putback drop off guy in the post If you throw a bounce pass to him you better make sure that he can catch it Ill be your pardon Virginia Tech with the arrow So the Hokes have it shooting 42 in the first half Pier ones trying to keep up with the 69 freshman and Odales scores off the window And 33 NBA scouts are in attendance Now Dallas looks to be a first round pick and could be better than that Come the summer down low Yikatu in a crowd and Aales takes it away The no look to Bedford and Bedford scores Hes in double figures with 11 I think when SMU gives Egolu the basketball in a position where hes got to make a choice its tough for him I mean he needs to catch it with two feet and just go to his goto He doesnt even need to counter Just overpower at the front of the rim And to your point Debbie about Boopy Miller there is Miller looking for his own and he draws the foul against Bedford Its hard to keep one of the top scorers in all of college basketball in check He is so athletic He is so good off the bounce He reads the second and the third level so well For Andy Enfield it is not Boopy on the birth certificate by the way Hes Kevin Miller He had an uncle named Boopy And mom decided you know I like that name but lets change one letter So Boopy it is And by the way when mom gets mad to this day Boopy says she still calls me Boopy not Kevin laughter Andy Enfield says You can call yourself whatever you want to be called as long as you can put 20 points on the board for his team He brings SFU to within a point Hammond against Miller That is such a fun matchup tonight Dallas against Edwards A stingy defender See they were trapping out Dallas in the first half They didnt trap him that time on Fster Hanssberry Fouled by Yugato whos incredulous late in the shot clock The whistle blows Romani Hanssbury is one of the most consistent guys for Mike Young every day energy He said he stirs the pot for his team And I asked him about it and he said Yeah every day I bring the energy Im Ive worked on my game I want to win He said I want to win and do whatever it will take to make as many winning plays as he needs to make in a game Thats what you want around your team Thats the kind of attitude you need If everybody thought that cheering and felt that way and wasnt worried about their own doing whatever you got to do to get your team a W I love the word that Mike Young uses too He says Ami Hansbury is the best connector I have ever coached on and off the floor The intangibles the IQ Miller hits for SMU So creative in his shot making ability I mean he knows if he goes right up under the the basket its going to get blocked Miller had five points in the first half music Hes got four here in the opening minutes of the second half Haymon got past Miller setting up Guilford who missed the three And now Miller on the run Got stopped by Hanssbury Miller trying to take advantage Now hes got another Yak Here comes the isolation Get out of the way Miller trying to create him and comes to dig Has to give it up Edwards against Alis the drop off Good stuff for Hugo This PJ Edwards making that play happen He had to handle the point guard responsibilities in the Duke game I thought he did well Had a big game for them 20 points five assists against Duke the other night Dallas trying to get past Edwards at this end Got deflected and itll stay with Virginia Tech Look at Boopy playing off two feet Fade away off the baseline and then Edwards right here Plays broken down So what does he do He tries to get the ball inside Iu does a great job of sliding into his vision moving up the lane so he can drop it off Under 12 to shoot for Hanssbury comes out on the show Bedford that footwork to elillude Yigolu Thats a big time move right there Playing off two feet playing on balance His back in front Edwards again against Alis The turnaround Heres Bedford A Dallas wants it Hes asking for a clear out Hes going to back down right here Hes got five inches on BJ Edwards The extra pass from Hannon Bedford off the mark but Hansbury the offensive rebound Hannon lets it fly and he buries the triple cheering His first three tonight Its the largest lead for Virginia Tech which trailed by nine in the first half Miller cant answer with a three Bedford up the floor of Dallas with the layin Virginia Tech can run two and its usually of Dallas music sending the pass ahead This time the recipient Watch Bedford right here What a game Off two feet playing the game on balance music Finishing at the rim Hammond for triples Virginia Tech music Jaylen Bedford had six games of double figures coming into this one on the season and he has been fantastic Advanced pass up the floor to Dallas who gets behind SMUs defense in transition If Bedford can bring that kind of consistency gives them another player that can put pressure on the rim off the bounce in their ball screen activity and certainly his ability to shoot the three as well Thatll help him put even more pressure on the rim Jaden Jones back on the floor for SMU Had 86 rebounds in the first half Edwards cant finish The wall is just owning the glass Done a fantastic job rebounding Hes got six boards to go with eight points in his third game back from his foot injury handed trying to feed a cutting Hanssberry and out of bounds music Just a timeout Fourth turnover for Mike Youngs team and he doesnt like it music These are the three longest tenur head coaches in the ACC Now yeah 16 years for Brad Brownell Big game on Saturday Miami and Clemson both undefeated going into Little John Coliseum Brad now 27 wins last year had to replace the starting five and theyre right back at it You can tell those scores out of the timeout for SMU to make it a fourpoint game Yeah you were there at Little John last week when Clemson beat SMU part of what has been a roaring start to league play for the Tigers SMU scores inside goes to the zone We havent seen any zone in this game yet This is the first possession And Hansberry is fouled I think before the shot music And Mike Young is going to counter with Jaden Shoot if theyre going to go with zone Lets see if Andy Enfield stays in it If Shoots on the floor you better know where he is Its all in a name Yeah No theyre going back to manto man Yep There shoot off the curl STILL LETTING IT FLY AND STILL HITTING Sharp shooter with a foul music What a great job of setting his feet Watch him come off the screen All Hansbury has to do is just get a piece of ONeal which he does Just enough to give Jaden Shu an opportunity to catch and shoot which is something he does extremely well Ted I watched all of his threepoint makes on Synergy today and I charted them Coming into the game he had made 43 28 of them were catch and shoot 14 he had one dribble And there was one other triple where he had two dribbles You got to run them off the threepoint line Virginia Tech is so creative in getting in those looks All he needs is just a fraction of air space Trying to feed Yolu and a foul called Antonio Dorne back in the game The freshman in his first ACC game He missed the last five overall with a back injury and he picks up his second personal Miller gets the screen from Tombs Tombs inside to Mont keeps it alive and scores again Big rebound He had Dorne under the basket and he used that 72 reach to be able to gather that rebound and finish Back to back basket for Kentucky And now the steal BY BOOPY MILLER STREAKING ahead and hes fouled Neil Aales preventing the layup music Watch Eaton right here He gets Dorne under the basket He just reaches over the top and puts it away over that left shoulder Its real estate for him Ted when he catches it that close or he rebounds it at the rim And now Miller the top free throw shooter in the ACC 93 at the line Second miss tonight Theres no such thing as he announces Jinx I promise you Tomorrow on ESPN 2 big time womens match up in the SEC Madison Booker and number four Texas against Choice Edwards and number two South Carolina Coverage tipping off 7 Eastern Its a rematch from November when the Longhorns handed the Gamecocks their only loss of the season They have played six times in the last calendar year And each time theyre both in the top five and you just mentioned two players that are all Americans South Carolina has a 32 edge this in this sixth meeting Dallas changing directions now Walled off by Yigatu Under 10 to shoot Back to Lal for three Boy hes tried that all night Hasnt gone down very often Dorne with a tough rebound inside Wants to travel The whistle does blow and its a foul Officials come together make sure they got the foul not the travel right here in traffic Thats a big time board Eric Lewis thought the contact created the travel Thats why the foul first And its the third on Cory Washington Hes trying to keep up with ADA right now Shoot Just off target Well hes so good off those pin downs His acceleration on his exit cut to get into the rhythm of a shot is excellent Speaking of acceleration Miller rejected by Lel Man can he get up Where did he come from The weak side Watch Llewell Hes involved in ball screen coverage and he comes all the way from the other side of the rim My goodness Puts it in the fifth row I think they need to measure the vertical again It might be up to 50 at this point Forget 49 12 in from a couple of years ago when he was at VCU Washington against Opales Now Pierre shot clock dwindling Tombs launches a three and the rebound to shoot I mean Pierres got the basketball and he gives it up in a late clock to Tombs for a three Hes got to get to the rim Hammond with the floater for Virginia Tech Theres not many times that Boopy Miller is going to face up against somebody that is almost identical in size to him And Hammonds having his way Now Tombs inside the arc gathered his own miss And Tombs goes glass for two This has been a fun match up to watch and Miller list Miller at 6 ft Haymond at 511 HAYMON GOT THE STEP IS DENIED BY TWOS Pierre comes away with it and Miller is fouled by Jaden Shu Time music out Dallas Watch this block music What a great play right here by Tombs to ignite their music transition game music for the Hokes This would be their second quad one victory of the season The other one to open conference play in triple overtime music against Virginia I dont think Joe Lonard is in the bunker yet but hes probably pretty close Hes preparing the bunker He is stocking it with supplies Theres a lot more quad one opportunities this year Thats why last year the ACC with four teams in the tournament and North Carolina playing in the first four This year theres going to be eight or nine teams Just a chance to stack that resume And Virginia Tech with JADEN SHU KNOCKING DOWN THREES A chance to bolster that resume tonight You have to run him off the threepoint line and he does such a good job of setting up his ability to catch and shoot with his footwork and his exit cuts Miller feeds Jason to the freshman whos got a dozen points to go with eight rebounds What a followup from his breakout game when he had 23 against Duke Saturday Ammani Hanssbury post to post Gordonette in a tough spot trying to KICK IT OUT ITS OVER THE head of Bedford A turnover Virginia Tech wondering was that tipped by SMU Its Mustang ball Watch how Chute runs into his jumper He does a great job of being ready on the catch and the passes in the pocket And then Tombs on the other end Hes just burying the Virginia Tech front line Miller has been ultra impressive here in the second half Just like you said Debbie he sets up his teammates in the first and then he goes to work FOR cheering WINNING PLAYS for himself in the second Millers got a dozen coming back from the flu Pier doing a good job getting over the top of that and contesting Good for the step back portions of the rebound for SMU You do not want to get screens Pierre did a good job of getting off that screen Pierre the quick move and he lost the handle Boy trying to feed Tombs a steal for the Hokes Hanssberry on the drive hanging missing Bedford with the follow What a game for Bedford in his return to the Lone Star State Hes got 15 Miller to the rack and hes fouled Watch the hang time of Bford crashing the offensive glass Hanssbury does a good job of getting it up on the board And then thats just a pursuit of the basketball And the guards for SMU have got to do a better job on the glass right now You cant just rely on Tombs who does have a careerhigh rebounding number So Miller at the line a dozen in the game seven since halftime Hes just four for six so far making it five music for seven Thats notable because hes 93 on the season The other thing too is for Virginia Tech Ted they are averaging 30 free throws a game in conference play and they have not been able to get to the free throw line as much tonight Hes missed three free throws that he had missed a total of eight all season coming into tonight And Miller is five for eight in the game Three misses on the attack Cut off by a turnover Mike Young his team has done a nice job taking care of the ball for the most part tonight Just the seventh turnover of the game Miller being chased by Bford trying to shake him And Poopy Miller what a handle You have to get on him just to stay in front So Andy Enfield put shooters in the corner and he goes twist action with Eglu on the top of the floor and Boopy just reads it and plays off it This is where he is so good in his IQ So good at getting to the free throw line almost seven free throw attempts a game And Jaylen Bedford Debbie picked up his third personal and the leading scoreer in the game with 15 points I dont think Mike Young needs to make a decision on that Hes playing so well The media timeout is getting ready to come up too music So thats more like it from Miller who gets the rare breather the ACC leader in minutes played as Germaine ONeal Jr returns for the Mustangs A lot of minutes with Tombs and Egatu together for SMU Save by Under 10 to shoot for Bford thought about it NOW HE DOES AND Tombs pulls it in Dallas is 0 for five from outside the ark ONeal Now Dallas on the break The quick passive blocks GOING UP TAKEN AWAY BY SMU here chases it down and left it short Vertical at the rim Up and down we go Bedford from the corner SPLASH HERE WE GO TED this is awesome You think Jaylen Bedford loves playing back in his home state or what 10 friends and family on hand on the block against the freshman Gerak Extra feed Pierre He knocks it down Answer for the Mustangs This is shot making going on now Got past Edwards AD Dallas thought about the step back Passed it up Eight to shoot Mismatch Freshman against freshman HANSSBERRY BACK TO ALIS THE LOGO THREE HANSBERRY THE OFFENSIVE REBOUND SLOTTED BY NIKOLU Edwards the other way Lost it Going up Pansbury all the way to the rim block BY ONEAL BUT FOLLOWED BY BEDFORD Hes stuck with it and hes got 20 for Virginia Tech What music a sequence for Mike Young and his team WE HAVE SOME SHOT MAKING going on now music The three by Benford in the deep corner in transition SMU doesnt match up and then its Pierre right back at you of heart rending losses to Wake Forest and Stanford music on last second threes This team would be 80 in games decided by six points or fewer They would be on a ninegame win streak And Debbie they find themselves in another close game right now A onepossession game at Stanford or Stanford at home in a loss Cal a win is what theyre coming off of But they have two possessions they could be undefeated in the league Thats how tight the margin of victory is and how hard it is to win in the ACC Hes trying to become the first team to beat SMU on its home floor this season Mustangs 100 and looks like a foul inside Yollu and the freshman Dorne were tangled up and thats going to put Yugato at the line for one and one with SMU in the bonus You got to be ready to rebound He is not a great free throw shooter Just 53 on the season First trip to the line tonight 72 sophomore from Istanbul and Dorne corrals the rebound So not a bad foul Now you start looking at it that way with Dorne using up his his personal fouls which is good for Virginia Tech to keep an eye on that Oh Hammond slipped and Miller comes away with it and Miller got hammered by Dorne I think theyre going to take a look at this and I think theyre going to upgrade it Hes an airborne shooter and thats a hard foul Of course the key words here Debbie something thats excessive in nature Well take another look Excessive unnecessary and avoidable music Boy tangled up with the arm as well on the opposite side The call on the floor is a common foul The review is for a potential flagrant one foul Pat Driscoll the lead official filling us in Debbie youre all over it The question now for Antonio Dorne will it be upgraded to a flagrant foul Well hes an airborne shooter And I I think this is not going to take long And Boopy Miller is probably fortunate Debbie that there wasnt more contact there The way Dorne reached back or that he didnt fall on him That too Officials did not take long at the monitor Contact to the head Airborne is always an F1 Pad Driscoll What will it be And maybe hes not ready You know as it is its the fourth on Dorne music Boy Driscoll and his officials they left the monitor to discuss it They came back Now theyre going back to discuss a little bit more music Watch Boopys eyes right here He sees the contact coming Hes not even looking at the basket until last second music You know it honestly Debbie it looked worse in real time I could have made a lot more contact with that hand coming down the whole arm He kind of missed Miller Its an airborne shooter Its Its an F1 Not Not arguing that it is not a flagrant For Poopy Millers sake hes probably fortunate that Dorne did not make more contact And it appears that it has been upgraded Boy Mike Young making a little contact with Pat Driscoll too And hes Were not even going to get the announcement cuz Boopy Miller is all alone at the line Four free throws hes missed Would you say he missed eight on the season all year 98 of 106 And Miller is seven of 11 tonight Four misses in this game cheering He splits the pair Check out Mike Young here Oh just be careful music Having a discussion with Pat Yep Yep music So the two shots for Miller He split the pair music and the Mustangs retain possession down by four under six to play music SMU trying to rebound from the backtoback road losses to Clemson and Duke last week Miller wants it back from Yugato Got past Hammond missed it Lal there to challenge Hammond the other way Bfords at the hot hand Oh couldnt connect with Lau A turnover by Virginia Tech This is pooping Miller time though Put him in a ball screen and let him go Hes got 17 points and four assists in his return from the flu that kept him out Saturday He sets up Edwards PAM OH WOW FROM TOBY WOW Climb the ladder Theres the 49 12 inch vertical big to big and out of bounds Still SMU ball He throws this ball to the top of the backboard Its even Its not even at the box Its above the box music A stratosphere that only Toby Lau can reach Boy he got fouled too with no whistle there There was contact Tombs backing down Hansbury the veteran got pushed off his spot Had to kick it out Miller launches Pierre the offensive rebound Fresh shot clock for SMU The turnaround goes for Jeron Pierre Jr cheering Abdulis puts it in He passed up the three and made the right decision He hasnt made one and he shot fakes and gets in the paint Winning time Winning plays Aales with 10 Miller draws contact And hes headed to the line The foul on Hansbury music his third Timeout here on the Hilltop Toby Lal going to the top rung of the ladder for Virginia Tech music and Neo Abdales The freshman Fenom making plays Hooks looking for a big road win All on their home field against Miami the Heisman winner Fernando Mendoza and number one Indiana Miami of course representing the ACC And what a game we have here in the ACC in Dallas Ted Emer Debbie Anteneelli ready for the final four minutes Virginia Tech trailed by as many as nine in the first half up six now and trying to take it to the finish line but so tough with Boopy Miller at the line here for SMU Virginia Tech with five players in double figures They had six in double figures in their last game against Cal which was a win music Millers had his struggles at the line tonight The best free throw shooter in the ACC Missed four on the night now nine of 13 When Mike Youngs team passes the ball and they move it tonight theyve got music 26 baskets on 14 assists And well see some extended pressure by SMU First time weve seen them bring out the 221 fall back into the zone They did play one possession of zone earlier Virginia Tech with both ball handlers on the floor with Hammond and Abdollis the twopoint guards swinging it around against this zone Late in the shot clock Hammond got the screen Of the mark against three but a long rebound from Pedford Bedfords the threepoint shooter in this lineup without shoot on the floor Bedford tosses it up and rattles it in off glass 22 for Bedford the Austin Texas native They go to their horn set Miller off the screen He finds the big and Yato scores He had position Staying in the zone cheering This time its a 131 Back in the hands of Jaylen Bedford the Texas native Hanssbury the flip Hammond the floater No And coralled by Miller ahead of Pierre Back in town Bedford Oh Bedford picked his pocket What a game for Bedford Its going to be one of his best allaround games this season Hes had other games where hes scored more Im not sure hes had the same impact as hes had especially on the defensive end So excited to play back here in the state of Texas with friends and family Six for shoots trying to throw it down He draws the foul He is so good in that fake dribble handoff action He makes you play him honest You got to guard the ball not the action right here If youre SMU watch this action right here He just gets by Igatlu fakes the dribble handoff gets to the rim Ive been talking about Virginia Techs rim pressures all night Its not a back to the basket feed the post They do it with their offensive rebounding their transition their pick and roll game and their ability to attack closeouts And Hansberry just a 69 foul shooter missing the first One more for the junior transfer from West Virginia Hes really coming into his own this year with the Hokes Didnt get the friendly bounce Missed them both Fourpoint game with under two to play Miller downhill losing the window ITS A TWOPOINT GAME JUST PUT HIM IN BALL SCREEN ACTION He is so good cheering and hes so confident cheering the playmaker Honford loose ball Now a scrum Washington is at the bottom of the pile for SMU Poopy Miller is so good in this right here He goes right off theu ball screen High off the glass Plenty of separation Really well executed And he wants the ball in these moments 15 of his 20 points coming here in the second half And now Ted I remember in the Clemson game where Poopy Miller was in front of the Clemson bench clapping And you see right there his expression hes shaking his head Hes a confident getter in a late game Chance to tie or take the lead UNDER A MINUTE AND MILLER is fouled Hanssbury there for Virginia Tech It would be his fourth music and it is This has been his tendency Miller set everyone up in the first half You see he has five points He goes two for six Second half he gets to the line He puts so much pressure on your defense in the paint And I heard you say it music last week in SMUs game against Clemson he has such a fire that ignites his teammates Hes so quick Hes the leader and captain of the team Hes never played in the NCAA tournament Jaylen Bedford checking out Hooks leading score 22 MILLER MISSES FOR A FIFTH TIME TONIGHT unhealed 11 of 16 Good but not his standard Still the zone into the middle of it with Hansberry playing with four personals cheering Hammond chased by Tombs Three to shoot Jesuit for Virginia Tech And a timeout for SMU music Jaden shoot on target Would foul him But if Im Virginia Tech Im putting the ball in Shoots hand An 80 free throw shooter Hammond is also a closer at the free throw line 845 So Im getting a quick two music Im Im putting the ball in Boopy Millers hands Im letting him make all the decisions late And by the way music SMU has a foul to give Fourpoint game into the hands of Miller of course back to the perimeter He launches off the side of the backboard Loose ball and out of bounds to Virginia Tech with 12 seconds Not quite what SMU drew up Im not letting uh Jaden Shute touch the ball here and Im not let Hammond catch it Im letting one of the other guys catch it and Im fouling him SMU with a foul to give here in to shoot Under 10 seconds now SMU going for the steal They force a tie up and SMU ball here with the arrow Is that true That is a great play with one foul to give You dont just try to foul you try to make a play with a steal or a jump ball Well beg your pardon The arrow on our score was incorrect Its Virginia Tech ball with the arrow into Hammond He is fouled The sixth team foul against SMU The next one puts Virginia Tech at the line music Apparently the arrow here in the arena was incorrect as well music So got that sorted out It was Virginia Tech ball with that tie up The next foul puts the Hokes at the line Edwards trying to strip IT THE ACC STEALS LEADER AND he tips it off of Dallas SMU ball with 7 seconds Look at that effort by BJ Edwards Timeout by Virginia Tech First of all you cant inbound the ball that music close to the baseline anyway Edwards wreaks such havoc on defense and he does it music again here Virginia Tech an opportunity at their second quad one victory of the season Miller to inbound Yeah look for the lob here into Edwards over Abdullah It goes in 12 with 55 SMU within a bucket quickly into Hammond and immediately fouled One and one coming up for Ben Hammond who has not been to the free throw line yet tonight I mean Boopys eyes are telling the story right there And BJ Edwards using his athleticism right there at the rim Good execution by SMU Now Hammonds an excellent free throw shooter Hes fifth in the league at 85 Again one and one and he has not shot a free throw yet tonight music Now we had this conversation with Mike Young today about if youre up three would you foul And he said its situational and hes conflicted about it So we did ask him HELMAN MISSED THE FRONT END LOW WITH THE REBOUND and hes fouled with 34 Toby Luell working back from his foot injury What an impact he has made You have to secure that rebound Watch Luell Nobody puts a body on him He is free to leap over the top of SMU And because Hammond missed it short it lands right in his hands And its the fifth personal on Cory Washington So his night is done Andy Enfields gonna have to sub somebody in and Lau at the line shooting one and one Now they changed the foul to Yigolu his second So Washington remains in the game Lau 77 on the season His first free throw attempt One and one He misses And a whistle here as the rebound was collected by Pierre Theyre going to have to look at the time cuz I think theyre going to put some time back Boy they might have to put at least a music second here The way that came down is you music could put the game on ice Yeah Yep You got to make free throws on on two occasions with Hammond followed by Lau and both missing music the front end You see several ten of a second went off The clock will be reset to 26 seconds Yeah that is when the SMU player signal timeout Yeah almost a full second So SMU music calling that timeout 26 six in its share of those games this season So it looks like its going to be Hanssbury on the inbound Lal is still on the floor and music sticking with Jaden Tombs here BJ Edwards ready to throw in for SMU And now Mike Young calls his final timeout gives Andy Enfield a chance to change up his play and gives Mike Young a chance to decide if hes going to put somebody on the ball or not music So 26 remaining Virginia Tech trying to take this to the finish line Theyre in these games seemingly every time they step out on the floor and theyre 26 away from a win Well its a huge resume builder considering SMU has not lost at home The last time they played here they beat North Carolina This quad one for Virginia Tech if they can execute here and finish it off But what an incredible game This is what we love about the ACC Last year not as many quad one opportunities music This year plenty of opportunities in the league Again Virginia Tech has thrived in this environment As Mike Young says its just a maturity about this team a next play mentality No matter what happens his team moves on good or bad And now trying to close it out as SMU has to go the length of the floor Now Dallas is going to be on the ball So it is a change by Mike Young Looks like a similar set though for SMU Edwards again to inbound Last gasp for the Mustangs cheering into Miller Defended by Hammond FROM HALF COURT screaming IT goes a chase screaming
