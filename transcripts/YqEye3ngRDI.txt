Raymond Somerville to jump for the Hornets wake will have Zack Keller in the jump Circle and its controlled by the decks the deakes like to space the court theyll go five out they go four round one they really do a nice job of reversing the floor moving without the basketball and trying to get into the gaps Wake Forest coming off an 83 to 59 win over NJIT a pullup is down for martaz Robinson as we look at the Hornets starting five their big three tarez Robinson and mun combin for almost 60 of their scoring State likes to play man but as of late their Zone has been doing them wonders and thats what they started tonight A 32 matchup Zone top of the key three buckets from Miller Wake Forest starting lineup theyre the only School in division one to have four players averaging around 15 points per game or more and theyre very very unselfish they share it theyre hard to defend because they always look for the open mun one of the better shooters for Delaware State his 18th three of the year thats a team best shoots almost 40 from Applause downtown Miller pierces the lane and his tear drop p through well thats why hes so hard to defend out of the perimeter cuz he is a very good threepoint shter capable but if you clows out too hard he does that he gets into the Gap and he has the floater tarez turns it over first turnover for Delaware state now you mentioned this Delaware state zone what are they trying to accomplish to bother opponents well theyre trying to get out and take away the passing Lanes they want to rotate they want to rotate hard and it gives them great rebounding position Applause Hunter Salis his first try is short rebound Delaware State and their second blunder Hornets are coached by Stan Waterman in his third season 14 56 spent 30 Seasons as the head coach at Sanford High School part of that boys basketball program and he has Delaware states on the rise they already have six wins tying their win total from any of the last six season Applause Music Carr kick out Salis lines up the three short well you mentioned the zone and what it does next they have good length especially on the back side they get out and contest and get back inside for the rebound Raymond Somerville with the foul line jumper they have five players on this Hornets roster that are 68 or taller to your point and theyre not only tall James but theyre long and theyre athletic and they move well and this zone is start to feel more comfortable in as the season grows Delaware state has grabbed an early lead Corner three from car Applause money what he does he stretches the floor hes a good passer he can make moves around the basket but then theyll step outside as well 610 220 lb stretch four quick bucket on the other end for Delaware State another lead change as that one goes for Altin Andrews coach Waterman spoke very highly at the Illinois State transfer on our call today Andrew has really stepped in well another option up front three for Millers halfway down but it spins out three ball from tarez wide right NASCAR Tempo HRI a collision and its out of bounds it will stay on this end with Wake Forest in his fourth season Steve Forbes at the H of this Wake Forest program backtoback winning seasons for the first time since the 200 20089 campaign and 200920 seasons and he was the 2022 ACC coach of the year Well Steve Forbes one of the most likable guys in the the profession of college basketball coaching and just a a true blue blue collar guy that the players love playing for him and hes done a really good job of Runing this team with a few transfers that have fit in nicely burrowing to the rim the balls wrenched out of bounds itll stay with Delaware State Tim your thoughts on the fact that Wake Forest has attempted seven field goals six of them have been threes against this Zone well it can be Fools Gold if you start getting three happy and I know Steve forbs will remind his team of that in the next TV timeout because you dont want to just limit yourself just to be threepoint shooting team playing against a Zone and uh you know if that happens then you you never get into a rhythm so sure theyll have some more balance they probably need a little bit more balance moving forward go inside first then go outside weit turns it over sends us to our first media timeout Delaware state is connected on five of their first six shots and they have a threepoint lead on the road Music thank Sofi is helping me get my money right to achieve my ambitions the threepoint Edge in our first media timeout Tim whats clicking for Delaware State offensively when you look at their numbers Well w us to up their pace and intensity on the defensive end I think theyre making any pass they want uh Im sure Steve forbs told them in the timeout we got to get out and guard guard them a little bit because theyre basically doing what they want theyre moving ball from side to side weights not getting up in the passing Lanes or contesting enough shots and certainly Delaware state has enough Talent uh enough scoring out there in the Florida Bern you if you dont get up in their chest and thats what Stan wman said earlier today hes got Robinson mun and tarz but he has other guys that can step up as well and thats what he needs tonight so far so good four of their five starters have already scored shot clock into single digits weaving tough one from mun and he splashes it in we talked about that length and that ability of mun at 66 to kind of play that guard spot that Wing are a little step back over the top well 60 run from Delaware St comes to a halt as Cameron H buries the triple one most improved players in the ACC over the last three years hes up got better every season now has that game off the bounds but hes always definite threat from downtown a jump ball it will stay with Delaware States on this Music end mun looking inside its bottled up pin to shoot Robinson and from 16 bull he is so strong and can Elevate in traffic because of that ability to create his own shot find because of the power and he got to get up make him put it on the deck and give a little help Robinson preseason First Team all M hes the running Mak offensive player of the leag averaged over 21 points per game three contests for the Hornets stop and pop from hildr is left short Music hornets have made their last three shots mun finds the cutter and banking it home Raymond Somerville and Delaware State leads by six one of the problems for on the season is been their ability to create good passing angles and turning the ball over way too much got over 25 more turnovers and assist on the season so tonight they look highly skilled on the offensive end with Miller driving a foul in the lane marz Robins we were talking about he just creates a little space because of that power power and then the ability just to elevate under duress and then Somerville with the nice CAU down the lane and the soft touch Millers a 79 free throw shooter for Wake Forest average of 17 points per game the transfer from Central Michigan only played in four games last season suffered an early season injury he made the mall freshman team two years ago hes also seventh in the AA in the ACC in assist per game averaging right at four per contest Delaware state has started 8 for n from the field theyve only missed one shot theyre perfect from inside the arc it was a missed three Fall Away halfway down but it goph for out out of bounds hell stay on this this and with the Hornets well that was a better defensive possession by wake but again they have to be aware that Delaware State on the season is almost a plus seven on the glass the wake is just even steeven on the glass so St has that Advantage coming in especially with six to shoot mun weaving flips it up didnt hit the rim theres over two seconds on the shot clock State doing a good job just keeping the ball alive just crashing the boards if Wake can just do a good job of finding that defensive rebound they may be able to get some run outs mun throws up a prayer didnt draw a rim its a shot clock violation not sure the players in W state were of the shot clock situation I dont think they were because with two on the shot clock you got time for one bounce and a shot tried to pass the ball around the perimeter Parker Frederickson has checked in for Wake Forest coming off a career high 19 against NJIT hes number 20 in white deep in the timer dangerous pass Miller has to hustle H its in M the presence of Mind understanding the shot clock situation and coming into the corner cam H just set his feet and thats lights out for wink can a play like that jump start a team after a slow start absolutely they have been playing a little bit more intense defense in the last couple couple minutes but theyve going to continue to get up on the glass and Miller just great hustle after a loose pass on the perimeter and just finding hildr this is what Miller does best he just drives into the Gap draws that second or third Defender and then looks back out to the perimeter for an open shooter long two from Robinson that is tough he doesnt need much space and he does a good job of not only creating shots for himself but doing a good job of using screens that time came off that Baseline Runner a little bit and moving without the basketball has six points hes yet to miss a shot his coach Stan Waterman says Robinson is a gamer hildr left wide open Reed trying to keep it alive picked up by Applause Frederickson Miller cant snap the ne again settling for some threes ways to be in that zone ball revers take it into the into the Gap nice F and a flush right down the boulevard from Applause Music Somerville heres our Friday night mens basketball double header the begins at 6 Eastern PJ Hall and number 13 Clemson hosts Queens University at Little John Coliseum and then Marcus Burton and Notre Dame host the marest red foxes at Marcel Pavilion in South Bend should be a good evening of Hoops right here on acc Network and the ESPN app wait for us called a 30 second timeout to send us to a break Tim Delaware State preseason picked sixth out of eight teams in the Mak but they look much better than that well they do and Stan Waterman told us earlier today that this zone is something he doesnt really like to play but its worked so hes sticking with what works and not a lot of people wake has not faced a lot of Zone possessions this year because of the fact they do have so many good Shooters but what happens sometimes is the first time you play against a zone for a long period of time you get standing around because youre not comfortable against it yet you think you can just rely on your threepoint shooting which Im sure Steve forbs has told him this is not the case weve got to get the ball inside and and use our inside presence first and then get the threes Hunter Salis at the line the Junior from Omaha Nebraska transfer from Gonzaga whos not only seen an uptick in playing time here at wake but his production has been off the Applause charts Applause energ to almost 18 points per game for wake his field goal percentage covering around 50 starting tonight 0 for three gets in the book with a couple of free throws banging down low and Delaware state turns it over thats their fourth turnover and Tim coach Waterman said that if they were going to compete in this game they had to keep that number down between 12 and 15 well thats been an issue at times this year you said they have 20 more 29 more turnovers and assist on the season so it tells you theyre not a great passing team they go with sometimes a freshman The Freshman he makes good plays but then as Co said to us today its bris reward another foul line jumper from Somerville offensive rebound and a three Robinson thats his first Miss of the Applause Music night around the wheel of frecks for three fifth for Wake tonight thats when wakes at its best though they really do a great job of using the corners using both sides of the floor to space it in and they reverse it with the pass before the defense can Shi ties the score 21 and wake has picked up the intensity on this end Reed pulls it away job on the glass one and done for delare State Salis now 0 for four from the Music Applause field Robinson hes a bucket hter has it denied by Sal out of bounds well Ws doing a much better job the last three or four minutes ball ball pressure helping out each other defensively resisting at the rim and contesting and getting in passing Music Lanes whistle and a foul offensive foul on the Hornets well Wicks done a much better job last we not only defensively as we just mentioned but on the offensive end trying to get the ball into the gaps not settling in the second and third pass for a quick three but moving the defense first and then attacking Ry Miller reenters the lineup for Wake Forest replacing Fon Reed III whos now eligible just got cleared by the NCAA the transfer from by way of LSU and then Gaga playing in his third game with the deakes here tonight break forced on a mini 50 run deep in the shot clock still a long way from the Applause cylinder Marion to the bucket and he throws it down I was about to say Wake is just spending too much time on the perimeter he never got inside the threepoint line in the dribble Drive situation so Marion took it himself they were outside and they waited a little bit too long but then Marion found that gap which is there thats what wake Force needs to do to attack this Zone wakes on a 70 run over the last Music Applause Music 226 Miller pin tra Salis bumping and he draws a foul time out on the floor when you must attack the zone you cant get three happy you have to have balance and thats what Marcus Maran did its both attack three guys Robinson mun and tarez tonight they have 11 of their teams 21 for the season the three of them average just under 43 points per game and the rest of the team around 32 per contest tarez hasnt scored tonight but hes dished out five assists and the others leading Delaware State Robinson and mun with six and five they were tavar is a goodlooking player and know Stan wman said to us earlier that he didnt really anticipate him to be stepping into the line up but hes been hes been done a nice job running the team and he gets out there pushes him in transition he plays good defense at the top of that zone the Hornets starting point guard Cory Perkins went down with an injury theyll get him back in six to8 weeks they Trail by four Wake Forest after a couple of free throws from Salis where he has all of his points tonight wakes on a 90 run Delaware state is cooled off they start at 8 for9 since then they are two for n and now make it two for 10 from the field Applause Music Applause Miller gets in Te and he scores Ste Forbes message has been delivered to his team dont rely totally on the three that time Miller did a nice job of getting in the Gap after ball rsal getting all the way to the rim nice find underneath and a block down low a foul on the floor shot will not count for alustin Music Andrews wake has done a better job of adjusting and helping each other on the interior and making Delaware State beat them from the outside where theyre not a great threepoint shooting team and wake being much more physical on the paint wakes on on an 110 run Delaware States missed their last six shots you can see up in the chest and much more intense defensively getting up in the face of the offensive player now its trapped mun steps through cant get the r on this end Ry Miller leads wake with nine points he also has three assists what do you like about his game tonight not much not to like about Bo m in general he continu hes very consistent in how he plays a good looking question there do as confident as a Sho but no it makes him go he gets the ball into the gaps he shares it hes quick he can go get his own but he really looks to run the team first and does a great job of dribble penetrating and finding open People elbow jumper wont go offensive rebound Delaware state righty hook rattles down Cameron stit ends the drought for the Music Hornets that bucket ins a 14point run for Wake Forest pulloff Salis offensive rebound is sck back for Zack Keller Zack Keller very good at just be active offensively and defensively they they dont throw the ball much but when hes around the ball in the rim good things happen three ball pops out Miller Slams on the brakes and he draws a foul in the open floor thats a head Music play about boy Miller is hes always playing at 100 mph but its under control and thats a hard thing to do hes he still has the ability to get everybody involved but go get a bucket when needed sometimes Tim it has taken Wake Forest a while to get going this season in their nine games thus far theyve only let it the half three times if theyre six and three and you see what theyve done over the last 5 and 12 minutes on a 162 run Fick three and this kid is a walking Fireball dating back to the last game hes made made eight of his last nine threes all three tonight those Oklahoma kids they can shoot it hes a long way from home but feeling comfortable Robinson gets the bounce off the glass Ste not happy with his defense took a step back on that possession when theyve been intense on defense its turned into offense for way where the Zone doesnt get a chance to set driving kick and salad lines it up rebound called pass Applause one Ws doing a nice job at the top of the Zone there screening the top of the Zone which allows poopy Miller to get into the gaps and then he finds the open man and car cleans it up senior from Westchester Pennsylvania up to six points tonight and all of a sudden Wake Forest leads by 13 theyre on an extended run of 22 to four over the last 6 inch in Robinson splits the defense the L and the thunderus flush on the way down Somerville with the dunk now if Im Delaware State I go through Martez Robinson everything wakes having some issues trying to guard him oneonone and he makes things happen for himself or his teammates Frederickson that one short Robinson down hill lost it out of bounds off his leg turnover Delaware state but this kid partner Frederickson cant miss now if he gets his feet set hes got the textbook

of the backboards and then against the zone and now Delaware States out of the Zone play man and man theyve done a better job of being patient and working the ball inside and then go back out to the perimeter out on the arc with pin to shoot Miller the lob to car touch pass double clutch a scrum and deep in the shot clock a whistle possession arrow stays with wake with 23 to shoot coach is this where you just lob it over the top to your sevenfooter e Reed well youve got a couple different options I want you want to look in first maybe see if you can draw the defense with a little screen and then see if the screener can get on at the threepoint line you got a chance for a quick three if the defense bites on the first Music screen Miller didnt beat the buzzer thats got to be a catch and shoot situation you you have time for one pass but then a quick bounce and and a shot much to the dismay of Wake Forest coach Steve Music Forbes Music that was Ws first turnover in their last 17 possessions they had really cleaned it up trying to shoehorn a pass inside its knocked Away by Miller Reed teas the sevenfooter cant hit car A man among Music boys Salis trying to drop it off some sloppy Play Its out of bounds it stays with wake on this end a little tight in there to make that pass for Salis he dribble drove into the Gap and when you see the defense collapse this is what happens flush from K thats the play you were looking for earlier with two on the shot clock that was a very good Baseline out of bounds play this just a simple screen to screener and lack of communication Delaware state allows car the easy Music One For Keeps on this end after the Hornets give it right back Delaware state after the inbounds violation playing defense and committing a foul

if wakes eight assists in this first half Carr with eight points and two rebounds free throw pops out Wake Forest has a team top four in the ACC really good from the line at 78 Collective car spits the Applause Applause pair Delaware state yet to shoot a free throw pull it from mun and he splashes it in good job by me this just creating that little bit of space off the bounce but the step back

crossover and Miller Miller might have bumped him a little bit on the way down and then not sure how they found a charge on that play but Salis hit the ground hard time out on the floor just under a minute left before we break for the half wake by 10 at home its bow time hey sweetie hey Mom top 42 to 32 over Delaware State wakes hit seven of 17 from three but after settling four they took 10 threes Tim in the first few minutes of this game 10 of their first 12 shots its really evened out now 28 field goal attempts and 17 have been threes well you knew that wasnt going to keep going at that pace because Ste wouldnt allow it he knows that you need balance to go against any Zone even if youre having early success and we talked about it earlier now the defense that has been stepped up as well closing in on a half minute deep in the shot clock for the Hornets Robinson second thought three barely Clips the rim Tap Out mun able to track it down Delaware stay can hold for the final

second half belong to the Music Hornets hrth bumped and foul Austin Andrews commits the foul for the Hornets their first in this half and his second personal make it the third on Andrews the 16 senior from Detroit transfer from Illinois Music State hell get a breather and they bring in Wesley Oba the Junior from Manchester England a high energy guy off the bench for the Hornets bus three around and out for with numbers Robinson to the well and he finishes on The Brak come on state coming off the second half the way they started this game a lot of energy getting out of transition getting into gaps playing good defense the only difference is theyre playing manto man theyre not playing The Zone they started the game in D from Andrew Carr Thats where Carr makes his money right around the rim hes so physical inside he doesnt fool around he just goes home and goes up and flushes it decent double figures 11 points on four of five shooting righty hook well Applause Music short Miller with nine points and five assists in the first half dashing Bas line two away this is so quick he changes Direction very quickly he can go either way hes got his head up hes looking for Open men if you back off a little bit hell knock it down top seven in the ACC and assists per game also averaging 17 points per contest L over the top out of Applause Music Applause bounds Music Quake Forest trying to move to 26 and0 at home against nonconference opponents since 2018 and a Ticky Tac foul called on a hornet their second of this half de wil tarez commits the foul this is what wake wants to do offensively versus the manto man theyre going to have a lot of movement a lot of Cutters coming through theyll play five out at times sometimes theyll go four round one but they really do a nice job of spacing the floor Miller changes course gets in deep flips it up too strong rebound batted around in a Applause whistle a foul on a hor itll stay on this end with wake their third foul in this half in the first two plus minutes thats great spacing that they have that we spoke about on the offensive end versus Mana man really allows Miller a lot of room to roam out there because they youve got Shooters in both Corners sometimes theyll Flash the big guy up to the top and its oneonone basketball and then hes going to take it into the Gap and if you overh help hell find the open man on the Keller banging with Andrews and Andrews commits his fourth Music foul extended that arm that ra just told him you cannot guard the post that Music way Miller B and the fifth foul issued to a hornet in the first less than three minutes of this second half and keep in mind the free throw discrepancy already Wake Forest theyve attempted 11 Hornets havent been to the line tonight this is unfortunate for Delaware State and you know for some reason it didnt take Andrews out of the game and maybe it wasnt they didnt realize it quickly enough and then boom within 5 Seconds hes gone for the night and thats a costly foul for Delaware State he just committed two fouls on this same possession it put spy Miller at the line in a rare Miss hes an 80 Marksman maybe the bench did not know it but clearly or the player didnt seem like the player knew knew it either but uh thats a bad mistake for Delaware State just not paying attention to whats going on on the court so the Hornets are down a starter with still 17 minutes to play Miller missed them both offensive rebound Salis from the corner Applause Bingo R for looking to take advantage now it looks like Del lost a little wind out of their sails and that position just let Salis count to three in the corner wide open thats his first made field goal tonight all of his points had come from the foul line in the first Music half tend to shoot shoulder shaking in the lane big step through and Oba Banks it in Wesley Oba he does a nice job of creating some space there he carves it out and then a real good footwork highly ped recruit a Joo transfer from Northwest Florida State going Baseline Sal count the basket and Applause one for Sal starting to heat up for w you know he has that ability he can go get Buckets and he can make the three and if you get up into his grill which you have to do he can do that slow rotations on the backside if hes beating you off the bounce here easily youve got to meet him outside the paint on the backside with your help rotation sixth team foul issued to Delaware state so wake will be in the bonus the rest of the half on that next foul Salis converts the oldfashioned three and hes up to a quiet 11 Applause tonight mun cut off Tavarez Baseline he pulls the tri trigger and Carr has his seventh rebound of the evening deep in the lane blocked at The Rim Hornets on the Move shots good at the window Robinson puts it through make it Somerville Oba I should say and wake leads by 12 well nice job by Delaware State just pushing up the floor and OB gim running right down the middle of the floor little slow on the retreat hrth navigating FPS it up with the LA the off hand and he gets the roll H when he came in hes kind of a just a perimeter player but hes a complete player now for Wake much improved can knock down shots and you see him can get in the lane with good footwork one of four players on this wake team averaging north of 15 per Contest out of bounds to wake as we head to a

Delaware State going back to the zone hrth relocates with nine to shoot in the lane scooper and hes fouled seventh team foul on Delaware State this will be two for Cameron hildr does a really good job of getting to the free throw line hes strong hes been in the weight room the last three years you can just see the the development not not only of his body but his total game and hes just a hard noosed player that loves the game everybody awake just Raves about how much he works on Improvement and development especially off the bounce now instead of just being a standstill shooter he talked about what hes done off the floor in the weight room he plays 35 Plus minutes per game second highest minutes per game in the league I mean you have to be in shape to be out on the floor that much well he is in shape everyone looks great they really play want to play a fast game they they share the ball theyre inside guys that good passes capable all step out shoot a little bit so keeps the defense honest you talked about the bance and scoring and thats what way is the key to their success four W players and double figures tonight as Brandon Stone gets in on the action hes returning from an injury hes been sorely missed for Delaware State second team preseason all meia hammer for well thats what most does they dble drive into the GS they find that angle and if you send that second Defender they do great job of sliding into the open area on the back side a whistle and a foul on bopy Miller itll put Robinson at the line for Delaware State back to the Music dson your that do a great job just sliding into that open R shares the ball team weve seen this year in the ACC they make the extra pass Robinsons free throw spits out these are the first free throws tonight for Delaware State the first trip to the line comes with 1353 left in the game Music Hornet with some pressure Miller a second thought three wont go and Robinson clears it he going take it that early in the clock but Delware State just dared him to take it from the outside on the second pass of the offensive possession now steel P fuels the break the L and Pa with another finish is getting his fair share of UPS tonight because his teammates are looking for him but also that he is does a great job of not just standing watching the ball he watches the defense and then slides to the open area to finish it off its been a oneman wrecking crew with 15 points and seven rebounds and hes done it on just seven attempts just really nice touch feel at The Rim looks like hes going to shoot it and then he finds car there the unselfish Music play Four Lake players and double figures tonight the usual cast of characters with Carr Miller HRI and Salis all four of those guys averaging 15 or more per night Lake theyre not super deep just in terms of how many guys are in their rotation The Starters play a lot of minutes but those four guys theyre the only team in the country that has four players averaging 15 or more per game and M mono comes back which could be early January late December uh they are really going to be dangerous and hard to defend because another threepoint shooter and score added next Miller on the way Coast to Coast the point guard flips it in Mar State not doing a good job of sprinting back and trans transitioning wake is Reed with the block Miller peels it back Frederickson trailing for a three off the heel long rebound Frederickson again 18point Wake Forest Le Delaware state has gone cold since they started 8 for n from the field off the opening tip an air ball Frederickson pulls it down Miller oneonone Crossing scooping scoring but theyll wipe off the basket the foul ke on the drive thiss getting a little out of hand for Del State really caused by letting wake just get out and transition seems like on every possession its an open three or a layup so Delaware States has to make some adjustments in this next TV Applause timeout Miller hits the front end of the one and one well look at Stan Waterman in his third season at the helm of this Delaware State program they have the second most wins in the Mak with six on the young year preseason picked sixth

trying to direct traffic once a screen Robinson in the land of the trees tip in no and Reed has it for Wake defense on that possession by Applause wake stolen back by a Hornet fenetic Pace outside tarez for a three Salis trying to save it great Hustle by Salis on the Baseline Little dangerous saving it under your own basket right into the Music lane Delaware state has missed their last six

tough one over the weekend to Georgetown in overtime but I will tell you that Maris is one of the better teams in the Metro Atlantic conference so should be good ball game we forced on top here by 18 over Delaware State approaching the Midway point of this second half Robinson pull up hes fouled headed to the line and Delaware State saying where has this been all night wake has attempted 19 free throws to the Hornets Music four Robinson normally does a pretty good job of getting the I that would be a good recipe for to get back in this G clear out some space get some ball reversal and let him

balance wild shot Maran with the rebound and a reach and a foul and thats number 10 on Delaware State this will send wake to the line on the other end well Delaware States not going to get back in the game with that shot selection but wake is going to increase the lead by going through Hunter Music S Wake Forest has matched their largest lead beg your pardon their largest lead was 20 marans free throw is good its an 18point cushion freshman from Denmark drills the second free throw regarded as a top 100 player nationally considered the top prospect out of Music Denmark Robinson offensive rebound Delaware State able to cycle it out hard pass and a recovery by Maran to bat it out of bounds wake basketball dely state forcing the issue now came multiple possessions without going through marz Robinson that previous one stone forced issue and that one was kind of a lazy pass read one one with ob and an offensive F called OB by sell re is still re is still trying to get back in the FL

the D and finish on the Baseline side turnover for Delaware State Reed playing in just his third game here at wake transfer from Gonzaga didnt play a ton for the zags around four or five minutes per

analyst yeah all around great guy tremendous player husband father worked a lot of charitable work in the Chapel Hill area Hubert Davis put it put it best I think today he said uh you know I lost a teammate a friend and uh someone that just loved being a dad and being a husband and being a tarhill and hell be missed he was a really good player he was a really good broadcaster as well our thoughts and prayers certainly go out to him and his family Wake Forest here they lead by 19 with hrth at the line a rare Miss from the stripe hes almost 90 for the Music year missed them Applause both underneath mun is foul this will put him at the line for two mun is another guy get to the free throw line and very good with the handle with both hands just needs a little bit more space and more aggressiveness offensively sometimes he just lets the game come to him instead of being on the attack free throws through Delaware State team they havent been to the NCAA tournament since 2005 their lone appearance they won six games all of last season theyve already matched that this season at six and seven they have the second most wins of anybody in the M Applause Music conference Salis gets around his man pull up hornets one to run Applause mun quick Hands by fedck and steel two on for f has made a bad decision over there on that left wing put his head down and dribble like five times in place and he just tried to squeeze a pass down to the corner with nowhere to count Robinson probing he lost the handle Frederickson the freshmans all over the floor salers with the r one Lake on the defensive end now theyre starting to feel it they starting to be on the attack packing the lanes the passing Lanes getting up good pressure on the basketball deflections and then run outs Lake Forest 187 points off turnovers Miss jumper from mun largest lead of the night for Wake Reed bumping and hes Applause fouled well wakes defense just has been outstanding in this entire game after that little bit of a lull to start the game and since they get out theyre active theyre hungry on the floor and then theyre very unselfish On The Run outs wake by 21 their largest lead of the night even though they didnt make the NCAA tournament wake is coming off backtoback winning seasons for the first time since 0809 and 200920 how does this week team stack up to the teams that youve seen Tim under coach Steve Forbes the last two years well I think this team is is better because of the fact they have more options and they have more options they have combination of good guard Play Good shoo guys that can do different things theres really no one thats onedimensional out there on the floor even theyre bigs can step out theyre decent willing enabled passers and then once they get Monsanto back I think theyre really going to be dangerous theyre already a good shooting team as is top three in the ACC field goal percentage and Monsanto was the second best shooter in the conference last year at 41 from Deep well theyre at just 79 points a game only thing I would say is that they need to become a better rebounding team and maybe tighten up the defense and that kind of goes hand in here Carr trying to shovel it underneath throws it away wanted read the Music cutter wakes on a mini 60 run top of the key jumper a long two from mun had he had a good second half and theyre wake a little careless with the inbounds a three wont stickz couldnt get it to Music go drive and kick Carr thought about it under five to play Salis around and out Tap Out wake gets another look fr PS he got it had missed three in a row unbelievably I think he around his life where hes open but he knew he was going to knock that one down he plays with a lot of confidence for a freshman Reed wrestles it Applause away and a foul on the open floor this will put hildr at the line for Wake that is the 12th foul for Delaware state in this half and tarez commits his fourth so cam hildr will shoot two Applause Music here wake pushes their lead to 25 a Wednesday night after the football Signing Day special stay with ACC Network for our featured womens basketball game of the week Kiki Jefferson number 18 Louisville they host Washington at the KFC Yum Center coverage begins at 7 Eastern Wednesday night Monday night basketball here Wake Forest on top 79 53 five players in double figures coach with Miller and Carr Leading The Way with 15 Salis is now up to a quiet 15 then Hildreth and Frederickson with 14 and 12 well you asked about waking their team compared to other steep forbs team well I will say this though good teams have an identity and this wake team does have an identity early in the season and Steves done a great job of forming that identity and building it with the transfer portal that players that fit his system and you know the the identity is on offense were going to share the ball you dont know where were going with it because they have tremendous balance both inside and outside they have 14 assists here tonight Applause Miller navigating car looking for the open man Salis Nice Shot turned down the three coach for the much better twoo well thats one of the worst things when youre a coach is when you youre driving to the arena to coach your team in a game and you cant youre worried to death if bester has an off youre is and Steve for doesnt have to worry about that because hes got a lot of good players and most kns they all help each other get better after the Salis DP wake has pushed their lead to 30 take another look well weve talked all night long about the offensive balance but in the second half its been the defense for wait its bow time well Andrew cars had a big night 10 with 15 points and 10 rebounds a double double transfer from Delaware what he does he makes his money right there at the rim because he can finish with the best when he runs the floor hes got good hands tremendous footwork and seems to have a great feel for the game of where to go and get open right at the opportune Music time 15 points on just seven Shots tonight his seventh career double double Delaware State started this game8 for n from the field and had a lead in the first half they LED 21 to 18 and then wake flipped the script driving in contested shot is left short and Carr has his 11th Music rebound Miller Banker Music no Wake Forest will run their streak to 26 straight at home against nonconference opponents this is always a feel of relief for a coach and a coaching staff at a program come in on a Monday night play a formidable opponent dont forget Delaware state they beat Chicago State ear in the year on the road and Chicago state has proven to be a pain in the neck for teams especially Northwest uh and come in theres not a lot of energy in the building cuz the schools out of session guys are thinking about Christmas a little bit and come in and solid performance and again thats great coaching but also just good team building your identity is there you were going to go out do what we do best every night what was this week like for you Tim when you were coaching at Providence among other programs the week right before Christmas well its a com combination of a few things its uh first of all its good to be home being on the road is really tough but you always try to be home if you can but first thing is you theyre thinking about getting away if they can for a few days which most schools can unless theyre call Christmas tournament in Hawaii the other part is they just coming off a grueling exam week where theyve got to really focus in on their exams and they lose a little bit of focus on basketball rightfully so and you dont get to practice as much or as intensely as you normally do so theres a lot of changes at this time of year you just want to get through it get through the holidays and then get the team back where they dont have to go to school for about three or four weeks and you can just focus on basketball Somerville misses with the left deep in the shot clock approaching a minute and a half left catch and shoot threes long rebound run down by wake Corner Pocket no it wont go wake trying to get one for cl a block on the other end the other nice piece of this for Steve Forbes as he gets to use his Ben a little bit late in the game and these guys feel a little bit better about themselves getting a little time to get out there and play and be involved AB bro zanka has checked in a sophomore from Italy transfer from UCLA number 10 in white for we Matthew Marsh has entered the Music Applause lineup will under wood is also entered for the deakes with a minute 16 left Wake Forest will move to S and three on the season big picture theyre trying to get back to the NCAA tournament for the first time since 2017 theyve only been once since Applause Music 2010 Steve forp knows how to push the right buttons is hes absolutely tremendous coach former ACC Coach of the Year highly respected real very well likeed not only around campus and he proved that this year as he ventured out to the College World Series with the Wake baseball Music team a minute Music Applause left slicing in the layup rolls off wouldnt go for Maran a three yes well Delware State obviously not what they wanted tonight but if you can the m theyre going to be a formidable foe of the year and I would say they going be better than seventh place they got some good pieces out there they lead the league its always so hard to stat compare for teams like Delaware State and conferences like the M because the nonconference its always just brutal but they lead the league in scoring field goal percentage they second in the Mak and threepoint field goal percentage their tops and assists they have a lot of really good things to build on heres a r three Applause Music in this excites the bench one of the guys comes in still continues on what you were doing what the starters were doing out there on the floor the WalkOns and they get a chance to dra struggle stop a little bit and I like this breake team a lot good chemistry seems like they like each other a lot because you see you can see in how they share the ball W Forest thatll do it they win it 88 59
