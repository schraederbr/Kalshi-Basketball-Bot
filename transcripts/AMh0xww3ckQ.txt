students behind us and to our left our rockas should be a terrific environment for basketball 9000 seat Little John Coliseum nearly every one of thems taken up Jamal Spearman has the tip of the ear with Ted Valentine and Jeff Clark our officiating crew Clemson basketball to start and they go right into PJ Hall get the marac transfer Jord Miner guarding the post early for Virginia Tigers one of the best offensive teams in the AC DC scored at 76 points per game in conference there is chony Wiggins with the first shot its off the mark from three an area where Clemson has struggled as you look at the UVA starting five the guards beakman Ro and the nations leading threepoint shooter mcney Ryan dun had a fabulous allaround year and Jordan miners made a big impact since he moved into the starting lineup three weeks ago this is McNeely they will try to get him as many good looks off screen beans and curls as possible inside to Dun against Ian sheflin Dunn forces up the shot through contact and an early foul on sheflin will put Ryan Dunn at the line an early post to get shefflin to half to guard its interesting the matchups were seeing early Jordan Miner matched up with PJ Hall going to have to stay out of foul trouble that versatility of Hall can can be problematic and then you love going after sheflin early hes a real X Factor for Clemson does such a great job on the glass such a physical player good to pick up a foul on him early 58 free throw shooter done with a Miss Brad Brown out year 15 at Clemson and here is his starting five its the usual group three seniors are grad students in Hall Gerard and Chase Hunter just scored his 1000 point last game a sophomore Wiggins and the junior sheflin rounded out one free throw for dun Virginia to games first point the longest win streak in the ACC now at five after North Carolinas lost Tuesday at Georgia Tech heres Hall who could step out and shoot it well in and out two Miss threes early for Clemson which has been the worst threepoint shooting team in conference play in the ACC well in part I mean you say PJ Hall could shoot it well he has historically has not in conference play Only 23 from three in conference its going to have to knock some down here today bman with a long two and a much improved shooter has the games first field goal get this packline Virginia Defense youve got to move the ball you youve got to be patient you got to press the gaps kick out the ball has got to have some activity to it done guarding sheflin one of the most improved players in the league back for Wiggins and Clemson misses another three sheflin has the rebound and hes fouled by mcney here 15 for Brad bro 15 for his counterpart Tony Bennetts done a marvelous job at Virginia the most wins in Uva mens basketball history this may be one of his least talented teams and for a while it looked like a team that wouldnt sniff the tournament but here they are number 44 in the net Joel lardy has them as the fifth team out of the field and a lot of great resume building games coming up in the next month and a half deep at the shot clock its Chase Hunter McNeil standing in his way Hunters jump shot well Off the Mark sheelin has his second offensive rebound draws the foul undone and finishes hes a monster in shefflin I mean hes averaging over four offensive rebounds a game in conference play like you said Kev already has two really good job getting inside position and what youre going to find against this Virginia Defense youre going to get a lot of shots at the end of that shot clock you know theyre going to force you to have to work the basketball if you can collect some of those offensive rebounds off of late misses Big Time play threepoint play for shefin averaging 93 points 96 rebounds and has Clemson on the board this cavaliere team has been one of the worst offensive teams in Tony benett tenure but much better of late and mcne in the lane has his first two no they thats that Virginia sides that they run you get McNeely coming off in the curl and Clemsons going to play that like Drop coverage Gerard with Clemsons first three theres a continuity motion offense collab with with the way that Virginia runs stuff and MCs gotten so good at coming off of that and then finding that big who sets that screen that pin down heres Andrew roie off the low pass from beatman Miss shot is cleaned up by Hunter Clemson will look to run hunter gets to the basket with a left hand and scores it first points for Chase Hunter whos at 17 now in his 5year career got to stop the basketball hes as good as anybody in this league Hunter is at going end to end transition defense starts with stopping the basketball crimsons had the length of Wiggins on the guards early hes on roie right now gets it back from beatman back to beatman that pass is knocked away Gerards on the deck with a Clemson steel inside Wiggins Ro was there to hamper the shot Wiggins did not finish strong at 611 theres beatman tough angle shot and it will find the bottom of the Music bucket guys thank you we continue our afternoon of ACC basketball here in Clemson where Reese Batmans Miss is flushed by Ryan Dunn who went over the top of his teammate a 98 Virginia lead Kevin Brown Chris poo with you Virginia winners of five straight the longest streak in the ACC Clemson just four and five in League Play after a brilliant nonconference and backtoback turnovers beakman goes into Gerard who wants a tie up Andel Spearman says it is a foul instead thats something theyve always been good at under Tony Bennett with his fearsome packline defense ree beakman at the line for two after the foul on Joe Gerard before the break beakman coming off a good one the other night 21 points six assists and that win over Notre Dame had four threes in the game so I mean the impact of Jordan Miner being in the lineup has had a positive effect offensively I think for this team youre talking about the numbers not looking good you know Jake Groves has started to play well in a more natural position at the Music four its a nearly full line change for Clemson which leaves sheelin on Josh Beetle Dylan Hunter Jack Clark and RJ Godfrey All Off the Bench uvas got three reserves in as well and this basket is missed by Jack Clark tane Murray one of the three Cavaliers Off the Bench grabs the rebound along with Jak coves and Blake Buchanan they ween sure if you can it will be available he was sick the last couple of days Tony Bennett told us his fever broke this morning and he is out there wearing zero Ro off a screen from Groves he was a hot threepoint shooter last game and he swirls his first one out yeah youre lucky if your Clemson there miscommunication both guys stayed with roie and Gro is the guy thats the guy youve got to close out on where does the scoring come from for the Clemson Reserves Clark inside handle was lost by Godfrey is Miss cleaned up by Clark another Clemson offensive rebound as their third heres Godfrey into Groves spinning and missing in and out and then another offensive rebound Try by Clark he draws the UVA foul not a very good rebounding team for Virginia and Clemson owning the offensive boards early When Brad Brownell goes to his bench it gets a lot younger youre playing a lot of sophomores off that bench and you dont have quite the shooting when Joe Gerard goes out but you do get more athletic more defensive minded with your guards Beetle and Hunter three leading scores out of the game right now for Clemson Beetle has played a lot of late drags that one to the left of the lane Clark fighting for the rebound again he keeps it alive once more five and orange and white has made this a super long possession and finally chefin ends it I dont know if he wanted to shoot that he was just kind of probing and he saw a lot of green grass in front of him and eventually got to a point where he had to put it up there nobody stopping the ball picking it up Dante Harris on the floor for the first time for Virginia Speedy guard wearing number one Cavaliers typically deliberate its a from beatman pinned against the board by Clark Buchanan the offensive rebound misses it way strong heres Godfrey trying to find sheelin inside groes will come to help on Godfrey Groves goes down and its a blocking foul against Jake Groves his first and Virginias fourth thats where Clemsons done a nice job again youve got to be patient yeah I like that call I think he gets there late you Clips has done a nice job you know being patient youve got to be patient against this Virginia Defense this packline defense its not going to come on a first pass youve got to get it that ball reversal and then youve got to manufacture cheap points and theyre doing that on the offensive glass so far Miner and Roy back on the floor Buchanan who again had been sick out of the game after only a couple of minutes they may need a big night from Miner tonight try to match up with his physicality of Hall gets blocked by miner throws it off the underside of the backboard and they offish is going to come together and say that ball was out of bounds off the other side of the backboard and its going to be Virginia ball and thats Jordan Miner in the impact hes made for Virginia in a nutshell I mean thats who he was in that overtime win for Virginia against DJ Burns he he is really strong particularly in the lower body and he doesnt give any ground barely played first couple of months of the year since he started Virginia has started to win Groves again his second threepoint try and this ones pure a career high six in the win over Notre Dame and Jake Groves is on the board thats his 143 in their last six games shooting 65 from three and I think its that shift to that four position hes playing his most efficient and effective position really good skip pass and thats one of those guys again that stretch four becomes a mismatch CU RJ Godfrey is not used to having to defend the guy whos shooting it as well as Jake Rose 9 for 12 the last two began his C at Eastern Washington with his brother Tanner went to Oklahoma nice inside Paul gets position on miner and has his first two thats the angle that Clemson beat you with those guys inside playing in the post is about where you catch it in the angle you have Clemson is constantly ducking you in and trying to find post angles found the angle right after Miner had picked up his first foul earlier in the possession Miner fighting for that Dante Harris Miss Godfrey has the rebound for Clemson post defense is so important for all 30 seconds of the possession of youre Virginia Clemson constantly trying to duck you in Hall will shoot it Hall will miss it look at Godfrey though got position found hall and then Hall lost it to Miner Harris has some real speed behind the back a low catch for McNeely who gets taken out by the thighs of Clark I me this is great post play I mean this is perfect position to catch it look at the angle he works and again youre going after a guy with one foul thats PJ Hall in a Music nutshell ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Daisy sourer cream do it dollop of Music Daisy Reese pman brilliant Wednesday against do Dame at a 12point win tied a careerhigh with 21 points took about eight steps before that layup thats okay we dont call that four of seven threes four steals in the last five games coming into today Ree beatman had 18 steals in the last 28 years as far back as our research team could go no Virginia player had that many steals over a fivegame stretch and Chris hes already got two more today hes hes really instinctive hes constantly alert particularly off of the ball its great reaction I was talking to Brad Brownell about him he said its its a little bit like Rivas Island like I I cant choose who he guards but I can I can definitely choose where I put the guy he guards is and you know hes has started the game here on Joe Gerard Tony Bennett said sometimes itll look like hes out of position and then the next thing you know his eyes turn he jumps back in he intercepts a pass the defensive player of the year in the league a season ago and may very well win it again this year on the spin Josh Beetle got to the rim Miner grabs a rebound Clemson just 5 for 17 to start against the second best scoring defense in the nation pman and dun back on the floor with Miner McNeely and Groves Kate Murray had the last two free throws for UVA theres beatman in the paint and PJ Hall sends it into the front row again on that sides and that curl action Clemsons going to play it a little bit like Drop covers in a ball screen theyre going to keep their big back so PJ Hall is back theyre going to force that midrange floater that midrange tough two and if you get too close you got the Eraser there in PJ Hall second best shop Blocker in the league only behind Ryan Dunn of Music Virginia mcney gets it from Miner F around Gerard Hall came to contest McNeely misses a three another rebound for sheelin is fourth good sense of urgency by PJ Hall to close out on that looking to feed him again working on miner with an early foul sheelin back cut Gerard took a little bump from beatman and finished but I think if youre Virginia youre okay with that you know Joe Gerard only 34 from two in conference play so you dont want him shooting threes its a tough two I think he can live with that Patman once again has the size of Wiggins on on him dun fre throw line jumper is way short and last Touch by Chase Hunter its good movement without the basketball though again hes got ree beakman on him and beakman denying here good cut and then off of that one foot that goofy foot good shot there but but Gerard and McNeely are the same neither of those guys have shot it well from two you want them taking shots like that good start for Gerard today it his first two shots one from Deep one from two theres a two for McNeely Meer a little too quick on the tap in Opportunity Hall Feed sheffet of the paint has a big weight advantage against Groves and Groves able to hold up well enough there seen some better post defense the last couple of games from Jake Groves only weighs 211 with that 69 frame now hes going to take it at sheelin and Groves will fit finish hes really starting to become confident offensively and I think thats where its its energized his defense and hes getting more comfortable as this team is these new guys in this pack line Hunter all the way for two Hunter had a couple of those in this game those are drives you dont typically see against this Virginia Defense early in the possession straight line drive another good look and Groves with a straight sweet St from Deep thats eight early and a couple of threepointers for the grand student Jake Groves a season High 18 on Wednesday hes nearly halfway there sheflin working on Groves again shefin leaves it short Miner comes in from behind and the ball is ruled to be last Touch by shefflin Jake Groves got it going early here and its a tough match up for sheflin youre going to have to move move your feet and because Groves can shoot and hes on a heater youre closing out leaving little space and then you get a little pin down big to Big Jordan Miner sitting a nice screen and Groves continues to stay hot Sacramento State coach David Patrick the longtime friend of Tony Bennett he was an assistant in Oklahoma helped make that connection between Groves and Bennett that connection is paying major dividends the last couple of weeks you can back on the floor hell fade away with nothing else to do at the end of the shot clock and Blake panan The Freshman from cordal Idaho gives Virginia its largest lead he probably traveled but PJ Hall stopped playing The Possession to referee and and that gave the space for Buchanan trying to find Gerard beakman fought through a screen so its a tough drive by Hunter done comes soaring in this will stay with Clemson yes it will with seven 52 to go Groves has been hot uvas up seven between those two tonight Sonic Blockbuster RJ Davis ACC Player of the Year front runner John shy looking to go three and0 as due coach against Carolina you have been on the sideline for some of those games what is it like it is amazing to me Kevin how much goes on around the game and the emotion that goes into it I mean I I remember Coach K having to tell guys dont play the game in layup lines and he would sub a lot early in the game too cuz guys you mean there just so much that goes into it and in and around it Hall got smacked by dud there are screams of foul wondering if Hall hit the hand along with the ball but call is a clean block for Ryan duny ACC shop block leader trying to set up Groves again and Groves misses the contested layup Le you Canon pulls it down a whistle foron UVA with its largest lead at seven bman makes it nine and a tough Drive what a nice job by Ryan done keeping that possession alive I mean that thats the thing with he and beatman they never stop playing I mean they they are alert on every possession every play right now its a freshman Buchanan on Hall will step out set a screen D Canon checks Hunter already 20 seconds gone by in the shot clock this is what happens against Virginia all the time five to shoot it Godfree driving done from behind to alter the shot dun picks it up another defensive Clinic put on by the Caps its one pass and then a guy is putting it on the floor the balls got to move and its got to move by the pass beatman with an early 8s four points away from a th career Groves and theres a kick ball kicked by Gro so UVA turns it over for just the second time and its been tough sledding I mean even when Clemsons been able to get it there its been tough sleding at the basket I mean Ryan Dunn as you said you know best shop Locker in the league and then just not very good defense there from Chase Hunter but Virginias got the two best defensive players in the league theyre their two best players when your two best players are bought in defensively doesnt matter if youre at Virginia or not the impact that has on a teams defense is exceptional Clemsons gotone nearly 3 minutes without scoring its missed its last four shots shooting at 29 in the game Beetle back on the floor with Godfrey shefflin Chas Hunter and Clark Chase Hunter a jab step in the face of beatman misses a three and all of a sudden theyre already 14 minutes gone by in the game and Clemson has just 16 points Bry Clemson cuts off a couple of Windows hell feed McNeely with eight to shoot beakman again step back thats a long twopoint jumper and Rees bman a much improved shooter of late is in double figures Clemson needs a timeout the team with the accs longest win streak is rolling at Little John back at 30 to Music Applause Music Clemson Rees beakman in Virginia leading by 11 watch the way the beakman moves here without the ball yeah theyre constantly and this is that rotating you know this is what they call sides and you know you youre too far off youve got to stay attached obviously but thats what beIN is starting to do I mean starting to knock down that Jay with consistency the other thing the impact it has on on Clemsons offense is having to defend for 30 seconds I mean thats what going to the end of the shot clock for Virginia offensively does tigers have not scored in nearly 4 minutes Gerards back on the floor deep in the shot clock again heres shefflin dun comes to double shefflin in a really dangerous position finds Beetle somehow who buries the three its a big shot and it ended up being a good find by shefflin but you cannot be surprised by the post double from Virginia J little life for the Clemson fans after a 90 run is snapped mcne no PJ Halls on the bench waving his towel trying to lead the cheers Gerard yes his second three dun will drive it at sheflin and help defense from Dylan Hunter to steal what a play one more basket his place is going to blow Gerard gets around McNeely in the miner who rejects his shot their bodies all over the floor and Ted Valentine is on the floor saying Clemson touched it out of bounds Virginia ball with a quick 60 spurt by Clemson yeah two threes here heres that post pass from shepon out of the double all the way across Court done get out of bounds and a little JoJo Gerard off of the bounce here right in you off face Andrew Roy hes wet so so wet with a couple of Threes for Clemson trying to fire up his tiger team and this tiger crowd tough shooting stretch for Joe Gerard just 32 from the field his last seven what are you noticing with him early well when he hasnt had re beatman on him like on that shot over Andrew roie you know hes been very aggressive and heres a little Zone from Clemson something they havent done a lot of McNeely from beatman got a clean look from Deep Miner in between Hall and sheelin keeps it alive throws it away gets it back its done who was really not much of a threepoint shooter five to shoot it for bman dun bman again for three it is no good Miner hes got another offensive rebound Grove sneaking in sheelin was the last to touch it he smacks the padding as Jordan Miner puts in Yans work to keep this possession alive and Alive matching up after the offensive rebound you got into some funky matchups one of those was Joe Gerard trying to block out Jordan Miner there m transfers not score but he has seven rebounds and two blocks Miner and this time sheflin will finally end The Possession off the beatman Miss Gerard inside the hall Miner swats It Away Jordan Miner is thinking a lot less hes playing much more instinctively now more athletically more physical talking to Tony Bennett before the game he was quoting Jerry tarania and he said you know I got to a point where the more I put in their heads the heavier their feet got you know he just kind of simplified stuff time has helped Miner on the ball right now Groves comes out to help Beetle hit that three a couple of possessions ago and scores it in the lane here Mak it an eight8 nothing Clemson run and thats his game that three he hit was his first in conference play only his third of the year he is a driver particularly to his left hand Virginias missed its last five Clemson back in that two3 zone Joe Gerard is well accustomed to this sort of thing dun over sheflin rebound to Wiggins Clon played a lot of Zone against Louisville and they got pounded on the glass cuz they werent comfortable rebounding out of it hall for three now 0 for three out there and a timeout taken by Virginia use it or lose it timeout for Tony benett whose teams lead is cut to three you expect a post double kick the ball to the other side now you have a defense thats closing out now you you have a shifting Virginia Defense thats how you have to beat them good penetration off of the close out and a really good find out of the double team by PJ Hall its an 80 Clemson run right now Hall only with two points but a good pass to set up Beetle hes got five sheins got five Gerard a some balanced scoring as the Tigers back in this at home Clemson team that Joel lard projects to be a seven seat at the moment Virginia team that Joe has is the 15 te out of the field looking for a big quad one win on the road under two to play in this first half which has been mostly led by Virginia and beatman Murray late catch off the screen from Buchanan five to shoot for Tame Murray theyll get mcney difficult shot in the lane mcney scores it anyway and thats where again PJ Hall is going to stay back they dont want that pocket pass going to the screening big they want to force mly to hit that shot tough one off balance the second basket hes two for six Gerard pickpocketed by beakman is third steal Beakmans going to pull it back out had bu Cannon running with him and now its Groves against Gerard bman send the mismatch there and Groves finishes over the top of the much smaller Gerard I mean it just starts from Rees beakman taking Joe Gerards cookies I mean that was like a high schooler taking it from an infant cannot turn it over against this Virginia this Virginia team they make you pay point off turnovers are 9 nothing UVA Wiggins John to Wiggins with his first basket that was a smart play by Groves not to pick up that ball until it was under 30 seconds to fully turn the shot clock off its a veteran dude whos played a lot of college basketball for three different coaches Virginia has led for nearly the entirety of this first half they lead by at least five into the break beakman sets up Groves off the shot phas Groves drills a three its the Jake Groves week all across the land in the ACC hes got 13 and a half and Virginia leads by eight what a flare screen and I mean Jake Gro has an sheins head ringing ding ding dong here you can go up double figures and against Virginia that can be really tough cuz they bleed you to death this is a very important first 5 minutes of this half for the Clemson Tigers one six in a row at Clemson Virginia trying to make it seven behind Groves reys Beakmans got 10 and PJ Hall with only two was one for six shooting it for Clemson in the first half well Groves who did not start the game is on the floor to start the half in the place of roie along with mcney beakman Dunn and Jordan Miner at a great first half despite not scoring UD shot at 42 in the first half 33 off from Groves Dunn had a good allaround half didnt score much Miner fighting for another rebound hes got his eighth and thats their 10th and this is a big lineup for Virginia with Groves at the three shop Fon Hall steps in yeah automatic for the people Jake Groves with 15 and thats the area where Clemson had to they had to win the battle on the glass today and they have not 10 offensive rebounds for Virginia starting five for Clemson Wiggins with a ball with sheflin Hall Gerard and Hunter its a tough Fade Away by Wiggins Groves has a rebound and virgins plus eight overall on the glass and thats not a good shot out of halftime your first possession thats a desperate shot from chony Wiggins hes got two points shooting at one for five Clemson has shot at just 34 3 for n from three t a shot clock mcney on the drive the righthanded floater goes for Isaac mcney Hall didnt Elevate to defend and Virginias scored on its last three possession straddling the half and thats those silent runs so you talk about it in football its the same in basketball going into halftime pman draped all over Gerard shean steps out this got doesnt miss hes 11 for 19 from three on the season and the chef hats in jooy it in the crow once again Virginia awfully deliberate with the ball beatman from miners a good find and an airball from in close and change it up the defense again Clemson there in a Zone Hunter probing thats where a lot of Clemsons offense has come on a tattoo cuz PJ Hall has been a nonfactor in this game and thats where CHA Chase Hunters at his best you know downhill in transition especially if you dont stop the basketball McNeely cant give him space in the midrange and mcne has got a couple of buckets here in the half eight points total its Clemson team a 16 or Sixpoint win over Louisville Tuesday in its last game they led by 22 and A2 had a really tough second half they will need to do the opposite of that today shefin through the contact of groves draws his second foul and we get to the line J where is that offense for Clemson going to come from and and again youre playing against Virginias defense a Virginia Defense that is playing its best of the season but they got it you know the the half that Jordan Miner had and you said this at halftime like you know there wasnt a lot in the stat sheet youre going to see from Jordan Miner he was magnificent in that first half though he was physical a physical presence on the interior did a really nice job on the glass and really took PJ Hall out of the game one of the better scoreless Hales of basketball you may see seven rebounds couple of blocks again helping the hold Hall to just two points as shefin becomes the first player in double figures for Clemson Roes fees Miner single coverage with Hall Miners on the dribble Jordan minor left handed hes scoreless no more wow oneonone he said I got you PJ Hall amazing to think this is only a seventh start hell guard hall right now hell Force Hall into another tough shot hes one for seven they got sheelin on beatman who did not use the screen and Gerard on Groves Beans going to try to take shefin to the hole done with the offensive rebound Miner kept it alive mcney would have been a big one shefin clears it for Clemson heres hunter in a tack boo again and hes gone after that matchup with McNeely you know you decide to put Reese peakman on Joe Gerard and there have been moments in this game where Chase Hunter has put it on the floor and attacked Isaac mcney Jack Clark picks up beatman now again its Groves against Gerard got seven Ines on him beatman three for three and Reese pman still looking for that 1000th Career Point Hunter again this time he feeds it to Hall who gets his rebound back and hes Maul by dun second foul undone PJ Hall to the line when we return Dr buckets here to start the half versus Jordan Miner oneonone is the first team all ACC candidate in PJ Hall says I got this and then Chase Hunter says Isaac M the net nonconference strength to schedule 171 so middle of the pack and the record in the top two quadrants is four and four Joel lardy has them as the fifth team out of the field win today would obviously be a quad one win on the road and youd have to imagine would get Virginia right up to that projected cut line well I dont think the theres any doubt with the way theyre playing theyre absolutely a tournament team and I think they are a prime example of how our metrics are flawed now in analyzing teams for the NCA tournament it does not allowed there is so much put on what you do in November and December especially when youre playing 20 conference games that it doesnt give a team like a Virginia for example time to get better and and they are certainly playing like a tournament team now you think it be better to wait the late season results a little more for picking tournament team I think we have to play less conference games or play less conference games this time of year other end of that spectrum is Clemson which is being still bolstered by what they did in November five to shoot heres McNeely set a couple of baskets in the second half thats a tough one and it will draw nothing meanwhile Clemson which beat Alabama TCU Davidson UAB South Carolina had a very good nonconference strength the schedule Brad Bells team has a projected seven seed despite a four and five ACC record back to Hall who just hit a couple of free throws and he scores it sometimes seeing it go through at the free throw line gets you going and and taking Jordan Miner out of the game that you know he understands hes got that matchup and so Brad branell goes right to him on the Freshman Buchanon six points for Hall lead down to three streamers waving in the face of Virginia as mcne is Deni a blocked shot from behind came from Chase Hunter with 11 to shoot just a good job following the play got back doored a nice pass from the top of the key but good job saving a twopoint bucket pman into Buchanan Rees pakmans missed his last five shots hes 4 for2 for the floor hell take it into traffic done flying in again and hes the last to touch it guns been all over the offensive glass and hes getting a run from the perimeter nobodys checking him and if youre Clemson here go back to PJ Hall on the Block against the Freshman 611 225 Buchanon against 611 238 a lot of muscle and Hall he wants it he does beatman trying to make sure he doesnt get it Hunter retrieves it Hall ceiling again he gets the ball and he cannot finish it theres some question of did dun Goen that basket the ruling is no and itll be two shots for PJ Hall well this is where if youre PJ Hall you go up to Josh Beetle and say yo men throw it in I mean you can get that ball to him they bypass him and he just stays right there that was a really good feed not really a tough angle for Chase Hunter to get it in there but you force feed him and you get him to the line no surprise what the counter move is here from Tony Bennett Jordan Miner back on for Blake Music Buchanan Tonys a smart guy thank you for your service break through Cannon please sit down theres a lot to ask for a sure is sure is wiy freshman against this kind of physicality and size Tony Bennett said theyve seen some size like this this year Florida Wisconsin but maybe not an ACC play and Hall goes one for two the lead is down to two its a 7 nothing Clemson run and PJ Hall will take a seat and he will Roar up the crowd on the way Virginia brings in Miner to get all and now its Miner and no Hall Andrew roie into Miner around Godfrey and Jordan Miner makes another impact his second basket and the lead back to four and thats that sides that pin down action Virginia runs and thats the pocket pass that they are so good at making if that big defensively comes up high theyre going to drop that down couple assist for mcney to go with his eight points three rebounds Jack Clark on roie misses the step back sheflin couldnt Coral the rebound beatman pushing beatman tough shot and hell get to the line heres this action that they run its its a continuity SL motion offense collab Kevin you know about collabs and thats where that big RJ Godfrey if youre going to come up if you come up too high thats where theyre going to drop that and Clemson so much today Brad Brownell wanted a play that a lot like Drop coverage on a ball screen where you stay back and you force a tough two in a lane by that guard curling just not played there well by RJ gried and he is asked to sit down PJ Hall will return collabs thats like when Taylor Swift and Phoebe Bridgers get together on nothing new right or szan Phoebe Bridgers well sizan absolutely bman those two for two at the line and there is the Big R number for reys beakman his 1000th Career Point a dozen today for the 63 senior from Milwaukee Wisconsin congratulations to Reese pman who can add a pretty special number to whats been a really special career two straight possessions with points to stop that seven nothing run and then its sheflin looking inside the hall back on the floor and Miner with his second foul you know Clemson runs a lot of stuff most of which ends in a high low and thats where this is I mean he just gets him PJ Hall gets Jordan Miner too far up the lane and then you got to hold him on that pass over the top Halls calling for it off the inbound Hall gets it off the inbound Joe Gerard yet to shoot in the half until now shefin had great position and that foul is going to be well before the shot after Ian sheins third offensive rebound one of this its a nice job you can offensive rebound when you expect a shot from a teammate and Ian shefflin was the one setting that screen he assumed Joe Gerard was going to shoot it coming off there and had good inside position its the third foul on Groves as well miners got two Gerard again yes sir thats a three for Joe Gerard and its a threepoint game theres that twoman game PJ hall now coming out sitting at screen forcing Miner away from the basket good shot off the dribble pman getting a breather right now RI and Harris are the Virginia guards along with Murray Harris feeds Miner he got contested by Hall and finished through the contact what a pass Paul inside shefflin seals off Groves who did not want to pick up his fourth foul theres that high low they are both very good PJ Hall and shefflin good bigt big passing and theyre both very good at carving out their angle on the Block shefs got a dozen roie for three Andrew roie just a 26 threepoint shooter with a big one as Tony Bennett takes a timeout after the make an unlikely source of offense putting the Cavaliers up six from three for that space and in Andrew roie 26 from three on the season and look at Joe Gerards body language The Scouting board report says youre fine you could cheat that screen hes not shooting it well a big shot to put this lead to six from an unlikely guy Gerards got 11 now three of four threes and then theres roie who over the course of this Virginia win streak is now just 5 for 23 hes really more of a distributor and a Defender heres threepointer pushes the lead back to six Virginias LED for nearly 26 minutes Clemson is Led for 92 seconds Gerard passes up a three Hall misses a three and hes 0 for four but wow Harris just blows the uncontested rebound and sheflin was I on the spot this is Dylan Hunter younger brother of Chase there is his big brother another Miss three the struggles from three continue I mean Clemson just has not shot it well from three in conference and PJ Hall thats the differentiator the versatility his ability to hit a face up shot the struggles continue he was wide open his last 8 6 for 36 from three PJ Hall Murray took a bump from Gerard Miner on the bounce solo with Hall Miner just shoves it up on the rim and he draws the foul PJ Halls first Jordan miners had a big second half Virginia still keeping Clemson at Arms Lan tigers and PJ Hall trying to return to winning ways the Cavaliers looking to make it six straight in the Music lead in college basketball than this all year six top 10 teams in three games Houston Kansas in the Big 12 Duke North Carolina in the ACC Tennessee Kentucky at rup so you get the fog Dean doome R arena Houston Kansas coming up after us that is a Monster game youve seen Houston in the Big 12 their first year in the league they made a brilliant adjustment you know the numbers we always use analytics uh to describe Houstons defense I think it only tells half half the story I mean it takes a special coach takes special players to play a very demanding a very physical defense youve got to be diligent about your habits you have to be committed you have to love contact all the things I do not like is what their defense does I mean is really a sight to behold and I think it travels today in in fog Allen you look at some metrics Houston is statistically the best team in the country they ranked fourth their only losses last minute losses at Iowa State in TCU Hall working on miner and theres shefflin again in the middle of three Virginia Defenders this will be an 11th offensive rebound for Clemson that Jordan Miner match up oneonone with PJ Hall has been a brick wall I mean its such its such a great thing for Tony Bennett because you really have dont have to double him when he catches it right there in the middle of the paint barely played early in the season minor four years at meramac in the Northeast conference look at him again deflect the ball Hall picks it back up though and he draws the third foul on Laughter miner and thats where I think you keep Force feeding PJ Hall as Brad Brownell is again nice little duck in they constantly duck you in throughout the 302 possession and foul trouble now you you start to put that in Virginias mind that starts to become an issue here as you continue to post Hall on minor PJ Hall 82 free throw shooter four for five today so Groves and Miner each with three fouls the miners going to stay in the game itll be a guard swap Murray and Harris out beakman and mcneel in now hang on a second Tony Bennett with a late decision to sub in Blake Buchanan for minor I I I I like it try to steal a few minutes especially as youre going down on the offensive end and its been you know good job by Clemson you know that middle post getting hauled a post in the middle of the floor you you take that automatic Virginia double on the on the post out of consideration just saw the good free throw numbers for Clemson on the season theyre eight for nine in the game down by five Midway through the second half Roy air mail I dont know what Andrew Ros looking at Ryan done for that was a terrible pass I mean it wasnt a great angle but even then youre pulling him way off of his position the position he had Virginia has the best dead ball turnover rate in the country that is a true odity sheflin why not go back to PJ Hall he misses his time and Dunn couldnt Corral it and sheflin comes hobbling out of there hes hes maniacal here hes a football player in high school and he plays the game that way his actually his first two visits to Clemsons campus were to Dabo Sweeneys football camp yeah it was not a hard decision for him to come here he just loved the school it was just a matter of what sport would he play looking for Hall again hell reset to sheflin and shein had some space Dunn comes over late sheflin cannot finish FES theyve missed a lot of layups today 8 for 21 is the lay now 8 for 22 is the layup number man for Clemson you hit half your layups I know its doesnt work this way you hit half your layups you have the lead in the game well and its what Clemson has done well this year I mean theyve shot 55 from Two and when you get it that deep against Virginias defense youve got to finish theyve missed a lot of layups today theyve been the second most efficient offense in the ACC with the worst threepoint percentage because they hit those shots all the time bman off a little screen from Buchanan into the body of WI and beatman rattles it home hes got 14 johy Wiggins is 610 but there are times where he plays smaller than his size theres no way beakman even with the little nudge nudge that he should be able to get that up over Wiggins Clemson has missed its last five on this end Gerard head space for a moment Wiggins will feed sheelin Buchanan doubles and its Hall against mcney Clemson will take down a really good cut down the middle of the lane good big to Big pass snaps an 0 for five drought for the Tigers the lead is back to five for the Wahoos beakman with Wiggins on him again now its shefflin trying to guard beatman he stays in front Miner off the shovel hard hard hit the deck thats a charge heres hunter in transition and a foul on the way up according to Ted Valentine free throws coming for Hunter Clemson can make this a threepoint game this game got some juice to it baby a little fire were on fire here its a big game two teams desperately needing a win for their tournament hopes PJ Hall has been one of the three best players in the ACC to this point in the season did not play like it in the first half only one of six from from the field and there was a big reason why Clemson was down eight at the half but hes been much more physical I I think hes been a become a willing participant in this game hes gotten himself to the line six times and hes really been a factor in this second half and its you know they need him right Kev I mean he has been the guy for them all year they need him down the stretch of this game this is 31st straight game in double figures PJ Hall has not shot it well from Deo for four from three but started to take control of the game in the post where Jordan Miner has three fouls Jake Groves has three fouls and both those players are in with Groves returning after a long break for Virginia free throws coming up for Chase Hunter dont forget you see in the top right corner of the screen Duke in North Carolina dont forget after this game here in the ESPN Houston and Kansas after Duke North Carolina its Kentucky Tennessee just a monster day a seismic Siege shifting day of college basketball on ESPN and a whole lot of other great games on our family and networks first time weve seen pressure out of the timeout you like it just to show a different look forc Virginia to think early into possession 8 for 15 shooting here in the second half theyve only hit four threes in the game though theres beatman switched on to shefin McNeely five to shoot McNeely nowhere to go with it bman again bman driving bman got the rim and in traffic Miner was able to help contest that rebound and it will go to Virginia again a play that wont still show up on the stat sheet for Jordan Miner but he keeps that possession alive I mean he has been an absolute monster on the interior today and Virginia plus six on the glass as a team pman again finds his way in the pain another tough shot Jack Clark this time its a one and done on the second shot opportunity Paul Gerard Way out oh my Joe Gerard from the Paw has tied this game the last time Clemson had the lead or was tied it was 87 bigman for an answer thats short rebound PJ Hall Hunter has been great pushing Tempo today not this time as beakman gets on the deck he sets up Clark who Three is out of play Joe Gerard is super confident always believes the next ones going in here he is from the parking lot where youre parked Kevin Brown he is so wet from there and what how about the emotion from Gerard Applause today your part next to me dont act like Im special six to play Gerard with 43 on five attempts Miner banging with Hall and he gives Virginia the lead right back and theres that roll again that pocket pass off of the curl and just banging bodies man lot of meat in there today Jordan Miner with nine points all to the second half it was a twopoint per game score before this string of starts Hall finally he breaks the threepoint seal and Clemson has its first lead in a couple of years heres Groves didnt like his look roie off a curl Gerard contests it another one and done for Virginia I dont know if thats the shot you want if youre Virginia from Andrew roie especially as Clemson has seized the momentum of this game first lead since 8 seven trying to grow it Hall in and out thats the matchup though coming in would the versatility be a problem for Jordan Miner it hasnt yet today until that three from Hall bman stripped and fouled only the fourth of the half on Clemson this is what this Clemson offense is designed to do with the versatility you play that high low when you flash PJ H Hall up there hes such a tough matchup when hes making that shot the problem is hes only shooting 23 from three in conference and so its really limited that option 14 points tonight 1455 in the career of PJ Hall second leading score in the ACC and defensively a great play by Hall to take it away from Buchanan Force Virginia to rethrow this has been a gritty half for Brad brells team has gone just three and five in the month of January four and five in the ACC theyre back on top against red hot Virginia they got beetle in the game guarding McNeely who hits a tough step back two Tony Bennett trying to buy some time before the TV timeout for Jordan Miner go to PJ Hall with Buchanan on him him they will for a moment Hall gets rid of it again Hall is going to make his move up top this time hell drive Buchanan holds up hell get it to Jack Clark met by Groves at the rim and denied surprised they didnt get Hall of the post there I would have loved to seen a post up for PJ Hall a jack Clark Drive like that is is not what you needed under four to play beatman the air traffic controller sets up mcney mcne misses a three he still has not hit a three today Hall will take it in this time that foul before the shot on the floor against Buchanan itll be a one and one for PJ Hall to try to give Clemson the lead when we return theres that contest what it like to have seen PJ Hall on the Block instead you get Virginia blocking Jack Clark in the backboard and then mcne coming for for Hunter dickon tonight top 10 triple header following us with Carolina Duke in Tennessee Kentucky but this game is far from finished Virginia with a onepoint lead PJ Hall with a one and one and he misses the front end big Miss and thats thats where they have shot it well as a team collectively and Hall thats a big miss the 14th best free throw shooting team in the country Hall at 82 leaves a couple of points out there and Virginia has the lead with 315 to go beakman with McNeely in the game along with dun Groves and minor and its dun chasing to save the play Groves somehow kept the foot inbound and hes fresh Tony Bennett had him on the bench hes managed his bench really really well thats a fresh Ryan dun out there little hobbled after that play he gets back up Groves tough shot over sheelin Jake Groves with 17 Virginia with a threepoint lead Virginias beat Clemson up on the offensive glass today its been able to extend possessions you play a ton of Defense with how Virginia runs their offense looking for a seven straight win over CL at Little John Miner went over the top thats his fourth foul a one and one again for Hall after this save its is a winning play he hes going two onone there and how about that save and it leads to a basket I mean we we we talk about people being competitors all the time like to me a competitor is somebody whos always on to the next play you know what can I do on the next play to impact winning what a play by Ryan Dunn b gets the front end Ryan Dunn only three points in the game Chris but eight rebounds three offensive rebounds a blocked shot and gree pman doesnt win the defensive player of the year it might be because of that guy no question oh this time goes two for two the lead back down to one theres a little pressure again from Clemson they havent show it much Miner has to come all the way back to get it now what do Tony Bennett look for in this possession I think you you go back you run your stuff you know and thats where theyve been able to get stuff off their offense and then crash the glass Clemson youve got to finish the possession with a defensive rebound pman searching finds McNeely hes fouled he hits the three oh what a moment for your first threepointer of the game Isaac mcney hes a dagger man I mean weve seen big threes today Joe Gerard earlier and then heres Isaac mcil and this is their offense I mean here he is hes just coming off just a curl and shefflin youve got to be up knowing that that Shooters coming off there got to be at the level of the ball after a wide screen by Ryan Dunn to springham a fourpoint play for a five point lead Gerard lost it with beakman against him Gerard will hoist that was even deeper than the one he hit earlier and its shefin who has the ball after dud and Clark went tussling to the ground o mcne is on the deck sheflin has the ball that has be a foul in there somewhere no question pman came in from behind youd call the foul on a couple of different people and well just make sure Jeff Clark has a foul on the C what a job there by Isaac mcne staying in front of the ball hits the three on one end and then oneonone keeps Chase hunter in front forces that loose ball its been a physical game the foul was on groes is fourth so thats the 10th foul against Virginia two free throws the rest of the way for shefflin and Clemson these are must makes because you know Virginias going to work the clock theyre going to force you know going to force you to play nearly 30 seconds of Defense these are Big free throws must make missed sheflin a 77 foul shooter much improved this year he splits the pair and its 6460 Clemson still has three timeouts Virginia with two Brad brell will set up the pressure get into the dun not a great free throw shooter Virginias not in the bonus yet and UVA does get it across the timeline just got to be solid if youre Clemson and then defensive rebound 90 seconds to play Virginia looking for a six straight win on the season McNeely still McNeely through the iron tip by dun rebound Clark Clemson not exactly moving in a fast tempo here Hunter will change that into the body of Miner if thats on Jordan Miner its his fifth lets see I think the foul was called on done I think Jamal spearmans got that on Ryan dun actually theres a great t you know its its great oh it was the reach from dun first hell put the pressure on Virginia to have to make a play and in those spots throughout the year thats where theyve gone to PJ Hall on the Block Jordan miners defense has been such a deterrent good job by Hunter taking the initiative Brad branell is flashing 22 he thinks its on minor but it looked like the foul is called on the reach first by Don and the officials will get together here try to clear that up and the crowd sees the foul on well it would have been a foul on miner and it would have been a foul on him but the reach was called before that chase Hunter 86 one of the best free throw shooters in the league gets the first Hunter one of four tigers and double figures 11 points today that makes it a twopoint game shefin will guard the ball and bakman gets it in quickly to Miner and Virginia has not had trouble with the press a minute to go with a twopoint lead searching for a major quad one roadwi try to put Virginia in a really good NC a tournament position at the beginning of February Seven to shoot heres beakman hes been the man all season feeds Miner dun is there for the tip sneak attack for a two possession lead the offensive glass he never stops playing two winning plays I mean the save from out of bounds that got him a bucket he never stops playing thats a competitor someone whos always on to the next play and theres that curl nice job by beakman playing off it theres that pocket pass and then just sneaking in there as theyve done all day the offensive glass has been the Kryptonite here for Clemson 15 offensive rebounds for Virginia on their 33 misses done of Virginia to have to inbound the ball against your press to have to make free throws pressure free throws on the road be aggressive here if youre Clemson no field goals Clemson in the last 5 minutes theyll get it to Hall against Miner who has four fouls Hall with a body Hall stepping in Hall left it short rebound Ryan dun and he is fouled its all Jordan Miner only the six fouls so Virginia will have to inbound but Miner with the four fouls holds up again been an immovable wall today and hes done a heck of a job on one of the Leagues best players its a winning defensive play and thats what Clemsons done all year in winning time theyve gone to PJ Hall on the Block so bman to inbound it he gets it to McNeely thats the guy who wants shooting the free throws of Virginia Beans not a bad choice either McNeely ahead to Groves and Groves is fouled by Hall at 191 its a lot of time his first 17 you know you look at Virginia in the turnaround and and you know Jordan Miner has been the guy whos gotten all the attention for that but but you see why today I mean he just gives him a dimension against one of the Leagues best players defensively physically big Miss by Groves still a twopossession game and Clemson takes its third timeout well that opens up a few more options the Miss free throw by Groves it stays at Four Points this was the big play though a few moments ago speaking of Four Points Virginia got all of them on one possession from one of the nations best a guy shooting 51 from three in conference has seen a lot of different defensive coverages but with the way that Virginia runs their offense thats a tough action to guard and then a guy who can make a tough shot hes did a lot of tough ones today here you said early in the game you have to make Isaac mcy take twos and theyve guarded him well from three thats his only make he said five jump shots from inside the arc as well so more wellrounded game for McNeely Tony bet didnt want to say he was the best shooter hes ever coached he said look I coached Klay Thompson and Kyle guy hes up there in just his second year of the program 2 his percentage I mean his icy shooting 51 from three only 33 from two mean thats why youve got to make him a twopoint shooter youre kpon if you got a quick one here H again Im in favor of going for two get downhill put the pressure on Virginia Virginias not a good free throw shooting team either Wiggins has to do something here 10 seconds hes had the ball for 6 seconds Hall oh wow he was fouled by minor shooting at three that is a gift from the heavens and its miners fifth yeah not sure what youre doing there you just got to have your hands in the air be big force him to shoot it over length if he hits it tip your hat youre still up one just not a smart play and Brad Brownell was going for three there hes running a comebacker for for Joe Gerard so Hall hits off three free throws here even if Virginia hits two free throws Clemson would have a chance to tie and Jordan Miner out of this game played a brilliant game but he fouls out with 75 to go you told as a player there no threes no fouls so thats why Im always in favor of driving it cuz the teams theyre not going to foul you youre going to get a pretty clean look you definitely do not want to foul a threepoint shooter obviously PJ Hall 82 on the year got the first you do not need to miss it here I I I think you make this you set up your press you foul right away theres still time Virginias going to take its third timeout virgin remember Virginia is one of the worst free throw shooting teams in the country 65 they ranked 330th four for 16 but he has helped Salvage it with nine free throws 18 points one shy of the season average or two shy of the season average for the ACC second leading score Clemson has Clark and Wiggins on the line as rebounders no sheflin in the game right now interestingly and Hall hits the third its a pressing lineup its taking Hall off too its your pressing lineup Virginia brings in Murray for Dunn for a little bit of a better free throw five Dante Harris the inbounder Virginia has a timeout Harris will use it that five count might have gotten to about 496 well thats why you you have the lineup out there if youre Brad Brownell nice job in denial good job running the Baseline by Dante Harris here again in these these situations the inbounds passer is the most important player on the floor for reasons like that to know to have that clock in your head to know when to call that timeout thats the last timeout for Virginia which was able to run the floor after the ma basket now it takes the timeout though with 75 to go Virginias LED this game nearly the whole way theyve LED for 35 minutes and 2 seconds Clemson is only LED for 240 UVA is led by as many as 12 clemon has never led by more than three now Tony Bennetts got Isaac mcney taking the ball out a little more quickness I think with Dante Harris to try to get free because you dont have any timeouts like you said he is their best free throw shooter but the most important thing here is just getting the ball in cant run after the timeout he gets it into Harris thats a good player to foul eight for 15 on the year and hell go to the line for a one and one and Gerard and Hall will check back in now for Clemson but Clemson has a timeout here if he misses it if youre Brad benel do you call the timeout at some point or do you like to just let this lineup something in an unsettled sit Im always yeah Im always in favor of of going and playing against a defense that doesnt have the opportunity to script what it wants officials are checking the clock right now Houston Kansas starting on ESPN news John chabby Fran Pilla the great Chris Buton and Lawrence for that one they will join us after the conclusion of this 6665 Virginia and the Cavaliers have won five straight overall theyve won their last six games here at Clemson theyve LED for more than 35 minutes and they are trying to put the finishing touches on what would be from a resume standpoint their best win of the season so Dante Harris how do you do no points 5 minutes in the game 15 free throw attempts on the year missed a lot of time with an ankle injury heres the biggest free throw of the game and he missed it with seven points two here comes Hunter for Clemson its Hunter with three its Clark For the Win no it was Jack Clark with the last shot and Virginia survives at the buzzer well you didnt need three Im surprised Chase Hunter didnt get try to get downhill I mean to get some free throws to get it up on the glass and for Jack Clark to be the one to take that shot that that is not thats not what you want but look you dont call a timeout youre leaving it up to your team to make the right decision Chase Hunters got to drive that ball there a wild ending a Wild win for Virginia six in a row for the Cavaliers for Chris this is Kevin soong from Clemson now the first of our top 10 triple header Houston Kansas lets get you to Lawrence
