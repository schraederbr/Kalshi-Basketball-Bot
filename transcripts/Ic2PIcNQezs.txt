amongst the questions tonight can the Citadel deal with Armando Bangkok and Friends well one of the things Ed Conroy their coach has been here before at Citadel and he understands what needs to be done in this building with this crowd and and this type of environment whether or not his team can execute is something we have to wait and see meaning 20 all time between the Bulldogs and Tar Heels underway here at the Dean Smith Center officials need to sell rainy Stines and general Stephen Clark and the Bulldogs trying to rebound after a loss 10 days ago against the College of Charleston shot clock already under 10 down to five now down to two the three up the threes had Elijah Morgan from Deep Citadel has constant ball movement and player movement and it always causes their opponents a lot of problems love Davis black Nance and baycott the five for the Tar Heels foreign takes a look puts it on the floor now a launch out of bounds and back send it out defensively has to play a gap type defense not allowing Carolina to get a lot of penetration just because of their size catch and shoot from the corner thats no good pay cut for the offensive rebound one of the best in the country in that category but three is in from caleblanc offensive rebounds going to always come back to hurt you especially with the shooters North Carolina has der Ash Morgan price and Clark price in the lineup tonight to replace David Maynard who will come in Off the Bench Citadel will go a lot through Clark they need him to be explosive there you see him scoring in the pain he just does so many things for them hes a leading scorer for the Bulldogs averaging 16 per Applause Music this Carolina team still plays oldfashioned basketball they play inside out and they look for penetration they look to feed the post they look for dribble drives Clark trying to penetrate here trying to spin off tough defense provided by Pete Nance and hes got the ball fans will try for deep thats gone Nance has really stepped up and helped this Carolina team he is he can play in the low post and he can also knock down the trail three 36 percent on the year from three thats been a weakness for North Carolina this season behind the arc down low price against Bangkok tough matchup his layup underneath the rim off tomorrow and a Bangkok rebound Applause Music into Bangkok double teamed and a foul well thats among the matchup problems tonight for the Bulldogs and thats one of the things coach Conroy said they cant afford to do it hes getting foul trouble the one thing that you see Nas on the trail three hes very very good at that hes able to space the form where you get that kind of spacing it gives you easier angles to pass the ball into Bangkok in the low post foul charges Stephen Clark thats his first Music thats the one guy coach when we ask them and shoot around who you cannot afford to lose he said Clark and hes so pivotal for the Citadel to have any chance to win this game tonight he has got to be productive on both ends of the floor without question but one of the things Carolina does is they always get to the foul line and thats because they really do a good job of attacking them and playing inside out 105 lead for the Tar Heels after the trip to the freethrow line by Baker look for Center down to space the floor to get a lot of pulsed up and cutters and the Brady Spence whos into the game for the first time hook shot right hand no good one and done again for the Bulldogs black on the move Applause the foul these Carolina guards are so quick whatever you see on television really does not show their quickness and speed they move the ball there you see the penetration and plus theyre very strong Dirk around the basket and they can finish penetration is so key at times to the play of this offense as love finishes off the threepoint play we talked about the struggles from Deep they can get to the rim pretty effectively and the guards when they pick up steam they could be tough down low well I think both guards are good Shooters they can make tough shots but where theyre really good is in transition and that quickness and attacking the basket Clark on the attack gets that one to go tough shot for Steven Clark the Charlotte North Carolina native hes got four and its a lead of six and that time they had it matched up maycatch was on him and he attacked him right away dance throws that one into the lane not sure what he saw and its a turtle gets it right back there down the floor Bay caught short on the layup and a rebound grab by Spence Im not sure if Citadel can can play at this pace and Madison Durer on the move a foul picked up lets find leaky black thatll be his first sixpoint lead for the Tar Heels Virginia Tech on Saturday Armando bacon RJ Davis double doubles each way thats a pretty productive formula for the Tar Heels it really is and a lot of people talk about the team last year and this year this is a whole different group guys have different roles and theyre finding their way into those roles but being able to get that kind of balance really will start to be the identity I think of this North Carolina team fifth time since 2000 a paratar heels go 20 and 10 in a game Music as they won their home opener in ACC play off to miss three by Austin Ash I think Tar Heel possession down low bacon catches score hes too deep you cant let him get that deep every time he runs to the front of the rim the ball is pass to the right he rolls right and balls pass to the left he rolls to the left but they always look to get him off the transition one of the best low post players in the nation doing work early eightpoint lead for the Tar Heels but while the foul coming up here on North Carolina again Carolina loves to run the floor there you see baycock he gets deep position right in front of the rim hes hard to handle there but thats thats a skill set I mean thats not done by accident I mean thats planned its about sharing the basketball thats been one of the concerns for Carolina during that fourgame losing streak different story in the win against Georgia Tech well thats always been a part of this Carolina program sharing the basketball they were the ones who coached Dean Smith when the guy makes a nice pass they point at him and thank you for the assist thats part of the Carolina tradition five North Carolina field goals hooked up by four assists thus far and an eightpoint lead for North Carolina Citadel has to keep moving and keep cutting down low the layup is in from Brady Spence so bench productivity among the keys here for the Bulldogs to stay in this game Applause Seth Trimble into the game for the first time Puck Johnson getting a look as well hes got it here shot clock to 10 for Trimble outside three ball up that is a little short Nance offensive rebound off the Miss by caleblanc and a trip to the free throw line on the way okay they lose trouble was the guy that made the penetration he created that they absolutely love him they love the way he can play either guard spot they love the way he integrates his game the rest of the guys and its really going to be a tremendous boost for this Carolina team as they get into the harder ACC play and its good on the first coming up next at nine on ESPN2 Brandon Miller in number four Alabama hosts Penny hardaways Memphis Tigers at Coleman Coliseum should be a great one coming up at 9 00 pm the dark Hills know a lot about Alabama that Alabama team is really talented now they I tell you to go into Houston and beat Houston in Houston thats a tremendous speed Applause hey previously number one in the nation no longer courtesy of the Crimson Tide Five Points so far for Nance crossing over wow what a beautiful layup by Elijah Morgan Morgan one of the two transfer graduate students in this starting lineup for the Bulldogs hes got five nice to Citadel does a great job of moving the basketball Carolinas gonna have to guard the full clock to love miss a new possession to kick the Trimble hell try it for three oh almost backed that one in instead its a Jackson price rebound yeah another three this time for Morgan he cant connect there Trimble into the front Court Morgan transferred from Notre Dame that was a little quick I think for Coach Conroys taste Johnson no good on the three offensive rebound by baycott double team kick out now to the Baseline Johnson his jumper thats no good another offensive rebound by Badcock but he loses the ball hes got six already here to start as Clark steps in lost the ball Tar Heels with numbers Johnson in the lane Johnsons layup no good and a blocking foul coming up against the Bulldogs that time Bangkok is doing a great job on the offensive glass I think hes getting a little bit frustrated hes getting bumped and pushed a little bit the referees are letting him play there you see on the transition right there great finish got underneath of him but thats the way Carolina likes to play they really like to get out they like to feel the lanes they like to get easy baskets things have gone well for them here to start out the game up by six as the foul picked up by Madison Durr and for Durr thats his second and thats one of the guides along with Clark that coach Conroy really was concerned with getting in foul trouble because he brings a physical presence also too this is a unique experience for the Bulldogs they dont come here often they have not played North Carolina since 1991 so this is a challenging environment for the players and then you have to deal with obviously the talent on the floor oh without the question most teams come in here they want to tour the building they want to see the statue they want to see the jerseys you know they want to see all the memorabilia and then you have to play a really really good North Carolina team so thats what I said I think coach Conroy has been here before prepared his team and came in last night they did their tour then and hopefully that theyre ready to play today you can get lost in the rafters here just staring into space with all the history youve never been here before Clark stripped in the lane after putting it on the floor love the drop to Nickel hell try it from Deep thats no good just went down kept around and controlled by price they really like nickels on the transition as a shooter nickel scored over 2 900 points in high school thats another reason why they like him he can fill it up Clark as his progress cut off and its still by nickel Tyler Nichol on the Move stripped and out of bounds it stays with the Tar Heels I think Clark is instead of trying to penetrate and try to shoot over the size of North Carolina for Citadel to have any chance hes gonna have to pull up and take the short jump shot will set up shop for Bay cop eight minutes in Tar Heels up Applause Music audition early six points too big too strong he does a great job with angle you have to get him above the block if he catches it below the Block its very difficult to stop Applause to the block for Clark shot clock to 10 the kick out top of the arc three no good yeah those are the shots that Citadel has to be able to make as Carolina collapses defensively tough layup by love and the rebound controlled by the Bulldogs and David Maynard whos in the game Maynard coming in off the bench after starting previously Ash launches and scores wow the problem is sometimes he has a hard time getting the shot off because hes not really quick a foot but that time he got it he said Im open and Im letting it fly the Iowa Transfer with his team leading 30th threepointer of the season Applause North top rickle tries a three thats no good a little bit too strong over to caleblock love defeated thats how in southeast his Carolina team is I tell you you know I was at the ACC media day and those guys were there and you could just tell how well they get along they like each other they have a great recall with Coach Davis and Coach Davis has a great rapport with them as well he talked about how much he enjoyed being around his guys today and shoot around Manor outside for Price another look from three this one hits Music you have to knock down a couple of Threes Citadel Dodge with just with the spacing if you dont then North Carolina is not going to come out and challenge a lead down to five Trimble a little post for Bangkok scores again with the movement North Carolina just did on that possession is what they need to do because Citadel is looking to double Bangkok I mean theyve just got a guy sitting on top of him beside the guy guarding him so you have to give him some movement ten and six already for baycod off the Miss by Clark tipped outside to Nickel Love On The Run for the Tar Heels Nichols open for three catch and shoot Runs Out Applause into the front Court well you know he wants to shoot it and he launches it here this one no good and Coach Conroy was telling him slow it down a little bit and asked this coach Im open who hammers it home 12 now for baycott yeah he does a great job of precatch putting himself in a position to score so when the when he does get the ball he knows exactly where he is and he can finish tip of the cap to Seth Trimble moving the offense along as the corner three by Jackson price is good against in the Georgia native keeping the Bulldogs in and hes got six well price is really going to war with Bangkok down low so hes taking him on the perimeter tremble down low cant finish Ash tries to shoot one overbank Music and get to the bench to say how about that thats an unbelievable shot everybody sent actually a tremendous shooter and he and Clark are the heart and soul of this Citadel team and you could tell coach Conway has been well prepared coming in here not to be intimidated foul coming up and the Bulldogs feeling it there you see Ash coming down pump fake the distance doesnt matter too for Citadel take hes a tremendous player he comes in that helped Davis Love and Bangkok and make them better he does a great job of delivering the ball he can play either Gods fine he really accelerate this North Carolina break and gets easy opportunities for people hes just what coach Davis was looking for coming in as a freshman career high three assists on Saturday hes got three assists in eight minutes tonight for the Tar Heels Off the Bench but he plays with so much confidence and he understands what his role is and who hes playing with dantras Styles in and a foul coming up and well step out once again threepoint lead for the Tar Heels stay tuned good I can stand and Perry as you take a look at what hes done so far four wins against division one opponents in November thats a program record he wanted to challenge his team coming out of the game I tell you what he has always done a great job he was at Tulane place I was at I know the job he did there he lost his two best players transferred out in second year after winning 20 games and hes not going to be intimidated in this building he understands what this team needs to do to beat this Carolina team hes been against the Tar Heels as a player and as a coach as well its Clark trying to work some magic down low and scores Clark is fearless I mean hes not really a big guy and he doesnt overpower you but his skill set is really good and everybody hes played against has given him rave reviews as far as his ability to pass and score the basketball Nance stops an 80 run from the Bulldogs hes got eight its a lead of four for North Carolina Lance has done a really good job with this Carolina team and being able to stretch the floor when you got a fourman or five man that can shoot the ball like that it just opens up driving lanes for Davis and Trimble and and and love and thats what Carolina the way that they really want to play fifth turnover for the Bulldogs by the way rebounding out of that last media timeout a problem for the Bulldogs they have seven total rebounds the Tar Heels have seven offensive rebounds not great no but Citadel but dont even make the three and then the evening faster and thats something theyre not a great threepoint shooting team but theres something that they have to be able to do to stay in this game today Jackson price will head in is that foul committed by Stephen Clark picks up foul number two thats team found number six for the Bulldogs and its a little bit too strong on the first free throw Thursday night we have the number one ranked Womens Basketball team in the nation on ESPN2 and yeah Aaliyah Boston and South Carolina square off against the South Dakota State jackrabbits who have already knocked off two ranked teams this season coverage from Sioux Falls begins at seven Eastern as they defeated Louisville in November in Kansas State on Saturday so a very intriguing game coming up on Thursday night Applause for North Carolina Ash swinging around the arc get it inside the price hes got it here price turning around cant score Stan white guys shoot the ball before they find the basket and price did it that time he got them on a low block the ball was out of his hands before he was located the basket Corner three is in from Don Francisco he located the basket very quickly they really like Styles they think defensively he can really help and if he can continue to knock down those jumps up the threes like that first points of the Season by the way for style when you look at this Carolina roster and see how many minutes their guys play its hard to play that many minutes for the whole season so some guys have to develop and come off the bench and help them with a shot clock winding down price with the layup and again the Bulldogs hanging around priced with eight prices played very very well battling Bay in the low post being able to score himself offensively he has really been a plus in this first half Jalen Washington in for the Tar Heels what a great story he is well get into that tonight Davis Turn Around Jay off the mark But box out and aboard for the Bulldogs Applause long three missing high off the rim out of the hands of Morgan and that ball gets stuck on top of the backboard you hate to see it yeah but Ed Conroy really gives his teams a lot of credit a guy to take that type for three right off the second pass uh at Carolina you can tell the confidence hes putting his balls left well thats a pretty good segue to Jalen Washington who made his season debut against Georgia Tech on Saturday he played two minutes scored his first points of the season coming off of a torn ACL in July of 2021 has come all the way back and Carolina views in reviews in as a major piece potentially in what theyre trying to do this year and thats really important its coming off with an injury and getting the confidence that you had before you got the interview is really critical off the Miss and a loose ball foul coming up here good battle down low but its won by Styles and the Tar Heels and this crowd is appreciating the lineup that that Carolina has where theyve got young guys now on the floor helping them because they know that some of the veterans are going to need the blows as the season progresses oneonone situation after the foul picked up by Colby McAllister by the way after Washington finished up on Saturday he got doused with water by his teammates who are so happy to see him out there and contributing after just what has been really a tumultuous time for him dating back to his days in high school and now finally being able to get back out on the floor for North Carolina you know your teammates see you on the sidelines rehabbed and all the extra stuff you have to go through and and then the training run and the pain Hardys had to work to get back two from Styles he has five eight point lead for North Carolina Derek Jones and Perry Clark with you tonight from the dean Dome Bulldogs trying to hang around with the Tar Heels Ash again from Deep this one misses and the rebound take it away by RJ Davis Applause Miles trying to keep his feet lost the ball in the lane to kick Morgan from three the offensive rebound by AJ Smith Smith off the window and in thats a big car offensive rebound one of the things Citadel is doing to try to eliminate North Carolinas transition and putting three guys back so both cars are getting back and theyre taking one of their forwards and not sitting into the ground along into Washington Washington fouled Applause a couple of free throws on the way for Mr Washington Music there you see Styles stepping up knocking down a three and Sean as we bring you back to the Dean Smith Center six point lead for the Tar Heels over the Bulldogs is kind of continuing a little bit of that thought process so lets get into it a little bit here Perry North Carolina lost four in a row they won against Georgia Tech as we know there is a lot of concern in Tar Heel Nation about whats going on what say you its just college basketball Applause uh Alabama thats not a bad loss I mean being on the road and the environment they were in going up to Virginia Tech and playing without Badcock I mean its not a bad loss I think that this team is starting to come together the thing that makes team really good and large is adversity early theyve gone through some adversity lets see the way that theyre handling on the Horizon by the way for North Carolina Ohio State and Michigan on a neutral Court coming up and what a move there by AJ Smith hes got four right back down the floor North Carolina trying to take advantage and leaky black got hit there leading to a whistle got a couple of shots on the way I tell you what coaches would tell you a team like Citadel is not necessarily A Team like to play right now because of the fact that you got you youre in between League games Citadel is very skilled they pass the ball they dont hurt themselves and theyre capable shooters the thing they lack is the athleticism that a lot of the teams and maybe in the ACC may have but as far as skill set theyre very good with that our NBA Wednesday doubleheader has Julius Randle and the Knicks taking on DeMar DeRozan and the Bulls at 7 30 Eastern than Anthony Edwards and the Timberwolves played their fourth game of a fivegame road trip against Kauai Paul George and the Clippers our coverage tips off with NBA Countdown at seven on ESPN and the app the drive to the Lane missed shot and tries had an opportunity there to follow off the Miss by McAllister and jump ball The Possession goes over to North Carolina size of North Carolina around the rim has created problems for Citadel the whole game thats why sometimes its good to drive it and kick it and get a wide open shot Davis kick to Nance open for three got it another three for Pete dance hes got 12 and a lead of 10 4131 timeout called by the Bulldogs largest lead of the game for North Carolina here 10point Advantage Derrick Jones and Perry Clark with you from Chapel Hill tonight as Hubert Davis trying to get his team to head into those tough games against Ohio State and Michigan coming up the twogame winning streak but the Bulldogs have been feisty here tonight well for Carolina tonight there you go its going to take a good Workman effort to get this win tonight because this Citadel team is very fundamental incentive Madison tour has the ball here he has not scored yet in this game trying to create his jumper contested altered by black and the Tar Heels on the Run outside Davis three connected three pointer for RJ Davis averaging 16 points per game and that extends the lead to 13 price going to get past baycott fires it up with the right hand and it dips in sorry thats a great run and again price is able to step away from the basket they also brought Clark back from the corner Applause Music thats what the Carolina guards can do to you I mean they can hurt you so many different ways theres such good Shooters and drivers and Estelle three on two black got stripped and it went awful leaky black out of bounds Citadel Basketball I really thought he was playing for the foul and thought he got fouled I think the official was not really in a great position to see it because they were trailing there you see the knockdown jump shot right there for the three and thats what Carolina is really doing a good job with with their guard play Clark contested by Nance Bangkok cleans it up Music and a foul coming up they just dont have answers for baycod down low already has seven rebounds but theyre putting about three Gods on the minute the shot goes up about three guys are banging him that just arent physically strong enough to still contain it its almost like Nats at a picnic I mean you know theyre more its more of a nuisance than anything else and bacock is looking for the fouls he he does have that expression thats a good comparison knocks out the free throw he does have that look on his face sometimes down low as if to say will you guys get off of me Music they caught the line for one more and hes had a huge first half 138 stay at 138 with Grant called for a foul dance has 12 price on the other side for the Bulldogs with 10 and rebounding has definitely been an issue in this game but there Nance picks up a foul trying to get an offensive board and thats a huge call because that could have been the Third on Clark which would have been disastrous to sit it out as much as the dismay here of the fans Dean Smith Center Applause now back in the car by Bangkok not to the floor and a tie up possession arrow points in favor of the Bulldogs again Citadel is having a hard time finishing at The Rim besides of North Carolina and athleticism is really creating a problem for him there you see Clark driving you know they just got their hands straight up clean block play on Clark and and hes it really one of their toughest players as the three missing ball tipped around and grabbed by styles obviously he can score it but also hes one of the Premier shot blockers in program history as Hubert Davis and the Tar Heels will call a timeout and well draw something up here with 33 seconds left a half as a head coach I think theyre going to run some kind of horns action where they can get Bay on the roll and pop maybe the other post which would be Nance and then put Shooters in the corner Nance has been active in the first half hes in double figures Clark is now out of the game they dont want him to pick up his turn also maybe keep your eye on Tyler Nichol whos back into the game as well Applause Davis going to work for the Tar Heels to close out the first half Applause Davis into the corner dance three short Applause and now Ash is fouled by Caleb love with 66 seconds remaining Carolina always seems like they have fouls to give late in the half thats been a Carolina tradition now why would they want to do that just just to clarify so that you so you dont get a shot out of transition you got to set it up you got to take the ball out of bounds it makes it a much more difficult offensive opportunity and another foul to give and it makes it a little bit more difficult from a timing standpoint as well another foul picked up here theyve always done a very very good job of that the only time has become a problem is when they wanted to send teams to the foul line and they have to give so many to get there so now 16 fouls and a ball that sticks out of bounds away from price by Bangkok the other thing that Carolina is known to do when these inbound plays is to double it and to try to come up with the Steal Clark four seconds ash from Deep this is everything and itll roll back over to the Tar Heels and the fans giving him the business but he had more space for that shot than he did on his couple of other early ones maybe he had too much space Music at the half 15 point lead for the Tar Heels Strong finish for Carolina Carolinas doing a great job on the glass so that theyll have to clean that up because thats what Carolinas dominating 138 for Armando baycott off to the earliest Citadel was knocking down some threes and staying around but since then Carolina has really stepped up defensively yes when you have the third best offensive rebounder in the nation and Armando baycott hes back on the floor RJ Davis Caleb love not clocked at 10 Applause dance with a five against Clark Fade Away Jay got this is something about Carolina fact youre going to get used to mass can not only on the perimeter face and shoot the three but he can also post up and create problems for other people in that low post position 14 points for the Northwestern transfer North Carolinas 48 points in the first half a season best to the first 20 Morgan with the kick out Madison third trying to get going his layup is no direct but thats what bird does real well he attacks the rally he had 209 against the College of Charleston and rolled up blocked by Clark against Bay caught out of bounds see the little basketball big kite did not know he was there he felt that his defender on him rolled away from him and was able to get a good look he didnt see Clark coming over from the weak side Clark is adept at blocking shots hes a team leader in Block shots thats his 16th of the season Applause he had 75 last season and he is closing in on the program record by season 10 Applause Citadel not going to change the way theyre attacking down low a block Bangkok the kick to black and black is fouled see perimeter guys never mind getting the ball to you in the low post when you share it in Bangkok that time instead of forcing a bad shot kicked it for an easy shot they usually Bangkok rolling making the block he loves to do that and sets up his teammates for transition so leaky black at the line for a pair Bay is just so important to the Carolina tackles offensively and defensively and these guys play so well off of each other third foul picked up by Madison Durer and we talked about baycotts ability to rebound the basketball hes becoming one of the best in the history of college basketball doing just that averaging a double double this season as black gets both and obviously if North Carolina is going to get close to what they did last year which is get to the final four and get to the national championship game hes obviously going to have a monster has to have a monster effort but also has to get help as well without question and thats why its important in this game for Coach Davis to start working that bench and getting that bench more involved BART to it against dance hes Fearless in there I mean he doesnt overpower you but his skill set is very good hes got eight smart move there by black to just throw it off of Durham stays with North Carolina you know speaking of black every team Ive always maintained this needs a guy you dont have to run a play for and he can help you thats Tiki black he does all the tough stuff for North Carolina defensively offensive rebounding and they dont really run a lot of sets for him RJ Davis bangs in a three hes got six the Carolina guard always seemed to come up with tough shots I mean they make really big time shots largest lead of the game for North Carolina at 20 that was one of their calling cards last year late in the season hit time threepointer Ash over to Clark Clark for three to shoot Clark throws it up again contested by Nance and a Carolina possession Davis comes deep tip outside the love love oh he was trying to get space and he gets the layup that time yeah hes anticipating perhaps a law play but its a miscommunication hes telling the big guy I was looking for you they really do this Carolina team really does communicate well with each other well limp off they see the shot is up price comes down off that oh off balance a little bit yeah its one thing to just rebound the boss another thing to rebound the ball in the bodys leaning up against you Applause Morgan now were going to Clark again Clark down low the feed the bucket for Brady Spence Citadel is never going to get too far away from what they do yes ago hes got Hill Applause Carolina pulling away here from The Sentinel but an answer provided by Elijah Morgan cuts to the rib and gets a layup hes got seven Citadel always going to space the floor theyre always going to cut and move and youre defensively theyre going to make you play defense the whole possession Applause and its an illegal scream how about RJ Davis coach I tell you big tossing in on another double double it would be his sixth DoubleDouble of the season if he can grab another rebound and then from there hes right now sitting on 61 double doubles all time for his career and the alltime list for double doubles in program history its a whos who of basketball North Carolina ball looked like Carolina tried to runs a double there off the off the ball action and thats what theyll do theyll wind up changing defenses on you the kangaroo kid Billy Cunningham at the top with 60 full doubles all time on a big cop looking for number 55 12 Corner three almost had his hands on rebound number 10 you know the one thing about makeup he rebounds outside his face so a lot of guys just rebound when the ball comes right off to him but he goes and gets it wherever it may come off the rim thats number four by the way on Madison Durham catches turns and a travel seventh turnover of the night for the Tar Heels it looked like he tried the Quicken yeah he picked up his other pivot Bulldogs trying to get back into this thing as AJ Smith cant convert at The Rim out to black black stumbles and a turnover thats what black really does for this team hes bobbled that one but in transitioned his athleticism and his speed he really gets easy basketball Applause into the corner for Smith now the three from the left side missing from Morgan black on a move for North Carolina a Baseline Drive and the cutoff and the turnover yet again number nine of the night forced by The Citadel Clarks three misses a rebound control by Caleb love of North Carolina step back three connects you see what they do on their transition everybody goes to a spot and you dont have guys running on top of each other that time black went to the corner baycott went uh to the basket and it created a Shot For Love right up top with space London is a leading scorer this season with 18 Curry hes got 14 tonight Clark open from Deep thats short and the battle down low and a loose ball foul coming up against AJ Smith now you see him in transition see the corners are occupied the wings occupied its a love right there is wide open for three in transition but thats because of the spacing and their transition offense that Carolina does North Carolina nine of 19 from three tonight coming in they were shooting 28 percent from three which is on Pace to be the lowest in Carolina history its launched to feed the bay cut Applause turning around cant score lose Applause Music again sharing the basketball timeout call by The Citadel the nickel three a 6539 lead for the Tar Heels you see very when the Tar Heels shared a ball like this it makes basketball fun nickel joined the most double figure rebounding games and program histories picked up his 55th DoubleDouble and 110 games played and he is putting together quite a resume as Billy Cunningham a top of a lot of those charts and hes starting to surpass him without question his energy especially every every night you know youre going to get a double double out of the guy as a coach thats really satisfying and that helps you do your game plan great career ball tipped Away by Caleb love itll stay with Bulldogs I think feel like its safe to say this is more of what Carolina fans expected from their team on a night in Night Out basis yeah but again thats a work in progress Its not an automatic weve started to come out but were going to play like we did last year we have to work to that we have to go through some fire which things have to happen guys have to go Brady Spence now with six after that follow dump the tip and nearly a turnover but baycott gets it right there on the spot and a foul drawn you know Derek you know back when I first got into business guys used to sit in January November and December at home and they never went on the road to like midJanuary Now teams are out theyre playing different in different venues theyre playing tougher opponents and so if you it takes some time to get to chemistry the annual ACC huddle Bowl preview specialist tomorrow at six Eastern right over on acc Network and the ESPN app Jordan quartet Eric Macklin EJ Manuel and Mark richt will take a look at the nine ACC teams playing in a bowl game with Team breakdowns and comprehensive analysis like only the guys can provide the ACC has sent at least nine teams to a bowl every year since 2016 and Carrie you hit on something there its a challenge now especially if youre a top program youll get a lot of these neutral sight games and very challenging schedules for North Carolinas Trimble all the way in cant get it to go tipped around Styles trying to keep it alive he could not near side three McAllister that is no good take it away by Caleb love in the NCAA committee is also pushed tougher schedules for seating getting in the tournament which is encouraged coaches to go out and play tougher early Seasons just Skeptics Morgan Applause Clark with the feed and thats intercepted by Styles back over to style Harry you said it earlier sharing is caring and business is good right now for the Tar Heels well this is the type of game that that Hubert Davis wanted with his team he wanted to be challenged he needed guys to step up he needed to just start the play some guys on his bench and so all those things have taken place and he still has a lead David Maynard with the three to cut it to a 24point game with a drop for nickel nickel under duress love will try a three thats gone could not hit three Applause basketball and theyre getting shots in Rhythm which makes a huge difference in trying to shoot contestant contestant shots 50 percent from three to nothing for caleblock good defense on Trimble and the block or Morgan thank you love the kick Styles three sure Applause coaching the Midway point Music two North Carolina and stepped on the gas late in the first half and into the second half McAllister leads down low as Clark tries to take styles to arrive and score and again Carolina play a very good defense against the team that offensively does a heck of the job executing 10 for Clark the feed down low for nickel and one Tyler nickel got some contact got the bucket hes got five coach Dontre styles transition styles on a great finish thats the Carolina break at his best member of 1991 North Carolina won 9758 Hubert Davis led the Tar Heels in scoring with 16 but heres a cool One Raymond stions one of the referees tonight right there refereed the game in 91 I mean thats crazy hes in tremendous shape and that is that is really crazy but it just goes to show the stamina of these officials to be able to do that and Hubert was a heck of a player I dont think of these kids really realize how good a player he was Davis Sensational Remy stions talked him before the game and mentioned that to him and he said oh man hes like 12 years old back then she sent it all in a hole here down 7446 a turnover Tyler nickel on the move hes got eight defensively Carolina is really active right now and again theyre getting other guys in the lineup weve got Trimble out there you got Styles out there you got nickels out there theyre getting playing time for guys but theyre really going to count on Music they see a loose ball right there and Nick was right there he looks behind him to see whos coming to make sure he can finish it off Big Time dunk oh Perry you hit on a key point with North Carolinas upcoming schedule and then jumping into really the thoroughs of the ACC season depth issue without question I mean theres already been some teams that have been bit by some injuries and set back and so having developing your bench is really important you know you got Ohio State Michigan before you go to Pitt which would be a tough game I mean right now youre really getting in the pros of it and to be able to develop your players and events like that is really important and obviously Ohio State Michigan that backtoback very tough but as you said the pit was not picked to finish high in the ACC 14 theyve started out well Wake Forest is a challenge Notre Dame and so theyre no nights off no gimmies coming up coaches dont want to hear about where guys will pick I mean thats the last thing they want to hear because the game is to be played thats why you play the game dirt still trying to find the Rhythm tonight oh he blasts through oh a blocking foul call Davis the fans apoplectic even up 30 yeah that one was close but we knew there I mean he really is coffee very aggressive he likes to get to the front of the rim uh it looks like he held his position I mean thats Applause thats a tough call thatll be a foul number two against RJ Davis and how about this der at the line first free throws of the night for the Bulldogs down low turnaround shot Washington knocks it down Jalen Washington with a turnaround Jay good extend the lead to 7846 and thatll get his confidence going going through him right away and him knocking down a jump shot Morgan fall off his hands you know this Carolina team they very they dont play a lot of Zone you know and they really hit you with the mantoman Hubert has got them all to believe in the mantoman they will extend it with some full court pressure but again how well they play together and help each other defensively I think is really impressive for this time of the year Washington lays it up and ends and the foul Jalen Washington getting into Rhythm hes got six this young man was very talented coming out you know he had the injuries but he is really looking like hes backing informed bench loving what theyre seeing out of their teammate I tell you the energy the benches have and now they have their own little routines you know guys get up like theyre playing the guitar when a guy knocks down a three and they got their own little dance and everything I mean so is Washington cant finish off the threepoint play the bench celebration has evolved over the years thats for sure by Washington as well go to break under eight got 52 left Music much Noah County in Alabama set to take on Memphis at the top of the hour that should be a fantastic matchup it should Davis get it the point guard for Memphis is really really good Pennys got that team rolling it ought to be a really exciting game Applause Music 8049 lead for North Carolina nine different Tar Heels scoring tonight Washingtons to kick the styles tremble trapped underneath the Baseline looking for help throws it up a little short with a loose ball Music Applause Washington trying to provide resistance dirt in the lane spins to kick out to Morgan his three Mark with a rebound Marks layup is good he really has to be impressed with Clark coach Conroy still wants his team to execute and run the same way that same place that they did did earlier today because of the fact that they can carry that on as the season progresses Clark has 13 Styles beautiful turnaround jumper hes got nine so Hubert Davis going into the bench here and seeing some results kick Bailey Conrad tries a three styles of the board Applause into Washington Washington two men on him could not finish at The Rim Ash pull up three rims out tremble had two hands on it and then got fouled by Ash so those shots that were dropping in the first half for ash not so much here in half two well hes had to play defense against this Carolina Pace also the fact that theyre running different guards at him so will shaver well head into the game Jalen Washington will sit and hes going through a transition obviously seeing time on the floor after recovering from that ACL injury and getting back into game shape so its going to be a progress for him so far oh without question they want to do it in spurts do they want him to build up his confidence they want to build up his conditioning and thats all a part of it Justin McCoy as well one more from Seth Trimble freshman knocks down the second free throw they really have high expectations for Trimble because they feel he is a leader I they think hes a point guard that really does a great job of disrupting on the defensive end and distributes the ball extremely well well as you know from your days in the ACC the standard for point guards here at North Carolina is pretty high yes Clark working test by McCoy and a possession for the Tar Heels Trimble gets blocked track down By Conrad Conrad still cant hit through three nickel does a nice job rebounding Styles into the post a layup by shaver gets rejected Clark is really good defensively I mean hes made a couple really good blocks open Lane for AJ Smith an easy layup hes got six Hubert wants him now to slow it down he wants him to execute run their offense Applause McCoy will fire away Austin Ash with the rebound coaches never mind you taking a quick shot if it comes out of your offense they have problems when you take quick shots that are really not in your offensive system dirt takes it all the way and lays it in theres a little shaken up making his way back to his feet hes got four Applause nickel again cant convert this time sir room for a three Applause another box out and another rebound for the Tar Heels theyve been monsters on the glass tonight Hub is really telling them to push the basketball thats what he wants he wants transition basket he wants him to take a look at the Music and they want Carolina they want his Carolina team to play at that pace Justin McCoy the Virginia transferred drills the three and well step out for a quick timeout from Chapel Hill Tar Heels up Alabama certainly has had a big week number four in the country Mill try to knock off Memphis coming up right after this game Clark with the right hand tipped around and price has been quite active tonight to draw the foul coming up next at nine on ESPN2 Brandon Miller number four Alabama hosts Penny hardaways Memphis Tigers at Coleman Coliseum tremendous atmosphere coming up tonight at nine oclock for what should be a fun game between tigers and the Crimson Tide mentioned Alabama being number four in the nation a change at the top with Houston falling to Alabama Purdue in the mix in Virginia representing the ACC at number two Im surprised Alabamas at four Kelvin Sampson told me that Alabama team is the first team he played against that he thought was a better rebounding team than his thats saying an awful lot and thats why they went into Houston and wound up getting that win its a very intriguing top ten with Purdue at the top as price beats the defense down the floor for the layup of course North Carolina will see Virginia later on in the season you have the big game between Virginia and Houston on the horizon as well yeah thats coming up I think this weekend and I tell you its going to be a lot of changes and such balance but its going to be an exciting college basketball season we havent even gotten into January yet Floyd misses its hard to believe that this team were looking at here in North Carolina is Ash cant get that one gets it back trying to fight through it and gets it to go Austin Ash with an impressive fight of course the fourgame losing streak knocked North Carolina out of the top 25 they were preseason number one and now lets go question theyre going to be back in the top 25 theyre too talented I think theyve got some pieces that are starting to develop and come and I think theyre getting healthy I think theyre home and Coach Davis talked about the scheduling was really not in there the favor with the travel and everything not making excuses its just the fact and I think that once they get into ACC play things are settled down Tyler nickel earning himself some playing time for this performance tonight well thats what theyre looking for him to do being able to knock down jump shots you got so many guys that can create off the bounds now you need finishes on the perimeter and again the way North Carolina spaces before it creates that kind of storm a careerhigh 11 points for Tyler Nichol The Freshman out of Harrisonburg Virginia Psy Applause so much about confidence and coaches do a great job of building confidence and sometimes you dont understand why guys do certain things because they understand their players they understand their makeup and theyre trying to get them feeling good about themselves great pass right there again looking for the shooter knocks it down these guys like each other part of the Carolina DNA is assist thats why they started the thing according to the guy that make the pass they have so many talented players getting them to play together its always been the Mantra here at North Carolina by the way charged to AJ Smith and his third picked up as nickel continues to add to his total Applause Music nickel on the way with another as North Carolina closes in on 100 points which is a high contrast of North Carolina if they hit the 100 Point barrier they get free biscuits for sure theyre happy about a w thats incoming well they want some biscuits too Applause the kick out and the corner three is knocked down by AJ Smith now with nine Creighton Leebo into the game Dewey Ferris who has the basketball here scoring three rattling out the battle on the floor Libo and jump ball into possession points in favor of the Bulldogs got a crack there at the three could knock it down but good hustle these guys are the campus Heroes now these are the guys that walk around and thats all theyll talk about tomorrow is these guys getting in the game if they can walk off and get them some biscuits too man they will be heroes for the rest of the year with the win here for North Carolina itll be their 20th against the Citadel theyll move to 200 and thatll be an UNC record a continuation of that record those victories against an opponent without a loss hell be a big man at the student user tomorrow 9764 making Dan proud Im sure rebound off to miss grabbed by Beau May 97 points see lets see Jackson Watkins down thats pressure thats a Carolina moment guys at the buzzer and an impressive way to end this performance tonight Perry a huge effort by the Tar Heels love the performance I love the balance I love the assist I love the way they dominated the glass and they and theyve really played great defense North Carolina wins their second game in a row on to the big
