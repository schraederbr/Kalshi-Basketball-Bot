played here theyre looking to get one here tonight Duke out of the top 25 at the moment Andrea right now two coming in a little healthier than they have met and look at the lineups here tonight Duke coming in with philipowski and Mitchell Whitehead as well as Proctor and youre going to get a look at Jeremy Roach coming off the bench in just a few minutes Applause young up top a little swing here for Philadelphia whos averaging 15 points and 10 rebounds a game well Ill tell you what the fans are ready to rock and roll one of the greatest openings in college basketball being able to come here and see the castle guard perform and theyve been great early the shot clock is down to two Mitchell the kick Whitehead gets it off in time and he beat the buzzer and Tarik white has stepping up knocking down the three ball Poise for a freshman at Virginia Tech 118 but they are reeling they lost their last one on Saturday 5150 to that outstanding Clemson team threepointers like that one from Couture not falling the way they need them too its such a big part of their attack it really is but I love seeing Hunter Couture aggressive to start the game off Virginia Tech needs his production to be successful just got him back three games to go Mitchell inside and tipped up and in stand right on top of the rim philipowski with 17 against Miami in a gritty win for them over the weekend and thats been the surprise about philipowski his freshman Year everyone knew about his Applause defensive ability and his rebounding have been spectacular and hes put those in showcase the last two possessions to tip in and now the steel didnt finish Lynn kid among those who could have a big performance tonight need him to hes in the lineup for the Hokies Mike young getting him in there the 610 Junior theyre going with the bigger lineup the bigger lineup hasnt been successful Duke off to a 70 start if youre John Shire you couldnt have asked for a better opportunity the tour again off Target for Lebowski with a rebounds no one of the better rebounders in the country all year Applause off the Iron by Whitehead one and done there and heres Sean Padula averages 16 a game for the Hokies with the swing the long one on the way yes the scoring column and Virginia Tech needed that Willington calm them down we got the blackout in Castle Coliseum tonight of course but never the Blue Devils come to town its a big deal you can see the nerves on the Hokies early Applause young draws the double trying to fight his way out of that Whitehead trying to make a move and thats going to be an offensive foul Applause the fact that roach is healthy after missing several games with that toe and ready to contribute thats huge for Duke yeah absolutely Dave you know coach Shire said after that Miami win that this is the closest the team has been to being whole being healthy and being capable of who they truly are he said they had defensive intensity they rebounded with aggression but assistant coach Chris Carwell added during warmups that Miami thats the game where they finally hit shots they need ball movement and offensive chemistry today on the road you know they really have been shooting it the way you expected Duke team to shoot it right the struggles for Duke this year have not been on the defensive end weve seen that over the past few seasons its been solely about the offense and you never think about the Blue Devil struggling offensively is Young misses a wide open layup off of a nice five from The Reef whiteheads the foul Shire number one for the 35 year old former Duke captain and AllAmerican he has a chance with the scheduled Corey the way it is is setting up these next few to kind of get rolling and Mike young youre number four is the head coach for the Hokies frustrating time right now but remember they were two and seven at one point last year in the ACC and they won the ACC tournament getting it inside for Lynn Kidd and a quick strike and if you look at the benches for both these teams you see the Blue Devils coaching staff with their suits and sneakers on his suits and sneakers Week Virginia Tech chose to war the black pullovers because it is a blackout thats the only reason Mike young who normally wears a suit anyway and his staff dont have one suits to them over the top young downstairs got that one to go you only make 72 of a shot yeah exactly hes pretty shorthanded thats why it was so surprising to see him miss the layup on the last possession but he makes up for it on this one mutts back downstairs again its kid they want him to touch it early and thats why the main kid has been in double figures and three of his last four games including a careerhigh 14 points three games to go so hes continuing to progress Applause yeah hes playing his best basketball the season the coaches say right in on the spin and knocks it down 67 freshman hits speaking of progressing Tariq white has starting to become more aggressive attacking the basket on a perimeter shooting the basketball well the number two high school player in the country coming into the Blue Devils fall this season had some nice games at 18 against BC 16 against FSU so he can score did again a lot of iron but that wont drop for him Music Proctor The Freshman running the point Applause the Lebowski again doubled up the Doula steps in knocked it away Brazilian on the break medulla on the attack and hell lay it out smart play by Sean Padula even though the crowd wanted to see the three putting it on the floor laying it up seeing the ball go through early can pay dividends for him much later in this game he had scored a double figures every game this season except for the last one against Clemson Proctor will lift it barely got to the iron but right back up and in by the hardworking young and thats what Ryan young really does he is a great offensive rebounder almost three a game for him top five in ACC basketball and he continues to give Duke another dimension offensive guitar dropping it down low kid gives Couture straight on yes sir with the triple Applause part for Virginia Tech thus far as Hunter Couture has already taken three field goal attempts Mike young wants him to be more aggressive on the offensive end and defensively too as he bats that away much getting up ahead tiptoes and lays it in and how about the Hokies right out of the gate a sour start but no longer its a 146 run and another step by Padula flips it up there as he draws the foul medulla really active defensively theyre getting those hands in the lane great response from the Hokies as we see Sean Padula not only playing the ankles but possibly breaking ankles and dropping dimes here at the castle Sonic cheeseburgers are made ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Liberty Mutual insurance only pay for what you need and back in Blacksburg back and forth we go its going to be that kind of pace tonight were in for something it absolutely has you always call basketball a game of runs and when you think about it Duke started off 70 run but just like that Virginia Tech responding with a 50 run of their own after forcing four Duke turnovers in the Hokies thus far tonight have five assists on their sixth May field goals sharing the basketball extremely well the Doula will be at the line it makes 84 percent to shoot two the sophomore from Edmond Oklahoma had a rough one against Clemson held to seven points in that one he looks very determined tonight OBS Ill tell you what its a great thing to be home you think about Virginia Tech coming off of a threegame road trip and theyve had struggles on the road getting Hunter Couture back and being able to come back and play in this building and of course theres always going to be tremendous energy when the Blue Devils visit Town Lokis facing Duke for the first time since beating them 8267 in the ACC title game in Brooklyn last spring Couture had 31 a career high he was magnificent in that one phillipowski turns and knocks it down so smooth absolutely Im Mike magnificent as they were I think its the word to use to describe Kyle Lebowski especially with his back to the basket where hes been a Difference Maker for the Blue Devils who go Zone on the defensive end clouds come up five times already spent rookie of the week in the ACC that shots gonna go in a foul two as guitar got hit up it went high off the iron and in philipowski with the personal Hanukkah tour has a different look about him this evening hes already taken four field goal attempts knocking down his last two threepoint field goals and this one making sure he adds one for emphasis an opportunity for the fourpoint play missing the free throw but the hook is up 1915 and is Couture going to have another one of those nights against the Blue Devils like he did in New York City quick whistle here hip Kissinger calling the foul 1301 to play that one will go against OT of the Hokies his first Applause Jacob grandison a graduate out of Oakland California end of The Fray now roach driving it and well lay it in and Jeremy roach has become such a better player when he attacks the basket he had a career high 22 points won this floor as a freshman in a game that his team lost but he was spectacular and of course we talked about Hunter Couture and his confidence against Duke Roche has the same confidence against Virginia way downtown Applause right now sitting at around 32 percent from three for the season hes better than that he absolutely is but hes had so much responsibility as the point guard philipowski going in strong follows his own Miss stayed right with it but you can see a decided Advantage for the Blue Devils you got two Duke Blue Devils Above the Rim going after an offensive rebound MJ Collins a freshman from Mike young into the contest as well heres Couture again Oh my he is Off to the Races I think its fair to say at this point that Hunter is hunting shots right now Obi and its working out in the favor of the Hokies five out of seven beyond the threepoint line early Metro back for phillipowski you can try a long one cant drill it big battle for the rebound and Collins played some heavy minutes for Coach young this season picking off the rebound rolling all the way in Poteet will draw the foul thats going to be two on phillipowski as the Hokies have gotten it rolling with Jeremy roach attacking the basket gets a bucket on one into the floor but Sean Padula has the answer the three ball and Hunter Couture of course finding his range here at home thank you okies leading Duke 2519 we check out the ACC standings Clemsons for real 81 Virginias awfully good at 72 you look at the top of the league and theres the Hokies way near the bottom at one and seven remembering that they were two and seven before they picked off FSU last year you and I were there in Tallahassee that flipped the switch on their season it absolutely did and of course our colleague you know college basketball expert Seth Greenberg said earlier this year that the ACC was going to run through Virginia that Virginia and Virginia Tech were the two best teams in the ACC and at that time he was correct and this Virginia Tech Team still has a chance to be one of the better teams in the league and being that weve seen them do it before it would be no surprise to see them run off another 13 of the next 15 games I dont think anyone would be shocked if they had a long winning streak in them under coach young and you know they were 111 before they lost Hunter Couture for several ball games for about a month actually yeah and if Hunter Couture of course plays such a huge role for this team not only as a scorer but also as their backup point guard Rodney rice out of the lineup with the had finger surgery on Friday he will not be available for the remainder of the season coach with the dish jumper on the way and that wont drop off the mark by grandison Applause Oakies by the way 41 against Duke in the last five meetings here in Blacksburg so recently success on this floor against the Blue Devils shoved there with 1102 to go here in the first half as katore hitting the deck lets go to Drake Well David listening to that last two Puddle and Coach Shire challenged the team defensively he said were giving them wide open shots he said this is not who weve been defensively we have to be aggressive on both ends but it starts on defense with getting stops then we can flow into the offense you know Dre when you hear something like that how much do you think that being on the road plays a part in that when you say thats not who weve been they havent been great on the road yeah absolutely theres a big difference when youre at home you sleep in your own bed you wake up feeling more like yourself going on the road makes a huge difference you have to have more of an intention on being who you are you have to lock in Sweet Home certainly so far as granniss passes knocked around Mitchell picks it off and lays it in the Hokies feeling very nice here at home in the early going up 2921 Oakies have not won a game since the 17th of December seven game losing skid Couture thought about one there OT thats going to be an offensive on him too much of the body on the 69 Junior and thats just a smart play by Taylor Blakes recognizing that he is out man on the interior by potique knows that he has to be able to take that contact as we look at look at the Blue Devils and what has happened with them throughout the season at Wake Forest taking the loss losing at NC State losing at Clemson one and three and ACC play on the road this season this is a very young team Obi so its not really a surprise that theyve struggled on the road Mitchell got it up there banked it in went to your point the Freshman from Kansas City Duke of course 100 at home with Cameron Indoor so if you look at the Blue Devils roster right now its its a junior with two Juniors on the floor with three freshmen and youve got another freshman in the Rick Whitehead second back into the game shot clock down to seven now down to five Applause Music heres kid shot clock in one well short Applause Duke with an opportunity to run a bit Proctor forcing the tempo and Hokies get back defensively and right now if youre Jeremy roach youve got a mismatch youve got to take advantage of it giving the basketball up doesnt work for the Blue Devils roach long one nailed it thats a twopointer actually okay respect that again whatever as a guard a point guards you get a big on you like that youve got to be able to get everyone out of the way take advantage of the mismatch and the fact that theyre disrespecting you Obi with a big man guarding you at the point guard mom and dad theyre like I prefer three well take the two well take the tunes fine at least for this point of the game is Padula beyond the three rolling inside nice dish for Ken missed on the first one and it came three and laid in by Vasily is Lincoln going to look for the system now I think you get one I would absolutely ask for the assist go right to the table and demand it 3125 its only with seven and kid coming out to guard and roach hitting the deck which is just back and after missing a few games with that lingering toll problem which actually goes back to November for him yeah Jeremy Rose coming back into the lineup immediately gets the assignment from Hunter Couture who Mike young lets us know on a regular basis is their best perimeter Defender and so he makes sure he takes that on as we get to look at Joe and Carol the roach Jeremy Roses parents making the trip down from Northern Virginia to come see the young fellow play now they dont miss a game it doesnt matter where they are Portland Durham theyre going to be there last year all the way to the final four oh they were they were in participation for that as well starting point guard for the Duke Blue Devils coach Ks final year Applause a clock to 10 crowd wanted to walk there on Blakes Whitehead gives it up roach on Couture with a triple coming you see the difference in that move with going against Hunter Couture in comparison to having a big out their gardening Patois just makes it difficult on the defensive end Applause downstairs bazilly tough angle but he made the shot anyway and it could tort his body to get it off the window and great recognition by Justin mutts knowing that his teammate was being guarded on the high side the perfect pass delivered Applause quick moving first half here in Blacksburg the handoff for Whitehead hes going to take a shot great rotation on that and a twopointer and hes been aggressive we saw Tariq Whitehead knock down the first three of the game now coming back in he has been aggressive on the offensive end of the floor Music well the Hokies play fastmoving games to talk about that with Virginia all the time too because they dont turn the ball over heres Couture again here in the first half at home he has 12 points he only had six the entire game last time out against Clemson and you can see Hanukkah tour is motivated by being home and more importantly about getting his team a win up on top and over it goes the jumper wont fall for Proctor and I hope hes have it back Applause the Hokies playing smart basketball high low action if youre going to front were going to find the way to beat you Grandpa silly with the finish off the night Justin Must Die Music new customers get our best deals on all smartphones thats right but one thing that we are seeing from this Duke Blue Devils team this season is switching on defense watch Mark Mitchell at 68 defend Sean padul at 61 at the top of the key using his link closing the Gap not getting beat up the dribble and then as soon as Sean Padula picks up the ball he closes out again youve got great defense Duke and John Shire switching more on the defensive end Corey something we havent seen in recent years we havent seen a lot of them but one of the things that John Shire is doing of course when you go out and you get the number one recruiting class in the country youve got guys who expect to be Pros on that possession alone we saw Mark Mitchell and Derek Lively both guarding on the perimeter thats the thing they have to do in the NBA level John Shire challenging his players to be able to do it now in college Lively 71 freshman playing some good defense coming off what 10 rebounds five blocks against Miami it was six offensive rebounds in that game and of course Duke needed each and every one of those to be able to pull out a victory the Doula very casually lines up to three and that wont drop for him coming in at 16 points a game Applause Virginia Tech was chilly with the threes right away but it caught fire that made four of their last five heres Mitchell Applause Whitehead looking inside and a whistle down low and thats going to be number two on kid and up next on ESPN we take it to Waco number 17 Baylor squaring off against number nine Kansas Kansas have a couple of losses taken a tumble in the poll today yeah a rare twoday Losing Streak For The Jayhawks and no easy task for them later tonight roach goes down on the seat of his pants almost lost it shot clock at nine for the Blue Devils Applause 3627 Virginia Tech trying to snap a seven game losing skin right now at 14 and five five and three in the conference and Duke now back into the Zone but if youre going to play zone against his Hokies team you got to be an account for all the shooters and the interior passing Justin butts one of the best in the business as an interior passer in the ACC hes very unselfish Motif with the Finish Whitehead with a pull up off the back of the iron and basily there for the rebound one of the Hokies looking very sharp at home and again they absolutely have to five minutes to go in the half he just ended a threegame road swing losing to Syracuse Virginia and Clemson even with Couture back in the fold he rejoined him in that Virginia game shot clock down to three thats tipped away its going to be heaved in midcourt and that is a shot clock violation so it goes back over to Duke youre talking about Justin mutson his ability to deliver but you know one thing is youre always a better passer when you use your eyes to be able to give some deception to The Defenders around you Justin must looking on the perimeter to try to make sure that the defense watches all the threepoint Shooters he has around pretty much looking everyone away from that kid on the interior hes earned three degrees and I asked him during the shoot here tonight when he was getting warm and he was lacing up the shoes they said he had gone for the doctor and he said hey not right now I got some things to do but it is on the schedule I asked him what Justin must we were going to see today well were going to see the aggressive mutts were we going to see the defensive much and were going to see the allaround guy he hasnt been aggressive with his offense but hes been passing to Perfection thus far Duke just one for seven from threepoint land again have not been a good threepoint shooting team not by their standards 32 percent for the year heres my topping into the paint left it way short he wanted to foul but he was well defended Rhodes trying to get them going Whitehead will knock that one down a threepointer from the corner the Rick Whitehead has been the bright spot for the Blue Devils on the offensive end of the floor today as he knocks down his third threepointer here in the first half ten points Music for the Hokies Applause and thats going to go against Padula thatll be number one on him and offensive and the Hokies with a 3830 lead the Blue Devils with the ball back here and Im on the white head able to get two going from threepoint territory at last hard work it takes early mornings planning precision sweat sacrifice and teamwork thats why Old Dominion Freight Line the number one National LTL carrier for Quality works hard to be the best in the game and is proud to support those striving to be the best in their game Old Dominion Freight Line helping the world coach in the studio coming up on the Jeep halftime report will consider whats wrong with Kansas as theyre mired in a twogame skit might be that the Big 12 is that good right well its kind of an uninspiring start here for Duke it is theyre shooting way too many jump shots I mean you look at that last jump shot by Kyle philipowski set just really casual from the corner theyve got to attack off the dribble and post and they gotta find Hunter Couture hi to Couture let me tell you something whoever talks about the shop making thats all part of it its the spacing crates his ability to defend his toughness his leadership totally changes the Dynamics of Virginia Tech OB Kev thank you very much how about that question to Kevin posed you hear that one once every 50 years whats wrong with Kansas I mean but theres truth in that coach beyond the three heres young trying to get a little closer on bazilly inside with a hook but no for Lebowski another big rebound block from behind by Vasily boy did he recover fast well at the hokeys defensive effort has picked up significantly as you watch them make shots coaches dont like that ever to be the case that youre better defensively when the you see the ball going through but it is human nature and right now you see the defensive effort looking great for Virginia Tech mutts going to start to look for more shots like that because he can really score and he absolutely can and again Mike young has to go to Justin much way too often to ask him to be more aggressive looking for his offense but one once he is you see hes a big time scorer contact there to shove in the lane 232 left in the half Improvement Saturday a constant 50 points in a loss first half tonight already with 40 here in Blacksburg and the foul will go on MJ Collins of the Hokies Music Kansas and Baylor to come tonight after this game with bushabi and Jay bilas heres Roach that one clanged away and picked off by Padula so the Hokies up 10 on Duke tour has been quiet the last several minutes but as it doesnt guard him Padula beyond the line fire it up and knocks it down that is a confident shot great offense hes good defense to reap right head knew exactly what Sean Padula wanted to do took away his space but medulla good enough to still get the shot off and knock it down no keys with their biggest lead tonight of 13 Applause proud and a blackout here tonight Mitchell roach to penetrate and it wont fall foul here against the Blue Devils bazilly was trying to start the fast break as he went down oh heres our Big Ten ACC super Tuesday doubleheader we start in Champaign with Illinois hosting Ohio State at 7 Easter North Carolina and again Syracuse both games right here on ESPN great opportunity for Syracuse who in my opinion should be in that consideration for an NCAA tournament then of course theyve got a lot of work to do but North Carolina hasnt been a great team on the road either theyve had the same struggles that weve seen for the Duke Blue Devils when they get away from the Deanie Smith Center so great opportunity for the orange coming up tomorrow night young with the foul to put bezilla at the line grad from Wisconsin 13point Advantage here for the Hokies in the final 90 seconds and hell draw the foul in the act of shooting a threepointer great offense beats good defense any time but that is very good defense by Tariq Whitehead had his hands up he was all over the basketball shadowing the ball for Sean Padula with his great tough from Beyond The Arc was able to still beat the good defense a lot of Iron Duke with their first foul shot of the game and three here for philipowski makes 78 percent as a team Duke makes 78 its something they do very very well so it comes down to a foul shooting contest theyre going to win it seven foot freshman kofowski playing with those two fouls John Shire going to get him out of the game right now 119 remaining goes to offensive defensive possessions here at the end of the half but right now looks like the Blue Devils are going to be in a 131 defensively UC Proctor on the back line Greek Whitehead going to pick up when weve seen John Shire throughout a number of different looks defensively throughout this game Applause a lot of penetration much jumping inside and blocked by Lively a leading dude by far in that category in Block shots but they foul on the play and thatll put much to the line but youre talking about a veteran team you see the way Virginia Tech moves the basketball against that 131 its the first possession of one through one that Duke has played but Mike Youngs team more than ready for it and moving the basketball well allowing much to get to the freethrow line 67 percent foul shooter missing on the first one on the bench here prior three games 63 points 43 rebounds three straight double doubles just had some freshman year will be back for the final 107 of the first half Music Applause closing minute here of the first half filipowski out for a minute coming back in offensive defensive substitution by John Shire great move Bill powski playing with those two fouls dont want him to pick up the third foul here but when you get an offensive opportunity now off the free throw you want to have your best offensive player back on the floor number two for months and Mr both and Phillip mosque with a rebound averaging 10 rebounds a game meanwhile Duke Chile just a little bit theyve missed eight of their last nine Whitehead has been the answer on offense so far for them in the first half Applause a nice fine from Procter whos done a much better job as of late running the point guard position finding his teammates and facilitating good look to find Lively for the easy bucket Applause meanwhile for the Hokies Hunter Couture has been these story mutts with a nice spin well lay it in oh another 20 to go before the break oh the I believed Mike young may have had a quick conversation about just as much about being more aggressive down the street picked up six quick points here he also has five assists bellapowski way downtown hes only 26 out there but very confident on it that one hurled up there at the horn it will not drop the shot by Maddox but Virginia Tech has certainly had the better of it here in the first half and its a great chess match between two very good coaches when you consider the way that theyve gone about ending that half Virginia Tech 42 live when leading at halftime over the last three seasons lets go to Dre every reason why we feel as though this Virginia Tech team will Ascend back into the upper echelon of the ACC ENT shooting will help you to a 4538 lead at halftime it absolutely will Johnson cant be happy about that going into the locker room talking to his team who allowed 68 percent to happen on his defensive end so underway in the second half the spin move by bezilla will be off the win bill with another rebound Applause has won the ACC rookie of the week five times already look at the pass downstairs gave it up nicely Mitchell had it stripped and Padula going up against the big there young will collect the rebound but I like the attack about Doula I like the fact that he challenged the big guy with adding that additional 10 pounds of muscle over the summer hes playing much more confident more physical right head with a nice pass cross to proctorino nailed at three speaking of playing more confident Tyrese Proctor has been much more accomplished since going back into the starting lineup as the point guard with Jeremy rope sitting down with that toe injury 17 points for him at Clemson a career high hes continued to get better each and every time now used Couture had an outstanding first half at a dozen points and out it goes and thatll be back over to the Blue Devils they came in at 145 they have been the accs best rebounding team Applause hes trying to snap a sevengame losing skid and do what they did last year really good rolling phillipowski yeah got a good look and a feathery touch hes such a matchup problem you talk about it close to seven feet tall but the ability to shoot the basketball the way that he does he can also put it on the floor which makes him even more difficult to guard the national leader among freshmen and double doubles draws a lot of attention in the paint but a nice touch of his own Applause 4744 Applause Music he has 11 to go with five rebounds Applause Whitehead down nice pass here for Mitchell its tip that its going to be hokeys basketball Applause just getting started here in the second half Thursday night ESPN college game day tipping off our coverage from Thompson Bowling Arena seven oclock Eastern and thats the Rivalry that elevated womens college basketball in the 90s Uconn and Tennessee in Knoxville got a feeling my sister Andrea Carter is going to be in the mix somehow or another with that big game going on Mitchell down the lane and a foul Vasily going up for the block but a personal Applause Applause and elevating it is probably an understatement because that was a point in television it absolutely was and youre talking about two of the names on the Mount Rushmore of college basketball coaches Pat Summitt Gino aryama John Wooden and one Mike ciseski thats the four throughout college basketball Mitchell makes one of two Applause Cory youre talking about summoning thats the Rivalry that I grew up watching that helped me fall in love with the game of basketball and I will absolutely be there for that matchup weve got a game day crew that will be on site Studio Rebecca Lobo Carolyn Peck weve got a great crew Holly Rowe and Elle Duncan jump right to the corner by vasilia wont go Whitehead is hobbled though he was holding his leg maybe his ankle wide open medulla absolutely drains the triple and Whitehead goes off very quickly to the bench on one leg and he is in some pain Whitehead The Freshman from New Jersey he has been their offense for times in his game Whitehead going after the basketball and you see Just Landing awkwardly on that left foot IES by five he has 10 from the corner oh so sweet by philipowski dropping in those triples he already has 20 in this game and cuts it to two along with nine rebounds on the doorstep of yet another DoubleDouble and another collision and a whistle with 16 35 to go on his contest Applause Ed to young man who had foot surgery back in August missed the beginning of the season hate to see him having to deal with this right now hopefully nothing major Applause roach with that last foul his first ly trying to make a move on Mitchell a collision again no basket and theyre going to call a flop there but heres the question who is the Flop on as his own basily or is it on Jeremy roach because there was two guys right there in the mix I dont know if John shires beside himself right now well if its called ropes John sire has a reason to be beside himself because it was such a late call take a look you see Jerry Rhodes come over and there is contact which means that it cant be I cant imagine how its a flop with there being contacted on that possession Applause and Im sure thats the same conversation that John Shire is having right now itd be one thing if there were no contact give you a look at the Flop rule Class B technical foul one free throw Padula hit that no warning there either to me it looked floppish but well again if theres contact then I dont think it can be a fly because again now maybe you are saying that theres you could say that it wasnt enough contact to make that happen was able to knock down the three ball but at the same time I think that could have been that goes a noncall either way you dont call it after Brazil he misses the layup right you know its the first tie here 5151 after the Mitchell shot man underneath his mutts and a foul as well as he was hit by philipowski and that is number three and its normally Justin Lutz on the passing side of it but this time its basily dropping the dime oh not as much contact as I thought dude I think they got it right they just got it late definitely perfect take a look at tonights Wendys wooden watch and Armando Bay cotton along with Caleb love filopowskys having an outstanding night here is that one of Miami to Cleveland Smith who had a scary incident but ACC players midseason top 25 watch list yeah speaking of scary incident to Rick Whitehead coming down on that left foot immediately grabbing it wincing in pain and having to be walked off with the help of his teammate as hes trying to describe where the pain is but being walked off with the help of his teammates and wow I hate to see this from a young man whos worked so hard to battle back getting on the court and really has been having a terrific night S at the line Justin Watts the senior we came in the broadcast talking about this is the first time that the Duke Blue Devils have really been whole and healthy right and to see karik Whitehead have to exit the lineup after 10 points in the first half shooting the basketball really well thats a tough blow for the Blue Devils 10 on the shot clock a foul here against the Hokies number one on mutts Duke leads the alltime Series 5112 against the Hokies we talked about the injuries to quavion Smith is good to go practice today just got the update from my gosh F Greenberg whos on on top of all things college basketball Proctor with a shot clock a factor down to two got to get it in the air got his own Miss and put it up very softly for two points Proctor the freshman so back to even big factor here and the Duke comeback has been theyve been hitting threes after a chilly start theyre two for nine block downstairs a battle for the rebound and chasing it down the corner Mitchell Applause Music taking care of business and flip now with 23 points nine rebounds headed for another double double which will be his fourth consecutive and possibly another ACC rookie of the week award Duke on top last time they had a lead it was a long long time ago its like seven or nothing out of the gate of course bazilly oh look at the passing underneath maybe a little too much there yeah way too much between just as much and Grant facility somebodys got to get the basketball up on the glass and speaking of looking for the right shot Jeremy Rhodes finding Kyle popowski the hot guy knocking down to three on his way to a big night roach no thats going to be tipped out and Duke will keep it with 13 53 left and the contest hes Proctor to put it in from the Baseline the Lebowski off the fake Proctor drives it and lays it in a determined move we are watching The Freshman grow up right before our eyes for the Duke Blue Devils remember Tyrese Proctor should be in high school right now every class up to join the Blue Devils and John Shire is sure glad he made that decision thank you meanwhile the Hokies have cooled off after scalding the Nets at what 68 in the first half not making as many shots a foul on the floor he would seven on a shot clock its going to be number three on Ryan Young 13 pounds and Lively back on seven foot freshman and young to the bench Applause and one thing the Blue Devils have succeeded in doing here is quiet at the crowd thats going to be it over and back MJ Collins not recognizing where he was on the floor the turnover and again Collins at that point you know if youre getting close to that line youve got to find a way to turn and throw the basketball back to your basket and the inexperience for the Hokey starting to show up in making a couple mistakes here is the foul philipowski trying to slow him down good luck there the way hes cooking Justin Music Big Time response by the Blue Devils coming out at halftime locker room Virginia Tech had all the momentum in the first half and give John science group a lot of credit the way they responded here in the second half Mitchell will try to shovel the pass underneath trying to hit Lively but out it goes Duke on top 5853 very few turnovers in this game the Hokies are among the best in the country and fewest turnovers theyre number nine only about 10 a game and where do the Hokies go right now when they need a bucket whos going to be the guy Kyle filipowski doing a great job guarding brazili and he hooks it in for two but we mentioned it before a great defense beats good offense every time bazilly the better on that possession Applause Jeremy roach will set it up again philipowski going in strong and Boyd hung up there for half an hour Proctor scoots away with it another offensive rebound by the best rebounding team in the ACC and now Duke with another opportunity here 10 remaining on the shot clock Lively with the game filipowski goes up almost made the shot as he went down and fouled on the play Applause lets go to Dre Carter thanks Dave just got an official update from dude zuriq Whitehead is doubtful to return with that lower leg Music Applause lets play tonight and been playing throughout ACC play The Blue Devils come into Ace to this game but only two players averaging double figures at ACC play that would be the Freshman Kyle forkowski at the line and this young man to Rick right hand averaging 10 points per game we see the injury once again scary area to be grabbing is the castle guard now on point here phillipowski what they miss would reward everyone here with bacon no bacon flip says no parts of that you will get no bacon here not on my watch 5955 under 12 kid hands off for Couture hes been a nonfactor here in the second half but well go back to what Andrea was talking about previously you see Derek Lively stepping up guarding Hunter Couture switched out of the corner by Collins Music Applause 5958 Applause Mitchell short Collins comes away with it kid on the entry spinning basily as it slapped away right to Padula and once again you got the big fella having the guard on the perimeter buzzelli should be able to win this matchup with five on a shotgun shot hell be at the line back and forth we go Hokies by one Applause Sonic Blockbuster Texas right down to the bloody end last year Tennessees won seven of the last eight thats Saturday six oclock on ESPN thats a Dicky V game from Knoxville thats also a Rick Barnes game youre talking about his former School versus his current school one of the best coaches that college basketball has seen when you consider Rick Barnes you have the ability to see a big time matchup Texas is really good a top 10 match up in this Blockbuster really looking forward to that here the Hokies back on top 6059 and the Duke Blue Devils without a key man in the Freshman Whitehead out of the game with a lower leg injury you know be coming into this game John Shire told us he wanted to keep Jeremy roach in the mid to high 20s as far as his minutes were concerned with the twoday turnaround after having to play on Saturday and not practicing for two weeks how would Jeremy roach be able to respond did Tariq Whitehead out we may see Jeremy roach for the remainder of this game how will he be able to hold up said he played him a little bit longer roach in his return the other day against Miami it might be even longer tonight and a whistle with 10 45 to go here Virginia Tech Nine times 6159 Saturday 27 minutes but 14 points hes in terrific shape so no problem there tonight already 20 minutes as early picks up his third foul yeah but being him being in game shape is completely different you know and again not practicing for two weeks trying to get back into this mix well see if hes capable of making the plays that he made at the end of the Miami game Proctor the open shooter cant stick it Collins with another rebound Collins is 64 but he can get up there he absolutely can Mike young loves him feels like hes going to be great for the Hokies into the future but asking him to do a lot right now as a freshman medulla trying to penetrate swatted Away by Lively but a whistle before the block thats his second person yeah thatll be number two on Roach Jeremy roach reaching in and this is a play where you have to recognize youve got one of the best shot blockers in the game right behind you if youre roach you keep your hands out of the mix allow Derek Lively to come over and clean that up medulla really good at the line at 84 percent Hokies have not been they were just five for ten at the foul line before that didnt shoot free throws great against Clemson either a big Miss down the stretch but they could have used that one point in a onepoint loss yep lost 5150 right on the road a little John yeah Clemson just continues to churn out wins right and doing it without their point guard Chase Hunter out but Brad Brownell still finding a way for his team to win tops into conference heres Mitchell cant give him any room he dishes here and Lively with the slam Zone Kyle filipowski is doing everything right now but he has the ability to play off the bounce thats what makes him so special at seven foot he can handle the basketball and more importantly Playmate not just scoring on his own finding his teammates Music the silly up top not down low kid couldnt handle it on a turnover filipowski look at the big guy running the floor and laying in Euro stepping his way for two more and weve talked about Kyle filipowski and all the things that he can do well hes showing us even more the Euro Step to the lefthand finish showing off his dexterity around the room the Freshman putting the Blue Devils on his back tonight here in Blacksburg Virginia shot clock at six down to seven its going to be a double dribble and its going to be a turnover Kyle phillipowski suing off his ball handling the bitly the crossover and then the drop off to Derek Lively for the finish and then getting out on the break the Euro the Lefty finish doing it in every facet of the game right now for flip Applause for Lebowski another triple grandson a little battle for the rebound thatll go against him though look at these numbers now over the last four games for the big guy and youre talking about including a 28point 15 rebound effort versus Pittsburgh in that mix one of only three freshmen to ever do that the other two guys were the number two pick in their respective NBA drafts Marvin Bagley and Jabari Parker foreign Collins great dish basily with the Finish but it was a great screen that allowed billikosi to get held up on that screen John Shire wants to give his guys a break hes going to have to use his timeouts wisely throughout their stretch we talk about a number of guys playing extra minutes 5563 the Hokies Music living with eczema were used to that and hes shaping up here in the 12th ranked Virginia Tech womens team is part of our doubleheader Thursday night over on the ACC Network squaring off against outstanding Duke team in the second game at nine oclock Eastern meanwhile Kyle milapowski to seven foot 230 pound freshman for the Duke Blue Devils is putting on a show and some Pro style moves both ends of the floor Music Dave you mentioned those Pro style moves and I feel like Corey is leaving the people at home hanging because Corey you watched Kyle filipowski in high school what were the expectations of him then and how has he sort of turned himself into a prospect for the pros now Dre I dont believe the expectations were this high for him and hes improved significantly since hes been at Duke but as he continues to play as well as he has and show off all of his different skills Jerry roach gets the tough bucket attacking the basket philipowski continues to climb the draft boards because one thing people are saying that he can do is not only offensively put the basketball on the floor make plays but he can step out and guard defensively and thats what makes him so valuable if you play a guy like this at the center position in the NBA he is going to be a matchup problem for so many different teams kid on the high post shot clock now down to six the Doula wants to fire up along three but no rebound loose in the corner and picked Away by Collins took it right off the deck heres bazilly can of the paint strong move for two thats tough tough bucket Bob bezilla we talked about Jeremy Rhodes with the tough bucket on one end facili doing the same here for the Hokies well hes got 20 points he had 2610 and the loss at Syracuse so he can be a major factor offensively Proctor wants young yes sir Brian Young with two this game is looking like even though weve had some very good threepoint shooting its looking like its going to be one in the paint right now we see philipowski and young dominating on their end basily doing the same on his side Mark Mitchell getting ready to check back in here for the Blue Devil suits Couture got it thats threepointer as he comes back to life my bad Hunter my fault Hunter foreign Applause with a rebound Victoria missed the bottom mods with a bad elbow and man did they miss him he absolutely did they missed him significantly and right now Hunter Couture is trying to do his best Kyle filipowski impression and put his team on his back similar to the way he did in the ACC tournament championship game a year ago he had 31 points on the MVP Applause medulla with a crossover Brazilian into traffic a scrap for that onehander and it rolls in and in front of the buzzer 7267 he has 22 Brad bazzelli was not a part of that matchup a year ago he wants his own win versus the Blue Devils long one coming and off the back iron there by Roach Applause this big crowd ready to Roar tonight Applause OB as great as philipowskys been he is visibly gassed he has worked hard in his second half has not had a break onehander by Collins no Duke comes away with the boy grandison there as we approach five minutes to go Kansas and Baylor to follow tonight Applause phillipowski coming out High Proctor on the drive no young will feed it back to him in the corner another fight for the rebound and itll be Hokies basketball 4 48 remaining we talked about it would be about the inside game well Hunter Couture prove me wrong making sure he knows he will have

next Kansas gonna have to deal with one tough backcourt fawns yeah the Big 12 leader in threepoint field goal percentage and threepointers made Adam Flagler top 20 battle in the on Deck Circle will be thank you very much 7267 Virginia Tech hasnt won a basketball game in about five weeks and on top of Duke at the moment here at Castle Coliseum heres Couture as he gets going again just made a three a moment ago and Duke dodging the pulling with that possession miscommunication defensively giving Hanukkah tour wide open look just unable to knock it down Duke has missed their last four shots trying to put an end to that is Proctor cant hit the three and Duke has gone cold here inside the five minute Mark almost four minutes to go Applause and Padula will take his time and set it up now for Mike Young Applause and theyll run some motion heres Collins rebound comes out High Duke wants to run as philipowski ahead of everybody again and a blocking foul thatll go on Collins trying to stop the big phone and well take the break 3 47 remaining 7267 the Hokies at home on top of Duke Music just lit it up gamewinning threes Maddox was incredible Couture was amazing and they worked their way through that tournament when everyone was kind of looking the other way but here came the Hokies and eventually they would play their way against North Carolina knock them off 7259 to semifinal take on the Duke Blue Devils on that Saturday in the finals and winning four games in a row and more importantly knocking off North Carolina and Duke on your way to the championship game and on the way to holding the first ever ACC tournament championship for Mike young for the Virginia Tech Hoagies a special time for these Hokies a year ago so they know they can do it theyve dug themselves a hole this year too phillipowski making number one last year they were two and seven they beat FSU on the road that turned everything for them now theyre one and seven will tonight be the night where they flip the switch and two for the big continues to have a great night hes 28 and that ties his career high the freshman Duke coming out with some full court pressure to see if they can speed up the Hokies quite a bit and Obi as we get further into this game I got to make sure that we say a happy college sports communicators annual membership appreciation week so we make send a shout out to all these sports information directors throughout the ACC that make this game so great for us in a special birthday shout out yeah to Mike de George who is the great guy and Sid for the Duke Blue Devils for the basketball team Mike turning I think he said 23 today maybe that maybe the 21st anniversary of his 23rd birthday theres our guy Mike outstanding he does a great great job our best to Mike and a happy birthday to lebowsky on the drive and its blocked by vasili great timing there and he gets it back soon and Derek Lively getting his hands on the basketball but theyre small things thats one youve got to be able to Corral and maintain that possession for your team Music 7269 bazilly down the lane fouled before the slam so no basket as he was held up 306 left so Missouri to the line and coming up next on ESPN we take you to Waco 17 Baylor squaring off against number nine Kansas and oh well both get together and talk about baseball weve been known to you have not been known just a little bit we go back a long long way to our Marlins days you know book actually introduced me to coach Ross well David Ross we flew back together from Tallahassee uh coach Ross is actually a no saying believe it or not spend some time at Tallahassee in off season we had him in Boston he did a great job for us catching before he was a manager done a pretty good job there too theres Proctor outside the three now inside under three minutes to go Roach Proctor again shot clock at five Proctor with the kick young the other side of the rim platoon a great recognition by Young hes not the athlete that basilia so he used the other side of the basket to reverse layup to get the shore to a big bucket for Ryan young so its a big boost tonight he is eight Mozilla slapped Away by phillipowski great work there but its going to be a blocking foul has roached did a terrific job to keep that alive for going out of play and it was a smart play about medulla to try to get the charge of that possession but I do think this was the right call you have to be able to give someone an opportunity to change direction and right there you see Jeremy Rose did not have that opportunity as Ryan young continues to work for the basketball and finds the right position but avoids the shot blocking a Brazilian by using the opposite side of the rim that a timeout here as roach went to the line for a oneonone its a 30second break were coming right down to the end 217 to play the Hokies by three foreign as we give you the reset Duke has the possession arrow both head coaches with two timeouts Mike young has been coaching as long as John Shire has been alive however in his fourth season at Virginia Tech Mike young is two and three versus the Blue Devils and John shires first attempt against the Hokies good against his hostile environment and now his team with an opportunity to make it a onepoint game at the freethrow line roach hit the line and missed the front end Duke usually very reliable at the line Jeremys sister not happy with the freethrow Miss right there encouraging big bro approaching a twominute mark mutts doubled up eight to get off a shot mutts on the move to the Lane brazily came up with it but misfired underneath foreign Applause getting down to their own defensive stance watching Jeremy go to the basket Carols been doing that since he was two oh absolutely off the front iron Duke missing the shot 78 at the line as a team but suddenly the free throws are not going made the second and once again cal polapowski denies this castle guard the crowd here and Castle Coliseum bacon Applause 28 out of 12 at the line Applause brazili Applause minute 10 to go Zilla spin heres Collins on the Baseline Collins is muts and draws the foul great recognition by butts to cut to the basket seeing that Collins could be in trouble but in comparison to standing along the threepoint line he Dives to the basket finds Collins cutting but you see surrounded by three Blue Devils and Justin mustard great job cutting to the rim getting the opportunity and getting to the freethrow line Mitchells second personal this has not been a strong suit but a senior from New Jersey just 67 percent made one tonight and oh for four and these of course are huge free throws you want to try to make it in multiple possession game but with missing the first one that wouldnt happen right now you can get it to three 7572 Applause and a timeout John just over a minute to play Duke started out as hot as a firecracker and a 70 lead Virginia Tech came back just as strong and so here were coming right down to The Bitter End with a minute or two to go and right now no need to rush a threepoint shot you have more than enough time a minute you Omega you want to get the best quality look you can probably attacking the basket find a way to make something positive happen in the painted area whether its a layup or kicking it out to one of your guys for three but no need to rush right now for the Blue Devils 25 72 missiles been a big reason than Virginia Tech has been able to have this lately in the kings of Castle so far and of course Philadelphias just been outstanding with 29 Points and nine rebounds yeah career high 29 Points with Kyle for lapowski stepping it up big time here on the road recognizing how much his team need s him and his answered the Bell each and every time for the Blue Devils we look at our game reset right now still two timeouts remaining for Virginia Tech only one for the Blue Devils both teams in the bonus and the Blue Devils right now looking to get some points on the board to either tie or make us a one position one point game now both of these teams coming off games that came down to the last shots on Saturday Duke but a big win over Miami at home Virginia Tech lost by one point against Clemson Roach down to 47 seconds to go 10 to get off a shot they want phillipowski to take one but he cant Proctor will he drains a triple and he ties the game but a shot within the flow of the offense all dribble penetration philipowski weve talked about him being able to make plays off the bounce but has the poison presence of mind not to take a bad shot and Tyrese Proctor weve talked about him growing up in the moment and finds his teammate his Proctor steps up make a big three to tie the game as the Brotherhood on the sidelines excited about their chances here on the road the Duke had missed six consecutive threes and Proctors only hitting 26 percent for the year well and again as a freshman you start out the game is moving 100 miles per hour but right now you can see from philipowski who got off to a great start during his freshman year but for Proctor its starting to slow down for him then he started back in the starting lineup and now as a point guard hes handling the basketball a lot more but still poised enough to be able to make plays at the end and stepping up and knocking down a huge three to tie the game look at the Rick Whitehead on crutches out cheering on his team hate to see this for this young man but still involved in the mix and wanting to make sure his team gets a road win he cant not look right hes got to come out and watch the end of this thing ice there on the lower leg 75 75 35 seconds to go so now youre Mike young youve got the basketball well right now you have no need to rush 26 seconds remaining on the shot clock you dont want to do anything too quick so but right now the way the hunter Couture has been shooting the basketball you want to allow him to be an option but Grant basilia my question is that in my opinion is the guy right now simply because hes been able to attack the painted area finish around the rim and get to the freethrow line and make his free throw attempts when he gets those chances Brazilian 69 grad to transfer from Wright State Hokies by the way without a field goal in the last five minutes in 25 seconds the Blue Devils have been locking them up defensively and right into a 7575 tie Applause okies 10 out of 19 from threepoint Lando tonight heres bezilla 20 seconds to go and offer Couture Couture with a bounce feed heres Collins with a pullup got it with 13 seconds to go Applause and theyre gonna have to maybe look at the clock here as well 124 to go philipowski taking a hit looks like in the throat area also got what looks to be Blood on the knee has been that type of night for Kyle philipowski hes played great but hes been beat up also weve seen him on the ground a number of times throughout this when you see the blood on the knee MJ Collins making the twopoint Basket in a fist bump that accidentally catches Kyle filipowski in the net oh on to Celebration and the officials going over to look at that to make sure that it wasnt anything that would be considered flagrant I dont even know that Collins had any idea Phillip housing was right there he was celebrating making a big bucket turns around for the fist pump but philipowski takes it right in the net Keith Kimball right there on top of it looks like hes in the ring taking a shot Applause Keith Kimball and Terry Oglesby the officials not going to say as you said it was anything play for nothing on purpose there it was in the act of the celebration unfortunately for Phillip housing unfortunately for philipowski but again thats one of those things that you go over to the bench you shake it off but it continues to get your blood boiling and right now theres no one who wants to get a big buck in his build house takes that square into the net but theres no one right now who wants a big bucket to win this game more so than top of the house were also going to reset the clock to 136 theyve added more time no Hokies on top 7775 14 look and thanks thanks to our officiating crew that angle right there shows you thats a tough shot for the power ski took but thanks to our officiating Cool J Oglesby of course Keith Kimball kept kisses are coming over and letting us know it was deemed incidental because it was celebratory though and it was nothing intentional on that phillipowski just in the wrong place at the wrong time so Collins hits a big shot and then hits filipowski unintentionally right in the throat Applause so 136 to go and Mark Mitchell will put it in here for the Blue Devils see if philipowski has had a spectacular game can recover here and be a factor at the end Proctor for philipowski Proctor will launch a long one its short rebounded by Collins with 36 seconds to go and the Hokies less than four seconds from breaking a seven game losing skin Applause free throws of utmost importance at this point 36 seconds is an eternity in a basketball game to be able to get a quality look for the Blue Devils which makes these free throws very important if youre Virginia Tech you want this to be a fourpoint game when its all said and done not leaving any opportunities for the Blue Devils to tie Or Win It by missing a free throw or missing both Okies are seven for nine at the foul line in the second half Duke had started to head back over to John Shire another called back by the officials 39 now Collins to the line he said some major moments in this game this was checking the clock make sure they got it right threepoint nine remaining and Duke still has a timeout Collins an 80 foul shooter freshman from South Carolina pretty smooth on that one just like his jumbo and that is a big free throw because now the most that he can do is tie the basketball game and send it into overtime if they are able to knock down the three this one right here could be the dagger Applause balance a fourstar recruit on the top players coming out of South Carolina and looking to put the Hokies on top by four and he does not and a timeout philipowski with a rebound 32 to go the door is still open my friend when you consider how important free throws are at this stretch of the game no one dealing with more stress right now than Mike young recognizing trying to figure out whether you have to foul at this point as soon as they catch the basketball and put the Blue Devils on the free throw line or if you allow them to play it out now well take a look at the Capital One rewarding performance tonight Applause that rewarding performance coming from number of Hokies but Grant facili has stood out amongst them all offensively defensively coming up blocked shots rebound the basketball and he has been significant for the Hokies here tonight looking to break that seven game losing streak if they can stop the Blue Devils on one last possession 24 points for gazilly and eight rebounds 10 out of 15 shooting and a lot of really gritty hard work in the paint it absolutely has been that for him he has matched the toughness of the Blue Devils in the painted area taking the basketball to the rim a number of times finishing it off of course only one or two from Beyond the threepoint Arc in this game where he normally makes his mark so for Duke who takes the shot confident its not even close I mean again right now you want to find the one and again at seven foot hes really your biggest receiver and what I would expect right now is to be able to throw the ball long and find a way to have him come up and catch it and be able to fire a three he would be the guy that I would suggest will be the one catching this the timeout for the Hokies young will take one here 7875 Applause and had to do it the Blue Devils for a big chunk of the second half without Whitehead lets check in with Captain Studio all right we want to let you know that Kansas Baylor is about to start right now over on ESPN news Brady dick and The Jayhawks two consecutive losses gigantic battle in Waco tonight top 20 Showdown take one of the big

Music now Couture runs in and pushes kid to the bench and honey Couture covers the ground six Hokies on the floor coming all the timeout Hunter Couture sprinting over thats leadership right there OB so nobody on young as he inbounds gets it knocked away Katara defense and they win it 7875 Qatar had a huge hand in it and he had the biggest hand in the end as duke fails to get off a shot and a hoagies and a seven game Scan they had not won since the middle of December Virginia Tech 51 in their last six matchups with the Blue Devils in Castle Coliseum
