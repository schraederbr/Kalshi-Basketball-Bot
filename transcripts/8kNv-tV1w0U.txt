time to answer at the other end Lundy the long rebound for winner thats another thing you have to deal with theyre shooting so many threes theres going to be some long rebounds you saw Dorsey ball screen for Pickett Tyson tried to knock it away intended for Miles dread last Touch by the Nittany Lions says Jeffrey Anderson this has been a problem for the Tigers so far Pickett gets the ball out at the top of the key and then just dribbles it he turns he turns nobodys coming to help because of their threepoint shooting tigers are going to have to figure something out there getting our first look at Clemson and Dylan hunter in the ball game theres Hemingway a catch and shoot three off the top backtoback triples for the junior Hemingway and when Hemingway can get in that position West and catch with some a little bit of room and shoot it he is a very dangerous threepoint shooter both schools have gotten into the bench Ben Middlebrooks wearing 10 defends Dorsey on the perimeter for Clemson he replaced Hall a moment ago the whole side is clear heres Lundy with six to shoot against Hemingway trying to size him up drives and scores wow nice strong move by the senior from Paulsboro New Jersey Seth Lundy whos averaging 16 points and seven and a half rebounds in the last two ball games for Penn State Hemingway another one missed that time fivepoint lead and Penn States kicking up the temple a little bit Lundy misses on the three and Hunter goes to the deck digs it out in Lundy commits the foul Clemson very fortunate to get that ball back hemenway did not block out Lundy first on Lundy second on Penn State winner will come out of the ball game as will Lundy for the Nittany Lions and Lundys going to pick up the foul because this isnt football you cant jump on top of the car you sure a positive were not were not we didnt change that rule well thats been a point of emphasis for a couple of years now where you cant guys cant just jump in the pot middle Brooks at the top theres Tyson whos been quiet offensively and so far the Penn State Defense has done a great job keeping Clemson out of the middle and away from the lane middleburgs tried to spin Dorsey reached in knocked it away heres Pickett with the tiger turnover their third and a fivepoint lead Applause Pickett bounce pass for Dorsey what great recovery by Middlebrooks miles dread on the bounce now back for dread and a three and the rebound for Galloway Wes Dredd has only attempted one twopoint shot on the season hes out there to shoot three and no free throws by the way Galloway and gets the roll five for Brevin Galloway Clemson to within three thats a really good response by the Tigers they were struggling heres Pickett all the way through kicks it back out front three ball from Funk he gets knocked down and therell be free throws coming for Andrew Funk on the Hemingway foul his first thatll be the second on the Tigers but Galloway has shown that hes willing to drive the ball to the basket this is a tough tough shot you know thats one of those things if youre a Defender you just tip your hat to the guy so heres Andrew Funk these are his first free throws of the Year Dan wow this is a team that comes in West making only seven free throws per game they dont shoot free throws they were 337 last year in the NCAA in free throws yeah I mean when and you stand outside and shoot threes unless youre going to get fouled like he did on the threepoint shot its hard to get foul first point for Punk dont forget the uh coverage of the 24th annual ACC Big Ten challenge presented by Continental Tire continues tonight at 9 30 from Chrysler Arena in our arent in Ann Arbor number three Virginia and Michigan tonight and Funk only got one of the three game on ESPN and always available for you on the ESPN app fourpoint lead Ian shefflins coming to the Ball Game Brownells dipped into his death heres Tyson and we get a foul call by Lee Cassell and I think its on dread and it will be on Miles dread Timeout on the floor here at Clemson Penn State by four going to the break of foul on uh miles dread well you get your moneys worth and the interesting thing about that is since Hunter Tyson was already in his shooting motion had that ball gone in that shot would have counted so a break for the Nittany Lions miles if youre gonna file somebody tigers have hit three of their last four to draw to within four and the ball after the marker on dread heres Dylan Hunter and this is sheplin for three Miss and scooped up by funk shuffling you know he hadnt taken very many his two for five coming in so he can shoot the three and that may be something that the Tigers big guys are gonna have to do because the Penn State interior defense has been solid Mahaffey on the floor wearing 12 for the Nittany Lions he joins funk Jai has returned along with Pickett Johnson out there too another freshman for Coach Shrewsbury and now we get a whistle and a shot clock malfunction here at Little John it says 20 thats not possible there was no Ron Gruber is going to award the bench for both teams while they uh work on the timing issue while we get a break remind you the 24th annual ACC Big Ten challenge continues tomorrow night Dan dont youve heard Ohio State and Duke are going to play yeah and I hear Indiana and North Carolina yes they are at Assembly Hall the Cameron Indoor game starts at 7 15 and then the Hoosiers and Tar Heels will be at 9 15 Wednesday night on ESPN and always streaming live on the ESPN app both are Sonic Blockbusters and I should say so are they are and it brings us to this conversation here about this challenge it was announced yesterday this is the final year of the ACC Big Ten challenge Big Ten has won the last three they tied seven all in 2018 the ACC has not won the championship or the challenge since 2017 when they won it 113 and Dan there is that idea when this was formulated in the late 90s that this was going to benefit the NCAA tournament and while that is subjective at times it is a fact it is going to help build the resume of these respected leagues well and thats what theyre trying to do thats what the whole purpose is give you an opportunity to build your resume over the last couple years right Wes youre right the Big Ten teams and not because theyve won the challenge you know by a large margin but theyve done a better job in the nonconference season building the resume for all the teams in the league right thats where the ACC has struggled and the ACC again West this year so far they have not done a good job playing against ranked teams so heres some opportunities for the conference to win a couple of games that would really help the resume not only of the teams that win but of the conference as a whole you and I were talking before the game the ACC only has two wins against ranked competition in nonconference play both of them belong to Virginia yeah and what were they last year like four four and fourteen four and fourteen yeah see the problem here is the the clock reset to 20 as if there was a shot and Penn State recovered the ball the shot clock was actually down I think very low and so its a good job by the Ron Gruber the official noticed it that the shot clock simply reset and I dont know whether somebody bumped something or its just a mechanical malfunction so what theyre doing is theyre using the replay system that has become a part of the college game to go back and look at because they have the ability to look at shot clock game clock right and they try to figure out subtract It Off The Possession right to figure out how much time is left on the shot clock the other thing to have to look at is to make sure the game clocks okay thats right but I think the game clocks fun theyre just trying to figure out how much time is left so while Micah Shrewsbury huddles up with his group so you keep an eye on this here 28 on the game clock 20 on the shot oh everything stopped everything now manually they have to go through and do it now they got to figure it out right how much longer did they play well thats why they have a stopwatch at the table right now if they wanted to West we could count Mississippis for them I think theyve got a little bit better opportunity than that so 1111 to go which means theres four four seconds on the shot clock four on the shot clock so they had to manually go back and do it with the uh literal stopwatch and so they didnt count Mississippi no okay all right well they actually had some technology technology so four to shoot for Penn State whos got a fourpoint lead and can we consider a stopwatch to be technology old technology take it to put it in Play heres Funk working on Hunter little Runner will be short and the rebound for Galloway Applause Galloway with Chase Hunter heres Brevin tried to kick it out and hes called for a travel by Jeffrey Anderson turnover number two on the Tigers Wes so far Im really impressed with the way Penn State is able to stay in front of these dribblers their defense against the ball reducing cutting down on the penetration has been really good Music here is Pickett with Dylan Hunter and Alive Jai couldnt hang on to the lob tried to keep it alive and hit the inline itll belong to the Tigers I like the idea but Kevin Jai this outstanding young freshman from Centerville Ohio playing about 13 minutes a ball game for Micah Shrewsbury just couldnt finish the back end of the lob just not able to catch it and you can see the Clemson defense pushing out against the three so creating some opportunities inside Galloway working on Funk on the drive Josh slapped it off the window Galloways really trying to push it in there West that looked like a force to me here is Pickett grinding on the backs kicks it in the corner Johnson launches and hits thats a three and again its Pickett who creates that whole thing gets down in the corner forces the defender to come and help out and then he just dumps it and thats a really quick release on that threepoint shot fifth three of the Year Battalion Johnson lead back to seven Hunter misfire shuffling the rebound second chance for the Tigers its Tyson Hunter working on the drive against Johnson softball away no good and saved by Johnson Clemsons missed a couple like that Wes Mahaffey on the drive scoops and it bounced away Chase Hunter into the front Court Clemsons leading scorer is scoreless and still remains that way Tyson fished it around sheplin recovers and scores foreign Applause this season overall but its his passing and his defensive ability that has really helped keep this Clemson ball Club tell you what its going to be interesting to watch here in terms of his development he does a its really their first the first rotation that shoot 38 or better from Beyond the threepoint arm Chef on the lob this is RJ Godfrey to work with a right hand the young freshman Godfrey his eight field goal of the season now he put Wiggins in the game and its 610 jumping up and down there in the corner stop moving your feet and the shot rolled off the iron Michael Hinn by the way has played at five schools in five years hes 21st Century College basketball up by hunters too strong rebounded pulled away by Kanye Clary a freshman from the Tidewater area Virginia Beach hell leave it for him hell launch from the front PJ Hall will clear it thats hens first Miss from three this year yep was two of two and perfect from the floor but hes missed his last two how about PJ Hall another three one of the reasons Penn State interior defense has been so good is their big guys are dropping off the Clemson post players and Hall just made him pay for it twice tied at 21 now tigers on an eightnothing run theres Clary forces up the layup and scores Applause Music its really a nice job by Clary all up over Paul 2321 Applause Godfrey for Dylan Hunter tried to bounce at the hall and we get a kick and well get a timeout BJ Hall has given the Tigers a pair of Threes here Dan but Penn State with a twopoint lead Music hey dont forget more college basketball for you coming up Thursday night a pair of games featuring Big 12 and Big East teams first with the top seven matchup boy how about McDermott and Craig Dan and number two Texas both schools off to terrific starts here in the first month in change of the season and then at nine oclock well take you to venerable Allen field house Shaheen Holloway youve been a lot of places welcome to KU the hall and the number nine Jayhawks at 9 00 pm Thursday night on ESPN and always available for you on the ESPN app two really good ball games and a good one here Dan twopoint lead good Wednesday with six minutes to go you know Penn States defense has really forced Clemson out to the perimeter but PJ Hall has made two threepoint baskets that equals his total for the entire season Josh Beadle on the floor wears zero for the Tigers first time weve seen the redshirt freshman from Columbia South Carolina tend to shoot skip for Galloway hell launch front rim Miss they scramble inside Funk out of there with the rebound for the Nittany Lions Music Brad Brownell has gone deep into his shirts yep Applause Wiggins getting some extended minutes 11 different tigers have played here in the first half this is Cameron winter with eight to shoot working on beetle into traffic turns and scores tough shot for winner whos got eight thats his first twopoint field goal of the game and that just goes to show you that its more than Pickett who can do that their guards are big theyre aggressive and you cant double team because the other guys could get around the perimeter and then the lines are kind of sized down here Dan youre shuffling with the catch on dread and fouled by dread thatll be his second and thats five now on the Nittany Lions another look at the winter basket though well this is a situation where you cant help and shefflin is looking looking but he cant go down to help because hes afraid of the threepoint Shooters hes guarding dread and Dread is an outstanding shooter and so the way you counter that is you get the ball inside on the other end where suddenly you have an advantage the Tigers did sold out on that occasion see Chase Hunter check in for Chauncey Wiggins and the youngster will get a word from the head coach of the Tigers alltime winning as coach at Clemson Brad Brownell and shuffling hits them both hes got four in the first half Clemson to within two under five to play Applause dont forget later tonight number three Virginia and Michigan and Ann Arbor that should be quite a show a lot of good games tonight on this ACC Big Ten challenge presented by Continental time Funk on the drive inside Lundy the nice catch and score seven for Seth Lundy on his third field goal and when you Wes when you have to react like that and Sprint to the guy who you know is the shooter nice job by Funk to put it down and go around beetle winter defending a return bounce for shefflin up strong and scores easily on Lundy if Penn States going to risk going small Dan Clemson can do that right and thats Advantage Clemson as long as they can prevent the threepoint shots pick it against Hunter Tyson Music Applause back for London 10 to shoot a three away and good Seth Lundy with 10 hes averaged 16 and hits six of 11 from three in their last two games Applause first Penn State player to double figures thats really discouraging for a defense heres Tyson Lundy defends Tyson now Galloway needs to try to get it inside the shift line against dread here it is in a double team and a foul called this is either two on winner or three on dread and I think its Cameron winter heres a good drive by Funk too what draws the defense and for the rare occasion they dont kick it out they get it inside and speaking of going inside Chaplin has an advantage and he takes it Indiana Universitys South Bend at the age of 25 and his basketball journey is fascinating and Dan I I thoroughly enjoyed our visit with him today what a nice guy oh yeah yeah and you know the Boston Celtics assistant coach that means hes been in the NBA hes seen all that NBA stuff he brings it here yep and just a terrific higher and when you think about it now it sets up where hes got a chance to develop a program and hes doing it with recruits but hes also been Smart in a transfer portal with grad guys Dan I mean Jalen Pickett Sienna Andrew font Buck now Cameron winter Drexel those are all guys that were high level players in their leagues heres Beetle on the drive pushed it up with a right hand bounces away and now Clemson Trails five and were closing in on three minutes to play first time weve been talking about Penn States threepoint shooting but Clemson has just as many threes five in the first half as Penn State the Tigers simply have not been able to score effectively from twopoint Rings Funk of fall away three now okay sometimes you miss a defensive rotation or something but theres just you cant guard them yep and now we got a foul offensive foul called on Chase Hunter as he was working through a screen itll be his first third on Clemson here and another look well hes he never stopped right Wes you know you cant just run into the guy if youre going to set a screen you have to be stationary and he just he just right into Johnson yep so Pickett plays with Caleb Dorsey winner Lundy and Andrew Funk who just hit the three heres Chase Hunter defending Jalen Pickett eightpoint lead again for the Nittany Lions and a hand checked foul on Hunter will be his second been a tough first half for Chase Hunter now the Redshirt Junior his second thats the fourth on Clemson and Josh beetle is going to be summoned back from the tiger bench hes working really hard because Pickett right there he just slams him with the body hes trying to keep picking away from the basket Pickett has done such a great job posting up with that dribble out of the corner Funk a shot fake on Hemingway bounce pass Dorsey the catch and a reach in foul comb and I believe itll be on Galloway it is his second he is the second tiger with two and five on Clemson Penn State has done a really nice job getting the Clemson Tigers to chase they get that one little step and then suddenly the ball starts moving around and the tigers are behind Pickett with Galloway defending on the hip turns with the left hand scores how many times weve seen Jalen Pickett do it tonight I think all four of his field goals Dan yeah well hes six feet four he weighs 210 pounds if youre just going to let him back down like that hes going to score anytime he wants largest lead of the night for the Nittany Lions who are on an eightnothing run in the last 90 seconds Tyson allowed for his buddy hall and a foul by Dorsey Smith on Penn State Wesson we sound like a broken record but look how much space he has he just backs in theres not a lot you can do if you dont get any help and its hard to give help because hes such a good passer and you get hit with a three Clemson at the freethrow line is just two of three one and one coming for PJ Hall as RJ Godfrey checks back into the lineup the young freshman from Suwanee Georgia well now this is interesting I think Godfrey is in the game to guard Pickett and so thatll be effective against pick it down on the inside but lets see if God freaking stay with him out on the perimeter all left it on the front rim 10point lead for Penn State two minutes to go here in this first half so Godfreys going to guard Lundy Hunter Tyson now is going to try his hand with Pickett Fall Away by Pickett bounces out for Godfrey put a little bigger guy on and bother him a little bit here is beetle Music Josh tried to work in on Dorsey skips it out for Hall hit a couple of Threes from out there earlier heres Godfrey inside up through traffic and scores boy thats what you call a power move RJ Godfreys got two right at the iron here in the first half for His Four Points well thats a big bucket for Clemson sure stopped the Penn State run heres Pickett trying to work around Paul Johnson now slashing through 10 to shoot now Pickett will take the ball with five to shoot working on Tyson Fall Away background Miss Beetle collects nice job by Tyson but a really good job by PJ Hall to tell Tyson to switch when they had the opportunity beetle with the left hand Josh beetle he is not afraid he likes to attack four in a row by the Tigers cuts it to six Applause Penn States been able to find the bucket when Clemson builds a little momentum here in this first half Lundy working on Godfrey and RJ Godfrey will commit the foul sixth team foul on the Tigers when a beetle is noted for his speed but its speed its athleticism and its strength to get that ball in there oh were gonna use it or lose it time out taken with 349 to go Nittany lines the ball up six knew this was going to be one of those kind of Rockem sockem games tonight didnt he absolutely he did and he was talking about how impressed he was with Penn States ability to not only shoot the ball but to move the ball and to create some matchup problems but what they have just done coming off the bench with the Tigers putting Tyson on Pickett has slowed pick it down just a little bit because he cant back his way in against the taller guy and you cant do that unless you have somebody who can guard Lundy and so far thats been Godfrey Godfrey he really hadnt played all that much this year Johnson on the inbounds 20 to shoot heres Clary misses with the left hand Godfrey the rebound Beadle will call the Clemson timeout now so Penn State uses one as does the Tigers here step aside Music well were 214 from the half dont forget theres another ball game underway tonight as well in this ACC Big Ten challenge presented by Continental Tire great to be with Dan Bonner West Durham at Littlejohn Coliseum and coming to entertaining first 20 minutes here really an entertaining first 20 minutes West each team showing an awful lot of potential and its been fun to watch the adjustments that the coaches have made shuffling hes back on the floor with Godfrey Tyson Hemingway and beetle Clemson wants to take the last shot of the half Im playing zone or Nittany Lions Godfrey the catch working on Dorsey three to play in the half got knocked away Dorsey recovers and the half will end there Brad Brownell wanted a foul didnt get it halftime we reached it Little John six point lead for Penn State 10 points for Seth Lundy eight for Jalen Pickett lead the Nittany Lions Penn State a sixpoint Advance stay tuned off to the ESPN college basketball Studios get a sixpoint Advance stay tuned off to the ESPN college basketball Studios right after you see this a Continental Tire we welcomed me back to Little John Coliseum and host Clemson Trails Penn State 3529 with Dan Bonner West Durham we welcome you about Courtside we expected threes we got those but we also got a lot of twopoint shots and in particular Jalen Pickett and Cameron winter delivered what we thought they might too yeah West Penn State comes in they average 12 threepoint baskets made per game theyve made six in the first half so theyre right on schedule Clemson has made five threes the difference in the game is Clemson has struggled a little bit from Two and Penn State has not well quick check of the stats show you that line and more the other part is probably the 14 pain points for Micah shrewsburys team that may be a little surprising and for Brad Brownell his leading scorer his score less at the break well and that he thats tough to do he averages almost 17 points a game and he hadnt made a field goal Wes he missed a couple that rattled in and out literally I think his first four shots that happened to him I thought he got a little bit frustrated and he particularly got frustrated trying to guard Pickett down on the inside original starters for both schools begin the second half Penn State will have the ball they went scoreless the last 2 23 of the first half and here you see that matchup again theyve decided to put Hunter Tyson on Pickett put the bigger guy on him make it harder for him to back down Clemson tries to switch inside this is Jai and Galloway got a hand on the pass back out to pick it 16 to shoot for the Nittany Lions its a good thing he got his hand up because that was a fastball from about two feet and broken his nose if it hit him in the face so Pickett will put it in play right near our location and in front of the Penn State bench Music Applause Im Tyson again and got knocked away a little dig down from Galloway Hill you gotta pick your spots and he did a nice job that time turnover number four and the basket rattled out west every shot every twopoint shot he has taken that has been the result exactly that a little rattle around kick into the corner Lundy the fall away he left it short Jai tried for the rebound he couldnt handle it it will belong to the Tigers and Hunter Tyson and PJ Hall making sure they get connected here at the defensive end of the floor a moment ago Penn States defense for the most part has prevented the Tigers from getting inside that is a real difficult chunk got knocked to the deck Nittany lines the other way out of the corner winner launches backside rebound for Lundy Pickett says left it on the rim Jai had a shot at it Tyson Gathers pinky can shoot the three but as weve seen West thats not the best part of his game so can Tyson Dan first points for Hunter Tyson boy thats a surprise Wes that Clemson can be this much can be this close in the game with Tyson not having scored and you got to figure that somewhere in the neighborhood of about 29 Points is scoreless theyve got that bucket there the answer bounds his way off the shot from Lundy Clemson to within three in way to Hall Jai defends PJ with a right hand left it on the rim and the foul is gone Ron Gruber on kevajai the Freshman from Centerville Ohio his first and the First on Penn State of the half Clemson doing a nice job with ball movement and player movement here and Tyson is able to get open for that three thats uh that confused the Penn State Defense just a little BJ Hall missed the front end of a one and one in the first half and the first one here is good seven for Hall Music Dan his health at the end of last year was not good and then as he recovered from the foot surgery and all the rehab he suffered a knee injury dislocated kneecap and at the end of the day Brad Brownell says we dont know when hell be 100 but his toughness to get back on the floor has certainly inspired his team here well it has Wesson this is a guy in PJ Hall when hes healthy hes one of the top players in the Atlantic Coast Conference but its without question hes not healthy right at the moment but hes got eight tonight and he draws the Tigers to within one Jalen Pickett rubbing off The Jive screen into traffic and it rattles in board hey how about he just bored his way inside my biggest upset of the night is hes got 10 and not a three among them given his uh propensity to shoot them at a 40 clip and he shoots at a 40 clip West but hes not a high volume guy hunter trying to get on the glass Paul will follow the miss 10 for Hall another tough Miss for Hunter but if you drive in like that and draw the defense thats going to create some opportunities for offensive rebound heres Jai he traveled time a Jai shuffled his feet on the catch at the post and thats going to get Caleb Dorsey off coach shrewsburys bench to replace the young freshman Wes I think the move to put Hunter Tyson on Pickett has created some opportunities for the Tigers Tysons happy that its a traveling violation yep heres Chase Hunter back from Middlebrooks who spelled Hall a moment ago Galloway working on winner Hunter thought about it now middle Brooks on Dorsey Ben Middlebrooks and one Caleb Dorsey second and the second on Penn State Dan well Ben Middlebrooks is six feet ten weighs almost 250 pounds he is one strong guy and Dorsey hes the guy who plays in the post when they go to their smaller lineup hes giving up a couple of inches and about 20 pounds tigers in front for the first time since it was three to two on the Hemingway three and now an offensive foul called off the ball on Cameron winter itll be his third its the third of the half on Penn State illegal screen Applause and Tyson as Micah Shrewsbury visits with Ron Gruber Applause just leans into him theres not a lot of contact West but he knocks the player down and the bucket by Middlebrooks four in a row by Ben Middlebrooks a really good job by Hunter to get in there and make that pass you know just because youre not scoring you cant let it affect the rest of your game well John trying to become a factor here is Pickett working on Tyson offensive foul Hunter Tysons been a Difference Maker he absolutely has that switch to Pickett has really disrupted the Penn State offense and this is a this is a move where its not on the inside this is Tyson moving his feet and moving his feet to prevent the penetration breaking the action Clemson but here in the second half hes done a nice job Distributing the ball thats just an outstanding pass hes such a good threepoint shooter you got to cover him and with that penetration nice drop off to Middlebrook as you can see second in the ACC and assist but what a catch by Middlebrook yeah you could have pulled a hundred ACC fans about who would ultimately end up being Clemsons point guard Im not sure 35 of them would have guessed Chase Hunter when the year started Dan but hes been very good at that spot Hemingway had it slapped away tried to make the save tigers turn it over eight in the ball game now for Clemson Music threepoint lead for the Tigers Pickett trying to work on Middlebrooks Funk back on the floor with Lundy theyre trying to clear out and heres miles dread standing on the right wing heres dread eight to shoot back for Pickett and a three front rim miss last touched and Ron Gruber says it belongs to Penn State Jeff Anderson wants to double check on the clock here Music so were going to take the official time out theyre going to work on the clock threepoint lead for the Tigers but you better get settled in for conference championships Saturday on the family of networks High Noon start Kansas State and TCU the Dr Pepper Big 12 title fight and then at uh four oclock the American takes Center Stage Gus Malzahn and Willie Fritz matching wits to determine the champion there and then the subway ACC Championship game from uptown Charlotte about eight oclock Eastern time where Clemson and North Carolina will meet and a fivesecond violation off the shot clock reset and the Penn State turnover so all that hooha about the shot clock and it doesnt make any difference yep threepoint lead for the Tigers in the basketball miles tread really extending the mantoman on Tyson and now to work middle Brooks on Dorsey with the right hand six from Middlebrooks off Brownells bench here in the second half well West the Five Spot the post player for Clemson if you combine the three guys Brad Brownell is used tonight they have a total of 22 points on eight for ten shootings pickets for Funk look at this shot and a foul called on Hemingway against Andrew Funk that is the second time in this game that Hemingway has been called for a foul against Funk on a threepoint show were gonna look at this and Dan its about catching this crosscourt pass right Music got him in the arm well youre trying to get out there because you know hes a really good threepoint shooter but youre right Wes you draw the defense and you kick it across the court 118th Collegiate game tonight and the 84th start for Warrington Pennsylvanias Andrew funk he gets up and he hits him on the wrist before he comes down if you hit him on the wrist while he still had the ball but the shooter is in the act of shooting until he comes back down on the floor Kevin Jai replaces Caleb Dorsey and Funk now with a half dozen points this young man with second Team all Patriot League 18 points a ball game he hit all three at the line hes now four for six at the stripe and Clemson with a twopoint lead and theyre inside guys again and theyve done a really good job Hall has 10 middle Brooks has six shefflin has six really nice rotation in there Tyson against dread now Hemingway Galloway and a hand checked foul on Lundy second on Lundy fifth on Penn State in a twopoint game well West sent five team fouls theyre still 14 minutes and 37 seconds left in this game Music the Nittany Lions Dont Shoot Many period funks taking six tonight thats almost their game average heres middle Brooks working on Jai then turns in skips out in three seconds yep good piece of officiating by Ron Gruber Wes now once you get in there you have three seconds now the officials will give you a little bit more time if you get in there and youre over three seconds and you make a move to the basket yep but if youre in there and youre over three seconds and you pass the ball back out theyre gonna call that thats a point of emphasis this year Pickett had it punched away and last touched the foot of Jalen Pickett a double team of middle Brooks and Galloway Dan Well Middle Brooks has been doing a nice job when hes had to jump out to help against Pickett even when hes had to switch hes done a nice job moving his feet and Galloway has been aggressive see middle Brooks jumps out and hes the one that tips that ball away Music shy trying to defend the sophomore goes to work with a right hand left it on the rim got the rebound and then a foul on Pickett reaching in Applause and thats going to be the second on Jalen Pickett 16 foul Pickett does a really nice job going down here to help I thought he bothered Middlebrooks not able to get it over and he just got tangled up with Middlebrooks under the basket really good hustle though by the big guy heres Tyson against dread Fall Away Applause its for Hunter Tyson Clemson lead to four again so now Galloway is back on Pickett sometimes in the corner dread hit the side of the glass Applause Middlebrooks trying to help Chase Hunter fall away for his first no just didnt have it tonight so the ball West dread cues and threes the miss kicked out on the offensive rebound to pick it inside Jai Skips from Miles dread Pickett would tend to shoot Music trying to square up Middlebrooks Runner with a right hand too strong Tyson the rebound thats real good defense by Middlebrook tell you what you cant be shy inside tonight Applause you better Shake everybodys hand and make sure you get their name because wow Music Galloway from Middlebrooks a three Miss hes got a nice stroke from out there Wes yep now Hemingway sizes up Pickett or vice versa Applause return pass from funk and were going to get a foul on Alex Hemingway I believe and thatll be his third itll be the second on Clemson hes going to get us to a timeout they go to their neutral Corners Dan the fourpoint game at Littlejohn Applause hey dont

attempts so they decide to drive the ball to the basket Music Clemsons got Hall and Beetle back on the floor and also Chauncey Wiggins who saw some action in the first half and Beetle a little soft runner for his second field goal Wesley really likes that little floater in the lane Michael hen wearing 24 for Penn States come on the third big that Micah shrewsburys run out there in this second half too and Clary on the drive and Jeffrey Anderson a whistle against Josh petel itll be the third on Clemson weve seen Pickett s side and pickets on the bench right now and that time winner did this is just a nice job coming off a screen thats a shot that Clemson had a difficult time making in the first half Clemsons got 20 bench points tonight how about that dallian Johnson back on the floor first time weve seen him in the second half wearing 23 for the Nittany line winner sizes up a three from Deep 13 for Cameron winner thats his third triple of the ball game in Penn State just like that to within one this Rises up behind that screen off the dribble I thought Galloway did a pretty good job but theres an illegal screen yep beetles second in the fourth on Clemson you know you got to be careful when you do that handoff Wes youve got to get yourself stopped its a guy with the ball hands it off and he keeps going thats going to be a foul every time this is what happens turns you have to stop and you cant turn your body into the defender so the turnover sends it back to Penn State and a chance for the Nittany Lions to regain the lead winner again all the way underneath Johnson this young freshman from Haverhill Mass and now Clary trying to find an alley Hall is there and blocked it that mountain was too high for Kanye Clary and thats what that is a mountain almost halfway home in the second heres PJ working on him all the way through and a foul on Michael Hinn for the bump Applause now Clary is a little guy and theyve had some success getting inside with that turn around jump shot but not against 611 guys and thats a really nice job by all not only does he block the shot by going straight up in the air but he grabs the ball Applause PJ making his 30th career start tonight Ferrys only five feet 11 giving up a foot to Hall first ones away and good on the one and one dont forget coming up over on ESPN the ESPN app about 9 30 tonight at Chrysler Arena number three Virginia Tony Bennis Cavaliers at Michigan as part of the ACC Big Ten challenge presented by Continental Tire its available on the ESPN app as well second from PJ Hall as a front rim Miss Wesson Clemson has a little bit of an opportunity here to do some business at the free throw line they only have four team fouls and they are in the theyre in the bonus because Penn State is at seven heres wenner back for him he thought about the three step in foul line and it rolled off slapped around Clary in the reset for Penn State skip pass for winner hell shoot for the lead Music Hunter wants to scream Hall obliges Chase to the basket against hand draws the foul Michael Hinn his second thats the eighth on Penn State and two shots here for Chase Hunter a 73 free throw shooter and he just takes the ball right at hand he puts that shoulder into hens chest and hen is trying to just stay keep his position but thats a really good job by a really good guard first point of the ball game for Hunter with 9 22 to go Dan dread and Pickett both come back into the game for Penn State theyre going to size down here yeah thats where theyve had their success tough night shooting for Applause Chase Hunter those are his first points of the game Ian shefflin who gave Clemson some valuable benchmets in the first half but this is a tough matchup for shuffling hes got to try to go up against Lundy yep here is winner against Chauncey Wiggins how about Wiggins out there guarding the point one yeah Hunter draws the foul he tried to step in on Pickett Chase Hunter commits his third that is five on Clemson you gotta move your feet that time he just he banged right in to pick it yep and you can receive that blow West but you cant give it Hemingway in Chauncey Wiggins out for Brad Brownell foreign Music Applause Pickett again Pickett lowered the shoulder turns and scores Applause a dozen now for Jalen Pickett on his sixth field goal well Brad Brown now has a problem because somebodys got a guard dread and that is Hunter Tyson and that leaves Chase Hunter against Pickett and that hasnt worked well all night long Tigers trying to set something here on the perimeter shefflin would tend to shoot bounce pass for Tyson double team coming Hunter fall away from the Baseline shot you cant defend that any better than Penn State just defended it Tysons made some big plays here in the second half tigers by four Hunter Tyson all seven of his points in the second half Chase Hunter trying to defend Pickett keep him in front and a travel on dread dread is a little bit frustrated Wes he said he has only attempted one twopoint shot all year and that time he tries to get by Hunter Tyson and travels with the ball speaking of Hunter Tyson hes not only doing the job on the defensive end that is a very tough shot with one of the best defenders in the Big Ten right in his face yep lockdown Lundy did all he could right absolutely under eight we go here Dylan Hunter on the floor here to replace Chase Hemingway a catch and shoot thats what he does well you can see that coming he made a great cut all the way across the lane seven point lead biggest of the night for the Tigers inside Pickett draws the foul on beetle Applause and Clemsons events eventually gonna empty all their Wares trying to stop Jalen Pickett but theyre getting shots to go down and theyre defending at the basket tigers with the ACC Big Ten challenge presented by Continental Tire Virginia Tech a home win last night Pittsburgh a very impressive Road win at Evanston against Northwestern were underway with three ball games at this hour two in the second half and one at the first half break out in Champaign but this has been a very entertaining interesting basketball game West as we have watched each team make adjustments to what the other teams are doing well yep and particularly the Clemson defense in the second half they have limited Penn State to one for eight threepoint shooting Music Two Shots here for Jalen Pickett who is 83 percent on the year 10 of his first 12 these are his first free throws of the night Im picking and Lundy are the two guys who go to the line the most for Penn State and Wes you mentioned before they only make an average of seven free throws per game and he only got one of the two and they are now five of eight tonight at the line or the Nittany Lions well the other thing is that the Clemson offense has been very good here in the second half Tyson thrown pass just beyond and he gets there up and under on the reverse nine all in the second half for the grad student Hunter Tyson now even when it doesnt look perfect theyre still able to convert lead is to eight largest its been for Clemson Lundy and a whistling foul will be ticketed to shefflin here its his first its the seventh on Clemson and that is the third time the Tigers have fouled a threepoint shooter yep and Seth Lundy to the line for the first time tonight to shoot three and here is the tail of the tape with free throws and where they stand with both these teams first one good from London well West you can see now Penn State has six free throws Clemson only with seven tonight but the Tigers have sort of made up for that because each team has seven threepoint baskets and Lundy very comfortably has hit his first two hes got a dozen tonight a year ago he had three games of 20 or more he hits 64 threes the only reason I share that number with you is he had 15 coming into tonight hes added two more hes on Pace to Rattle the cage of that 64 about February hits all three cuts it back to a fivepoint tiger advantage back door cut him in way of the layup pass from Tyson well Funk was trying to anticipate Hemingway doing that cutting like he did before for three and Hemingways surprise him and went back door him and way hes got 11 first double figure game of the last five back door cut layup Funk at the other end well done by most schools Funk does the same thing to him thats just great movement without the basketball really good delivery on the pass Andrew funks got nine five in the second half heres Tyson up top against Lundy rolls back into the lane kicks out for Hunter Chase on the drive with a right hand sheplin tried to keep it alive last Touch by the Tigers Applause so an exchange of back door Cuts here Dan well youre right in Hemingway just fooled Funk and Funk this time he cuts back door Hemingway got caught up a little bit on a screen under six to go hit the winner Hunter fell down back for dread thats an air ball Lundy tried to save it couldnt Dred comes in Wes is a 53 freethrow shooter he sets the screen normally hes automatic but he shot an air ball there and now all of a sudden we got theyre trying to wipe up the floor well then Hunter went down out here on the right wing right before the dread three attempt and so a little housekeeping takes care of that Applause Clemsons offense has been a big key for them here in the second half and theyve got to keep it going Ive been able to get better shots than they did in the first half Music Pickett picks up Chase Hunter pretty good match up here Hunter the Up and Under wont go sheplin trying to keep it alive dread kept it alive for Penn State thats a great defense sure is weve seen really good examples by both schools at both ends tonight Pickett rips it in the corner to dread hell take off Baseline Applause no chance Jalen Pickett on the drive pushed it up draws the foul foul is on shefflin its his second its the eighth on Clemson and thats a problem when shefflin has to switch out on Pickett because shefflin simply cant move his feet fast enough to stay in front of him so Pickett whos got 13 in the ball game sheplans got three fouls eight on each School Pickett drops the free throw in Dan this guy was the 2020 MAAC player of the year after being the 2019 rookie of the year for the Siena Saints and then transferred to Penn State last year and continued the pace but hes been very impressive tonight West every time theyve needed something hes been able to produce 15 points six rebounds five assists thats a nice play by shefflin to save that Hunter crosses over spot up wont go oh a tough night for Chase hunter from the floor hes over 10 Pickett out of the corner Lundy the three six and a half 16 in the game for Seth Lundy and were tied at 58 Applause Hunter trying to find a seam here Hemingway to Tyson and Lundy commits the foul on the drive third on Lundy nine on Penn State so one and one coming for Hunter Tyson and theres Pickett he gets into the lane forces Tyson to come and help and that leaves the wide open Lundy nice response by Penn State a 70 run West yep and just were talking about how they havent made any threes they made three free throws after being fouled on a three and then Lundy just hit a three boy these guys keep the pressure on you they can reduce the margins pretty quick Tyson takes his time at the line front end of the one and one is good Hunter now 1923 at the line in this young season 12th in the ACC and free throw percentage at 82 percent coming in and obviously Wes in a game like this these are all very important opportunities looking for his 11th Point all of it here in the second half and he gets it Applause twopoint lead and so the problem for Clemson is the problem theyve had all night what do you do with picking Galloway draws the assignment this time now get some help from Hemingway Pickett burrowing in kicks out winner step out three spins out Hemingway The Rebound boy Cameron winner that went halfway down well I bet Clemson did a nice job forcing him to change spots he wasnt able to get the catch and shoot he had to dribble and move that ball was all the way down no Tyson got it boy thats a confident looking shot in Midwest 14 all in the second half for Hunter Tyson three and a half to go Tigers back in front on five in a row and well get a foul there I believe on Tyson thatll be his first so well have free throws for Penn State when we come back but hunter Tysons put the last five in a row on the board for Clemson here tonight in the ACC Big Ten challenge Music he is fivepoint lead and Hunter Tyson has been the story of the second half for Brad Brownells Club Wes I thought at the end of the first half he changed the defensive tempo of this game when they put him on Jalen Pickett right and I thought he was very disruptive and then thats amazing hes got 14 points in the second half and West in addition to those 14 points in the second half hes also got and of course this is in the game not in just in the second half but hes got seven rebounds hes got three assists hes got a steal and he has continued to do Stellar defensive work yeah the seven uh rebounds three have come here in the second half the other thing too is the Tigers leading scorer in a eighth best score in the ACC is hitless and 11 field goal attempts tonight Chase Hunters got two points theyre all at the free throw line and the first free throw for Cameron winter of the night is good plus its hard to believe that Clemson has a lead with three minutes and 28 seconds left in the game in a game when Chase Hunter is over 11 from the field second for winner is good for winter has made big contributions threepoint game Chase Hunter on the floor with Hunter Tyson Ian shefflin Brevin Galloway and Alex Hemingway shuffling with a strong move on dread with a left hand left it short dread the rebound he got in the way with a walk there at the start of that move but I think thats a good play you got to attack dread on the inside heres Pickett looking for Lundy dread gets it to him step back three Lundy the rebound got his own Miss and scores shuffling didnt block him out Wes eight and a half for Lundy 18 in the ball game Penn State to within one were in under the threeminute mark when Lundy just chases the ball Applause shuffling calling for it with Dread defending and with 14 to shoot ball got knocked Away by dread after Lundy rebounded his own miss here you know shefflin just didnt block out I mean he kept his feet but he just didnt block out Music heres Hunter Applause entry pass for shefflin turns with a right hand and a foul called Applause and he got hit on the elbow Micah Shrewsbury thinks miles dreads third Dan thats 10 now with 224 to go on Penn State so two shots on every common foul and Ian shefflin whos two for three to the line first Music Applause six points three rebounds tonight for the sophomore from Loganville Georgia you know all those injuries we talked about in the first half that PJ Hall has suffered the Silver Lining last year and early in this year has been Ben Middlebrooks and Ian shefflins participation rate right absolutely theyve been able to get minutes they might not have otherwise received twopoint game ticket driving on the Baseline Galloway there skip out three dread nope you know his night Tyson hasnt had a excuse me Chase Hunter hasnt had a very good knife but neither is Miles dread theyve sort of canceled one another out Brad Brownell will use a 30 here with 203 to go and Miles dread makes his way to the Penn State bench knowing he had a look to put his Squad in front Hunters had looks tonight Daniel Wright both of those shooting stars have not been able to knock down shots yet in the ball game you know Chase Hunter came in as a 60 percent threepoint shooter and hes missed both of his threepoint attempts tonight dread came in 53 from Beyond New York hes now over five yeah miles dread had hit 23s and seven ball games Chase Hunter had had 18 threes in seven ball games but both are hitless tonight from behind the arc Music if youre Brad Brownell Dan you had enough one in two possession games a year ago to last you a decade Micah Shrewsbury had enough twopoint games to last him a coaching career in year one at Penn State absolutely they were 09 West in games decided by two points or fewer and then you come into this year and what was their only loss Virginia Tech by two points yep Applause Music so 203 to go Applause Music heres Hunter against Pickett well theyve gotten big baskets from Hunter Tyson here in the second half and Chase Hunter with 15 to shoot now dread defends Hunter on the drive put it up didnt go but draws the foul thats four on dread I believe Music 148 to go couple of free throws for Chase Hunter Hunter just takes the ball hard to the back this is good he got bumped a couple of times you know I mean that was as close to going in as anything hes had tonight yep Music Redshirt Jr knocks the first one down Applause a year ago Music he averaged nine points in conference play kind of a slow start with some injury issues its both here but thats any strong in conference yes he did hes a good ball handler hes a good passer obviously he can shoot it even though hes struggled tonight fourpoint lead 100 seconds to go funka Fall Away front rim miss it grazed off sheplin had it Tyson rolled to the deck did he hit the inline I believe he did itll stay with the Nittany Lions and a fresh 20 with 90 seconds to play Applause boy shuffling just cant hang on to the ball and he rolls out of bounds yeah nice piece of officiating there Dan well thats really a tough break for Clemson shefflin and Tyson bounced off one another and they werent able to control the ball Galloway defending Pickett pick it turns it rolled off the iron sheflin finally Gathers thats a shot Pickett has made all night long and a really good rebound by shefflin nice defense without fouling fourpoint game with just ahead of a minute Applause and then Clemson trying to milk the clock this is fine as long as his score Hunter for Tyson wide open got it seven point game pick it on the drive and he scores like the Shrewsbury was trying to call a timeout was trying to call a timeout before Pickett pushed the ball up to court so Jalen Pickett drives the floor to cut it to five and I think the issue here is did the clock stop when its supposed to when its under a minute its supposed to stop when the ball goes through what a big basket a huge shot I mean good grief Music so 446 left theyre gonna put 454 so eight tenths of a second back onto the clock well in a game yes eight tenths of a second could be critical Tyson wide open team played with a lot of boys on that possession too Dan but watch Lundy push the ball excuse me Pickett push the ball up the court and its its supposed to stop when it gets in the in the within the cylinder all the way down used to be it had to be all the way through the net but thats not its got to be in the net so Penn State has brought Mahaffey under the Florida pressure the inbounds pass Music now Galloways got to dribble out comes to a stop and Brad Brownell punches that time out with 386 left because there was about three seconds left for Clemson to get across the midcourt line well and now what that does with that time out it costs you time out but you buy an extra 10 seconds right so Clemson has one left Penn State has two left right Clemson has one left West and if they wanted to they can hang on to the ball in the back court again call another timeout Music so fivepoint lead for the Tigers how about this by the way eight days a week from tomorrow night Penn States next game is Michigan State at State College Clemsons going to turn around get Wake Forest on Friday night deacons by the way are in Madison later tonight as part of this uh ACC Big Ten challenge slime its almost like launching conference play now right well you know when youre going to play 20 conference games that you sort of have to yep Applause so the Nittany Lions are Going to draw some backcourt pressure here on the inbound pass Mahaffey will defend Galloway weve got another 10 seconds to get it across and here is putter for shefflin Ian will break the timeline and is fouled thats gonna be two shots and its on Pickett its his third so a pair of free throws here for Ian shefflin tonight is three for five and its a fivepoint game Applause first of the two is good so its still a two possession game with 34 seconds left six in the game for the young man from Grayson High School in Loganville Georgia listen think about this you got PJ Hall you got Ben Middlebrooks but the guy that got the end of the game and again Wes is a two possession game yep heres winter hes going to drive it and Hunter got a hand in there and Hunter came from out of bounds to inbounds was the first guy to touch it and therefore it stays with Penn State well he can do that if he gets both of his feet on the ground but he didnt jumped from out of bounds this is a really good block and he just jumps from out of bounds hes out of bounds and jumps back in West if he doesnt go out of bounds intentionally as long as he gets both feet back in bounds he can handle that ball but he didnt get both feet back in bounds well the second half for the Tigers has been sparked by the grad student Hunter Tyson Dan and here in the last few minutes hes been terrific quite he sure has and we showed you that he didnt score it all in the first half although his defensive effort at the end of that half against Pickett I thought was important for Clemson staying in the game but in the second wow hes had open shots hes had contested shots but hes made them all 17 in the second half six of eight from the floor you see the eight rebounds and and even assist as well for two in the first half so hes made all six of his shots here in the second half and the game is six points with 23 and a half to go here we will send you to Madison when were done tonight or Wake Forest in Wisconsin Louisville Maryland Syracuse Illinois also underway Georgia Tech at Iowa and of course Virginia and Michigan tonight the late start over on ESPN from Ann Arbor and by the way theres a whole calendar against tomorrow including that Blockbuster we showed you with four ranked teams going out one of the high State at Duke and North Carolina at Indiana yep so Pickett is going to put it in play in the corner this is dread he misses they battle inside Lundy had it in a foul on shuffle Applause fourth on Ian shefflin 10 on Clemson so two free throws now when dread misses another one Wes yep six point game I dont and its Lundy whos shooting the free throws here well hes a god once a reasonable one yep I dont think Penn State will have too many games this year where Dred goes over from Beyond no they wont and likewise Clemson right with Chase Hunter yes 18 tonight for dread make it 19 Music so now dread comes out and Mahaffey goes in because if they cant get a steal they got to look for a foul thats it dread has four fouls Music fivepoint game and the second one good so 20 now for dread 10 in each half you know I think it was me I try to make Chef shefflin handle the ball and then give him another chance from the free throw and hes at the other end heres the lead and the catch by Galloway well thats a dangerous pass but it is a perfectly placed back Tyson Rolls by and when he does his winner commits the foul its his fourth Tyson Rolls by and looks at Galloway like I got it to you I mean that ball left his hand I thought oh my Heavens this has to float over that hand that is a heck of a pass Galloway just missed the front of the two Applause Brevin playing in his 108th college game tonight 75 at the College of Charleston 25 last year and he missed the free throw there thats an 82 freethrow shooter Wes fourpoint game heres winner hes driving for the two and Galloway fouls it third on Galloway with 124 left two shots for Cameron winter and all of a sudden the Tigers cannot keep the Nittany lines out of the lane yep this comeback and Penn States extending the game along the way yes and theyre getting back in the game from the freethrow line sure are something they rarely do Applause first one from Winter is good and Wes you know Clemson has helped because theyve missed some free throw thats it Cameron winter knocks the free throw down Penn State is 15 of 18 in the game theyre 14 of 15 at the line in the second half Dan just to cut it to two now and he does you know theyve gotten some loose balls theyve gotten some rebounds but Clemson had the chance to get Tyson in a double team and theres the Penn State foul with 106 left and the foul is on Pickett its his fourth Music see the Clemson number they came in at almost 75 percent with their 1321 tonight and heres another 82 percent freethrow shooter at the line yeah and Hunter Tyson quite frankly needs to make both to make it a two possession absolutely so here is Tyson whos been terrific for Brownells team in the second half Applause first of the two nope front run Miss West Center and here is dread that is three consecutive missed free throws by 82 free throw shooter now miles dread has not scored tonight its a twopoint game with 106 left Penn State has one time out as does Clemson to make it a threepoint game made it here is winner you win the game 93 of the time if you dont foul you win the game 94 of the time and what that means is you know you just got to play good defense and not make mistakes given their Acumen though and given the artillery that Penn State plays with Dan does that change your logic at all here I I think in this situation if you foul Wes and Im a big believer in this if you foul you bring losing into the equation got it yes you file he goes to the line for two free throws but if he makes the first one misses the second one they make a three you lose the game the Nittany Lions have threes from Lundy and winner in the second half they are just two for 15 from behind the arc and Dread is not in there to shoot a twopoint shot no hes not Clemson has a lineup on the floor that theyd be comfortable switching one through five here going to pick it hell catch skip funk for the tie and its gone 52 left in bounds here is Hemingway three two Hemingway for the win were going to overtime Applause Andrew funk who has hit a couple of incredible threes tonight hits one to send it to overtime we are tied at 71 in Little John the extra session is next a dozen tonight for Andrew funk but his last three his second of the Night comes in the waning seconds to get us to overtime well Wes if youre not gonna foul you have to defend three you dont have to worry about the two Pickett took the ball inside and that doesnt make any difference at that point because the two is not going to tie the game and somehow Alex Hemingway I dont know how he got so far away from Punk now to be perfectly honest its a Fall Away banked in three no no we have that or Pauls got 13 he and Jay are talking to one another so 13 for PJ Hall and the last bucket put Clemson ahead here in the overtime I think this hasnt been really surprised if PJ Hall got a technology heres winter and is that on Hunter it is and thatll be four on Chase Hunter Music so there was the exchange yeah and the officials jumped in and stopped that so 17 tonight for Cameron winter including four in a row at the line and a chance to tie this up after the fourth foul on Chase Hunter and the roll friendly for winter you know for a team that doesnt get to the freethrow line a lot theyre 17 of 20 from the line tonight well let me tell you this in the second half in the overtime they are Dynamite because they were 16 of our 15 of 16 in the second half they are now 17 of 18 in the second half in overtime Dan well I think he can point to the freethrow line just as much as the threepoint line yep 73 all Applause right heres Hemingway Galloway revving on the drive skips it for hunters three and it drops in first field goal of the night for Chase Hunter with 408 to go in the overtime Wesson of course it bounced on the rim before it went in Jose averaging almost 17 a game hes got seven now hows that for confidence though youre over 11 youre open you still take it keep tanning swinging my man Pickett out for winter and Hunter is going to be called for his fifth Applause and Chase Hunter fouls out of the ball game with 3 45 to play in the overtime and seven points Music well Hunter trying to defend the three but then he did right in front of the official he just moves his body into the offensive player finishes one of 12 from the floor Wesson and that play you have to consider that in light of the fact that thats one of the points of emphasis for officiating this year they dont want to allow that kind of contact so here is winter who just hit two free throws a moment ago back to the line after Hunter fouled out and Cameron winter true at the line hes really been impressive and here you got to respect the three he gives that fake and then just uses his strength to turn the corner Hunter you gotta understand you got four fouls let that one go winner coldblooded at the line yeah thats a word for it eight for eight all in the second half in the overtime and Clemson still clinging to the onepoint lead Applause Beetle who replaced Hunter a moment ago were a big spot for beating yeah and played 10 minutes in the ball game heres Galloway at the foul line Brevin Galloway now with nine on his fourth field goal now Galloway is a guide throughout his career hes been able to score picking with Beetle defending Beetle plays the three make it four as hes ticketed there hes just pushing him you just cant do that well and heres the other thing too Dan weve talked about this tonight Picketts size and physicality he forces you to make a decision right as a Defender he does West but if you hes hes 20 feet from the basket hes out by the threepoint line you dont need to push him here you know move your feet stay in front the more he dribbles the more chance there is he might make a mistake but to put him on the freethrow line and if youre going to follow him you got to follow him closer to the basket than that 18 for Pickett Penn State is five for five at the line here in the overtime and the second one good make him six for six Applause one point lead again for the Tigers Applause well dread is in the game Garden PJ Hall lets see if they try to get the ball to hall because dread has four personal fouls Tyson with the entry there is Hall with a left hand left it on the front rim and now Penn State a chance to take the lead now dread put that big body there and trying to run something for drift maybe here huh yeah dreds only six foot four but hes 235 to get a nice job holding the hall away from the basketball team to shoot for Pickett all trying to keep with him pick itll take it on the drive burrow around Fall Away tough shot Jalen Pickett now four in the overtime 21 in the ball game Penn State in front Applause oh what a hardfought game this is Timeout Brad Brownell with 221 to go Applause Jalen Pickett has put four in a row on the board Penn State six of six at the line and now the Nittany Lions with a onepoint lead date in front 7978 were in the overtime here but it was the final minute of Regulation Dan where the thing really turned well Clemson was ahead 62 excuse me 69 to 62 was 51 seconds left in the game Penn State closed on that 92 run and they were able to do it because of Clemson struggles from the freethrow line yep Chase Hunters fouled out of the ball game Josh beetles filled that Gap and now the Tigers looking to regain the lead with Galloway 10 to shoot for Hunter Tyson and now Hall to work and a block on dread he fouls out miles dread is going to finish the night scoreless with 207 in the overtime Music and this this is a really nice job by Hunter Tyson to get the ball inside you know dread trying to match up hes only six feet four hes got that 235 pounds get tangled up there with Hall and now again going to the freethrow line all three for five PJs got 13 in the ball game two in the overtime and a chance to tie and potentially put Clemson back in front Music first one good 13 now Applause Wes theres still over two minutes left in this game theres a lot of time yep just think Carolina and Alabama played four of these Jokers on Sunday second one no good so were locked at 79 and as Dan Bonner just told you two minutes to go well if youre the Clemson Tigers and youre looking back on the game if you lose the game there you can point right to the free throw line yep no question here is Pickett with Tyson trying to stay in front of the Penn State Star Fall Away good what a tough shot Jalen Pickett has got six in the overtime and 23 in the ball game and the last two shots hes made have hes made have been over PJ Hall they were very very difficult chances 8179 feels like Clemson might need a three off Mark for Brevin Galloway and now with 120 to go Dan the Nittany Lions can dictate the finish I thought they had a chance to throw it inside to Hall Galloway elected to go for the three Pickett playing with four Clemson needs a stop here yep pick its been tough heres winner eight to shoot working with beetle Cameron winner on the drive a Fall Away front rim Miss run down by Beetle Tigers dont have numbers must score for the Tigers in this situation the clock has just stopped and Lee Cassell and Ron groover well its the same thing that happened in the first half the clock stopped I was I was actually watching at that time at 474 seconds it just stopped yep so so you know after the last time it happened Jeff Anderson came over and said hey the next time the clock stops let us know and I I said I didnt realize this stuff you guys did yeah so lets take a look at this and see what we can surmise now Beetle runs it down and watch as it gets to 474 seconds hes just gonna stop and Lee Cassell blew the whistle almost immediately so somewhere in the neighborhood of 42 and a half yeah I would say so four or five seconds yep and you drop that down four or five seconds off the shot clock as well so that would take the shot clock to 19 game clock to about 42 boy Nittany Lions have three with 20 or more tonight Pickett Cameron winter and Seth Lundy and tell you what this game was determined though on a three ball by the Bucknell grad transfer Andrew Funk here hes falling down and he banks it in yep what a pass by Pickett too and Hemingway just got caught up on a screen there funks got a dozen but again Wes thats everybodys going to talk about that play but its the missed free throws yep that allowed that play to happen thats it Music so 457 and 23 on the clock 25 freethrow attempts but seven points difference in the conversions and a terrific second half in overtime at the line for Penn State who is six of six at the freethrow line in the overtime after they finish the uh second half 15 to 16 Applause Micah Shrewsbury just said both of us need better clocks heres beetle out front thats a three boss offline and last Touch by Penn State Music and theres under two minutes in the game so the officials can review it if they want to yeah it looked like ticket and Hall were inside but Jalen Pickett is kind of come to the bench thinking that hey theyre going to find out that this belongs to Clemson well move on Pickett was the guy over there he certainly knows yeah who hit the ball last yeah Hall might have hit it but Picketts left hand I think is the last player to touch it Music come to think of it you and I were watching overtime in the ACC Big Ten challenge last year with a Wake Forest in Northwestern Dan yep and I think I think Pickett is the last one to touch it and interestingly Wes I think he touches it with his left hand yep you know he hit it with his right hand and Hall may have tipped it but then the ball is going to go back off the left hand of Pickett and the thing is it was called Clemsons balls so they have to have indisputable video evidence to overturn it and they do not that is exactly right and as you say when Pickett came back it kind of knew very well yeah Pickett was kind of saying hey I think it was off my hand so Applause 20 to shoot 387 to play but Wes its not surprising in a key play in the game whos in the middle of it for Penn State its picking yeah quite fun player to watch huh Beetle got to get it in bounds does to Galloway and we got a foul on Jai off the ball against Hall and just hanging on to hall because Hall I think had a lane to the basket and now here we go again Clemson at the freethrow line bottom line is PJ makes both of these there might be just two possessions left in this game Dan because youre in Penn State you want to wind it down as far as you can go dont you well you do but you also you dont want to pass up a good shot 14 tonight for PJ Hall Applause and all your strategy now is dictated by whether or not he makes this one thats it hes five of eight from the line tonight second one got him and here is Middle Brooks to replace PJ Hall Middlebrooks is in there for defensive purposes yep middle Brooks is a little bit at this point with Hall being not a hundred percent middle books moves a little bit better tied at 81 here winner against beetle Applause winner on the drive all the way in right hand takes the lead six in the half or six in the overtime and 23 now for Cameron winter well if its not pick it thats doing that back down its been winter particularly here in the second half Applause and I thought the Tigers played pretty well defensively again these guys can really shoot the three you have to be conscious of that I think middle Brooks you know he he kept looking back at Jai and I think you know if Im middle Brooks Im more worried about winter than I am about Jai but he elected to stay with Jai and so theyre able to make the basket 207 to go Music and Brad Brownell I think hes going to take a time has taken the time out and Dan the question here becomes if youre Clemson youre at home are you looking two or three are you looking the best shot well I think youre looking at the best shot with but the key here for Clemson is youre behind if you were tied you would hold the ball for the last shot but since youre behind you have to take the first good shot thats available to give yourself some time in case you missed so you see Clemsons got Paul Tyson Beetle Hemingway Galloway on the bench and Micah shrewsburys got Penn State huddled up dread has fouled out winner and Pickett will be on the floor with four thats important to remember with Clemson at the offensive end of the floor as well the Tigers have Beetle on the floor with that foul TJ Hall is back in West as you mentioned and so he is an option inside to try to tie the game uh and Hunter Tyson has played very well he just missed his last three but he is also a guy who can give you a threepoint shot Im thinking youre going inside the hall for the two or youre going to try to get either Tyson or Hemingway open for a three and if youre Clemson too Dan knowing that Penn State has the youngster Jai on the floor here at the end you might give yourself a little cushion with the clock too on the shot you dont want to wind this all the way to zero dude no no no no no you you take your first good shot yep Music you miss you gotta I think you gotta foul jobs thats correct well any other these guys eight of nine at the line but he scoreless tonight hadnt been to the stripe Music so Lundy is going to drift into the backcourt well Jai is also a freshman yep so yeah hes eight of nine but how many free throws has he taken in overtime to win the game correct inbounds to beatle Lundy drops back okay you gotta move heres Tyson now 15 seconds set the screen for Hemingway looks inside for Hall backing down Jai with a right hand and scores Clemson bench wanted to foul they didnt get it with 42 left and Mike tied at 83 Michael Shrewsbury thinks they need to add some seconds back on the clock Music so PJ Hall on the entry pass Music this really well designed play right here you got to get out and cover the three so theres nobody there to cover Hall Applause so it is 42 and we play Detroit does a nice job getting positioned Applause and there was contact there but the main contact was his like his clavicle up against the chin of John theyre trying to figure out how much theyre gonna put 57 on the clock Music all right well now Wes of course if youre Penn State you want to take the last shot but its not like you have 15 seconds to try to get it you got to get the ball up the court quickly and Clemsons got to go defend the 94 feet here Clemsons got to defend the 94 feet and they have to do it without fouling and everybody on the floor except the Freshman Jai his threepoint capable although Kevin missed one earlier tonight hes one for four from behind the line this year if you can you want to try if youre Clemson you want to make Penn State catch the ball headed toward the Clemson basket dont want him to catch the ball running toward their own theres Pickett front court with three two launches at the horn off the back iron and we go double overtime tonight at Little John and youre the one who had to mention the four overtimes 83 all come on Dan cacc Big Ten challenge five more minutes 83 all now were at Clemson and Penn State great to be with Dan Bonner West Durham our coverage of the ACC Big Ten challenge presented by Continental Tire how do we get to overtime number two well we got to overtime period tonight because Andrew Funk hit a bank shot at the end of regulation Dan now falling down in front of the fans over there hits a bank shot Kevin way got hung up on that screen by dread so dread didnt score but that was a great stream so how do we get to the second overtime well PJ Hall had something to do with it so did Robin Galloway and 180s one basket of the game before he fouled out and down at the end of the overtime the first overtime Pickett was outstanding hit a couple of shots over PJ Hall Music winter of course hes played extremely well he has 23 points this is really a welldesigned play you got to guard Hemingway on the outside you get it inside to PJ hall now Im telling you Pickett had a really good look Music Applause but was not able to make the shot so the game stays tied Penn State went double overtime a year ago against Iowa its been eight years since Clemsons gone double overtime 2014 a 7773 game against Mark hurricane in Maryland well Wes and again we pointed out before the first overtime the fouls are going to be an issue yep the two stars Pickett and winter for Penn State both have four heres Hemingway catching shoot from the top and its good first points in overtime either one or two for Alex Hemingway hes got 14 Tigers jumped to a threepoint lead and that ball last Touch by Penn State says Ron Gruber you think about Hemingway Dan pretty cold blooded off the top here isnt it well Im telling you Cassie is really good coming off that screen with the catch and shoot he barely had time to get his feet set yep that is a huge basket threepoint lead heres Hall at the top Hemingway skips Fall Away Galloway Paul tried to keep it alive tapped it to Winter Wes again I think that was the wrong shot Hall had positioned inside winner with a high dribble boy lucky Pickett ran along and caught him they did playing with four trying to tie cannot Tyson the rebound Hunter Tyson has really been terrific had a great game defensively offensively Applause beetle trying to get Hall integrated in the half court set Beetle the scoob got knocked to the deck Jai the rebound so Clemson emptied the last two trips now Penn State another crack at a time Clintons empty West but that neither one of them was a good shot Pickett rolling on Galloway look at the runner by funk 14 now for funk his first points in the extra sessions Penn State to within one well I think I think you got to ride PJ Hall here on the inside Music Tyson entry pass for Hall BJ gonna take Jai into traffic and we get a reach push that on and the foul I believe is on Jai its his third its going to send PJ Hall to the line to shoot a pair hes got he had seven in the first overtime hes got 18 in the ball game to go with nine rebounds Im sorry with uh three rebounds tonight Hunter Tyson has 18 points and nine rebounds BJ to try and push it back to three first one good boy he made some big free throws at the end of that first overtime Applause by the way the cats out of the bag PJ stands for Paul Jr took about three years but we finally got to the bottom of it hes 785 Applause and Applause well Wes were nothing if not relentless well just try to keep providing relevant and important information Funk Lundy here is Pickett again driving the ball skips it in the corner thats Lundy for the tie terrific shot Seth Lundys got 23 now thats his fourth three of the night locked up at 88 Pickett winner and Lundy each with 23 for Coach Shrewsbury and how good has Pickett been passing the ball yep Applause there goes Tyson on the drive blocked by Jai itll stay with Clemson with 11 to shoot Music this is created by the dribble penetration and Galloway just gets too far into the lane PJ Hall was in there Galloway didnt need to be heres petal seven to shoot looking for help got to get rid of it heres Hall with two Fall Away got it Big Money Ball from PJ Hall twopoint lead for the Tigers 208 to play Harris Pickett squaring up on Tyson six to shoot block beetle get the ball to PJ Hall at the end of the shot clock he takes his time really good patience and then Beetle hes really an athletic guy bunk for three it hit the top of the glass before it then dropped off the rim well now at the end of regulation thats the one that went in the basket I mean to tell you Wes he landed on in their bench yeah hes got terrific shot balance doesnt he and the one thing you have to say about these guys theres nobody out here whos afraid nope heres Hall at the top picked up on the dribble one to go to Tyson Galloway now for Tyson against Lundy Hunter rolls with a right hand and got the roll dramatic seventh field goal of the night for Hunter Tyson whos got 20 the lead is four now with 77 seconds Pickett on the drive feeds Jai got blocked here is Galloway with Beetle Brevin the layer kick it ahead quickly six point lead a minute to play in the double overtime and Shrewsbury called a timeout before the Lundy threes how about Josh Beetle two really big block shots Hunter Tyson didnt scratch in the first half but hes been something in the second and the two overtimes Clemsons got a sixpoint lead Penn State the ball when we come back were in the second overtime of this ACC Big Ten challenge game and Dan if you had Josh Beatle in blocks tonight I dont know what the over under was but hes delivered here in the second half in the overtime well when the Clemson people talk about Beetle they talk about his speed and his athleticism and his instincts and you know hes hes a guy hes not shy hes not afraid and that was the first of his two blocks the second one we showed you but those were both huge defensive plays in this game yep now if youre a Clemson fan before you get comfortable with the fact that theyre up six with 59 and a half seconds well just reminds you they were up seven to 51 seconds left in regulation winter and pickets stay on the floor both playing with the four fouls and here is wenner On Cue trying to drive beetle and fouled by Beetle and that will be his fifth Applause its four for beetle it will be four so four for Josh beetle and two free throws for Cameron winter well and if its not Pickens as we said its winter wearing them out inside and again if youre Beetle you simply have to move your feet try to stay between winter and the basket and make him shoot over you winter is eight for eight at the line tonight four for four in the overtimes and making five for five in the overtimes and nine for nine and look at the free throw numbers for Penn State they finished regulation after a 15 of 16 second half they were six of six theyre now Dan 23 of 26 in the ball game at the freethrow line West End coming in in their first seven games they made a total of 49 Music theyve made almost half as many free throws in this one game as they did in the previous seven Mahaffey in the ball game hell defend the inbounds pass from Galloway heres Tyson against Lundy spins out of the double team and fouled in the backcourt Evan Mahaffey The Freshman from Cincinnati and I think thats what mahapi was in the game to do so thatll send Hunter Tyson to the line to shoot two Tysons got 20 tonight with nine rebounds Music but its just three for four at the freethrow line and that was in the second half again its very eerily similar to regulation question is can Clemson make the free throws here Music Applause come down and heres middle Brooks for Hall and this is a defense offense kind of substitution Middlebrooks is going to come in to play defense and the first chance they get theyre going to put Hall back in on offense hopefully Tyson ready second one good yes its significant that Beetle has four personal fouls because Penn State is going to attack him kick out Johnson a three how about that fifth three of the Year second of the ball game for Johnson down to a threepoint game heres the lead Tyson the catch a double team arrives out of it to Middlebrooks and a foul quickly by funk his first of the night but Middlebrooks is just 104 at the line Music well Wes we talked about the fact that Penn State has seven guys who are shooting 39 or better and Johnson is one of them yep and again that thats the way they want to play you get the ball inside kick it out for the three six for Johnson that was his second three of the night heres middle Brooks first and its good pretty confident stroke for a guy who was one for five prior to that Wesson I thought Hunter Tyson you know he started to call a timeout and then changed his mind and Middlebrooks hits them both I think that was a good decision fivepoint game inside 30 seconds heres winner with beetle in the four fouls kicks it out picket the three long rebound they Scramble for it him and ways got it well you got to get rid of it he tried to but he was fouled first and it was Johnson that commits the foul Music so Alex Hemingway is going to go to the line Applause that ball comes off and Penn State had a chance at it they had two blue shirts at the ball Hemingway misses the first Hemingway six out of seven from the freethrow line coming in so he didnt get there very often Music trying to push it to six second one true hes got 14 in the game 18 seconds left Penn State will be looking threes winner bumped and fouled by Tyson Dan Im okay with that Music because theyre going to shoot free throws Clemsons going to have a chance at The Possession Applause well Wes Im actually not okay with it okay you know and and Tyson he just got caught up on the screen and stumbled and committed to foul Winters been perfect at the line but if theyre going to score Wes you want to make him score and have the clock run now of course as soon as the ball goes in the basket the clock is going to stop but here it stops lets him go to the free throw line 25 for winter and a miss okay so now Im okay with that five unbelievable absolutely thats why second guessing is always so accurate Applause now if theres a Clemson Tigers you got to make sure if he misses you get the rebound Applause second one good by winner and thered be a lot of pressure my hafey will be on the ball Galloway to put it in play does to Tyson and Hunter fouled right away by Lundy thats his fourth so Lundy joins Pickett and winner with four and Hunter Tyson back to the line hes working on a career high tonight of 22 and all of it has been in the second half in the overtimes well and Wes the interesting thing is hes shot the three well hes rebounded the ball hes been good on defense but here in the second overtime hes been the guy theyre trying to get the ball to when they throw it in bounds first of the two against Clemson the century mark yep I agree with you Clemson has put Dylan Hunter on the floor so Tysons the biggest guy out there by a long shot for brown Elm but this to take it three possessions right yes there it is all you have to do is defend the three now and thats why the smaller guys are in the game you dont care if they get two out front winner with six heres Pickett misses the three Tyson kept it alive Johnsons got it and the horn sounds and Clemson wins a hardfought game in double overtime Dan boy thats some performance by these teams Quest wow ACC chalks up one in two extra periods of free basketball great to be with Dan Bonner thanks to our producer Rick Bagby off to Madison
