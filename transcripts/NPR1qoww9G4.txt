about backto back 20 win Seasons with an weight Forest win its been a long time since that has happened here at wake youve got to go all the way back to 08 09 and 10 Notre Dame wins the opening tip keep an eye on three if you havent seen it Marcus Burton the leading score in the Atlanta Coast Conference hes had backto back 30 point plus games and that first shot off balance and off the mark and here comes wake the other way well and if they can make him a jump shooter thats pref able and look for them look for way fors try to get the ball out of his hands as much as possible Salis all the way to the bucket and cannot connect so each team of possession were still scoreless well noted in because of injuries and wake just because of how theyre constructed uh not a lot of Ben bench depth for either one of these teams and theres a turn over by Notre Dame this is a sophomore Ty Johnson he runs a point for Wake Forest Salis and hildr are the big time scores for this team but theyve got other guys inside like him Trayvon Spillers he really has blossomed hes another guy whos come through the portal and uh played extremely well very athletic but gives him a presence on the boards and inside and hes got another year of Eligibility he is a transfers senior from appalachin Applause State cuz theyre losing a lot off this team their their three big guns if you will Salis Reed and hildr all leave at the end of this year and another turnover for the Fighting Irish Lan jumper and kin tski comes away with a rebound for Notre Dame well and the thing for Notre Dame yes youre going big you want to pack it in but this is a lineup hasnt played a lot together so timing has been off here look at theyre just they theyre going to commit to get the ball out of Burtons hands nice little pick and roll right there and finishing is Kev Jai the transfer Jor from Penn State theyre waiting for him to Blossom we had a long conversation this morning with Coach shuberry about ji he committed to Penn State when coach ruseberry was there and then came with him from Penn State to Notre Dame good block underneath yeah he and uh he and Davis a nice Duo up front no real Center but you know good size try the Al and Burton able to at least get in the way to prevent it and this a and Spiller is a guy who can climb the ladder too maybe that lob a little bit too low Notre Dame comes in 12 and 16 trying to avoid what would be a third straight losing season that hasnt happened in South Ben since 1919 through 1922 its a very very young team shot clock at one and answering the Bell from the corner is Tay Davis here second leading score he does most of his work inside really bailed him out I mean you could see the just a lot not a lot of ball movement for Notre Dame people standing around and uh was a big time shot at the end of the clock DAV is not a bad threepoint shooter for a player 610 will fade away by Salis in the lane and knocked out of bounds it belongs to the Demon Deacons youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands what a Saturday its been here on the CW we had that wild one Syracuse in Virginia Tech early at xinity racing from at Atlanta and now rounding out the day with ACC basketball hildr the feed underneath tough shot under there by Spillers will go if youre looking with this lineup out there for Notre Dame no real threepoint shooters or threats except for Burton and uh you know Davis may have to take a few more of this game oh thats a nice gliding power move by Davis and he kisses it in hell go to the line good start for the Irish thats WWE NXT the baddest brand in sports entertainment the best female division this week Smackdown Chelsea Green and Piper nibon going toet to Toe with s Ruka and Zaria when you go by one name you know youre big Zaria thatll be Tuesday 8 Eastern 7 C you only need one name right Prince somebody somebody coopted mine Michael some guy named Michael Ive heard of him I saw him in concert thats how old I am back in the old Jackson five days Oh you mean Jordan yeah come on Im kidding Im kidding yeah yeah yeah well we got the more conventional lineup out there for Notre aame now lets see if their offense responds but uh I think Mike is shury just wanted to give wake a little bit of a different look with that big lineup to start yeah its tough to argue with what that gr did through the first nearly five minutes of this game hildr kisses it in boy what a role he has been on senior grew up of course in England hes averaging 22 points per game his last six outings yeah now hes hes really given them a secondary score and uh also more of a primary score guy played last year most of the last year with a broken wrist healthy this year really strong battle for the rebound and tipped out of there to Notre Dame Burton passes hell go to the hoop and misses a tough shot he got hit went to the deck no call now wide open three for Burton and he still has not scored in the game actually got some very good looks off of those offensive rebounds this not able to Applause convert wake having all kinds of trouble finding the basket here early on they went through a really spirited walk through it wasnt really a walk through today about 1200 well they know theyve got to go to Duke on Monday night I mean that is a Monumental task as well as duke is playing this season and the kind of team the Blue Devils have once again maybe the best team theyve had under John Shire of course well see what kind of tournament run that means cuz theyve had you know one really good one under Shire since taking over for Coach K well and also some injuries uh there as well which could affect Applause them two for 10 to start the game for Wake Forest and you know when youre not shooting the ball well a three like that especially from Spillers is not a great threepoint shooter you know I dont know that thats what you want got to try to get a more qu quality shot inside get something going to the rim ball belongs to Notre Dame some of the numbers just the finals from earlier Clemson had to come back to beat Virginia they trailed in Charlottesville a lot of that game North Carolina starting to play better five wins in a row for the Tar Heels the wild one we talked about in overtime at Castle Coliseum and then Georgia attack well theres another team that uh yeah ups and downs no question about it but could be dangerous when we get to the tournament well and for North Carolina I think the the uh sense was they had to run the table in the regular season which theyve done to this point of course the big game next Saturday against Duke that was a massacre the first game in Durham of course uh next Saturday that game will be at the dean Dome at Chapel Hill so far uh pretty good transition def defense by Notre Dame not giving up any easy baskets Sal just cant find the bottom of the basket hes got some decent looks too Burton and its swatted away got it back and Roper into the lane another three ball and another Miss noted a starting to fall in love with that threepoint shot well but at least the thing is theyre getting a lot of the 5050 balls and a lot of offensive rebounds here early not a good Applause tone thats the first time Ive seen Frederickson miss a shot today during warmups he hit everything in sight but the old saying goes regardless of sport what time is theres Burton left hand in a beauty you know you talk about keeping him in front and bottling up and then you actually get on the court and its a pretty tall task he is so quick with the ball and only a sophomore is Marcus Burton grew up in Michel Waka Indiana which is a town over from South Ben into the lane and hildr finds the bottom of the bucket and cam hildr may have to carry them here for a little bit hes the only effective offensive weapon theyve had hes only shot twice made them both Salis is over for four and Spillers is one out of six into the corner and draining the three checking in for the first time just a minute ago yeah Cole Serta actually had a great game against pit played a big role in that win last Saturday gets off to a great start yeah he can shoot it if you leave him alone hes got more and more playing time over the back half of this season Applause Savvy move by Burton that would be a two shot foul hell go to the line when we come back an excellent start for C the Fighting Irish up by six tiebreaker goes to State and you have six teams ranked in the top 25 yeah and the women have been taking care of business and uh you know as far as the league and its Applause reputation Burton hits one out of two Duke earlier in the week beat North Carolina that was a matchup of top 20 teams but we saw the lady Fighting Irish a couple of weeks ago at home against uh Stanford man are they good checking into the game for the first time miss most of this season with an injury is the sophomore Omaha Baloo he comes right in puts one up and boy it is still quiet offensively six points through nine plus minutes and Tom you know I dont know that that Steve Forbes can complain about the shots I mean theyve been you know theyve been right at The Rim in the Applause lane heres a takeaway and Johnson will lay it in he tried to bait Burton into a foul that time slowed up a little bit to let him catch up but uh good he just picked his pocket right in the open court only four out of 16 Notre d started off redot but its really cooled off now five out of 13 and change that for Marcus Burton yeah I mean hes a guy that uh you know you just got to play the percentages with him and and I still say youd rather see him be a jump shooter than let him get into the lane but that is a thats an area that hes improved in from last year really good ball movement but it was stripped away and able to recover and lay it in is Ballo young man who was a Iowa high school player of the year a season ago did not play much his freshman year and has been injured almost this entire season with a foot injury and this will go the other way well and with him back at least it gives Steve forb some options out on the floor and gives them a little bit of depth I mean theyre theyre starting five plays heavy minutes I mean both hildr you know hildr up over 30 minutes a game Salis is 36 minutes a game not a lot of rest well you got Reed who just check back in hes at 30 youve got hildr at 34 you talked about Salis at 36 Johnsons at 24 and then you got Spillers at 33 its a lot of minutes from your starters it makes you wonder Mike is that why maybe weve seen them you know sort of let down here towards the end of the season right well I think you throw you throw the minutes in with a trip a weekl long trip out to California and uh its like an NBA schedule closing in on 915 to go in the opening half heres Burton there are three white jerseys around him on that defensive possession wouldnt you be are you kidding somebody else beat us cats averaging 20 to a game to lead the ACC and hes gone over 30 in backto Back Games whats going on there whats going on there well epton Reed has barely touched the matter of fact Im not sure hes touched the ball at all theres a three way off the mark by Salis and really a possession that went nowhere a lot of dribbling no player movement no ball movement and a tough shot epon Reed coming off a double double 12 points 10 rebounds and a loss to Virginia and a whistle inside like to remind you of final weekend of the regular season a week from today CW Courtside Saturday NC State in Miami you and Ill be right back here at Wake Forest for Georgia Tech then the NASCAR Xfinity series Roars into Phoenix that all begins at High Noon Eastern nine Pacific only on the CW Tay Davis at the free throw line hes now two of two from it a 75 shooter tell I really like him and you know the the thing that you know just hitting that first jump shot outside really sets up the best part of his game which is attacking the basket and drawing contact and he you know its its its been him and Burton and they just because of injuries theyve really been searching for that third guy yeah Bren Shrewsberry was the third leading scorer averaging 14 per game aggravated it and the lost to SMU that abdominal strain and they just decided to shut him down for the year thats not the shot that wakes looking for again theres you know just not a lot going on off defensively a lot of movement and then youve got to settle with Reed whos a 24 threepoint shooter Davis hes feeling it Oh What a Beautiful move by Tay Davis and a timeout for Steve Music Forbes 10 points through better than 12 minutes and its a 10point Notre Dame lead and um some really great teams in the early 2000s and um Skips wife Nancy was here during the actual ceremony they had last night and theyre not theyre just the you know theyre playing center field off of Reed just daring him to shoot well this is where he ought to be getting the basketball and good defense and a shot nope traveling before he let it fly he had decent position but then got forced out got his feet mixed up some of the fans wondering how theres only one foul called against Notre Dame through nearly 13 minutes of this game but I think U these officials are right on it and a late call there Burton did get bumped Welly hes such a Savvy player we saw that from Chucky hebburn last week you know a guys behind you you stopped you know theyve got momentum heres the look yeah I mean he just once he gets you on his hip like that I mean youre really at his mercy and I you know i make the comparison of Patrick Mahomes to him just y extending plays waiting for something to happen keeping his dribble alive and that is the mark of a fighter indeed brought to you by Modello thats a tough attempt right there by Logan eyeses and Salah still looking for his first points of this opening half and just lost a handle theres Burton trying to get another one coming down in transition the three is no good so till a 10point lead for no Dame 6 40 to go and the thing that Notre Dame has been able to do is not let them get out in the open court and run what a Follow by J Carris and hell go to the free throw line to attempt a threepoint play The Freshman from down the road in Salsbury yeah this was it was looking like a a rebounding drill out there with with wake force on the offensive end but uh nice job St with his shot getting the foul but Tom six of 22 0 of five from three and these are the first this will be the first free throw of the game for wake fors you know coach Forbes was saying yesterday said look this young man has had a solid freshman year he said you know people talk about Cooper flag in his freshman year well thats Cooper flag he said this kid has really had a nice year mhm yeah no you know gives him six 18 minutes six points three rebounds shoots it pretty well scored over 2000 points at Salsbury high school thats good defense there by Wake Forest something they have not played here recently its a big reason why theyre scrambling to get into the tournament get it right back to hildr pump fake hell go to the rack and thatll count and go to the line you know heres the thing way Force makes fewer threes than anybody in the conference you cant go for that pump fake youve got to invite that shot even though the guys been playing extraordinarily well you cant jump at that and give him a lane think they got J for the foul there and now hildr looking for his seventh point out of the first six for a wake so that trims the lead now down to four yeah and is uh as woeful as the offense has been theyre very fortunate to be in this game at only four points well Notre D has gone Stone Cold we talked about how well they started Johnson just hounding Burton gets a takeaway and Salis with authority and a Time out for not D Bo this crowd was just begging for a play like that to come alive Mark of the fighter moment brought to you by Mello and this again they are just swarming all over bird great hands right there Johnson the nice pick and one of the few open court opportunities that Wake Forest has had maybe thats something that uh gets Mr Salas untracked he has had such a fantastic career he leads a team in scoring at 19 a game transfer from Gonzaga First Team all ACC performer well they will miss him at the end of this season well the thing too about him thats been impressive last three games gotten to the line 27 times uh so you know mixing things up attack back in the basket wouldnt characterize him as a a great threepoint shooter hes right around 30 well hes fourth in the conference in scoring and hes seventh in the conference in field goal percentage so he knows his strengths he doesnt take a ton of Threes hes taking it to the rack pulling up for jump shots and more times than not hes making it well and its you seen the turnovers Notre Dame has really got to keep the ball out of the corners especially up top thats where a couple of those turnovers theyve got to try to keep the ball in the middle of the floor as much as they can well the Demon Deacons have been very good on the road in fact better wonder where will they be the net ranking at 70 seven and seven in Quad one and quad two games you know as things now those those two home losses really a set back I mean theres no way to you know to tap dance around that I you know I think think theyre going to have to make a pretty serious run in theend in the ACC tournament you know barring you know a win at Duke would be Monumental yes if they win a Duke theres a good chance youre getting there yeah and thats you know thats if you you look at it its one of the few opportunities that they have to get a really all right this is our Marquee win well theyve lost 25 in a row and Durham theyre due Applause all right so the jump ball possession arrow gives the ball to the Demon Deacons with a chance to tie the game or even take the lead thats stripped but a foul by Roper the second and that is only the fourth team foul against Notre Dame like a shuberry has had to you know really battle through so many injuries his team is so so young with a great recruiting class coming in next year his son we brought up Mike Braden Shrewsberry out for the year and Salis have fade away to tie the game yeah hes back in Rhythm right now but you know you I think the real big injury for them was Matt Al the their point guard a grad student an older guy who was running the team and not having him that took that takes a lot of pressure off Burton with him on the floor yeah hes a 45 threepoint shoot and into the lane a soft touch first bucket for Jr kesn yeah really not a shot blocker out on the floor on either end so you can feel pretty confident getting into the lane but that was a nice little pullup floater shot clock down to 10 theres hildr coming off a screen and not going to be there closing in on four minutes to play in the opening half Notre Dame on the road leading by two and thats a travel on KES you can see one thing a wake is really doing well is pushing that screen up the floor its giving their guys room to get through and stay with Burton couple of substitutions will get Trayvon Spillers back into the game replacing Eon Reed Burton will get a breather seems like both of these coaches Tom are committed to getting guys some rest at least for shorter periods of time theres been a lot of bodies coming in and out get our first look at sir mohamd he grew up in Charlotte and a three ball and dont look now wake finally has a lead yeah and a lot boy is hildr really held them in there early when nothing was working for him and he continues as high shooting that was a wide open look 132 Run for the Demon Deacons to take this onepoint lead ases lost a handle and Johnson rolling the other way he finds in the corner hildr who wanted to take it and now Salas into the lane in and out thats the thing with wake I mean with with the group out there right now I mean hildr is the one threepointer shooter Youve Really Got lock in on thats why surprised he passed that up although the pass was a little late he was open and Johnson took one more dribble into the lane thats an offensive foul thatll go against Tay Davis so 254 to go in the opening half and the home team has awakened thanks to hild shooting team especially from three and and thats where you know wake is susceptible if you come in and you know they catch a team like that whos rested and you know theyre theyre capable yeah we asked coach Shrewsberry you know was that sort of a a blueprint for how you beat Wick theres an offensive foul away from the ball and that is going to be against J Carris but he said look he said you know in all honesty he said Virginia just has a lot of good Shooters yeah and we have guys at least arent to that point yet well I mean coachs son would be a huge you know I mean he he was in arguably their best threepoint weapon build with a rebound 222 to go until halftime heres Salis a rare three went down about a third of the way and pop back got there yeah I think given the run that they were on thats not the worst shot in the Music world kick it out to Burton wide open for three and you knew that was going to Second and left his hand yeah and well and Davis really created that whole thing he drew everybody in and Burton was wide open just a great penetration his ability to handle hildr goes right by certa and a TI in beautifully done by the Freshman Juke Harris he touched on a live body has a chance to be a really good Defender yeah coach fors really excited about Harriss future and theyre going to need him next year with all that theyre losing which we talked about earlier were tied at 25 shot clock at seven man can this kid take it to the rack wow this is some late heal coming over and actually Spillers is a guy who can block shots but you just you misjudge his speed and his ability to get to the rim and youre late most of the time hes got 11 in the game they swing it in the corner and in and out for Harris theyve had two or three of those here in the last couple of minutes and maybe settling for the three I you know its theyve had so much success attacking the rim Davis kicks it out to the corner in the second three ball for certa we talked about you know he guy like that hits his first shot and things open up for him oh my goodness and theres a turnover for the deepen Demon Deacons 4 second differential we invite you to stay tuned for our halftime show presented by Subaru love its what makes Subaru Subaru turnover by Spillers and hell go to the bench so give it up to Notre Dame I mean had the lead let it get away and now all of a sudden have answered to take a fivepoint lead I think you its interesting both teams responded well to their coaches timeouts you know the Steve Forbes first and then weight came out in a different mindset and Notre Dame has regrouped as you said all right shot clock at 20 and out there defending there was a time youd have a 5second call out here not only when you pick the ball up and you have nobody to pass to kick out of bounds and Burton knew it was off of his knee so 14 seconds remain until halftime youve got Harris Reed Johnson salth and hildr on the floor for we feel like youre calling hockey here well that was an offense for defense switch by mik Shrewsberry that was a give and go at midcourt and a foul and again theyre nowhere close to the limit at least in where we are in time thats only the six they had that one to give so uh you know smart play on on their part all right so now the S out of bounds play not sure what the hold up is here we go final 10 seconds of the half keep an eye on hildr after he lets it go go and they turn it Applause over to the basket no good 4 seconds left Salis passes ahead to Johnson and its rejected to end the half and how about Burton with the BL and uh I dont know if everybody considers me media but no they dont they they see that big blue devil on your chest no Im Im still Switzerland when I go there okay all right all Ill be wearing my CW swag okay all right all right here we go in the second half Notre Dame with a fivepoint lead of course next weekend will be our final weekend of coverage here on CW of Atlanta Coast Conference basketball and a foul on hildr strong move going up to the basket by Tay Davis hes given away a few inches in that match match up they cleared out a side for him but it was interesting uh Burton really didnt touch the ball at all in that possession theyre just going to all out front him as much as they can Davis three of three from the line in the game and make it three out of four youre watching CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands normally good hands at the free throw line for both of these teams Notre Dame at 75 set likewise for wake and neither one of those looked very good coming out of his right hand no not a bit I dont know maybe if he got Jarred a little bit taking uh taking the foul on the play sloppy with the ball there is Johnson he just got caught up in the air with nobody to pass to great head fake and then missing the layup underneath is is kesn heres Salis attacking the basket too strong this is how the first half started Davis had 10 points in the first half heres an isolation Play Down Low kesn had it batted away and now Burton shot clock at 10 in and out and he had to go chase up ball down to get it in his hands and not a trying to isolate guys on that right side of first few possessions Kon Reed did not score in the first half thats cuz this guy was doing all the damage well I just think to last year and what a benefit he would have been to this team and he not it was a broken right wrist he played through a lot of pain with that but it clearly affected his shot what KES coming out very active offensively yeah hes been very aggressive hes had good looks that layup was something you have to convert on the road in traffic and hildr will go to the free throw line this guy the mark of a fighter is hild brought to you by Melo yeah great toughness he sees hes got a bigger guy just theres no way you can stay with him he gets to that right hand terrific finish know that Im a big fan of that all of that just onehanded but he was able to pull it off like a little more ball protection this guy has been so good as this season has gone on nine of his ACC games this year hes had 20 or more points and we mentioned the last six games hes averaging 22 per game and a a very high a very efficient game here so far hes only taken seven shots they may want to try to feature him a little bit more in the offense in the second half Im just stunned that Reed doesnt touch the ball more I mean he hes given them some good minutes throughout his career but has not scored a single point in this game three white jerseys again around Burton and a three by Davis his second of the game and noted aim in front by four well I tell you the Fighting Irish have so much to be excited about looking ahead to next year you can say yeah theyre still playing this year thats true you wonder how long theyll last in the ACC tournament drilling the three from the corner the left hander Spillers thats only their second three of the game too from an unlikely Source but and you know the the question mark for every team out there Tom is whos coming back yeah you know what thats thats the the unknown factor and theyre uh theyre really praying that guy comes back a hes only a sophomore we mentioned he grew up basically in South Bend Michel wakas right next door they list him at 6 foot and thats a thats pushing it a little bit but uh bo is he quick benne bumps hildr now by the top of the key if youre looking for a Cable News Network that respects all Americans well your new home is news Nation see why news nation is news for all Americans to find news Nation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom threepoint game at least Notre Dames getting shots in this game only one turnover in the second half which is a big turnaround from the first 20 minutes well heres Reed well a couple big bodies banging down there good head fake lays it up miss it able to get the rebound the lefthander Spillers and missed Bo some point blank shots you you know and uh Reed did everything but finish that shot nice footwork good pump fake 3532 thats been their man the tube basically Davis and and then underneath and drawing the foul kissing it home is Kevin J the Junior from Centerville Ohio heres the look and you know we talked so much about Burton but a lot of things are breaking down when uh number seven gets into the lane I mean he just draws all kinds of contact good second chance opportunities for Notre Dame Roper checks in multiple substitutions for the fighting Iris and Z trying to complete the threepoint Play Short no credit Davis I mean with all the attention on Burton and hes hes probably the second best ball handler they have out on the floor trying to get it to Reed and a jump hook thats his first basket he thought he was fouled well you wanted to you wanted to see Reed youve been getting it hes been getting touches inside that was a very decisive move look at this guy look at this guy and he finishes off the you see what he did though he the quick little burst he gets you on his back he slows up and then he figures out whats ahead of him hes got 15 at the 1527 Mark Play Just when M Wake Forest will make its runs Notre Dame is able to answer that was short and hild stayed with it well done well that was a Zone look by Notre Dame that time and hildr is a great guy to have in the middle of that zone he leads all scores with Applause 16 wide open Lookout there by kesn he cannot connect and now Wake Forest a chance to tie with a three ball and a turnover by hildr lot of sloppy ball handling on both sides today yeah those unforced turnovers really hurt another isol yeah see thats the respect that Davis is getting now and a take away for the Demon Deacons hild the one who pulled it out of there Johnson gets hung in the air and down at the other end three bodies were tangled up now theres some jaw going on you initially had Davis and hildr hildr got out of town but then Reed and Davis that Burton can break you down and Davis they draw tension off the dribble that you know that should freeze some things up for him on the offensive glass all right so here we go Notre Dame 1421 to go leading by three a game Wake Forest cannot lose Reed is just playing center field defensively helping out wherever he can not worried about his guy rer in the late thats a nice move with a left hand by Julian rooper The Freshman out of Boston he comes in averaging two points a game so any any offense from him is going to be a big lift yeah they wanted to get him some minutes here today to defend the man hes guarding right now Salis rer for a freshman has a terrific body why he is being very physical with Tas too and Steve Forbes wants a foul of 10 beautifully done by Reed you know I I think Notre Dame for right now is going to live with that theyre not going to come down and double team Reed although hes been successful wow can you believe that can you believe that splits Defenders and then kisses it off the glass not only that absorbs the contact too and makes a tough shot but there was no space for him to get through and he somehow found it the accs leading score now Salis cant find the bottom hes having a rough night Sal is just two for 12 in the game Fade Away by Roper and hes come off the bench and you mention hes doubled his game average well and those are the guys in this game when youve got guys who are down Serta comes in in the first half gives you six points with a couple of Threes And and now its roer sort of coming back in I mean thats 10 from those guys your lead is seven Johnson gets bumped from behind by Burton heres that move a moment AG go by Marcus Burton I mean look at that just you throw the ball through get through the double team and theres really nothing that hildr can do it was fortunate he didnt pick up foul on that play for right now I mean this this group may be the best offensive team that Notre Dame has out on the Music floor beautiful pass and slamming it home is Spillers boy great great delivery by Frederickson to on that nice solid bounce pass sundra checks into the game for the Fighting Irish theyve got Salis defending Burton here now they switch off and look for a double team and it left sundra all alone and he lays it in you got to I mean you got to choose something and youre going to be locked in on Burton and that just left a wide open layup that was off the foot of Serta and a Timeout on the floor Notre Dame leads by seven with Under 12 to go looks to be the perfect compliment to what was around or not around this area no doubt about it great use of the land football stadium right across the street and it will be spectacular just some some unforced Errors By Wake Forest three to third I mean Spillers dropped that ball it went out of bounds and Steve Forbes couldnt jerk him out of the game quickly enough 4740 1130 to go Lake for is needing this one desperately knowing the Duke is on the horizon Monday Night final game of the year Georgia Tech here on Saturday of next week the season finale Burton from the free throw line nothing but net you know when hes got a live dribble you cant attack him with two people how many times has he split Defenders and gotten a shot boy he is just so quick with the ball hes got 19 points he was the ACC freshman of the year last year and right there rer smacks it away but he smacked the arm of Salis who will go to the free throw line to shoot too and they need uh they need Mr Salis to come alive here in a hurry uh he is had a tough afternoon as you said two of 11 and you know for the type of player he is these are his first free throw attempts of the game talked about the you know the the run that hes been on in the last three getting to the line so we look ahead to next Saturday we start with hey its an ACC tournament appearance on the line NC State taking on Miami and then a two right back here wak and Georgia Tech season Al on CW Courtside Saturday beginning at noon Eastern both free throws by Salis and that makes it a sevenpoint Notre Dame Applause lead wake for us with a zone now different look for them defensively and Notre Dame not reacting well to it initially oh boy that looked and Steve Forbes better be very careful dangerously close to picking up a t right there after the call against tirth yeah he got his arm I mean that you know and the reach in I think that was a decent call in real time it looked like a good defensive play but I think it was a good call and you know Steve Forbes may be wanting to get a technical at this Applause point third foul for Wake Forest Notre Ds been whistled for three as Music Applause well great bounce pass and a slam by kevi thats it all he has to do is shape up and be ready to catch the ball I mean everybody locked in on Davis and Burton on the drive getting good production out of him and that is precisely what coach rwry was talking about today that they need from ji remainder of this year and then the next two years and a bucket and a foul silly foul there by J and salace to the line the IR you know he had him stopped all right here a little late getting over there with the help but keep your feet just challenge the shot if he makes it fine but dont give him the threepoint play Salis with eight two of two from a Music strike long traveling through his college career Salis he goes from Omaha Nebraska to Gonzaga all the way to Winston Salem winding down on his spectacular career his team Trails by six in a game it must have into the lane Davis got fouled hell go to the line for two and thatll be whistled on juk Carris it was interesting Tom Notre Dame really looked uh a little puzzled with that zone and how to attack it Davis doing the right thing getting inside be curious now to see if Steve Forbes stays with Applause that Davis hit his first three at the line of the game has missed his last two both of those in this half we invite you

points at the free throw line but theyve got size back out on the floor right now Davis has 13 Burton leads all scores with 19 and hildr with 16 tried to add to it with a left hand and will you know its not the play Its the players and when you have a twoman game with Salis and Hildreth thats tough to defend and they ran it Applause beautifully but stops have been few and far between here for the Demon Deacons and chai to the basket and how about him it in talk another guy who is uh overperforming six points on the season HRI fouled by Burton dribbling into the Applause paint the only thing that now what wake what wake is doing that was a six te foul so the next Notre Dame foul theyre going to be in the bonus for the the rest of the game wake still has some fouls to play with yeah wake been whistled for four so Applause far and thatll be a seven foul which will put Salis in the free throw line so the one and one beginning here with 846 to go could be a big factor in this game talked about how good they are at the free throw line and thats you know the most of their offense built by the by the twopoint shot or at the free throw line only seven attempts for the Demon Deacons now eight eight for eight tomorrow double header of womens college basketball in the CW number eight Carolina hosting Virginia and then Georgia Tech goes to Stanford our season finale of CW womens Hoops tomorrow beginning at 2 Eastern Salis in a boat hes five for five from the line and its a fivepoint game salz defending Burton pulls up and a whistle F foul against the Demon Deacons what you know when we talked about Salas and hes got it at both ends hes having to guard burden and then score at the other end but look at theyve got the whole right side cleared out youve got to communicate to him and you know he hes got that much space its almost impossible to guard him oneonone Burton an 87 free throw shooter two of three today Frederickson will leave Johnson returns for Wake as Burton hits them both and the lead back to seven for Notre Dame I just Id like to see Johnson play a little more under control in this game hes gotten himself into trouble and that you know him out on the floor lets hildr and Salis roam a little bit and score ler Dame shooting 55 from the field in this game wake has had a hard time from the very getgo only at 41 read the jumper is good he has three buckets here in the second half yeah good spot up and again that was uh Johnson drawing the defender to him he gets a good Applause look shot clock at 10 Johnson is just in allout denial with Burton Applause shot clock at three to the basket this kids unbelievable simply spectacular is BT they kept it out of his hands for 26 seconds and he still scores Reed head fake and hell go to the free throw line to shoot two black T the more and more you watch this young man he is something else in this this this possession was dead in the water than for formula one down there xinity Notre Dame in this game shooting 56 nice Soft Touch by Reed he has seven in the second half you cannot begin to talk about how important this game is for Wake Forest I mean I know I sound like a broken record but theyre still kind of hanging around that proverbial bubble and this cannot be another loss especially at home yeah those and you know so much of what the committee looks like and tie up and its going to be Wake Forest Ball but so much of the committee looks at too is what you how you finished the season and they look at this resume I mean they uh theyve stumbled here down the stretch after they got wins against Carolina and Stanford you know they took losses yes uh Duke and Louisville one three straight thought they had their legs under them and now they drop three of their last four Spillers hit one of those earlier missed this time boy I dont know you know with if again Notre Dame youre happy about him taking that shot now theyve got hildr defending Burton Salis is trying to stay with Davis wide open in the corner kevi not there and theyre going to call a foul on Wake Forest Wow it looked like Salis was just boxing out from here theyre going to call it on Applause Reed and thats number four on Applause him this underneath out of bounds too is something that Notre Dame run runs extraordinarily well and boy thats a little bit of a cheap foul there I would say and that is the six team foul against Wake Forest so the next one in Notre Dame goes to the line Bo Burton cannot even breathe without a Defender but its disheartening you do it for all that time and he winds up at the ball thatll be a foul against Notre Dame underneath the basket after Davis missed an easy shot and theyll walk the other way we mentioned earlier wake in the one and one thats a ninth team foul against Notre D its a real well with Reed out of the game it is a very small team out there for Wake Forest and uh you know there other bigs not so much of a matchup issue but Tay Davis was a handful for anybody yeah they was saw a little bit of Belo in the first half and CER is going to check back in and give Julian Roper a breather roers giving him good minutes here today especially on defense and any chance that Micah Shrewsberry has to substitute offense for defense or the other way hes been taken advantage of Applause it spillers a 70 free throw shooter he has six points here in a second half eight in the game next foul by Notre Dame puts wake force in the double bonus so have to worry about the this is the last oneonone theyll be shooting and you wonder if that will be the difference between winning and losing especially the way wake shoots him wake has not missed a free throw rejected by Spillers great weak side help that time and Solace actually keeps his body on him which allows I mean this guys got a 40 plus vertical jump and great finish great help oh boy I mean it looked like Johnson was just trying to fight through his screen there and U hes whistled for a foul you know I Ive been Ive been watching the game and it seems like in the second half the the whistle gets blown a little bit more than the first half Serta to the free throw line for the first time in a game hes h two threepointers hes got a smooth stroke yeah he hasnt hes been there a fewer and 10 times on the season though missed a lot of time early and just started to you know get more and more minutes and hes given him eight Off the Bench today only a freshman isera Sera and J combined for 16 its pretty good yeah and then you throw in roers giving him four he averages under two theres hildr hes been quiet of late his third bucket here in the second half and its still a threepoint game with 530 to go well he understood the mismatch too he had J on him kept his dribble alive and J just gave up the Baseline lot of dribbling there by Burton try to stick a fork in it hell get it right back with seven on the shot clock and dribbles it out of bounds yep thats one of the few times in this game where he looked like hes been a little out of Applause control hes getting news its Stanford beats SMU today SMU and other team uh some costly losses asz they were very much playing like a tournament team and we saw them earlier this year three ball it goes down J Harris has been a big Lift Off the Bench yeah and that was a huge emotional basket for a away course theyve been climbing this mountain they finally tie it up well the last time they made a big run after a 10point deficit Notre Dame settled down and push the lead back up to five now into the lane and Davis will go to the free throw line you know its interesting that it looked like Burton gave it back to him and said I need a little bit of a break here you take it and uh D Davis so good at breaking it down off the dribble boy Davis trying to catch his breath I mean Davis and Burton are getting a lot of minutes out here today yeah well and uh you know Mike both coaches are trying to give guys rest when they can offense the defense but you know those those Burtons going to be out on the floor Davis five of eight from the free throw Applause Music line and make it five out of nine wake with a chance to take the lead hildr lays it off and it will not go down for Harris but lost out of bounds by Notre Dame D couldnt come up with the easy Applause rebound kantowski checks back in remember Eric Fon Reed is on the bench with four and were at the 422 Mark Salis working on Roper spins into the lane in and out and able to tip it out of there is Spillers well great job keeping it alive there were three bodies around and wake has a lead as the veteran kisses it in Hunter Salis time out on the floor get the Salis to go in and get the basket Salis with 13 hes four of 14 from the field hildr leading the Demon Deacons with 20 the amazing Marcus Burton leads all scores with 23 and Tay Davis with 14 and now hildr well theyve had four different players guarding Burton throwing different bodies at him I tell very aggressive offensively is kesn and he is still only had one first half field goal hes had some good looks Zas demanding the ball defended by Cades and a three ball didnt even catch iron no I thought his Defender fell down thought he had a good look but that was not Applause close its an interesting match up with Applause HR heres ser Off the Mark battle for the rebound and last Touch by Spillers so this is our under four timeout a onepoint wake for 160 years this is a its been a battle man hildr and Burton back and forth all day but I tell you what I mean thats thats a quiet 20 points I mean he is really played within himself not taking a lot of shots Burton I mean its just hard to take your eyes off often so uh so aggressive so crafty with the ball and a quick inbounds play I tell you Notre Dame really executes their underneath out of bounds extremely Applause Music well and you know you play I mean youre one of the alltime greats in the history of the ACC you play longer than a dozen years in the NBA youve been around a lot of coaches Im not going to say it makes you a great coach but but but when you see certain teams play and theyre out of bounds or their side out of bounds and some of the plays they designed its incredible stuff I always felt that its very similar to uh special teams in football you know to CU those are places you can execute and get plays and sometimes defensively a team may fall asleep all right theyre just going to get it in bounds if you use it as a scoring opportunity especially underneath out of bounds boy and for as good a threepoint shooter as hes been he has been Way Off the Mark today you mentioned something his his first couple attempts did not look good I dont know what happened yeah I Im with you uh he just I dont know if he hes maybe injured cuz hes a 75 free throw shooter and he has had a tough time of it here today from the free throw line six of 11 both these teams know all about tight ones down the stretch Notre Dame six losses by six points or fewer this year wakes been muddy and kissing it in is hildr how is he rolling right Applause now well talk about the ability to go both ways go left what a tough shot with the left hand too with contact boy this young man is playing so well right now the best basketball of his career and its been an outstanding career right now wake looks a little bit fresher than Notre Dame does in these last couple minutes hildr now with 22 look at him he is some kind of fired up his team has its largest lead of the game and hes got number ready oh yeah well they missed a wide open Kevin G and heres Burton and hell go to the free throw line is this going to be goal tending is my question when did Spillers make contact with that ball it looked like a good block I dont know the contact came a little late Applause yeah youre right about the Applause block yeah I Applause mean it looked like Spillers just went straight up in the air you already have Reed whos fouled out so Burton at the free throw line well to their credit the referees are letting the coaches Express themselves on the side sideline I mean Steve forb was apoplectic after that play thats a big word thats a Duke work yes sir sorry thats a Duke work that means he was mad thank you very much thank you for the Ohio University version of that for the it down for the Cincinnati guys thats right d it down I cant say that D it down for the Buckeyes heres Salis pulls up and hes muddy down the stretch so far Alis and hildr he has 11 in the second half and then back the other way once again its Burton this guy is a free throw shooting machine and just running downhill what hes doing now hes putting his head down early in the shot clock and just attacking the rim third in the game is five of six on a strike he has 25 the good thing is though T Wake Forest in really good shape as far as personal fouls are concerned and we reads out of the game but nobody else has more than two and Burton hit them both to make it a onepoint game and theyve been two minutes to go and theyve been able to save that because theres been four different bodies on Burton so its not been one guy heres Salas Roper back in to defend defend him for the final two minutes of the game and heres hildr working on kesn loses his footing and stays on his feet Fade Away shot all right can Burton answer at the other end wide open and laying it in and once again is Kevin ji he has 10 you want to get the ball out of Burtons hands but not on a direct pass for a layup its boy J hes found a way to play in this game boy this is tight rope wire War walking right here now thinking about a three Johnsons not going to take that we have one minute to go in the shot clock at five hildr gets fouled behind the threep point line with three on the shot clock by kesn you want to know why both of these coaches dont have any hair this is the type of oh just you got to have awareness get a hand up and challenge that youve made him settle for a jump shot just let it go so hell shoot threes four for four from a line in the game well what a huge foul that could turn out to be it was a onepoint Applause game and youre giving an 82 free throw shooter three free on Applause H all of perfect from the line 17 to 177 fourpoint game 48 seconds remain and thats a silly foul away from the ball thats a last thing in the world that Steve Forbes wanted because youre putting Notre Dame at the line and stopping the clock thatll be a a twoos shot foul Applause well I dont know how you call that a foul thats just a guy trying to get by a scen well and you know thats the thing we worked on uh today at shoot around and um at practice just thats what Notre Dame does and they wanted to fight through it lets take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom well what a run this kids on his last six games averaging over 22 points and hes done better than that today 28 big ones you take 14 shots and you score 28 points youre not going to get more efficient than that my friend that just allows other people to get in the scoring column as well well the last time we had Wake Forest on CW he went for 31 we be very happy next weekend if they get yeah no kidding I tell you I mean here you know you think about these three guys who wont be coming back next year for week this team if they win today backto back 20 win Seasons a Wake Forest they havent done that since 08 09 and 10 and you know our back in our day 21 Seasons youre going to the tournament but how badly do you think a guy like hild and Salis and Reed they want to get to a NCA Tournament game first free throw is no good wow K 6 67 on the year bad foul still makes this its a onep possession game and they dont have to Music foul all right is a one possession game notame and now Notre Dame wants a timeout yeah they had that foul on hildr with three seconds left yeah he got three free throws thats the spread in this game right now three points try to trap hildr with a ball in his hands going to spin out of trouble Mich yeah Michael shry saying no foul theyre going to play twoman game hildr and Solace theyve got Logan Imes guarding hildr Applause switch off five on a shot clock Salis in the lane and Notre Dame with a Chance 17 seconds left down by three and theyre looking for a timeout and they get it all right youll see some substitutions here now theyre going to put uh Applause certa does check in the game as well for Notre Dame and heres Burton oh and hildr just runs right over him and they talk about the worst of all things to happen 4 seconds going off the clock put him at the line makes two its a onepoint Music game well this sophomore and right now if youre Notre Dame youre looking at it say you want to get the ball into Juke Harriss hands if you can and foul him 56 he is eight of nine from the free throw line his next point will give him 30 and thats 30 or more points in three straight games take it to the bank all right onepoint game hildr will inbound the ball Id foul Johnson immediately if he touched the ball and theyre going to foul Salis all right we talked about it being perfect from the line 17 of 17 from the stripe is wake and Salas is five out of Applause five hter l Applause CLE will come back into the game after the first free throw this is a twoos shot foul one point Applause game transfer senior out of Omaha Nebraska the Demon Deacons leading score I think Steve Forbes going to take a timeout after this yeah he wants to call the timeout set his Applause defense wouldnt you I might put four guys on it thats exactly right all right threepoint game here we go and times with the basketball and a timeout 10 seconds to go and again the question you asked you originally brought it up the last time Notre Dame had the ball all right here we Music go youve got hriff defending Burton underneath they go for the lob swinging in the corner to Burton no good another three ball to tie and its short two seconds to go shot up oh just off the iron and Wake Forest hangs on oh my every one of those those last two looked like they were going
