paint 10 on the shot and its a hokey turnover defensive possession out of the gates for the Irish discipline keeping guys in front not baiting on those shot fakes and then ultimately gather the ball go the other way Irish going with both guy and Davis inside expecting to really pound the glass here is Davis and it will stay Notre Dame basketball you know obviously when you look at Mike young and Virginia Tech 385 career wins his fifth season with Virginia Tech and for Notre name Michel Shrewsberry in his first season with the Irish and an offensive foul is called Ted Valentine and there is michah Shrewsberry its been a difficult task in his first year on campus at Notre Dame seven and 16 trying to establish a culture Jordan yeah its its an Ever evolving process uh the coach is sticking with in a streak of losses still having these guys commit to getting better every day speaks to the culture coach Shys building Baron one three Baron got three from down thats an understanding that Booth is going to have to extend out defensively Baron is a stretch for that hunts that threepoint Applause shot Burton he is the star the Freshman nice pass inside Davis strong to the basket lays it up and Applause Music Applause in certainly expecting a defensive style ball game Pace wise JC kid on that ball got to understand the Doubles coming got to find a receiver and take full advantage nearly another turnover five on the shot clock make it three Collins is going to have to Jack one up in and out and here come the Irish solid work from K keep kid off the backboard as well hs not a great offensive rebounding team averages only four points a game and the H look to push Collins Couture oh book it Hunter Couture transition defense cly two Defenders run to the Handler in Collins and that leaves one of the better threepoint Shooters in the conference Couture to get his feet set and dial down 51 from three in ACC play leads the conference does Hunter Couture shry trying to create got away with the travel Applause Fade Away 15 foter good and pure now with 307 career threepointers that is the 13th player in ACC history to go over the 300 mark pulla and he finds the range from behind the AR we raining threes for the h Ill tell you what you cant take a play off you think youve got him in good position he lows you to sleep without a dribble and knocks it down you got to stay connected with a sense of Ury when defending P Burton inside and a push inside so clearly the Irish every possession pushing the ball deep into the paint on the other side the hes content to just let the three ball fly yeah the hes are very dangerous and and establish a true threat from the threepoint line whereas the Irish simply aside from Shrewsberry dont really have that threepoint Personnel coming in I said the Irish have to defend the threepoint line shots that maybe opposition other teams dont take H Thrive there it could hurt you kit out Po in Burton from Applause distance n94 early all of V offense has come from behind the arc P nearly traveled Baron trying to create and potit Off the Bench and good Baron did a good job with the aggressive Drive getting some attention from a couple Defenders allowing po to catch a finish shry catch and fire from distance ring threes Applause atth again draws the double its Couture wide open Hunter Couture the pride of Holy Family Catholic School in Orlando cannot miss the Orlando sh is in the building I love it pulla drove two Defenders and swung it cross cour all of that action started from pulla to get the Defenders and swing it over great set up move from the guard GI side beautiful play from J average is only four points on the catch composure on the delivery sometimes gets SP up good cerebral move from the big Applause fell again 270b dribbles it off his leg but right now Virginia Tech comes out red hot on a cold night in South Bend firing from distance 149 see basketball youre watching ACC basketball on the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve and a great crowd here on a Saturday night on the campus of University of Notre Dame the fans uh trying to get in this and right now and Notre hims got to try to find a way to slow down Virginia Tech from behind the arc defensively is where the Irish have been hurt here early on and most especially defending a threepoint shot you can say look the hookies are four or five from three nothing you can do about that but its how theyre getting those dribble drive driving kick not a sense of urgency being up on the line to contest Shooters thats an adjustment in the first five minutes that will need to be made from the IR and you saw head tohead Virginia Tech has won six in a row against Notre see if get Burton on track Notre Dames leading score Collins a masterful Defender shot clock at five taking it to the with theiling for boo is infinite this young man is still learning his body an ability to score from the outside and the and youre getting a glimp of what he can do in an IR un flips it up rebound and thats going to be a block on Hunter cout and he is in some pain yeah thats the right call from Teddy Valentine the great Teddy Valentine understanding that Hunter Couture initiated the cont thrust his own body into the Handler invaded his face thats proper call one to the ribs it would appear 63 200b 5 years at Virginia toughy on the floor ABS represent virgin Tech basketall hes Virginia Tech ining times in his career and actually hes going to have to have a seat here this is something to really put a circle around Virginia Tech losing their leader with 1419 in the first half and he is in driving pain on the Virginia Tech bench best defender one of your best shot makers and your leader Absolut and Burton respond here come Applause Irish you should coin that phrase it might be a little bit too late for Applause that again just second consecutive turn over trying to do too much absolutely just SP on thats always a problem of AIG its not a consistent volume score they get the basketball they move just a little bit too fast meanwhile on the other side Marcus Bur so cool to sheep count that young man when he sleeps Burton again keski hit its good off its just hard for Ks just come the games padul pump fake nich oh wow its another the H from behind the AR the ball movement is so Sublime the defense in rotation time and time again which has proven advantageous for Virginia Tech Notre one of the best defensive teams in the country and struggling early on nearly a steal by Virginia Tech but you look at the Irish and all their defensive aades second in the ACC in points allow 38 in the country but already for Virginia Tech seven minutes in 17 points yeah cuz theyve been able to move this game along they havent allowed it to play the Irish Applause hope again on the shot clock does he see it Burton will fire and here come the hes the other way Pula look at in Collins is stripped in another Virginia Tech turnover H nearly turns it over oh my Applause Music Applause good to Applause K and it will stay with the H so Hunter Couture is back into the G game for Virginia te a reminder Louisville and Syracuse couple of ranked teams coming your way tomorrow on the CW Hunter Couture back in the game for Virginia Tech dodging a bullet there that was a scary moment yeah absolutely and what do he means to this team they need him out on the floor tough guy you knew he wasnt going to be kept off for long Davis entangled as Davis tried to prevent Couture from coming off a curl screen and absolutely got to call that but it shows you the approach Davis is trying to be physical with Couture one defended re Steiner also into the game The Freshman from Georgia for Virginia Tech Music Collins and Couture nearly throws it away gets it back Fade Away jumper got it hes got eight early thats frustrating youre Julian roer you do a great job getting your hand in the passing Lane the opposite way right back in the hands of the Hop Virginia Tech very very small JC gets the friendly Applause roll as senior 69 from New York you know it really is a case of pretty good from both teams right now its not a lack of effort defensively its just High L execution and ball movement right now from both teams at this R the over might hit in the first half Applause JC and the Irish the other way R out of the gate look at the motion from the senior mat Z pinch is giv the Irish a lift without question and its been a good crowd here thats turned out Irish and Juice early on and Notre Dame takes their first lead of the basketball Applause game hins three I dont like that one from Collins I like that was a settled shot when your off has been hum work that ball around its been your for the h this afternoon Zona Five Points Off the Bench unexpected offensive punch from the senior rer into the lane try to create Applause Andes how about the offensive power here inside the joy Center were not 10 minutes into this basketball game IR do it a lot but right here got a good one here in South buckle Applause up Virginia playing High L basketball team nobody wants see the ACC right now that game coming up next here on the CW at Florida State in talahasse Couture eight quick ones for Virginia Applause Tech five on the shot clock Hunter drives to the Lane hes got 10 Couture with 10 a Virginia Tech 21 points here in the first half I hate what people call guys like Hunter Couture sneaky athletic dudes just athletic quick First Step blew by kesn had him on his hi kept him there the whole time to maintain the advantage in high L move from a guy whos played a lot of basketball Z airall oy down one Rex Steiner does getting to early burn here against the Irish beautiful move inside Jr kesn having himself a nice first half kzns at his best when hes slashing cutting driving trying to draw contact a physical winck no good Burton and the Irish coming the other way one on four pulls it out takes it in and I believe that will be Lynns second personal foul with 843 to go in the first half excuse me kid Marcus B Shifty drawing the contact trying to get in there and carve him up court side Saturday coming up next here on the CW Virginia riding that hot streak that you mentioned taking on high fly in Florida State Virginia at Florida coming up next only on the CW threepoint game here in the joy Center Iris with their largest lead of the game Burton thinks about it colls TR to lock him up instead there no call there Burton went crash into the floor lot of contct Applause Music g go with Collins oh my goodness po throws it down with two hands 270 lb in your living room when Burton went to jump I think the business decision mentality took over and said I got to get out of the way problem was its too late little fell potit with the punctuation 6927 Burton rattles out I missed did he move his pivot he Applause did now right now very up and down game high flying on both ends right here as the aash at the the Music r lets take a look look at the significant stats brought to you by JP Morgan wealth management and what jumps out to you the Irish have been very physical offensively theyve been in attack mode theyve gotten their stuff in the paint Viria Tech early on was able to open this thing up with thepoint line and really get going there its really a game of inside outside certainly the Hoke getting it done behind the arc and Notre Dame uh dominant inside as coach crry told for the game that they thought they might have an advantage Applause inside on Couture Pati draws a triple team and baron slides in for the reverse layup yeah was too late getting back in rotation to protect the rim when they initiated the double and thats a failed rotation which leaves your defense hanging which allows an easy deuce who thought about it and hell draw the foul inside but hunting his shot is Carrie Boo the Freshman 610 from Brewster Academy its been these taller hybrid wings for the Irish whether its kzn whether its boo they really done a good job of shot trying to attack the rip a 53 free throw shooter hell get two and make the Music first of course you are the alltime shot block leader in the history of Notre Dame oh of course because everybody knows thats Kerry Boos father the alltime shot block leader in history of Penn State Calin was heck of Aer boo makes a pair hes doing a heck of a job in the front office now and its another change Music again Burton drew the double open inside and a little too strong and thats where needs to grow on that need come over the other shoulder from the opposite direction to his side and finish too much time trying to rather quick catch go over the left shoulder and finish the baron again and now notra Dame sees theyve got numbers the other way the Speedy Burton incomplete control able to stop to die despite moving at the pace he was impressive for Marcus bton who continues to show new facets to his game the transition and the open floor is really where hes taking another step potit inside and he draws the foul so potit not known for his scoring prace certainly the hes have been featuring him inside hes moving bodies as a dive guy hes moving bodies hes carving out real estate hes showing two hands where the perimeter trusts to throw it down low to looks good on the first Tuesday on the season finale of inside the NFL the guys break down all the action and we live the sights and sounds from Super Bowl 58 Inside the NFL Super Bowl Edition Tuesday at 8 C only on the CW Now splits a pair does potit Irish by a deuce here under six to go entertaining first half on the CW Burton pull up does not get the friendly roll H can tie the other way Collins padulla its prot again P Elite job of just getting into the paint and once you do that theres so many options you coll that defense which was the right Aon pass from into the fourth R and once again wholesale changes for both teams surprised by the pace the scoring anything jump out to you not surprised because I knew this is an Irish team thats not going to give up on their season and they are markedly better at home even if it doesnt translates to wins Competitive Edge it has translated the gam a bit tighter and its a Virginia Tech team that is dangerous and theyve done it from three but these are two well coached groups to have more Talent both run great Robbie Baron will now play center for Virginia Tech going with essentially four guards including that guy not a true big hes kind of a hybrid guy so the match ups work Shrewsberry quick Catching Fire zous the rebound Davis inside didnt take it Burton tries to draw the foul and does catches Nel up in the air marus Burton just put him in a blender show an array of moves what hes got in the bag but what I love every time no matter how he might be wheeling and dealing he always comes to a composed offering before he delivers like look its all over the place gathers to draw the 80 free throw shooter is the freshman Marcus Burton averages 16 points a game coming into the game he was eigh all time in the history of Notre Dame as a freshman scorer and hell continue to that over the next month of the Applause Season where are you at on that list J dont worry about that thats some Antics nobody nobody needs to know oh Nick wow the North Carolina transfer trying to make the oldfashioned threepoint play and again right here just not in position on the close out not ready to defend and had tip to Nickel understood he had the advantage and that angle to get to the ri about 80 from the free throw line all net so Virginia Tech surges back into the lead ton of lead changes here in the first half back and forth we go Burton blocked by Collins boy oh they are going to catch Z with a push Ill tell you that is a heck of an effort from MJ Collins to get back into that play after being beat off the crossover not only contest but deflect the ball not only deflect the ball but do it without violating so Zona picks up his second he provided an offensive spark for the Irish with five Off the Bench and Davis play Couture has Davis thats a mismatch Collins nich oh and some emotion from Tyler Nicholl nicholls dangerous a a heck of a score com out of high school had 24 already in a h Jersey verson dont let himat up speaking Applause ofon blows the tippy Collins to the basket up and down and all of a sudden Virginia Tech opens a sixpoint lead like a snap of the finger they have the ability to score in bunches transition defense failed the Irish theirs Collins unrelenting getting to the rip its an 80 Tech runton Davis a nice offensive rebound dribbles it out has Shrewsberry for three instead its Burton for three rattles it in and Applause out danger time here for the Irish 80 Virginia Tech run nearly a turnover saved by padulla Applause Collins and the Irish need a basket time Burton has not been the most efficient in this first half now two of 11 0 of four from three he needs to try of get back into that play making mode driving KCK Notre Dame has missed six in a row make it seven with the air ball and that will be a foul on notra Dame as Davis pulls down Baron as vir jinia Tech on an 80 run opening up a sixpoint lead on the road welcome back lets take a look at our Pacific Life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years the Hoke living from behind the Ark made five of their first six JC and look at how theyre getting those threes is pretty impressive whereas for the Irish theyre getting it by driving and getting downhill so right now Notre Dame find himself offensive slump as theyve now missed seven in a row and that has led to the Virginia Tech eightpoint run and the largest lead of the ball game at six so being told by Clarence Armstrong upon review there was a hook and hold on Tate Davis on the last possession were going to go back and show you exactly how we when it happened didnt catch us to the naked eye during a Stuffle but off a rebound there was the hook and the hold flagrant theyll get a free throw here and out of bounds under for the Hop so Robbie Baron heads to the free throw line where hes an 85 pre throw shoot and hell shoot a couple and and then it will also be Virginia Tech basketball as you mentioned so the Irish who played spendly in this first half find themselves in a a shooting slump Suddenly Its really happened in the last couple of minutes heres a look keep a look at 13 down low theyre going to say Baron I didnt see the hook and hold to the degree that you normally do to Warrant the whistle but they felt like he hooked and pulled down Baron which gave Baron those two free throws and the h with the basket in a 90 run after the free throw and the lead is suddenly bul to seven Couture back door and he lays it up and in what a first half for Hunter Couture that is stretching the largest lead of the game to nine big possession for the Irish where do they turn to for offense without Marcus you got to try and find shry coming off screens Boo has been good getting open and attacking us attack CL not a lot thought about three then takes the three back rims it and here comes Virginia Tech now up by n Collins does a little bit of everything for Mike young and Virginia and its a turnover from Couture the Irish with a minute 10 to go Burton Shrewsberry they need it hug can see the confidence as weve arrived into the of February those AR hopes those are Lo guar threes now when he gets that clean of AA in the lane almost loses it and does but they say last Touch by not trame Irish did a good job exploring some early offense off the turnover and on the Baseline I mean look if youre the hook defense theres only one guy youre out to and its Shrewsberry Miss assignment and makes some pay toughest part of playing for your dad is what it never stops I you know what I get to do when I play for Coach brg its a leave had to I had to deal with Coach all the time and I love coach BR its its nonstop but the the beauty is you can that coach Shrewsberry approaches it like I coach my son but then when were outside the lines hes my son and thats what makes the relationship work thats whats made it work a lot of father son Duos had great success and the shes will here in Notre potit inside again that one just barely rolls out so the Irish now have cut it to six and have the basketball under 35 to play here in the first half big possession for the Irish got to be probably a high ball screen coming from B 9 seconds disparity between game clock shot clock Burton gets the Baseline drives that one to get his D coming off the elbow right there a great angle to get to the r quick 5 run from Notre Dame cuts the lead back to four pulla inside and once again poti cant Coral but just 17 to go coming up on the Subaru halime report once again check in from around the ACC get you set for a big one in Tallahasse and a recap of Dustin Johnson and Liv go out in Las Vegas quick timeout here what can you really do with 17 uh you can you can heave that thing get a clean catch its time to catch if you get the right pass right receiver catch gather and get one up its possible and coach is trying to arue for time here should be 23 not to 17 so astute observation for from coach Shrewsberry to try and Campa for a little bit more time should be about 23 and go so a 50 run boy they needed it and they got it the two freshman guards both supplying it truberry with the three Burton with the flyby laying and now 23 at worst you go down four it was n to Blink ago yeah I mean look the Irish have not been able to get stops defensively to the clip its going to take to win let alone gets a good team like Virginia Tech Hoke shooting almost 60 from the field 54 55 from three youre not going to be able to chase the hes at those numbers so defensively theres going to be an adjustment from the Irish or eventually this thing will get away from them because they dont have the fire power to keep up so will be Irish basketball zon of the inbound and Virginia Tech comes out with a little bit of a fullcourt press if you will as Baron on Ball and coach shuberry wants to have a word with his team yeah so what youre probably looking at is some sort of curl coming off that midc Court thats probably the safest place to be a receiver get can still go and get a clean look right around that massive Notre Dame logo at half court so look for some sort of action in that regard lets take a look at whats going on around the ACC once again presented by TMobile coming up next year on the CW it is Virginia and Florida State Joe Gerard over 2000 points for his career as Clemson beats the orange in the dome Carolina just keeps on winning head coach hu Davis getting it on the road in Coro Gables and Duke defends their home court against Boston College so 23 Virginia Tech now picking up at half court Burton doesnt get it off in time and it will be a 3935 game at the half so Ill see if they cant push it to seven or eight and shry out of the gate all is an 8 its a great set to Fen coming out to get shuberry and look heed him up and apply that game pressure right out of the gates to begin the second Stan T he front rims it and here come the Irish with an opportunity to take the lead from down n to having the basketball down one shry driving not really his game Burton checked by Collins four on the shot clock make it three Burton swivel throws it up shot clock at one and wow as the clock expires able to lay it up and in I give a lot of credit to MJ Collins again locking in defensively but his teammates didnt the slack to win the 5050 staying with it to continue the momentum which is firmly on the Irish side its a 10 Irish run no trame from down n to up one with the Music Applause basketball Davis and Booth formidable group inside for Notre d Burton just pure speed by pulla so low with the center of gravity its so hard to defend a guy who can get that low and explode by a Defender like padulla who shorten sture himself it is a 12 Irish run and Couture draws the foul on Davis him and Davis have been tied up a few times here with Davis again trying to prevent his path coming off screens trying to remain physical really provide a challenge so Couture cant catch cleanly and get looks and that is Daviss third fou so he will head to the Irish bench and Julian roer very different player in size and stature in for notra Dame suddenly the Virginia Tech offense has gone cold Collins doesnt look to shoot much trying to established kit inside and the drought continues for Virginia Tech a kid second shot of the game one of your keys to the game yeah had that early foul trouble and kind of Jing him out of any kind of Rhythm Burton again oh how did he do it how did he do it JC its incredible a Applause magician the other end and there finally is a presence from Lin Applause kid How did Marcus Burton somehow amongst the trees get it up on the glass inber Couture in his Applause pocket Burton again Roper one three B again doing his job beating the initial Defender to break down the defense get him into rotation Couture a little off balance but all net Hunter Couture 15 theres no let up on Couture theres no let up hes always chasing the next play the next opportunity to lift this group and give him a boost you mentioned his Athletico prowess he won a league championship in soccer volleyball track football and basketball so wheres the sneaky part of the athletic what is sneaking up on you with that type of athleticism Ill never it is the only team to win the Catholic League win all five sports thats just athletic Burton for three and a run the other way were back where we started tied at 44 Couture fade away a fun basketball game up and down shuberry not his game Burton in the corner five on the shot clock roer IR buron is doing a magnificent job of opening for his guys got rer on aine couldt off Applause the heres Collins running a bit of a Applause weave and Collins draws the foul on the floor says Teddy Valentine good action here ask me how he did it earthly Music idea rank Louisville at 23 rank Syracuse its tomorrow 12 East 9 Pacific only on the CW Now The Joy Center is alive on a Saturday night student section they have not sat yet today this for a team thats lost seven in a row in the ACC really impressive turnout here in South Ben for a team that doesnt have those postseason hopes its been a tough year transition year program is going to be in the right place no question but for the fans to show up here pretty impressive speaks to the belief they have in the direction the programs going Couture finds Collins who launches a three he can hit petite flies for the rebound and will be Notre Dame basketball with a threepoint lead a heck of an effort from potit just to get a hand simply on the basketball couldnt Corral it and give his team another go but you love the big fella trying to bang around make something happen how about this run from notra Dame for a second we wondered would they get blown out down n Virginia Tech or up nine Virginia Tech had the basketball in the first half since that Notre Dame has been the dominant team up three rer trying to bully padulla inside and does like that match up I thought it was too much dribbling that I realized they wanted roer to try and exploit in the post a small or less physical pulla padulla is Virginia Techs leading scorer its Couture for three he thought he had it back rim potit again fighting for the rebound what a swing pass theres P drawing the now and hell head to the free throw line but you look at Padulas line its been all Couture from the guard tandem padulla really yet to get even the shots up youd anticipate yeah hes been more of a facilitator with those three assists hes had a couple turnovers that something trying to limit its PL him times but the effort again for poti to win the 5050 swing it to give P an angle to draw the whistle big time in your R and he misses the front end check out the CWs brand new hit series the critics are calling fresh and fiery and a damn good time watch wild cards this Monday 98 Central or stream free anytime on the CW app so pulla a 77 free throw shooter misses one of two and cuts the lead to four and of course if you missed two free throws which is why the crowd got crazy three nachos on a Saturday wow I was wondering why you were standing wanted accident Teddy Valentine is going to catch petite with a forearm to the back of John so 20 on the shot clock just under 14 minutes to play here in the ball game shry Virginia Tech not really an answer for Burton speed on the shot clock shry fires airall and it will be a shot clock violation good defense from Virginia Tech yeah Kevin simply had no idea that because the ball didnt draw Iron he had two seconds on that shot clock to make a play and nickel back into the game for Virginia Tech the North Carolina transfer averages nine points a game barely played in the first half did have a threepoint Applause play Pula takes the bump from Burton nearly had his pocket pick to Couture andout suddenly C from behind the AR straight re the Davis in traffic Music nonetheless the Irish have successfully slowed the game down to their L but nothing slowing Burton down just bricks it off the top of the glassa sliding but theres to finish aggressive drives but get offensive rebounding opportunity padulla gets all the way to the basket three Defenders trying to deflect it take it out of the play poti gifted a Sublime offensive rebounding opportunity one in which he capitalizes on game has gotten very physical as p p up and Burton continue to trade barbs out on the perimeter heres what Im talking about when I say that aggressive Drive look one two two guys take it out two other Defenders watching potit The Only One chasing the opportunity for a put back and a rebound Couture takes a seat for Virginia Tech and the Freshman Rex Steiner back into the game as you very rarely see both padulla and Couture out at the same time that is exactly what Mike young has Applause done ball pressure from Rin and suddenly both teams JC having difficulty on the offensive end wheres the offense come from for Virginia techy you go low post touches especially with the Defenders on the floor and you got two bigs and a tall Wing at 67 and Niel down the shot clock Collins throws one up again on the offensive glass the idea froms much like pull if you SE is prior just get the ball up off the glass knowing that Im drawing Defenders its almost an assist of sorts sure hes trying to convert it but even if he doesnt potit got that perfect real estate to offensive rebound game tied at 49 Applause shuberry doesnt put it on the floor much and misses the high aring bankot Nicholl nich both teams have gone cold here in the second half Music Applause Z Davis rebound near and the Irish reset Applause he throws up a run and connects all nine Notre Dame players who have played tonight have scored so coach shuberry getting it from his entire team here in the joy Center Applause rexs and it will stay Virginia Tech basketball on the Arrow possession but wow it is a physical game inside Irish by Ace at home standing Music Music by and here we go there is 15 the shot by Baron what a design play out of the Huddle I mean youre watching two coaches their atto execution their plays at times when theres a lull in the action to Kickstart their offense these coaches are inserting themselves into this game in a great way it is our six tie of the ball game booth out front lanky freshman getting the start tonight four on the shot clock Bo launches and kador and padulla both back in the ball game for the hes Baron Applause again kid hasnt done much nich kid inside draws the double eight on the shot clock jump hook bar no good theyre going to call Goen djc I think it came off the rim I think Baron touched it I think he timed it properly where it was at a goal well get the opportunity for a replay but my initial look was no goal oh yeah that is a go its still on the ri see how quickly I can acknowledge fult and another great angle from there still on the right still around a so we will stay tied at 51 Applause gives up his dribble Bo on the Baseline Fade Away rattles at home the Freshman consistently Ryan has done a great job attacking that close out from the Baseline either get all the way to the rim or to pull up from about 5T like there theres Couture after a blow on the bench nich pad yet to get going and he turns it over Burton pushes the other way this is whats P late stages of games taking care of the Ballon cant connect him whats the calling down with for the loose ball so that will be an official timeout what a ball game Brewing here the campus of notra Dame 5351 if youre living with moderat Marcus Bs ability to beat the defender he gets to the rim for the spin to win this time he beats Hunter Couture one of the best on ball Defenders kick out for three here PO is just had a nose for the basketball almost a fumble from pulla he gathers here Collins off the back for just to get it up there no Defenders checking for H aren known defensive rebounding prowess one of the worst in the conference but proin has given them a lift in the interior and a toughness its added another layer to make this one so competitive here down the stretch Virginia Tech came out on fire from behind The Arc in the second half shooting 14 from three just one of seven that has been a gigantic turn of events here at the joy Cent under 10 to play Burton doesnt seem phed the Freshman Imus pocket is a big shot bench guy his minutes hes always got to stay locked in to contribute when his num called and he has done that this afternoon and suddenly the Irish with a fiveo cushion and the threepoint shooting for Virginia Tech continues to be the gigantic story here in the second half now one of eight from behind the AR Collins slips Burton connects the lead has ballooned to seven for the Irish they were down by nine with a minute to go in the first half so some words there but Burton finds his Manus Irish by S at home freshman in scoring and doing it again tonight like I said coming into it theres a lot put on the shoulders of Burden because its an offense that can get stag get stuck in third gear in those moments the has to come for your bald dominant card hes provided some pretty impressive moments here some improbable finishes some proper reads some timely shots and the Irish find themselves with a sevenpoint lead with about six and a hook left to play and absolutely stuffing the stat sheet 14 points six assists five steals four rebounds The Freshman guard just absolutely doing everything and on top of that zero zero turnovers so now out of the timeout Virginia Che down seven largest deficit of the game for three hes missed again theyre now one of n from behind the AR in the second half got a great look from one of the best Shooters in the conference seveno Collins on Burton he tried to stay with him all day Burton what a what a play from B staying with his dribble turning a Applause corner thece to it to his for the easy 147 assist now for Burton largest lead of the game its a 90 Run Virginia answers on the offensive end potit draws the foul and will head to the free throw line keevin John got caught ball watching didnt mitigate the distance between Handler and his guy lost sight of him by time PO on a catch its too late but how about bur here doesnt give up the dribble despite blitzing keeps Defenders on his hip dumped down to ji here ji commits too late at that point petite that massive size hes already caught it in Prime real estate youve lost the battle at that point you going to foul harder give up the two now P potit now with 12 points Off the Bench really keeping Virginia Tech in the ball game the Irish continue to shoot at a very high percentage here in the second half Burton leading the charge hes done Music everything G rolling Burton back door cut how is there no call there there has to be something no literally a head hit his a foot hit his head I dont know how a foot can hit the head of an offensive player trying to lay the ball in and hes literally kicked in the head thats thats as egregious of a Miss call as you can possibly have and this is an elite crew thats a bad Applause miss a break for Virginia Tech for sure padulla trying to create to Couture he just cant find it in the second Applause half under five minutes to play the lead is Applause six Notre Dame looking for the sweep of the state of Virginia at home theyve already beaten UVA Shrewsberry for again not to take the credit away from the scorer again its Marcus Burton perusing the Baseline to kick it to a shooter committing the defense his Distributing today has been on point here he goes again comes around gets four Defenders opens up the threepoint look for br Shrewsberry whos been automatic so you start to look at the stat line for this freshman from Notre Dame he now has eight assists to go along with five steals four rebounds and 14 points this is uh this is a game that Legends are created he was two of 11 in the first half a dismal shooting first half and hes totally changed the narrative in this second half again just cannot find the range and it will be Irish basketball same thing first my theyre just going cold theyre getting really good looks theyre just not knocking these down these are great looks for the Applause hes one of 10 from the second half from behind the arc is Virginia Tech just cannot buy a threepoint basket got to find a way to get the ball back to Marcuss hands there he is draws the double from doesnt matter no one can stay in front thats exactly Ryan nobody can stay in front this is some kind of game for the freshman Marcus Burton like they saying p just trying everything he can to keep a guy whos just entirely too explosive with that first step to defend for him this afternoon and Burton looks cool as a cucumber I dont even think hes broken a sweat and he turns it over there first turn over the game for B pulla the other ways it Applause the Davis the other way and he will head to the free throw line now sha padulla averages 16 points a game really hasnt looked right from the beginning yeah for for h team that doesnt want on their poal tournament resum ACC basketball in the CW is brought to you by Pacific Life cre welcome back coming up next here on CW court side Saturday it is all AC guard re pman and Virginia on the road at Florida State follows us here at the joy Center but still a lot to be decided here a Virginia Tech can ill afford this loss on their resume its that simple its look at the defense and look at these percentages Virginia Tech Jordan is shooting 9 in the second half from three 27 from the field meanwhile the Irish are shooting 54 from the field and four of eight from three a team that typically doesnt have the threepoint line as a weapon in their Arsenal and Davis 69 free throw shooter uh misses there dive into the nations most shocking Mysteries catch the series premiere of The allnew CW original true crime series crime Nation Tuesday February 20th only on the CW makes one up to it as the largest lead of the game the lead is 10 Virginia Tech has gone ice cold can somehow revive their offense here late second half padulla tries to create kid cannot catch what would have been an easy lay kid has never found his rhythm much like padulla in this game kid wide open just wasnt ready to play on the Applause catch Davis and stolen Applause and its Sten by how did he do it near a turn one in a foul floor is slick DAV is way outside now trying to take the smaller Applause P really struggling finally able to make his second field goal of the game the lead is eight and going back to those looking at pedullas numbers and wonder whats going on Ill tell you hes exerting a lot of energy guarding Marcus B and thats taken away from some of his ability to be the offensive producer he typically isy Marcus Mak widey inside definitely P but in foul pivot got away with one maybe its the makeup call for the head of Marcus B foot to Marcus Burton but you shifted your pivot all kind of which ways to Sunday before the contact that might be the old makeup call so trying to complete the three play and give the Irish an 11 Le and he does now just two minutes and 15 seconds to go do the hes have one more push or is it the Irish on their home court padulla trying to create again once again canect Collins and kador knocks it down Hunter Kor finally a three ball drops here in the second half just their second make I can promise you this a h team that is not going to go quietly not with whats on the line not with the culture that coach young created good look from catches him Shifty off a rebound is always the best time to get that threepoint look in the Hoke he capitalize and good look there at Shan p a leading scorer for Virginia Tech in our open you mentioned a four game stretchy at 26 against Florida State 32 against Clemson 33 against Miami against Virginia as good a four game stretch as any player in the ACC but tonight has not been his night like I said earlier I think hes expanded a lot of energy trying to defend Marcus Burton whos been aone and hes been doing it a lot off the dribble demanding the basketball being ball dominant to make play the distribut in a score and its been a lot of blow binds and I think padulla is a little bit more winded trying to then go chase his on the other side so some full court pressure Jordan applied by Virginia Tech got to got to try and speed this thing up a little bit take Notre Dame out of their comfort zone Notre Dame turnover prone Squad see if the H can do Burton just barely with a second to spare gets it over the half court Applause line Burton double team kicks it off his leg but gets it back and hell go to the free throw line I dont know how hes making it happen with some of these plays I almost look like hes going to kick it out of bounds gathers it on a quick off dribble here looks like its gone but he plays it right in rhy seamlessly to lead it with that to the incredible a lesser man turns that ball over off their ship he uses it in stride now this is the best game of his career and statistically will go down as one of the best games of any freshman in the country when you look at the total stat line he has done absolutely everything for this Irish team padulla draws the fou so pulla will head back to the free throw line where he is a 77 free throw shooter hes just one of two tonight from the charity strike makes the first hell get the second nichel will come back into the game should should he make to be able to set that press up padulla makes a pair and here comes Nicholl oh they nearly got a 10second violation Jordan the last time and you might run that same if you dont FL the mid to be thater to coll there it is nearly gets trapped hes able to find Shrewsberry major pressure from Virginia Tech its aan triple team pushed back towards that timeline you got to meet that aggressive defense the aggressive Handler is willing to turn the corner and whos that been all game long Marcus Burton what point do you foul here down eight 122 to play now 20 on the shot clock after the kick ball I imagine youre going to defend actually I think Virginia would take sending to the line and that is where he will head in limited attempts at the free throw line he is 60 and he guess made his last free throw attempt because hes a poor free throw shooter Im not mad at it but you could have El to defend through the clock see if you get a quick one on the other end then maybe make it a fivepoint game with about 50 seconds left then you get into foul first of the one and one so hell get the bonus and an opportunity to push it back to 10 with just 81 seconds remaining wow how about this from John three consecutive free throws L the game and now the messaging to the Irish do not foul the threepoint Shooters contest but do it without Viola hands to the St there you go exactly what you said you couldnt do exactly what you cant do you give them momentum you give the angle c those arms down excellent execution from P to get a quick hitter in that fashion you got body thats where it got it didnt get him with the hands coming out he got him with the chest knocking padulla off his track even with the make it will remain a three possession game but this free throw could cut it to seven thats as close as Virginia Techs been in a while and the full court pressure once again applied and notame having difficulty inbounding and Coach Shrewsberry able to call the timeout himself coach Shrewsbury got it the last second and hes fired up knowing that Davis needs to be that receiver to come help out and Davis was kind of taking a sweet time getting there and that almost resulted in a catastrophic turnover lets take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home or motorcycle insurance visit progress is there any doubt Marcus Burton the seven Notre Dame player since 1996 with 15 points five assists and five steals his six steals tied for the most in a notre name game in history and his eight assists tie his career high what a game his ability to keep his dribble alive whether they were blitzing ball screens to keep that dribble that became a retreat dribble but then an attack dribble to get downhill to challenge the defense get in rotations get guys to commit to driving kick thats what stood out to me the most of course hes had some incredible finishes with the basketball as a scorer its how hes been able to make plays as a drive and kick guy that has been the difference if the Irish are able to hold on in the final 79 seconds now theyll try to again in the basketball here nearly a steal from collinses and Valentine is going to get Baron with the arm so Logan Imes The Freshman from zionville Indiana eight of nine from the free throw line this year so just nine attempts this will be his 10th maybe 11th the last time that Notre Dame will shoot a one in one next fou will be two shots Hier arer splash you got to be impressed and pleased if youre coach Shrewsberry with this was a team effort to get him to this point still a lot of game to finish in but nine guys came on the floor nine guys contributed in different ways mastering their role and makes both so free throw shooting clutch late for not trame rer to apply some full court pressure to ensure Virginia Tech has to eat a little clock coming up the court pulla again gliding to the basket Banks it up and in full pressure appli H continues to KCK Shrewsberry stolen by P he cant connect he cant connect who ball is it its Virginia Tech basketball wow three shots from point B range Jordan unbelievable effort when the Buddy becomes a bear multiple times for the hes then right here just a freefor all happy nobody got hurt and what was certain to be a collision so padulla able to make the initial steal theyre going to go look at this to me it looks like now the initial call is whats going to matter here this was ruled hokey basketball is there enough to overturn that call cant gather much from there pretty Inus our first angle might be our best angle well Virginia Tech had their chances inside it missed count them three layups Jordan after the padulla steel and to me I just dont know if theres enough to take away where you could say oh yeah lets flip that call Irish basketball I think this is going to stand as the hok basketball so Notre Dame continues to cling now to a sevenpoint lead but it is for now Virginia Tech basketball certainly they have threepoint Shooters with Couture and padulla and if this ends up being hoks basketball you dont need the three if you have a three obviously you take it but you dont need to force it able to get these quick hitting twos and even some and one opportunities i had attack that Rim the duas had success there was driving kick guy to maybe get Couture that three ball she got to operate fast and truberry and Notre Dame bringing this crowd to their feet late here at the joy Center theyre taking a long look for this possession make sure they get it right here well maybe checking clock because it the hes are lined up to take the basketball out yeah its a possession decision and it is a h basketball so it will be Virginia Tech basketball down by seven length 525 seconds to remain the entire Joy Center has come to their feet here at Notre D padulla once again gliding to the B misses another lay that might be it Jord take a look at this one Ted Valentine has the foul on padulla who is on the ground lets see thats his head unfortunately kind of surpris I could try and take a look to see if that was unnecessary or extreme contact in itself but were going to play it along here has not been smooth sailing for these Irish by any means when the hes have gone to that fullt pressure and now Imes once again he just made a pair the last time he was here and this is remember now its a two shot because the hook over the 10 personal foul Notre Dame on the cusp of a huge win at home for a very young team under 40 to go padulla tops it up again and it will be Irish basketball and rer will head to the free throw line of night for the hus of second half for the hus and the well win Dy that is for sure especially from behind the arc and lets go big picture here for both teams Jordan for Micah Shrewsberry I get it the seven game losing streak comes to an end tonight but how about the play of the Freshman certainly his son but uh the star performance of All Stars by Marcus Burton and pretty good effort from Carrie Boo as well at times yeah you look at the guys that have been the the biggest contributors Burton Shrewsberry Booth J these guys are all going to be a part of nots future for a lot of years moving forward and padulla that will be it Mike young sticks his hands in the the crowd on their feet giving a resounding Ovation Burton holding the ball and what a performance one that will go down history for the Freshman one of the best performances by any freshman ever at not Notre Dame I that was incredible what he was able to pull off
