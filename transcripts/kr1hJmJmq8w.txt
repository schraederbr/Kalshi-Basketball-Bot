W on Tobacco Road and we are underway on a Saturday night in the ACC its Cal that starts with the basketball NC State their last three games all decided by a single possession sto yakovich lines up the three he cant connect you referenced it Debbie Andre sto yakovich struggled midweek season low six points and misses his first shot of this contest wolf pack starting five and all five players starting for NC State are in their last year of college eligibility right now lets see what sense of urgency the first five minutes brings for this group thats been in so many tight games a team that suffered a gutwrenching loss on Wednesday against Virginia Tech they led by 15 in the second half and lost by three a big reason why Ben Middlebrooks picked up an early fourth foul in that second half and Kevin Keats needs his big man on the floor I love how they feature him in the first possession trying to get something going inside and you also play through the post to see how Cal is going to defend it are they going to bring two are they going to bring some help and then can you rotate out of that middle Brooks opens the scoring one of two from the line and the Wolfpack can set up their full court pressure Music Applause take a look at the Cal starting five St yakovich weve spoken about this is Joan black sure nothing but air sooko offensive rebound backing down middle Brooks thats going to be an excellent big man battle as mioko Cashes in on the second chance opportunity sooko coming off his best game of the season against North Carolina eight for nine from the floor 16 and8 NC State goes with a high hard hedge and they tag the low roll but then middle bur has got to get back to that and make sure he boxes out pull up Pap o conell lefted short blackshire is their point guard number 10 in blue right here hes got to take care of the basketball a difficult to do against a defense that turns teams over more than anybody in the CC its a Soo denied by Middlebrooks there in the post really good defense by Middlebrooks low man wins in those oneonone situations right here here they go again NC State going right back to Middle Brooks yeah theyre letting the big men go at it earlyer this game Middlebrooks trying to stay with it muscles it in I think Ben Middlebrooks is such an incredible energy guy for NC State he just does all the little things right some dont show up on the stat sheet but today hes got to have a big stat line for them to win hes got to protect inside hes got to guard his match up with Soko and then when Dort comes in the Music game kick to the corner this is DJ Campbell who hands off for blackshire lost his footing lost the ball scrambling to get it back Reus petritis settles things down for Cal two seconds on the shot clock laer has to go up with it and the back rim is kind for two see that loose ball right there on that deflection those are the kind of plays that NC state has to come up with and they didnt come up with those in the Virginia Tech game faded down the stretch a team that led by 15 points on the road in blackburg and came away with the loss so Connell cant hit Applause it St yakovich with the dant Styles matchup you got to make him go left hes so efficient going right this time he turns the ball over well thats the first turnover by Cal this evening thats something were going to keep a track on all game Applause Music long our ACC triple header continues in Raleigh Debbie Antonelli Jay alter with you were expecting a good one step back three jayen Taylor buries it first basket for either team outside the paint both teams looking to establish their interior going inside playing two and through their Five Guys for NC State its middle Brooks for cal Its sasoko both teams trying to bounce back for midweek lost Music tough takes DJ Campbell finding a way inside thats his game DJ Campbells a 30 threepoint shooter and if you watch the way Michael oconnell is guarding him hes given him a cushion now you got to keep him from getting inside after Taylor Made the three nothing but air there well NC State the last three games theyve played all have come down to one possession so were expecting a close competitive one for C PS and everyone here in Raleigh losses but three one possession yeah it is tough in this league to finish games and game slippage means you got to execute the details perfectly when your habits have to be at their best late game andc stay with full court pressure they have outstanding ball pressure particularly on the perimeter this is a cow team that likes to get it inside of the paint all six of their points have come in the paint sooko trying to add two more hell get the opportunity from the foul line its a really good job by sasoko to make himself available at the nail on the short roll andc States hedging ball screens tagging from the weak side and recovering and Cal knows that theyve run some good stuff here to get Soko the Music basketball Mai ahoko 69 240 those broad shoulders he has been a great player for C since coming in for Michigan State you know how to play the game if you play for Tom ISO for four years and coko had a successful career there this is his graduate year and Brandon Huntley Hatfield Jay in the game thatll be good to see for NC State fans hes missed the last two games and again when you lose by two and then lose by three you feel like he could have made the difference in those two they need him for front Court dep they need him the rebound and a little rust from Huntley Hatfield goes right off his hand itll stay Cs basketball Applause St Yakov trying to spin his way free rejected at The Rim its isoko fouled again trying to clean up the spill how about the first play on that Shing off the rush quickly like you said Jay Huntley Hatfield meets sto yakovich at The Rim welcome to Applause Raleigh and then Cal stays with it this is a great cleanup right here to draw the foul by sasoko who is really hammering NC State on the offensive glass early thats his third offensive rebound Cashes in at the foul line sto yakovich known as a knockdown shooter hes showing the Hops I mean hes an incredibly impressive offensive player nine times hes been over the 20 point mark only one time single digits and that was the last game in Chapel Hill I thought Seth Trimble in North Carolina did a really good job on him when he was on him so weve talked about the NC State close losses looking for some more consistent scoring maybe Brion pass who scores there can get into it they just need the supportting cast to take that next step Brion pass is a 50 threepoint shooter so you come with a long close out and now he adds that floater to his game ST it away Huntley Applause Hatfield off the window rolls around does not drop foul on the floor will stay Wolf Pack basketball this is the value of Brandon Huntley Hatfield right here he gets the deflection in the steel Soko trying to go into a dribble handoff with sty yakovich and I dont know about you but I get nervous when the big boys are dribbling more than two times up the floor you always start thinking he did a good job getting it on the Music glass heres Jaden Taylor in attack mode pull up pop got it drop coverage snake behind the ball screen pull up without over penetrating very well executed Taylor has five of the packs 10 in the early going here nearly 6 minutes gone by Applause lead D the transfer from vandervell Up and Under for two again that short roll off that hedge very well executed we watched Mark matsons team work on that and shoot around today they have a clear plan of attack and thats get into the paint and NC State answers Marcus Hill count it plus the foul Marcus Hill is averaging 16 points in conference play and watch him turn the corner right here get into the paint nice little fade away hes not known as a threepoint shooter hes only made six off season Jay but when he can get two feet to the paint he has the ability to elevate and shoot over most Defenders Sacrament in thead I dont know if many Wolfpack fans would have thought 17 games into the season Marcus Hill would be your leading scorer but you lose Mike James and Hill has been the most consistent scorer on this NC State team and hes not quite DJ horn from last year but he does provide a similar scoring punch for Kevin KS down the lane contested offensive rebound home Lee Dort with authority NC State right nows got to get Five Guys on the defensive Music Glass Four offensive rebounds already for this count team and theyve cashed in six second chance points thats off the mark from Brion Applause pass stole it away Jaden Taylor draws the contact from to yakovich who committed the Applause turnover four o boards right now the rotation over to help on the penetration opens up the weak Side Glass and look at Dort go to work he and sasoko have done a nice job early on for Cal dominating around the rim you sooko and Dort early in this game have present a huge problem for an NC State front court that has had plenty of inconsistencies at least you have Huntley Hatfield back to Aid Ben Middlebrooks but right now Advantage Cal in the big man battle lets see how long Kevin Keats will stay with his ball screen coverage right now because whats happening is because of the rotation they are getting the offensive glass left a little bit open however they are getting tips and deflections off the the hedging as as well so got to keep things uh off balance right you got to keep taking a different look on the defensive end so you make teams think and hesitate they do have seven points off turnovers its a pick your poison situation though what you give up does it offset contested deep three and its good The Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson what a boost off the bench this freshman has been this season another player for cow did not score at North Carolina had double figures in the seven previous games so you knew it would be just a matter of time for that young man got going 0 for eight from the field and he knocks down the first shot he takes here in Raleigh fifth in the ACC in freshman scoring hes the best scoring freshman without a start this season and he doesnt hesitate right here hands down too much space the cow has 15 points but none of them have come from their leading scorer sto yakovich who has it here with a head of steam that was a big time play Michael oconnell was setting up to draw the charge and stakic stepped right around him first bucket of the night fires CID front 1715 back and forth we go in the Lenovo Center Middle Brooks lost the handle St yakovich two on one puts it up rejected at The Rim dant Tes Styles never gave up on that play and now hes the trailer for three cant connect bra hustle nearly kept the ball alive for State a cal a twopoint lead on the road well tell you about their head coach Mark Madson most known for winning NBA championships well tell you something you dont know about him Music boom he rides the BART sometimes to work the Bay Area Rapid Transit and its a great way to maximize 20 minutes and not lose it driving in the car I love it congratulations to Mark and his wife Hannah they had a their fifth child in November we know theyre watching and uh Hannah you deserve a medal amen thats a lot of kids under the age of seven very cool congratulations and your husband keeps doing these cross country road trips now that hes in the ACC he just wants to be efficient efficient in everything he does and yeah uh he gave major props to Hannah this morning at shoot around as well to his wife thats very cool we really enjoyed our conversation with Mark Matson its funny UCLAs head coach mck Cronin kind of going viral like he often does complaining about all these road trips that the West Coast teams are forced to do in the Big 10 and the ACC and Mark Madson hes taken a completely different approach hes looking for positives more time together more practice time more time to build team chemistry on the road during these long cross country trips well if you get a good Tailwind its not that bad Im sure its somewhat some of the places you want to travel to in the Pack 12 but its about efficiency its about spending time with your team and its about getting extra practice time to be quite honest his teams playing hard right now going a little too fast there foul called I thought that could have been a travel on Jeremiah Wilkinson instead of foul called against Michael oconnell coming off the timeout both teams looking to push the pace Wilkinson trying to drop it off draws the the foul inbound and Baseline out of bounds and that has to be against Marcus Applause Hill no points in the last two and a half minutes for a Wolfpack offense that struggled for stretches on Wednesday against Virginia Tech although that came in the second half of Connell he ends the drop you get to the nail or you get to the Elbow off a single side ball screen you got to be ready to score shot the ball with a lot of confidence right there Michael Applause ell we are tied for the fifth time this game has already seen seven lead changes back and forth we go on a Saturday night in the ACC single side ball screen right here Ben Middlebrooks does a great job setting the screen and oconnell if youre going to go under youre going to get that separation right there because cows and drop coverage you got to pull the trigger there and knock that down sto yakovich Cs leading scorer out of the game right now who will generate the offense good X Out on the backside by NC States defense and they get another steal they really look connected on this end of the floor tonight he doing a really nice job getting in those passing Lanes deflecting ball BS turning Cal over transition three nothing but the bottom of the net for Jeremiah Wilkinson its hard to set your D when you turning the ball over with a team that can fill the lanes like Cal can now Wilkinson coming off that zeroo game against North Carolina sees a big basket hes got two threes in this first half nbrooks trying to answer nice spin move move right to the rim for two Ben Middlebrooks is getting so much better at being a feature on the block now then you can throw it down there and you know you can make something productive happen hes pretty good at drawing fouls as well miscommunication there and that is turnover number six for Cal in this first half Im telling you NC States defense is locked in on this end theyre getting tips deflections their rotations of have been outstanding this is the turnover and look how quickly they strike the other way feels like they almost have to because if NC State gets set in their half court defense theyve turned him over six times theyve been really good and when you start cutting off those passing Lanes you you make them think a little bit more and take them out of that natural offensive Rhythm they he pounded it inside with Middlebrooks and hes delivering putting NC State back in front when your coach tells you were going to throw the ball to you on the Block and we expect you to score and you deliver from the first possession of the game thats got to build some confidence for Ben Middlebrooks as well he has seven for the pack the Tred is Tangled Up tried to Circle it to Soko 3 seconds on the shot clock The Freshman Wilkinson has to hurry didnt see the timer another turnover thats seven for Mark madsons team although theyre only down one on the road good back and forth contest weve had eight lead changes already in this Music one still an emotional moment for me I grew up in that gym I grew up in Reynolds Coliseum hoping that Id be good enough that Kay would pick me but you know Im up there because of teammates like you Jay honestly and all my teammates Through The Years in my 37 years on the air trying to do my best to use my platform to help the game so thank you thank you for that what a year for you day Smith Hall of Fame Kirk gy award now that hanging in rolds Coliseum but weve got a good one here on a Saturday night in the ACC theres no place outside rather be than right here right now no doubt about it NC State 4minute scoring drought 0 for six shooting and its allowed a seven nothing Cal run they got to get a foothold back in this game their defense has to step it up again I mean thats how they were able to create some separation early and sto yakovich is starting to get going right down the lane brims out battle for the board won by Trey Parker right now cows winning the points in the paint theyre winning the battle on the glass Parker The Fearless freshman makes it a twopoint game and scoring allows NC State to get back into their fullcourt pressure this is when theyre at their best and Mark matsons not going to wait hes going to burn one right now now you said it defense generates offense thats what NC State does best they get the stop turn it into two we step away for 30 seconds Music Music hey this is why youre a Hall of Famer you say NC State needs defense in the offense and boom next play they do it you got to change the momentum and the rhythm of the game and a lot of times Kevin Keats has the ability to do that with his defense theres a lot of ways you can change the rhythm of the game changing your defense is one way lets see what they do here on ball screen coverage cuz theyre starting to get more aggressive theyre just switching right now that time hutley Hatfield was in drop coverage was in the Gap and forced the turnover its a really good job by Kevin KS to change it up from the bench mark madsons team has now committed eight turnovers in this first half and yet they lead by two theyve been playing really good defens themselves although not that time open three Dennis Parker Jr cant connect Second Chance opportunity from the same Corner cant hit it Parker cleans up his own spill the spin cycle The Freshman from fville Trey Parker backto back buckets for him what a move and like a freshman makes one play here with a triple right or excuse me he gets the offensive rebound and the spin then he commits the foul but you love the energy right here youre changing the rhythm of the game what a move woo that is quick tied at 27 four in a row from Parker we were in the back before the game Talking to coach Keats about his freshman and hes pretty excited about this young group young group he said he was going to try to get him some extended minutes today and Parkers delivered on that coachs promise tied this game at 27 six ties nine lead changes its been a fun first half here in Raleigh Hunley Hatfield called for it they gave it to him and it fell off his hand you got to throw a better entry though thats not his fault hes trying to hold off the contact Wilkinson how crafty is the freshman and the turnover allows the transition opportunity to cow Jeremiah Wilkinson has eight back TOs is open an immediate answer from Michael oconnell the other thing that Kevin Keats has done here off that last time out is theyre going quick hitters in their offense theyre not taking time moving the ball theyre looking to strike Applause Music quickly mismatch Soko double team threw it up there and in how did that go M Soka wow hes having back back to back games sissoko 16 and Chapa Hill earlier in the week and then just doing a nice job of playing right here Michael oconnell without the basketball good back door against the cow pressure this is the mismatch and NC State brings help they recognize it theres the Dig then the double from Huntley Hatfield wow I dont think he called it so yakovich the blow by couldnt finish it and the follow no good as well the Kevin Keats has a use it or lose it timeout he elects to use it and they could more or less hold for the last shot of this first half about a second difference between that shot clock and the game clock and while Keats talks things over well step aside Id like like to see Jaden Taylor with this possession right here for NC State looks like Zone Mark Matson changing it up Zone again second possession of Zone by Cal its a good change CU you know Kevin Keats had a mantoman play in the bag over there at timeout here comes the screen Ron pass gets a good look Miss fires Parker Jr no good and cow will him here in the second half only four points from your leading scorer and yet you lead by two on the road good first half for this Cal Bears team Golden Bears team and its tied at 31 EDC State Cashes in on their opening possession just a button up that point on sto yakovich he has the best plus minus in the first half plus five for Cal hes doing other things on the floor to impact scoring like that back door cut possession for C at this second half they go to sto yakovich and he delivers when you go to Synergy he has an excellent rating as a cutter 18 points per possession that is excellent that was an example of it right Applause there he cuts more than a pair of scissors okay we got C Zone in all right were done with all that right here we go middle Brooks with sooko falls off the rim no good sooko is not just a rebounder over his head he can go get a rebound out of his area Campbell never gave up on it follows his own shot and puts it up at in for Applause two the other thing Cs done is theyve done a pretty good job and theyve taken care of the ball of keeping in NC State out of transition you want to make NC State execute in the half court Marcus Hill been very quiet in this game only three points for the Wolfpack leading score fading away knocks it down they need that more of that from Marcus Applause hill hill averaging 13 on the season 10 straight games scoring double figures only five tonight even after that make DJ Campbell draws the Applause foul Marcus Hill is so good at playing off the bounds hes not a catch and shoot guy hes a guy that can get a bucket when the shot clocks running down or if he needs to break off the offense hes just playing off some twist action in the middle of the floor where Ben vinel Brooks is causing some interference and Hill comes off the backside of Ben and does a nice job of getting to his Applause spot Cal only attempted five foul shots in that first half thats a strength of Mark matsons Golden Bears team as theyll get to the line and theyll make you pay once they get there NC State was disciplined lets see if that continues in the second half its a great Point Jay because Cal is second in the ACC and made free throws at 17 a game DJ Campbell Cashes in on both of his attempts the Western Carolina transfer now playing on the other side of the state heres Marcus hill come here scoop to the hoop Marcus Hill backto back baskets thats just a great read because he was initially taking Wilkinson below the level of the screen and when Wilkinson hesitated because he thought he was coming off the screen going left it was a great take by Applause Hill so stolen away the ninth turnover forced by NC State in this game Jed Taylor that rims in and were tied at 37 time out Mark Madson three straight makes for the pack and theyve tied it up early in this second Applause right here in Raleigh North Carolina thats amazing because I feel like Dr King has a street named after him in every city or town yeah you asked our uh sports information group to try and get how many uh streets are named after uh Dr King I forgot to Google it and find out Im sure somebody will have the answer to to that for us another tough take inside ma Soko the transfer from Michigan State puts cow back in front by two neither team is led by more than four points in this game in the first half and just picked up where it left off Debbie yeah Marcus Hill is turning a corner and getting more aggressive nine points for Hill after only three in the first half Applause you got to really cut hard to get Applause Applause open Campbell lines up the three and hits it DJ Campbell a 30 threepoint shooter he set that up by all his driving ability thats how he scored in the first half its a good thing he hit it too cuz Soko was wide open under the basket Campbell leading the Golden Bears tonight with 11 Hill starting to show off Marcus Hill he has come alive in this second half remember at the beginning of the game we we talked about close games and who for NC State we thought it was Marcus Hill right hes the guy right now he has to be able to break off plays make plays make smart plays cuz he plays hard see good recovery by NC State but what a better shot by black sheer black Shir doing a good job of knocking down on a late rotation cuz Cal had numbers on that back side youre not just trying to get numbers in transition Jay you can get numbers by manipulating the defense on the other side of the the floor that was a twoon one NC state has made their last five shots and yet they Trail by four C has found an answer on their offensive end can they get a stop here Taylor Rises and hits time out Kevin Keats after the Jaden Taylor bucket to make it a twopoint game Marcus Hill Turn in the corner off that Middlebrook screen in the middle third getting to his spots off the bounce and then heres the two on one on the weak side and Blacker delivers Music Music boy these teams are RedHot to start the second half but combined 12 of 14 from the field and Marcus Hill has led the hot streak three points in the first half Jay eight here in the second along with Jaden Taylor they have all 14 points points in the second half for NC State he is being aggressive and I thought Kevin Keats called that timeout to maybe switch up what he was doing defensively uh but it remember its a total wear down effect of the 40 minutes of pressure and I think their pressure has been really good tonight Cals just an excellent offensive team 12 makes only two misses between these two teams and nearly six minutes of action in this second half does that upset you if youre a coach CU of defense or are you happy that youre executing on the offensive no youre youre thinking substitutions rotations wear down effect impact get the game where theres some pressure wide open look misfiring the junior Ola Joseph played sparingly in this game got a great look there Taylor he misses it short Applause another wideopen look this time its good Jeremiah Wilkinson drills his third three of the night Jay if not everyone is sprinting back on defense thats a problem everyone has to Sprint and believe it or not a fivepoint lead is the largest of the night for either team thats how close and competitive this game has been Ben midd Brooks draws the a foul trying to get that immediate answer you have to communicate and transition and you got to match up see they got two guys on one side of the Floor Michael oconnell stopping the ball somebody has to pick up Wilkinson this freshman is not shy about pulling the trigger outside the ark he leads the nation in all freshman scoring who have not started a single game this season Music more than 12 points per game fifth in the ACC in freshman scoring he has the green light in the trust of his C coach Mark Matson back to a one possession game Applause Music Applause black Shir pull up pop its good cow cant miss theyve made six of their last seven theyre getting whatever they want right Music now middle Brooks looking to attack oneonone with Dort body hes into him contact no Applause call sto yakovich in trouble sends it back out and blacksher will reset it switch Wilkinson feeling it missed it there on a heat Applause check High hand another offensive rebound keeps it alive for the Golden Bears they have Eight Second Chance points in this game shot clock at eight The Freshman Wilkinson finally a rebound to end an exhausting defensive possession for state middle Brooks lines up to three in and out no Applause good thats a lot of contact and Im not sure thats the shot right there even though middle Brooks is capable of hitting a trail three so yakovich spins into a double team Mark matsons like where is the foul theyre letting him play theres a lot of contact right now Mark Mark bats it not happy his team desperate for a road Conference win in the Music ACC time for Food Lions Food For Thought Debbie Jay we talk about closing out games and execution right here you cant get screened youve got to be able to play ball screen coverage better in a late game situation watch this pass right here Jaden Taylor curls is curling but the pass throws him at a scoring range he could have turned the corner and got in the paint you got to get a 5050 ball late game youve got to be the tougher team in this situation Virginia Tech comes up with it three players behind the ball and transition and then you have to finish it off with a rebound a rebound there seals the game if NC State had executed better in any of those situations the game would have been over at Virginia Tech thats why game slippage in execution and discipline is so important your habits have to be good thats on the players right there theyve got to finish those plays we showed you that close game down the stretch Wednesday night in the loss at Virginia Tech without setting up for another close game here at ACC play for NC State three of Kevin keatss Four conference losses by one possession their last three games all one possession a win against Notre Dame then losses to North Carolina and Virginia Tech and this game has all the makings of another one possession game for it comes down to late game execution how good are your habits to yakovich rejected Dennis Parker Jr flew in to deny Lee Applause Dort thats a lot of contact Applause this game has been back and forth throughout 10 lead changes and Cal this fivepoint Advantage is the largest lead either team has had tonight Marcus Hill off balance no Applause good so yakovich is calling for the ball Applause Music Ola Joseph in the paint and a foul call Ola Joseph had a couple of opportunities to hit a wide open sto yakovich but he goes off the bounce and breaks it off and gets to the free throw line and that is the fourth foul against NC States leading scorer Marcus Hill whos been their best player in this second half Applause Wednesday night double header on the ACC Network you dont want to miss it Clemson who picked up a big win today against Pittsburgh hosting Syracuse at seven and then its Florida State playing this Cal team on the west coast seals picked up a really nice win today theres the team no ones talking about in the ACC I like Florida State this season do too Hamptons done a good job you know what youre going to get and the kind of effort theyre going to bring how about Louisville eight wins in a row Duke set the play tonight later at BC that game is after us on ESPN theyve got 11 in a row undefeated in League Play Brion pass amongst the trees count it plus the foul so at the 955 Mark in the second half Marcus Hill picks up that fourth foul and it is a sixpoint lead for Cal so you wonder who is going to step up and Brion pass whos been playing about 16 minutes a game this year whos an excellent threepoint shooter has been able to get in the paint tonight and he is a unicorn in todays college basketball this is his fourth year at one school hes going to graduate in the spring well used to be normal now I wonder if there is another Brion pass out there there was only eight in the ACCC part of that final four team a year ago full court pressure back to a one possession game and thats a 5sec violation this is what the full court pressure can do to you that play right there can be an emotional gamechanging moment for NC State down three your Pressure Works its a tear down effect and Mark Matson Cal head coach only has those two timeouts remaining didnt want to burn one there Hunley Hatfield on the Block draws the Music foul its a really nice feed by Brion pass Music Applause Huntley hfield doing the work before the ball gets to Applause Music Applause him well we said it at the beginning of this game two teams when you look at the ACC standings are desperate for a conference win youre seeing that over the course of this game why its so back and forth both teams playing with that desperation it has been a fun watch in the last 9 minutes and 33 seconds who is going going to find a way to win cuz those wins have escaped both of these teams kick out Taylor a three and he barries it they count it as a long two Jaden Taylor arguing his case as it stands were tied at 51 and the full court pressure dialed up again Mark matsons got to burn another timeout backto back turnovers and you can feel the swing of emotion and momentum in the building right now this is an excellent trap first of all this is not where you want to inbound the basketball this is a big three by Taylor excuse me a two you can see clearly hes inside the threepoint line and then right here the ball in the corner right in front of the official I thought that was NC States basketball six nothing run in the last 25 seconds and its been spearheaded by that full core pressure Debbie it still has the same impact right here right because NC State now is going to keep wrapping it up now if Im Cal Im doing two things in a huddle Im talking about getting the ball past midcourt but Im also looking to go back door you got to have your pressure package in ready to go Id look for so yakovich to get it back and look for a play going back door its a tough place to inbound the ball as well and Cal only has one timeout for the next 9 minutes and 16 seconds that will be Music Applause challenging and C in their worst spell of the night Z made field goals in nearly 4 minutes and thats a 10sec violation Mark Madson cant believe Applause it Joon blackshire its walked the ball up its not 10 seconds because once they called a timeout it was a cow timeout the the count should have started over so Mark madsons correct Tony Henderson says my mistake Cal will keep the basketball Applause as I was saying the Golden Bears no field goals in the last four minutes theyve missed their last six shots how do they break out of this drought Im telling you back door Im looking to for something that is going to the basket NC States really ramping it up here shot clock down to three right down the lane off the window and in Reedus petrius delivers his first basket of the night thats a great take down the lane line going inside Huntley Hatfield finds Dennis Parker Jr right through the back door to tie at 53 really good back door cut by the Applause Wolfpack contested Corner three will stay cow possession we are tied for the 12 time tonight in a game that refuses to be anything but close and Applause competitive good defense so yakovich resets 10 on the timer hes going to Barkley three on pass double team comes in zakovich Fades away and a foul called the home fans of the Lenovo Center dont like it and I will point out they have let a lot slide in this second half theyve been consistently not blowing the whistle but they blow it here two seconds on the shot Applause clock Kevin ke is standing at half court I cant believe believe it tied at 53 and the officials did put 14 seconds back on the clock this was the controversial foul call before we went away two seconds on the shot clock thats a Music foul tell you what Andre St yakovich does not like Tobacco Road season six points against North Carolina Wednesday and hes stuck on six after that missed free throw here in Raleigh which are his first of the game and he is second in the ACC and free throw makes and attempts missed him both hes an 84 free throw receiv Applause NC States last lead was 2322 theyve kept it close but they cant get that lead back can they find it here Bon pass playing big minutes with Marcus Hill on the bench lost it tried to get it to Huntley Hatfield couldnt connect Applause Wilkinson The Fearless freshman left it short offensive rebound keeps it alive for cow remember that play we just showed you earlier about not rebounding got to stay in the play right there and get that board sto yakovich lines up the three he cant hit Applause it under 7 minutes to play on a Saturday night in the ACC two teams desperate for a conference win get is Parker Jr block dakovich showing off the defense cbell right down the lane in a hurry going too quickly and a foul called will keep the ball with cow I love the way DJ Campbell handled that up the floor he ran right up the backside of his big in the middle of the floor sissoko washes right up the back side of him he gets the paint now he loses handle right here but he gets fouled staying aggressive on the Applause road this is a Golden Bears team that is one and six away from home and the one win was at USC so still in the state of California they have not won this season outside the state of California they have played well enough to win can they find a way to do it in the final 6 minutes and 38 seconds not the first curl here look for the second their offense which has been terrific all night has gone cold they are just one of their last 10 isoko draws contact itll head to the line for two fing a shooter too much Applause Cal was two for five from the free throw line in the first half so they have already attempted six foul shots in this second half and two more coming here for Mai Soko makes the first Applause got them both Applause middle Brooks lost the handle Jaden Taylor has it 10 on the shot clock goes to work in attack mode left it off for Middle Brooks and he wasnt ready for it another turnover two bad passes in a row two turnovers for the wolf pack and buckets on the other end for Cal Andre sto yakovich delivers its a fourpoint lead for stored for Applause Music cow after backto back turnovers offensively can NC State find something here Bon pass re gathers and scores Applause Music everything going through sto yakovich trying to spin his way free 5 Seconds to shoot pump fake down the lane flying for two Andre sto yakovich hes more than a shooter I think hes sted to like Tobacco Road a little bit better now backto back buckets aggressive to the rim Music NC States got to get a good look right Applause here foul called the second best scorer in the ACC right now shows a pump fake showing go to the rim in transition and then again late clock creative getting all the way inside to finish stolen away and a foul in transition Joe Von blackshire picked the Applause pocket Debbie you spoke about it a few minutes ago the game slippage for NC State that have cost them close games all season long showing up here Applause again five turnovers in the first half for NC State seven here in the second and the officials are going to look at this now we dont have a clear path rule like the NBA has or anything like that I think theyre just taking a look at the clock right here yeah an extra 20 seconds ran off the clock so they got to move this back to 440 right now its showing 420 in the arena thats the second time thats happened tonight good catch by Tony Henderson and his officiating crew Mark madsons team has made the winning plays defensively down the stretch theyre rewarded with a fourpoint lead and Joon blackshire can add to it from the line they will be shooting the rest of the way impressive balance by Cal from inside their ability here late game to go off the bounce to get to the rim and then their ability to get to the free throw Applause line when the games on the line this is when your habit should show through the strongest and this is what Cal does they are Music downhill team they dont assist on many of their baskets only 47 on the season but theyre very good at getting in the free throw line This is the largest lead of the game for either team Marcus h back in the game right here Joe playing with four fouls lost the handle kept in play comes off the Iverson cut turns the corner its a good set for him no good on the transition three blackshire forced it Hill back into the game and a chance for two at the line but you know this is what I like about Marcus Hill he wants the ball right now for NC State this has been a question mark for the wolf back late like whos the guy Kevin Keats told us it depends on the game everythings by committee this year backto back possessions Marcus Hill trying to make something Music Music happen Hill comes up empty on the Applause first I mean Mark Matson so busy coaching his team that even his shirt came untuck now hes tucking in his shirt like a player oh for two from the line offensive rebound keeps it with Applause Music State Jaden Taylor in ATT tack mode rejected Soko swatted it into the third row Music wow down the stretch we come in Raleigh C A Sixpoint lead Mi Soko like a volleyball player with the spike Golden Bears trying to thanks Taylor looking forward to that after we finish what has been a fun back and fourth game in Raleigh Debbie Antonelli you talk about balance scoring five players of double figures for C they move the ball they have handled the pressure better in the second half theyve been able to absorb the full court pressure and take advantage of it they have attacked ncate at their own game as the 11th offensive rebound for the wolf pack let me correct myself earlier NC state has seven turnovers in the game they created a lot more Cal has 11 jump ball the possession arrow is with Cal thats the kind of toughness Kevin ke is looking at for looking from his team right now this is winning Applause time and NC State fans are thinking here we go again another onep possession game in the ACC three of their four conference losses have been decided by one possession the officials are over at the monitor Tony Henderson and Jerry heer appears to be another clock issue in the arena well this gives both coaches an opportunity for a timeout Cal with only one remaining NC state has two Cal has a foul to give and the possession arrow well actually they after they inbound it theyll change the possession hour back over back over so NC State will have it Debbie when you look at the stats to see what is separating these two teams how about NC state has only made one three the entire night while Cals made six well theres your difference in the game right now on the on the board Music Cal a fourpoint lead and the ball looking for their first road win since joining the Applause ACC after a tough loss midweek against UNC Mark mson said weve had a lot of time together to go through it felt confident about his group they played well enough to win could they close it out down the stretch rejected Brandon Huntley Hatfield has other ideas got the mismatch clear it out and let him go oneonone get out of the way Soko lost his footing Hill strong to the RAM for two and its a twopoint game with three minutes to Applause play its K yakovich double team in trouble and Mark Matson uses his his final timeout cow zero timeouts remaining for the final 2 minutes and 40 seconds of this game dangerous against an NC State team that brings a lot of pressure they go dribble weave up top and then blacker goes down the lane line and Huntley Hatfield with a big block right here thats a travel that NC State gets away with what a big play on the inside though by Marcus Hill to keep his balance he did change his pivot foot and hes playing with four fouls but hes playing Fearless NC State in their last three games its all come down to one possession a onepoint win against Notre Dame a twopoint loss to North Carolina and Wednesday a threepoint loss at Virginia Tech thats been the theme of the game right get it to this point winning time habits repetition discipline execution no game slippage meaning your details have to be on point screening angles running the floor hard and wide not fouling boxing out and closing out know your personnel on the on the defensive end I thought NC State did a really good job when Cal has not gone to their dribble weave all game until here late and when they got sakovic with the ball they trapped him thats why Mark Matson had to burn his last time out and its important to note and maybe its because Cal shares the same school colors as Michigan theyre out of timeout so you got to tell your players we cant take a timeout the rest of the way youre going old school way back right youre bringing up chis no Chris Weber no Chris Weber situations down the stretch at a twopoint game knowing that you are out of timeouts you pointed it out early Debbie Mark Manson had to burn two timeouts in the first half dealing with this NC State pressure and now they are with no safety net twopoint lead clinging to what would be their first conference Road win oh they faked his hand off to sakovic Corner three short total misfire from blackshire with 14 on the shot clock also interesting that they didnt go to sto yakovich there Applause so yakovich whos second in the ACC in scoring its been a more balanced approach tonight for Cal five scorers in double figures nobody with more than 12 oconnell pull up pop no Applause Music Applause good St yakovich as we tick down to two minutes to play trying to fade away his way free forced that one and he Applause misfired the last two cow shots have been nowhere close theyll have to trust their defense down the stretch Michael ell trying to cut DJ Campbell holding them up its been Music physical Marcus Hill Nothing But air he got a piece of that Cs last made basket came at the 504 Mark they have clung to this lead with their defense lost it Jaden Taylor has it and a chance to take the lead on this and one the strip and steel cant knock him off his line great contact balance and focus to finish by Applause Taylor NC States last lead was in the first half when they LED 2322 Cal led by as many as six you know the full court pressure is coming here you can run the Baseline Taylor fires Edy state in front the home crowd comes to life its a 7 nothing wolf pack Applause run ler all the way to the rim answers and its Cal back in front with a minute to play Applause NC St with two timeouts Kevin Keats takes one here his team trailing by one with 47 seconds Applause remaining black sheer has made some tough shots this is a great take down the lane line to the left hand black Shir of 511 graduate student a sixthe player this is why Mark maton can burn all timeouts when he has his offense in front and hes got a sixe point guard running the show lets take a look at our Star Stories for players that have been crushing it brought to you by Crush down the stretch blackshire its doovic Taylor and Hill those four have taken over and if youre an NC State fan youre thinking here we go again this story has been this season has been dominated by the story line of one possession games particularly in conference play can they find a way to win here trailing by one in 47 seconds Music remaining heres what youre talking about Jay the one possession losses and a one possession win in there as well NC State comes into the game two and four here very easily could be 4 two or 5 and one one to be honest but for the exception of that onepoint win against Notre Dame they have failed to close in these Music spots who do you go to here uh Im Im going to Marcus Hill and I think what Kevin KS told us before the game is its by feel and by whos playing well a lot of it has to do with matchups Applause heres Jaden Taylor now Huntley Hatfield musling his way in righty hooks no good and ncate doesnt have to foul technically theres 5 Seconds separating and you have one timeout got to play good d right here you got a Applause rebound now they choose to foul I thought Kevin oconnell was given the excuse me Michael oconnell was given the foul sign by Kevin Pats one of his staff was standing up calling for the foul they let a lot of time run off the clock if foul was not I mean if youre going to do that you would have done it earlier I 20 seconds earlier I didnt see Kevin Keats calling for that its one and one for DJ Campbell whos two for two from the line tonight that rims in rolled around and drops down Jay if he makes this I specifically asked Mark Madson today up three late game do you foul he said yes very well be in that situation Campbell the 75 foul shooter got it a season High 13 points for DJ Campbell threepoint game Cal doing a good job making NC State come back to the ball were going to call timeout here Mark Mansons going to foul so when you know that you want to foul you make sure you make it clear to your Music players that were not going to foul in the act of shooting youre going to foul on the dribble down not on the dribble up and you make sure that youre youre talking about boxing out on the free throw line here you have to practice this scenario every Music day and if youre NC State youre trailing by three and youve only made one three at the all at the 1625 Mark in the first half so its been a while so do you if youre Kevin Keats are you drawing up a three or a two here Im driving it hard and Im trying to get the best shot available I do think you have time but you got to execute perfectly I think hes going to have to go for the three now and then rebound and kick it out you got to go quickly though and if youre Mark Madson when do you instruct your team to foul do you let a couple seconds burn off or do you do it to I think I think you go on the pass and then the dribble so the pass and then when the ball goes down on the ground thats when you foul I would also consider entering a direct pass into the scoring area also to make it tough on Cal oconnell gets the handoff 6 seconds to work Bon pass launches a three no good and Cal survives the Golden Bears with a crucial ACC win on the road and its Cals first win
