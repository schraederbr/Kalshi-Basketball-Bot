Well the temperatures in the 20s outside but it didnt stop the crowd from getting to the castle And we are underway The Hokes in their black uniform special for tonight The Yellow Jackets meanwhile are in their old gold with black lettering and white trim Ben Hammond off to a terrific start to conference play at the point for Virginia Tech Here is Bedford who we talked about in the corner Romani Hanssbury Hes the alpha on this team the vocal leader He missires on the turnaround And with it is Lamar Washington the terrific senior point guard from Portland Oregon In the starting lineup tonight Cam Craft And he starts us off with a triple Wow Cam Craft stroking it from outside Its exactly what the Yellow Jackets need They got to start fast If you can play fast against Virginia Tech you have much better chance of getting the victory at the end of the game Off the dribble Bedford around and out Hanssbury seemed to have it for a moment but the whistle comes and a foul against the Yellow Jackets Reeves Reeds cannot afford to get in foul trouble Just picked up his first one right there He like I said earlier is the number one offensive option for the Yellow Jackets He can do it inside he can do it from the outside Hes fourth in assists on the team Hes pretty much the straw that stirs the drink for Damon Starttomires punch Bedford puts it up from deep Long rebound Lal went after it out of bounds Back to Georgia Tech The walls the guy for Virginia Tech thats got to pick up and elevate his game Hes coming off a subpar performance where he had just two points on on one of seven shooting And uh hes got to continue to crash the offensive boards and get some second chance opportunities for the Hokes Yeah the Hokes lost at number 23 Louisville on Saturday Theres another triple from Cam Craft Six quick points for the young man who averages seven per game Well Craft had two threepoint shots in their last game for just six points Hes already matched his total that he had the other night against Clemson First time tonight Neo AD Dallas has touched the basketball Misfires out of bounds Whos is it It is Georgia Tech basketball We asked Coach Young What are you worried about about this Yellow Jackets attack And he said Their ability to make the outside shot and play quickly before we have a chance to set our defense They said Hansbury was the last to touch and so Georgia Tech with it Yellow Jackets 11 and N on the year two and five in league play And how about the sizzling start to Cam Craft It might be in the 20s outside but Cam Craft has got it cooking on high heat right now here Hes just coming out being ultra aggressive That That was off of Hammonds chin Cam Craft nine Everybody else on the floor Nothing Hanssbury goes over the left shoulder again Misfires Craft pulls it down And the Yellow Jackets a perfect three for three from the floor Meanwhile Virginia Tech 0 for five Weve got an offensive foul coming against Washington on his drive to the hoop Oh Washington cant believe it He made a good strong aggressive move to the basket Yeah hes going to get whistled for pushing off with that off arm They know that lefty wants to go left If you can force a right you have a better chance for success Fullourt pressure by Georgia Tech Toby Lau finally gets it in to Jaylen Bedford who hands it off to the point guard Ben Hammond a 511 sophomore from Fairfax Virginia out of Paul the 6th High School PVIs alltime winningest players spent four years on the varsity at that national powerhouse Yeah I dont know if Hammonds going to move most improved in the ACC this year but he is much improved uh this year in the ACCs action Driving dish by him out to Hanssbury much better look And number 13 has Virginia Tech on the board Oh Hanssbury goes inside for two looks early Cant get either one of them to go and he knocks in a triple He had three triples in their last game against Louisville So not he sees his outside stroke is still on point Yeah he averages over 15 points per game leading this team Mustaf is fouled by Toby Lwal who cannot believe it Well we go back into this one here Nice dish by Hammond He finds Hansbury out there on that arc And Hansbury knows what to do with it And this guy really like the way hes upped his game He is much more in the tackle takes his body right into the chest of the defender uh and gets that contact to earn himself an opportunity to go in line knock down a couple Yeah Jaden Mustaf is a physical player for every bit of 65 They list him at 210 but he feels like hes bigger than that out of Death Catholic High School in DC And you might remember if youre a longtime ACC fan his father Jared Mustaf was a 610 ACC star for Gary Williams at Maryland back in the 80s He was the 17th overall pick in 1990 of the Knicks Yeah we had some battles when I was at Carolina He was up there Maryland and again uh in the league both in that same draft class Although unfortunately I didnt get drafted laughter but he goes in line He make one of two there Yeah Mustaf one out of two Its 103 Georgia Tech with the early lead Hammond draws the second defender Abdales Hanssbury back to Abdollis and the firstear player out of Greece misses And look at the athletic ability of Bango to be able to pull down that rebound Yeah Bongos chewing glass Thats a good thing for Georgia Tech Hes come off 10 boards Hes had 18 boards in his last two games And theyre most successful when hes uh getting on both offensive and defensive glass Craft trying to make it four for four Couldnt do it Long rebound grabbed by Mustaf Thats what Mustafs got to do Just one board at Louisville Hes got to get more on that glass Craft is hunting the threepoint shot That one barely rimmed out We call that a heat check Hes just trying to see if hes still as hot as he when he started three for three Have Dallas back outside Hammond Pull up from the foul line Smooth stroke for Ben Hammond Yeah Ben Hammond 510 They list him at about 170 lbs I think thats probably 15 pounds over what he actually weighs but hes not afraid to penetrate inside Hes got a good little float game and dont sleep on his athleticism when it comes to finishing at the rack But like you say Scott last three games he is nine of 15 on his threepoint shot So he can get you coming or going Pick and roll action Kiraak into the game Brings it back out to Washington Five on the timer Washington The step back around and out Suddenly theres a seal on that rim to our left Quickly back the other way Jaden Shute finds the open man in the corner Ben Hammond now 10 for his last 16 He was just saying how hot he was He gets the little mitty floater to go And Im telling you when you visualize that ball going through the basket your next outside shot is more likely to be true than not And when youve got chute setting up Hammond youd assume it the other way around Youve got something for the Hokes Here comes Hammond again Hes got Shu on the right Gives it to him who pulls it back out Five and a half minutes in Terrific quick first step underneath and two free throws upcoming for Christian Gerak after the break Well Ben Hammond has got in the Hokes off the launch pad once with a little midrange jump shot Then he goes to the outside and strokes the triple and he acknowledged to us after shootound today that we are not playing our best basketball right now Were playing good Were not playing great And they are constantly tweaking and looking forward now that weve reached just about the midpoint of ACC regular season play to pick it back up once again Yeah hes got 419 wins over 24 seasons I asked him if he was happy with the split and he said Well Im satisfied Im not happy He got the first one at Syracuse and wanted to get that one in Louisville and just said that we didnt play our full our best basketball So theyre looking to try to bounce back uh this evening Well Virginia Tech is seven and six this year against quad one and quad 2 opponents So thats pretty good But they are on the cut line for the NCAA tournament field of 68 As we tip things off Joe Lonardi said earlier today that if they lose they will fall out of the field Gerak going to be called for traveling So this is a really big game for the home team They cant afford to lose a game like this to Georgia Tech Yeah we already talking about tournament bubbles with Joey brackets Yeah I tell you what that was a nice little fast break Unfortunately they got the ball to Gerak right in the middle of the lane and he didnt have chance to catch the ball and then survey the defense Get whistled for the travel at the last moment there But I like the fact that Virginia Tech has ratcheted up their defense and theyre getting stops Lamar Washington dumps it off gets it back puts it up Carowak keeps the ball alive but its Abdales who comes away with it for Virginia Tech Hammond steps into the three Long rebound to Chaz Kelly just into the game for Georgia Tech Oh nice little pass in the dongo underneath but he shied away from the contact You got to go into that contact and get yourself to the foul line Have Dallas still scoreless Gak with the stick bat Well thats what Gerachs out there to do right play that solid defense clog up the middle and then score some buckets right around the painted area After falling behind 9 nothing Virginia Tech is on a 121 run Georgia Tech has missed its last seven shots since making its first three Abdales tries again No And Dongo with another rebound Yeah nice powerful rebound in traffic by Dongo The good news for Virginia Tech is theyre 12 and two against Georgia Tech here in this building Reefs turned it over to Hammond Shoot finds the cutter Shrewsbury tries to get it to Abdales Hammond penetrates spins Couple of shot fakes Good job by Washington not to bite But look how much time they have to operate it by rushing that ball down the floor Well they still got 7 seconds to shoot Abdollis this time His shot is pure Wow Virginia Tech has turned it up This is a 151 run that theyre on right now Theyre doing it on the defensive end Well he had missed his last eight threepoint shots over the last couple of games before making that one Dango with the bucket to make it 15 to 12 That was the first made field goal for Georgia Tech in the last six minutes Yeah And a nice play I got on dongo last time for shine away from the contact This time he went right inside and powered it up to the basket Well this young man right here has got all the scouts in the NBA salivating because music not only could he dish it he can stroke it from the outside Hes got two teams two games this season where he has scored more than 30 points Nice little trouble right there for him his last couple of shot attempts Yeah And thats why Coach Young is the maestro right Like he saw this young man off to a fast start and he adjusted his game plan took a little attention away from Ree and put it on Craft and then slowed him down Chaz Kelly feeds the post The big man Payton Marshall sevenfooter in a little bit of trouble Finds the cutting Kelly who puts it up and in Wow Ill tell you why That was like 14 ft of fun down there These guys were banging on each other And a nice pass out of the post there to find that cutter streaking down the middle of the lane Well Chaz Kellys careerhigh came in this building when he was a freshman at Boston College He made four of five from distance for 17 points And when I asked him to shoot around today have Dallas with the flush Whoa I didnt know the young fella had little pogo sticks for legs He went in there amongst the trees and threw that down hard with two hands Well hes every bit of 69 Strong along the baseline and Georgia Tech has its offense back in motion Jaden Mustaf with his first bucket of the night Yeah and thats what Mustaf does right That everybody thinks of him just as a score a shooter from the outside but hes a slasher Hes a penetrator Hes got live legs as well All these young guys can jump out the gym Lew tries from three and hes got it Well you dont see Lal step out there too often and stroke the three with that nearly 50in vertical leap but that one if this defense is going to sag off you got to make them honest Just his fourth made three of the season in 23 attempts He picks the defensive rebound away And here is Abdales You referenced the fact that hes gone for 30 or more twice this year Hes hit a bit of a lull relatively speaking Mike Young saying he and his staff trying to find good spots good actions for him to get it going again Big rejection inside by Marshall Lal puts it on the deck Lost it this time End to end Davi Reagan and the foul comes Theres number 10 freshman from Germany hitting some early minutes for Damon Starttomire Yeah theyre without Aai Fleming and Cely Lee So they need to find some guys that can come off that bench and give them a bump But I love that play by Toby Lau I mentioned how high a riser he is but hes also got the confidence as a a senior on this program to step behind the arc and knock in a triple as well Foul on shoot And so Remigan who apparently speaks Portuguese his mom Deborah is Brazilian and Davis great uncle is Ple the great soccer star soccer star from the 70s Now David called his uncle Teodo Apparently thats what the family called Ple They didnt call him Ple but that is the great nephew of the great Ple I love that story Thats great Thats a great background right there An athletic family obviously And I love guys that can you know sit a lot on that bench and then step in there and then provide an early punch when the team needs a bit of a bump off of that bench Although he the Cardinals said that wont make coach start happy Fouling some 90 ft away from the opponents basket I like this little backcourt pressure by Georgia Tech here on the road trying to slow down that Virginia Tech attack Shoot from way downtown A little bit of a line drive The ball went through the hoop but its not going to count Weve got a foul on the rebound going the other way Yeah big Dorne coming over the back of the defender there trying to use his length He was okay with his hand that actually kicked the ball in but look at this ball Look at the the uh chest right there into the back of Marshall Youre going to get whistled every time for that You cant be straight behind a guy on his on his uh his name plate You got to get to the side of his body off of one shoulder out of the other Shoot defending craft tight out on the perimeter Mustafa driving on Lu right through his chest and he banks it in with a little flex on the backside You cut that huh Right Yeah Those arms p uh pumping out there and those shoulder and chest Thats what Mustaf does I mentioned that this is a big strong fearless young man and he likes to play in there amongst the paint Tied at 20 A reach in on Remigan his second foul since coming off the bench for coach Starttomire Yeah and his second silly foul No need for that one right there You werent going to get that rip away You werent going to get that turnover and live ball turnover in the back court And you like I said theyre already a little thin Uh cant afford for this guy to go on back to the bench here with almost 8 and 12 minutes to play in the first half Hes got to be careful he doesnt pick up his third Well the reason is getting early minutes is like you mentioned a Kai Fleming is out took a hard fall in the loss Saturday to Clemson Its being described as general back soreness and also Moila their freshman big with a right ankle injury unavailable He did not participate in shootound today but he is here with his foot in a walking boot Bedford the Hokes after missing their first five have been getting it going but they come up empty on that trip Were still tied at 20 Yeah And to make your the point that you were talking about there as Washington goes inside and what was that dongo again chewing the offensive glass for the putback Uh thats 19 points and almost 11 rebounds that theyre missing in production Uh so D David Starter is going to find that somewhere else A thousand career points now for Bango Under eight minutes to go here in the first half Here is Dongo who just reached 1000 career points in his three years with the Yellow Jackets Craft off the curl first to reach double figures Hes got 11 Its a fourpoint Georgia Tech lead Oh Craft has come to play He gets his fourth field goal here in the first half Jaylen Bedford still scoreless for the Hokes Thanks so much We welcome you to ACC Network Basketball presented by Troll Price with Scott Williams Im Doug Sherman here at Castle Coliseum Virginia Tech and Georgia Tech And Bedford welcomes the national audience with a huge slam dunk Weve got ourselves a twopoint ball game Well Jaylen Bedford yeah he says I can knock in six triples like I did at Louisville but Im a high riser I love to get the crowd out of their seats He flushed a couple nasty jams in the warmup line that got the student section right behind that basket going crazy Dango misses Hansbury the rebound and here comes Virginia Tech Georgia Tech scored the first nine points in the ball game Virginia Tech right back in it Toby Lwel will head to the free throw line to shoot two after this media timeout After what things that Virginia Tech wants to do is they want to play quickly before Georgia Tech has a chance to set that defense averaging almost 82 points a game getting those live ball turnovers and getting it to their finishers Jaylen Bedford making a nice little cheesy uh smile there PNs latest mock NBA draft Jeremy Wu has Abdales going 25th in the first round of the Denver Nuggets and he cites inconsistencies for Abdollis this year And the other hokey who was on NBA draft boards is the man at the free throw line Toby Lw He entered the draft went through the process last spring and he came away with the realization Scott in his words I just wasnt good enough Im not ready yet So he wanted to come back Is that the uh the towel boy getting an ovation from the student section Sure did A little sweat spot behind the wall that he didnt like 73 shooter Probably after that first miss want a little bit more time to think about this second one Well didnt work Lal misses the second free throw Bayono one of the better rebounders in the ACC grabs another for Georgia Tech Here he is number 11 Last year an allconerence player Reeves unable to get there Here comes Lwal Hes got Bedford with him and he is denied Washington great hustle to get back and block that out of bounds Thatll put a smile on coach starters face because when you get a live ball turnover you dont want your team hanging their head You want them fighting back on defense and they got back there just in time to swat that one away from the highflying Bedford Look at that One more time Washington getting down in there not giving up any easy buckets Holding on to that twopoint advantage Ben Hammond the terrific point guard sophomore for Virginia Tech Hes had a terrific start to conference play 10 to shoot Have Dallas lobbs inside to the big freshman Christian Gerak Taking up a lot of space and he lays it in Look at Mac Truck down there right Hit him with that left shoulder right into the chest of the defender Got him backing up and a shot hes taken several thousand times Little right hand baby hook is true off the glass 610 260 Scott looks like somebody I know sitting right next to me Oh I wish I was 260 You kidding me I got to get on that Charles Barkley medication laughter to get to 260 Then they get another stop on the other end So a chance for Virginia Tech to regain the lead for the second time here in the first half And heres Gak again the young man out of Charles Town West Virginia Theyre going to count that basket you know as a former Tarheel at that size what its like to use that size to your best effort Yeah And he does right He plays within himself He understands this is where my bread is buttered down there in this painted area And look at his teammates now consistently backtoback trips trying to find him in that interior for easy opportunities Gird has sparked a 60 Virginia Tech run Hes got eight points Mustaf No Abdollis will dribble up and again projected as a first round pick He would have gone straight from Greece to the NBA last year had he been projected as a firstrounder They thought he might go in the second round in 2025 So hes come here to work on his game Hammond And Kelly has it for Georgia Tech Yeah Hammond was four for five from behind the arc against Louisville couldnt get that triple to fall But these second chance opportunities that Virginia Tech seems like theyve gotten three or four or five of them here in this first half is going to serve them well Dongo misses Nice setup from Mustaf Thats thats going to be the 17 foul on Georgia Tech Dongo disappointed that he didnt finish that one with a little bit more intensity around the basket Thats going to send Virginia Tech to the other line uh the other end for the free throw line for some opportunities from uh to score some points here from the free throw line So weve seen a number of Georgia Tech players making some silly fouls now that has gotten Virginia Tech in the bonus situation with still four minutes to go in this first half But with those two fouls the 69 Senagalles allconerence forward will sit down Its been a big night He has reached 1000 career points the first Yellow Jacket to have a000 points and 500 rebounds since Moses Wright the 2021 ACC player of the year but he is out with foul trouble now Oh no lane violation I think they got move for Washington squeezing into that that lane line prior to the shooter So Hansbury is going to get another opportunity for the front end of a oneonone And I just say too by Dongo congratulations to that young man A thousand points in college basketball is not an easy um plateau to attain So very happy for him Hanssbury rattles home the second He gets another one Thats cuz they got the they got the front the the violation on the first free throw Well we have another quadruple header Saturday right here on ACCN in the ESPN app starts at noon Eastern with number 22 Clemson hosting Pit at Little John And then number 16 music North Carolina will be at McCamish Pavilion squaring off against these Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets with former Tarheel Scott Williams Im Doug Sherman Glad youre with us here on a Tuesday night as we are having a review of some sort on the other side of the floor There you see Bert Smith with Tony Chiaza Tim Clockardy is our other official tonight a clock issue has them trying to sort it out Yeah I I Yeah I think what happened was on that first free throw miss the lane violation they started that clock uh and they shouldnt have moved it on the lane violation So theyre going to put a couple more ticks back up there So they got it set with four minutes 5 seconds remaining in the first half Looking up into the student section that is packed tonight because of a giveaway that has everybody in that student section wearing black The Castle Guard on sixth man night Happy the home teams up four Marshall hands it back to Kelly Gives it back to Marshall Turns down the shot And now hes fouled on the shot from behind Jaylen Bedford grabbed his arm number Well Virginia Techs on an eight nothing town school and be able to rub elbows with his childhood heroes like Alan Bristo Pretty cool Thats very cool In fact I didnt even know Coach Bristol was the baller that he was 1700 points in three years I just knew him as the Charlotte Hornets head coach when I was up the road at North Carolina in Chapel Hill Wanted to play for him down there Yeah if we added his freshman team numbers it would have been well past 2000 And that was without a threepoint shot of course Virginia Tech in the black Georgia Tech in the old gold Neo Abdales with an airball He was the last guy after shootound this afternoon who stayed on the floor probably a good 20 minutes after all of his teammates had left just working on that shot Yeah its its you mentioned he struggled a little bit last game out against Louisville Hes got one to drop here in the first half from distance Hes gone inside for a slam Um but yeah he hes got to pick it up here now to finish these last three minutes of this half to give Virginia Tech not only the lead but the momentum going to the locker room Well it has been a wild half of runs Georgia Tech scored the first nine Then Virginia Tech went on a 15 to1 run Georgia Tech answered with a 145 run And then Virginia Tech with eight unanswered to retake this fourpoint lead Second foul on Ammani Hansbury the junior from Silver Spring Maryland who has had a quiet first half here tonight Yeah And expected him to really bounce back with a big game He had he had the 12 points and the seven boards but he also had seven turnovers talked to coach Young said that was uncharacteristic for him because he is the straw that stirs the drink for this Virginia Tech Hokei squad He wanted him to have a big game here this evening And how about those two big boys getting after it Christian Gerak just picked up the foul as mentioned Hes 610 260 trying to cut off Pton Marshall on the baseline whos 7 feet 300 lb Yeah look at Brahma Bulls down there right 14 feet of fun underneath there laughter just banging at each other Now Marshalls got to make some free throws He went 0 for two last time The 65 shooter has got to start dropping these from the line Lob for Lal and he could not throw it down You could hear everybody in the building anticipate that coming because the athleticism of Toby Lwal makes you hold your breath Yeah 14 and uh 49 and a half inch vertical I we interviewed him at the last game in Notre Dame here Asked him hey you couldnt have hit 50 I mean come on He probably needed 55 to catch that that lob pass Abdollis after the air ball buries that three from right out front Yeah hard work pays off right Shooters got to shoot All that time after the morning shoot around I guess it was an afternoon shooter out here at 400 Uh pays off for him as he knocks down what thats his second triple It is Hes got eight points now He and Gerdak are the high hokey scorers Cam Craft with 11 for Georgia Tech Ben Hammond end to end with the acrobatic finish cheering Is there a dude faster in the ACC or maybe even college basketball than Ben Hammond in the open court with that ball getting to the rack I mean the hairs flopping Hes just attacking the defense And I love that finish with the off hand Look at the move right there into the chest of Washington to get the contact Youre 510 You got to figure out a way to score inside amongst the trees when he has figured it out nicely Drive it into the heart of the defender and get yourself to the free throw line Nice concentration after the contact and he completes the threepoint play So now hes got eight along with Gak and Abdollis Washington who picked up his second foul Drives the other way and lays it in I like this kid Washington And they tell you he he flat out gets it done I dont care if hes lefthanded going right or righthanded going left He can finish either hand at that rack Back sets the screen Hammond into the lane with the runner under control The sophomore out of Paul the 6th High School in DC now has 10 Well these point guards are going at each other and trying to figure out a way to give their team that lift Right now its Ben Hammond attacking backto back attempts Dongo back into the game takes the feed and throws it down Dongos that guy that needs to have more of a offensive explosion We mentioned the nearly 20 points and 11 boards this Georgia Tech team is missing Hes got to be that guy that takes the responsibility to provide more of an offensive punch Well Lu hit a three earlier in the half Misses that one Hes made only four on the season so far Dango off the pick and roll I like that pick I like that roll I like that shot Unfortunately for Dongo he couldnt measure the range Lets see if they can get a stop here at the going into the break Looks like less than two second difference between the two clocks So Virginia Tech can hold for a final look Have Dallas now hes got to go Finds Lwal who puts it up No Gerdak after it and the horn sounds music to end our first half of basketball Well it wasnt always threepoint shots of that first half They begin the second half with the basketball and theyve got to find a way to get Kesi Reeves Jr involved in the offense He played eight scoreless minutes in that first half Hes their guy He averages over 16 per game Damon Starttomire is fired up about the physical start to this second half Foul Yeah he got the foul called but hes unhappy with the execution by his team out of the locker room That ball could have easily been a jump ball in a possession error right now as favoring Virginia Tech So he was a little disappointed with this teams execution on that first play And so now thats the second foul on Virginia Techs Toby Lwal who also had a quiet first half Bayongo Hanssbury with a rebound and Virginia Tech with the basketball Sixth rebound for Bayandongo Yeah Dongos that guy that right hes got to just start playing better offensively inside midrange jump shots be more aggressive Look at going up and skying for that board He dribbles up himself Hes going to go end to end Put the shot up over and through Toby Lw Wow that was impressive right there We saw Ben Hammond kind of do the same sort of thing to the Yellow Jackets in that first half Another reach inside here by Washington Remember It was Georgia Tech that reached that penalty with four minutes to go in the first half And here we havent played a minute and theyve already picked up another team foul And the individual foul is on Lamar Washington his third Keep in mind Damon Starttomire is playing a bit shorthanded tonight Freshman guard Akai Fleming is sidelined with general back soreness after being injured in a hard fall Saturday in the loss to Clemson and Mo Cila who also reagravated what looked like an ankle injury in that loss to Clemson Hes not playing tonight and the Hokes just keep pouring it on Thats five points now for Jaylen Bedford Yeah Bedford with the triple there Remember he knocked in six in that loss where he scored 24 points at Louisville and uh comes out here to a quick start in the second half Dongo active on the offensive glass The denial though by Hanssbury and a foul on the rebounding action It goes against Hansbury Yeah they got to get Hanssberry was a little upset that he uh did not corral that defensive music rebound Give Dongo a lot of credit staying with the the shot after the block here And Hanssbury just puts that offense arm or forearm in the back there of Dongo as Dongo was losing his balance and he got whistled for the call And coach Young he has snatched Hansbury out of this game That was just the third on Hansbury right But still yes this early in the second that is a huge deal for Mike Young And Kasaci Reeves is on the board with his first two points Well we said Bedford and Reeves were really uncharacteristically quiet in that first half And now both of them scored backtoback buckets Lets see if they can get off that launch pad here in the second half Bedford tries to find Gerak inside but Mustaf is going to be called for the holding foul That is his first Yeah Big body Gak rolling down Defense is adjust You get in league play things are tougher and so they are still trying to find the right actions the right placement on the floor thats going to unlock him And for Neo Scott its not just scoring He does so many other things well including passing the basketball Yeah I like his size I like the way he moves You mentioned his court vision I like that one by Jaylen Bedford Knifing into the lane throwing that little offhand hook over the top of the shot blocker Dongo seven for Bedford Corner three Reeves No Have Dallas will dribble up after the wall got the rebound Out of bounds Itll stay at this end I like the wheels on Dongo right for a big going nearly 610 Getting back in transition getting that deflection Now this is something that uh Mike Young spent about 15 minutes working on his baseline out of bounds and his sideline out of bounds plays Lets see if it pays dividends here with a bucket Reeves defending Lwal Fight for the ball Mustafs on the floor Lals got to be careful not to pick up another foul Its Georgia Tech basketball Chaz Kelly with it on the screen and roll Weve got a personal foul thats going to go against Christian Gerak Thats number two on big number 32 Yeah And again it its the same thing Its big dongo on that pick and roll getting off of that screen so quickly Now he gains an advantage right there on Gardak by just getting off of that screen quickly and rolling hard to the bucket Thats why hes out of position getting that body contact and a chance to go to the free throw line So nice execution there by Georgia Tech on a simple pick and roll play cheering cheering Were looking ahead at February 5ths womens basketball play for K double header right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app North Carolina host Clemson at 6 Eastern and then Florida State will be music in Raleigh to take on NC State Of course the Wolfpack involved in that double dip because Kay Yao won over 700 games in her career Nearly 700 of them at NC State Dango staring straight into that Virginia Tech student section Calmly hits a pair That cant be easy right Youre a sub 65 free throw shooter You looking straight up into that wall of coeds there Anybody got a fat heads up there that theyre waving at you while youre trying to stroke the free throw Fouls on Georgia Tech number 12 Cam Craft picks up his first personal foul He is the leading scoreer in the game so far Nine of his 11 came at the start of the game came in Starttomires team looking for its third conference win of the year and looking to spoil the night for Mike Youngs team that according to Joe Lonardi came into this night one of the last four into the field of 68 and with a loss tonight Virginia Tech would be knocked out of the field of 68 for now Were still in January and Joey Brackets is already working I love that guy Year round baby Ben Hammond quick burst of speed to go around Craft He put it up on the rim but couldnt get the roll Gerak comes away with it Out to shoot Well short Trying it again Great defensive recovery by Kesi Reeves Hammond into traffic THROWS IT UP AND TOBY Luau throws it down Well there is an excellent example of if I get in trouble let me just throw it up about 11 ft in the air and let my high flyer go grab it and dunk it Well I asked Mike Young earlier today with seven NBA games being played tonight if Toby Lewis were in any of those seven games would he be the best athlete on the floor He thought about it and said Well hed certainly be among cheering the best Jaylen Bedford gives Virginia Tech its largest lead of the night Yeah this place is starting to go bananas Backto back jams has got that student section going crazy cheering cheering Craft comes up with it Shot clock at nine He puts it up Mustaf active again on the glass finally with the stick back The athleticism of Mustaf just staying around the ball Finally comes up with it Boy did Damon Starttomire and his bunch need a bucket and Mustaf delivered Nine big points for Mustaf so far tonight Gerak spins to the basket uses his shoulder to create space and the layup I thought maybe he might have traveled slot trying to slam that right shoulder into the chest of Dongo and he hit Dongo Dongos not no lightweight himself He backed up three feet Mustaf 11 points for the sophomore from Buouie Maryland Just seems like he plays under control for the most part right Hes got good body balance He gets to the spots on his floor that he likes to operate in Well he had a solid freshman year despite injuries for Damon Spot startms SC next 100 Bedford inside Gird whos having a nice night draws the foul on Craft Well Toby Lwal with that 49 and a half inch vertical on this pick and roll goes right down to the basket and his buddy Ben Hammond bangs him And then Jaylen Bedford music do not sleep on his hops He can rise with the best of them as well as he finishes off his break with a onehand jam time again We dont turn the ball over here Well except last years team made a liar of them but they are back down to just over 10 turnovers a game this year And tonight theyve taken care of the basketball Just three turnovers so far for the Hokes Jaden shoot He has been short all night long Still scoreless Hammond will try from the other side and bury it Ben Hammond now with his second triple in this basketball game But yeah you want to survive 37 shooting You got to take care of the ball like you said the first half and you got to get second chance opportunities The Hansberry getting on that offensive glass Shoot to Bedford He attacks Hangs in the air but missed it Hammond got back to keep possession for Virginia Tech Yeah Georgia Techs in trouble right now Their offense is not looking good Theyre down by double digits for the first time this evening And you can see Virginia Tech realizes we got a speed advantage on the Yellow Jackets and they are just racing the ball to the offensive end Now one of the things Georgia Tech has done well this year shoot it from three They were 37 coming into tonight third best in the ACC behind NC State and Virginia 47th in the nation But they are only 25 so far tonight Hanssburg bats it out Shoot gives it back to him They got a kicking violation down along that baseline Doug Its a little tough for us to see in the corner but again extra opportunities here for the Hokes and well see if they can capitalize Its hard to play defense two and three times each possession down You burn up a lot of injury energy and eventually your opponents going to score on you Hanssbury backing his way down the lane Good help defense by Marshall Shoot gives it up Shot clock in issue now as Hammond puts it up I tell you what he is now three for five from distance Give him 16 points for the red hot Ben Hammond who over the last 11 games is averaging 16 points per night Yeah two triples on second chance opportunities Does Georgia Tech have an answer cheering Mustaf stepped on the sideline Something must be going on with Reeks I mean Georgia Techs losing touch in this basketball game here on that music scoreboard And their teams leading score was not in foul trouble on that And um again now as Mustafs trying to do his best but he stepped on the sideline trying to attack the rack one more time So down 13 They must get a stop here or Damon Stabai has got to get a timeout and figure out how to get some points out of his team Mike Young brings 7 foot freshman Antonio Dorne from Hamburg Germany back into the game Big number 77 sets a screen that frees Hammond And now Dorne is going to be called for the rebounding foul That is his second You see the size of the screen set there on Hammonds defender though Hammond had the best look hes had all night from 15 ft I think he was surprised he was so open that uh he didnt make the the shot But again Gordon using that size down there Almost got another opportunity uh for the Hokes with the second chance offensive rebound How many times have they getting their hands on on the uh their own offensive glass Washington glances at the shot clock Hes had a quiet night for Georgia Tech Five on the timer Gets by shoot and swatted into the student section by Toby L Wow Put the wow in that one The student section is elevated way off the floor here at Castle Coliseum Official well over 10 ft and Low just smashed it into the front row I love those guys that can come over building against rival Virginia And Ben Hammond will get consideration for the N ACCs most improved player of the year award Juke Harris at Wake Forest Day Ames at Cal Ben Allen Luben at NC State among those who have really taken steps forward this season in the ACC Well with a short shot clock to work I dont know if coach Dmire wanted his sevenfooter Marshall throwing up a twohanded threepoint shot from behind the yard So you can just see right now Yellow Jack is just not executing well offensively as Hammond goes to the rack and gets denied by Dongo Here comes Chaz Kelly And now the last two players make it up court Its kind of like 1978 in the NBA cheering Eight to shoot Dongo going to work Marshall taps it out Washington able to throw it off the leg of shoot Out of bounds A great job So the Yellow Jackets keep the ball They have been hustling right Theyve gotten back on defense Theyve got some deflections gotten some blocks but just on this offensive end its been a complete mystery for the Yellow Jackets Even that possession even though they got it into Dongo the shot clock was down around 6 seconds And his left hand jump left shoulder right hand jump is moving away from the basket They got a fresh 30 seconds to work with on this possession Coach Dtomire trying to direct his squad on what set he wants from the run But they got to regardless of the set they got to execute Washington dumps it off Dongo this time able to finish First bucket for the Yellow Jackets in nearly four minutes Any good play right Little elbow screen Washington takes it hard to the baseline Two defenders go with Washington and as a result hes able to slip that little lefty pass into his big fella who chews inside gets a little bit something to gets these yellow jack something to feel good about Low Here comes Mustaf Georgia Tech down 11 with the basketball When is Reeves going to enter the fight here offensively Hes done absolutely zero in this basketball game Here he comes to take the basketball Rises up He hurt Scott Williams I dont want to talk bad about him but hes such a phenomenal player Assistant coach Bonsy Wells calls him his favorite player He says Scotty all he wants to do is hoop He doesnt care about anything else and I want to see that young man be able to play at his best So Im calling him to the mat here to finish this last 10 minutes strong And Dallas blocked by Andongo And here comes Kesi Reeves one on two And the young man who is a twice published author told me recently hes got a third book in mind that would be on philosophy Mustaf missed the layup but a nice attack and a great block by Dongo for his second rejection here in this second half The Hokes get it in close Dorne no On second effort able to put it in after seven consecutive misses Virginia Tech scores again to make it an 11point ball game Dornes just a little too big for Dongo when he gets him in that static situation down there Hes just putting that extra 20 pounds into Dongo and Dongo cant handle him cheering Dongo missed everything and trots back up floor He looks like hes out of gas Hes out of gas defensively and a wild right hand hook that hit nothing working on Kelly Coach Starttomire sees the same thing Hes got Marshall ready to come in a dongo on the next dead ball Georgia Tech still fighting Mustaf is fouled in transition by Hammond Thats the fifth team foul on Virginia Tech Virginia Tech number three Well the Yellow Jackets mustered only 16 points in their loss at Clemson right now with 44 points with under nine minutes to play I dont know if theyll reach that plateau or not but this young man here Mustaf he has been the one consistent player from the Yellow Jackets providing that good energy and um trying to push the tempo So Mustaf hes hes leading all scores Actually hes tied with Craft with 11 points here in this game Well we saw Dongo go out He has played 25 minutes but hell catch his breath on that Yellow Jacketss bench He definitely needed a blow Now Marshalls got to come in here and and play good defense and protect the basket the way Dongo had And Tech could use some offense from Cam Craft again Here he is with the basketball Had 11 in the first half but Marshalls going to be called for the illegal screen Its a turnover to give it back to Virginia Tech The ninth turnover against Georgia Tech When youre trying to cut into a doubledigit deficit you cant have those careless turnovers And Dongo with that little dribble handoff Hes got to realize I got to get these these big feet set before I smash into the defender Trying to free my guard coming around the wing Bedford of Dallas Gerak Hanssbury and shoot Five on the floor for the Hokes Abdales creates a little space Hes got a lot of moves a lot of ways to get his shots up that are very much professional level Yeah and thats what these scouts are seeing right there They theyre quick to notice that right away And then another another poor offensive possession I dont think they were trying to get a time out there And finally after about 3 seconds officials gave Mustaf the uh the signal there for the whistle and timeouts before they turn that basketball over But again another disjointed offensive possession Well step away from Castle Coliseum and come back to cheering if Georgia Tech is going to get back in this thing theyve got to find some offense They have really been stuck here in the second half to score any sort of points Theyve not been able to get on a roll Mustafs had a good game 11 points nine rebounds but thats an air ball Craft back out to him Mustaf to beat the buzzer missed the iron and its a shot clock violation So coming out of the timeout thats the best the Yellow Jackets could do with a basketball You know I Ive been kind of beating up Georgia Tech not be able to get anything going offensively Let me start giving some credit music to Virginia Techs defense here not only in the second half but all game long They have really kept Reeds quiet and theyve gotten I guess more than enough opportunities where theyve gotten Georgia Tech to take a shot and theyve rebounded their own defensive blast very well Georgia Tech has missed its last 11 threepoint shots Mike Young is incredulous Yeah good job Both arms out kind of telling the officials I do not believe you just whistled my big 260 pounder for an illegal stream But they got Marshall with the same call a couple trips down the floor before and sometimes these officials get themselves into these cold dur Lets see if Gerak just moves to the left just a little bit Yeah just Yeah Now I dont know who that was but that sold that but maybe Ree sold that a little bit more Kelly sold it and the officials called it Mustaf no Shoot the rebound Gerak by the way has three fouls He stays in the game for Mike Young Yeah When has a Yellow Jacket player taken a shot You said yes Like theyve gotten some buckets inside but from the outside they cant buy anything And one for Jaylen Bedford Hes got 11 points in counting Yeah Jaylen Bedford Uh much the way we kind of hope Kuwaiti Reed would for Georgia Tech has picked up his offense here in the second half That his fourth field goal here in this second half just being aggressive and attacking the big shot blocker inside Dongo and getting to the outside of his play and good concentration after that contact there Mike Young says of Jaylen Bedford who misses the free throw old guys want to win And Jaylen says because he played a couple of years to start his college career at the junior college level Jos create dogs Were hungry And I wear that title loud and proud You see that when hes on the floor here at Castle Georgia Tech facing its largest deficit at 13 of the night Reeves smooth on the turnaround Exactly right Like hes got that ability Little spin move there hard right at the defender with the right hand Little spin move tight uh under control and then back on balance to knock down the midrange jump shot Just want to see more of that out of that young man these next six minutes Hansbury gives to Gerak who is fouled Tell you what the big man the freshman has had a good game tonight for Virginia Tech The fouls on Chaz Kelly But Christian Gerach from Charles Town music West Virginia would drive 65 miles to Washington DC to go to high school He spent a couple of years teaming with Ben Hammond at Paul V 6 before transferring to Gonzaga College High School to play his last two years Thats a big time program A couple of bigtime programs And he has music played very well here tonight How about the numbers in that wonderful New Years Eve triple overtime win over UVA 17 points 19 rebounds tied for the most by an ACC player this year Yeah thats getting it done You see his last seven games Its not the points and the rebounds Its not the statistics Its the force in which he plays inside Hes doing a great job looking for point number 11 to go along with seven rebounds So solid effort for this young fella And Christian is a Navy brat His father Richard was an offensive lineman at the Naval Academy And then Richard married Meredith who is 61 And thats how you come up with Christian Gerdak who is 610 260 pounds and quite a ball player And Ill tell you what Mike Young has done a masterful job with his staff this year retooling this roster Lot of good freshman and they did very well in the Porter Theyve also done very well in the international market headlined by Neo Abdales That comes from having money as well They have made a greater commitment financially around here That ball somehow wound up going through the rim Yeah Mustafa hard to the rack He didnt get the clean flush but boy does this young man have some athleticism around that basket That bomb rolled all the way around every part of the rim before falling in Would you call that a dunk or is it a dink Its a power layup How about that laughter How about that He took it hard to the rack and that thing He got it down Thats the most important thing Two points either way Near double double for Jaden Mustaf who stays in the ball game Hes out there with Reeves Kelly Craft and Dongo Yeah dont go anywhere because Virginia Tech has not put away Georgia Tech They still got some a lot of time left and starting to show some life Well we have another quadruple header Saturday right here on ACCN And the ESPN begins at noon Eastern with number music 22 Clemson hosting Pittsburgh And then number 16 North Carolina will take on these Yellow Jackets from Georgia Tech down in Atlanta 18 points for Ben Hammond after the two made free throws Kelly throws to the rim Dongo couldnt get there Pass was off the mark Ammani Hanssbury Thats one of those passes you have to throw it It has to connect like you cant come down when youre down 18 throw that ball up there and then not complete the play or draw a foul Then they come down the other way And Toby Lal doing what Toby La likes to do getting right in front of that rim with power He went up they had to foul him Toby Lau music heads to the free throw line Well as of Monday ACC teams have produced 38 quad one net wins In the Monday net 12 of the 18 ACC teams rank among the top 75 Five ACC teams among the top 30 Duke Virginia Louisville among the top programs And there is Virginia Tech at 53 They are right on the cut line for the NCAA tournament as weve reached the midpoint of the regular season of ACC play And this is a big win if they can close it out to make sure they dont slip up against one of the teams lower in the standings Who on that list surprises you the most Im going to give you mine in Miami I was just kind of curious where you like cuz this has been a big turnaround this year for the ACC cheering Well tell you what in the preseason poll Virginia Tech was picked either 12th or 13th So thats a surprise And you know theyve got a big one coming up on Saturday when the Duke Blue Devils come to town And that will be their last quad one opportunity here at home this season So a big chance against one of the real heavyweights in the country The Blue Devils have been playing very very well Yeah And they better take care of the basketball Young We worked on those baseline out of bounds plays so much And finally Georgia Tech gets an opportunity here to get a turnover with that fullcourt pressure And then look at the next five for Virginia Tech My goodness But the other quad one opportunities as you see at NC State at Clemson and at Miami are all on the road So if they could possibly pick off Duke youd see their net numbers improve dramatically Hammond going for the spectacular bounce pass off the glass for Lu And Mike Young is just looking at his assistant coaches on the bench saying What on earth was that Choing a little bit out there And I dont know if coach Young is as real appreciative of the way that some of the players might have wanted that one to be finished off Its a 14point game Yes But like I said theres a lot of time left to play in this And Ive seen stranger things happen in basketball than a team come behind by 14 Thats that can happen quite a bit especially at the college level if Reeds could get hot Now Ben Hammond may have caught a little bit of a break because of the foul against Georgia Tech sending Wild to the line and take another look Yeah I mean theres nothing much to say about that other than something I really practiced in the layup line and he said Ill throw it up off the glass for you You use that 50in vert and go get it The best athlete Ive ever coached said Mike Young And we got a taste of it there earlier here in the second half A spectacular block shot by Lal He had five blocks against Louisville on Saturday as careerhigh but none of them topped what we saw here earlier tonight How about the onehanded catch gather and layup by Bayern Dongo Yeah Dongo you know when when hes got some you know wind and a little life in his legs hes one heck of a player but you can tell when his uh tank is empty he doesnt get back on defense He doesnt finish around the basket as well Hammond with four and a half minutes to go in the second half gets by Washington puts it up off the glass This time he was trying to score Lal was there but a foul on the rebound Yeah and theyre going to have over the back now Thats going to be the double bonus here for Virginia Tech as Georgia Tech has hits that 10 point 10 foul plateau Low going to go to the line See if he cant make two free throws uh this particular trip Foul number four on Lamar Washington to the line Number one Tiffany Low shooting two The Nothing But Net Crew has you covered tonight when we are done here in music Blackburg Then again Thursday night at 10 Eastern time after our womens basketball double header Thats right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Well the while now with 10 points to go along with those five boards and like you said one really big shot that he sent to the student section Well there are oldtimers who have been coming to this building for decades sitting near us who have said theyve never seen a block shot wind up in the stands like we saw here tonight by Toby Lwal Fourth foul on Hansbury Lwal is spectacular and hes worked on his body Hes gotten bigger and stronger Two years at VCU this his second year at Tech and again he considered going to the NBA or trying to make the NBA after his junior year but after testing the waters decided to come back to Blackburg for one more goround and he is certainly on NBA draft boards just based on nothing other than the fact that he is one of the best athletes on the planet Yeah And hadnt been playing basketball a whole lot long time So the potential is uh skyhigh for this young man Heres the block again Yeah I love I love that because like he came from the other side of the lane to go get that And uh thats when you just got you know you got a player thats got some dog in him that will do things outside of his own area to try to help his team into the first row of the stands Ive never seen that before Which is a good 8 ft off the floor and well off the baseline And and theres the official vertical nearly 50 in the NBA combine record is less than that Here he is with the basketball Young man from England have Dallas beats the shot clock off the back iron Gerak is going to be whistled for the foul and we will have free throws coming up Final 341 remaining in regulation Gerak check out a game and theyre Virginia to Virginia hoaxes classmates have provided a nice little performance here You got four guys uh in double figures scoring and Valis has got eight points right now He got eight at the half didnt he Hes a kind of a quiet second half Hes been happy watching his teammates success While the Yellow Jackets have sc struggled to score in the second half Virginia Tech has just extended what was a sixpoint halftime lead They have four players in double figures led by Ben Hammonds 18 points Hes got the basketball now And Abdales is one of those guys youd think would likely be in double figures He has eight so he could become the fifth Pokey in double digits The last time Georgia Tech hit a three was 35 game minutes ago They hit their first three to start the game and then basically the faucetss been turned off Cant get one going now What are they Three for 15 but they got a break there as to the Wild picks up his third personal foul on that offensive screen Like thats thats been kind of like the call of the day for this officiating crew If a big steps out there and moves any part of their uh upper torso into the defender theyre going to call that offensive foul every time Sounds like you know a little about that Former centerp power forward at North Carolina and 15 years in the NBA Low smiling after getting his fourth foul Well Douggee you know I am the alltime foul leader in the ACC And Im pretty sure after nearly 35 years that 36 years rather that record still stands I would have thought Armando Bacott might have caught you only because he played so many more games than you did True that He did play over 170 basketball games but they never whistled him for a foul cuz he was a star laughter Official officials were just hating on me I think because I complained about every foul call They wanted to see my little my that canary come off the porch Its all coming out now All right If a visiting player misses backto back free throws you know the story here in Blackburg Free bacon cheering with the pressure on Mustaf makes the second and draws the boobers They are not happy Those those kids wanted that candy meat Well what a night around the ACC Couple of overtime affairs Pittsburgh survived Wake Forest at home 8076 before our game here as part of the double header on ACC Network And Virginia Notre Dame has gone final in double overtime The 17th ranked Cavaliers pushed to the limit 197 winners tonight in South Bend What an excellent ball game Feel a little bad for Micah Struberry and his bunch Thought they were going to get that one A buzzer beater Sent the game to second overtime And uh the Cavaliers come out on top But a another foul down here on Virginia Techs going to send Georgia Tech to the line to shoot a couple free throws Cut into that 10point deficit Um and they still got 2 minutes and 38 seconds to go Were going to have a one possession game on Arlington Up on the jumbotron The fans take another look but its not going to change the fact that that is Toby Lewiss fifth foul of the night Virginia Tech is shooting sub 35 in this game and they are up by 10 Its just a testament to how hard this Mike Young squad works the offensive class getting second chance opportunities getting points into paid getting transition buckets and getting themselves to the free throw line Theyve shot 18 free throws uh on the evening to line for Georgia Tech number three Jayen Gust Jayen Must cheering at the line How about Jaden Blue 14 points 11 boards Hes been the one player that I can continually point to for Georgia Tech that has brought on every possession on both sides of the court And there you see its his second career double double I told you dont go anywhere Yellow Jackets hanging in there Yeah a couple threes and a couple stops Uh and Virginia Techs doing just enough to give this game away Another turnover So 16 points for Mustaf Two off his careerhigh but the ball is given right back to Virginia Tech To starter cant believe it He got exactly what he wanted a chance to score two points with the clock stopped and then they get the turnover but give it right back with a sloppy play Thats their 14th turnover And that is a recipe music for losing on the road So now theyre going to have to try and force another Virginia Tech turnover And and nine of those 14 in the second half Douggee have Dallas breaks the pressure This Virginia Tech team started the night at number 53 in the net and they have been handling their business Bedford no Long rebound comes to Hammond and hes going to work some more clock Yeah it it was it was Hansbury on that glass keeping that ball alive Poked it out to Hammond Theyre going to take another 20 seconds off this game clock Yeah rebounding continues to be an issue for Georgia Tech this season Minus 8 here today They are 321st in the nation in rebound margin But still the Yellow Jackets keep coming Reeves with the layup to make it 6559 Hey hey backto back stops transition bucket four quick points with a 9 Georgia after the timeout You would think Mike Young would have something drawn up to get a good look Have Dallas and Hammond in the back court Tech still not in a hurry Bedford with it now Back to Hammond He walked got away with the travel Now Bedford with the shot clock at four puts it up Its an air ball Georgia Tech has it down by six Washington off the hesitation right to the rim Oh not more than what 10 seconds came off of that game clock and we are ourselves a fourpoint basketball game Georgia Tech The game of runs continues and Virginia Tech forced to burn another timeout as the Yellow Jackets have scored the last 11 points in this ball game to make it a ball game here in the final minute Turnover for Virginia Tech will spell death for the Hokes Hanssbury gets it in to Bedford And the Hokes need to run offense They cant just take the air out of it Theyve got to get a good shot here Yeah Good 25se second differential between the shot clock and the game clock Virginia Tech will try to take as much off of that can and oh no foul on the perimeter is going to send the Dallas to the line Jaden Mustaf with his fourth personal foul Yeah bear in mind Neo has not been to the line He hasnt done anything offensively in the second half Lets see if he can calmly step the line and knock in a couple freebies here He is a 68 shooter from the foul line but he is just three of 15 from the floor Calmly sinks that one as a team The Hokes are 14 of 19 from the stripe tonight And Georgia Tech with nearly 40 seconds to play in this game does not need to come down and crack up a threepoint shot unless they get a really good look Down five Where does Georgia Tech go Lamar Washington into the lane Dumps it off Dungo lays it in Timeout called Georgia Tech has it down to three That was it That one missed free throw now makes it just a put but adding a lot of drama that he did not want on the evening Using his ninth different starting lineup of the season Virginia Tech for Mike Young now trying to limp to the finish line and get to the 40minute mark first They got big bongo guarding the inbounder trying to get a deflection or a steal here Hansbury throws the long pass Its dangerous And the foul is called as Bedford slam to the hardwood Wow That could have ended very badly for Virginia Tech Well earlier this afternoon we saw them working on this pass where they would throw it up high to Toby Lal and hed sky up over body everybody and grab it But hes on the bench He fouled out So they go to the highflying Bedford skies music up there and hes going to get an opportunity to go to line and shoot two free throws a 64 shooter If youre Georgia Tech not a whole lot of time came music off that clock and you got a sub 70 shooter on the line with a lot of pressure And McGrad transfer from UNLV misses the first The door remains wide open for Georgia Tech Look at that dude Tell me tell me he wasnt a little nervous there They were everyone was smiling laughing and having a good time when they were up by 15 Now now its getting a little tired Theres a big make right here for Bedford Hes got to get this down And he does cheering Now I think Georgia Tech you got to get a three here Washington takes it right to the bucket Gets the quick two Lamar Washington Quick two makes it a twopoint game A turnover here and a three for the win into shoot Virginia Tech got the ball into the right hands He and Hammond playing keep away And then the foul against Mustaf in the back court will send Colonel Maurice Hammond watching his son Ben Making the first trying to put this one back to being a twop possession game Yeah 85 shooter He walked up there with a lot of confidence That thing hit the back rim and was down The last 10 games for Virginia Tech hes been brilliant Give him 20 tonight Its a fourpoint lead cheering 10 seconds Washington taking a lot of time Finally gets it up Too strong Virginia Tech has it And the foul comes with only 33 on the clock And now the folks here at Castle Coliseum can exhale Maybe exhale And I think theyre headed for the exits They realize with 33 theres not enough time left for Georgia Tech to steal this victory But boy they came on like gang busters here uh in the latter part of this second half to make this a contest And I know Coach Stomire wont be happy with the overall performance the way his team played for 40 minutes but hell be proud that they fought to the top final horn and that give them something to build on for their next basketball game Bedford connects on foul shot number one Yeah doesnt really get any easier for him They got a host of North Carolina coming down there uh to Atlanta Have Dallas goes for the steal Reeves beats the buzzer with the three And that is it You You are right with Duke coming in on Saturday Virginia Tech couldnt have afforded to drop this one They could not They could not hands
