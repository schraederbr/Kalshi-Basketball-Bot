game against Duke at Cameron on Saturday as you said they try to bounce back but theyre here on the road in WinstonSalem and this is a raucous atmosphere Carolina and wake from the Joel Lee Cassell with the ball in hand Pete Nance Andrew Carr jumps Center Carr wins it and away we go so the last couple of games Steve Forbes the head coach for Wake Forest has gone with a smaller lineup now hes back to the more traditional big lineup because of the size of North Carolinas front line Applebee cant connect from Deep to start yeah 20 in white Davion Bradford makes his first start since November meanwhile the North Carolina starting five three guys that get at least 16 the game with the backcourt of Davidson love and this guy Armando baycat spinning against one on one and rimmed out theres cam Hildreth Caleb love starts on him first meeting between these teams back in early January leaky black was on cam Hildreth but today its black on 30 in white damari Monsanto who hit eight threes in the Wake wins Saturday against Notre Dame eldrift pivoting his way into a threesecond call really good defense by bacon holding his ground not fouling Hildreth didnt have an outlet North Carolina guarding one pass away once the ball went inside good d by the heels who won that first meeting in Chapel Hill at the beginning of January watch Armando bake out how much he stays in constant motion which is really tough to keep him off the glass as well because hes always moving one of the nations best rebounders Davis slashing had a block by Bradford back to that big lineup as you said and Davion Bradford makes an impact leaky black the pick and slapped great anticipation by leaky black playing up the line in transition that pass from one side of the floor to the other is two flat and it takes too long great anticipation and turnovers were a big problem for wake in the first meeting especially late in the game against Carolina Kyrie Appleby with the first weight points and hes so good at keeping RJ Davis on his hit right I mean he comes off that ball screen and he holds his position and locks up his hips with his to be able to get that free shot post entry for bake out one on one and Bradford commits the foul see when Armando baycott works that hard to get the ball and catches it that deep you cant bring the double hes too quick turning to score and he buries Bradford in a paint so two minutes and six seconds into this game is when North Carolina will attempt its first free throws and Hubert Davis pointed out multiple times post game Saturday and again with us here today in the nice way that Hubert Davis always does that they only shot three free throws against Duke its hard to believe to believe that North Carolina would only go to the line three times and not go to the line at all in the second half for a team that gets there quite a bit as baycat splits at the strike well North Carolina on the season averages well they make more free throws than their opponents attempt the extent some pressure here on Wake Forest who handles it and sets up the offense and damari Monsanto stays hot from Saturday I mean you gotta really come and close to space on Monsanto he made eight threes in the Notre Dame win on the road Applause one of the best threepoint Shooters in the country 42 for the season and he shoots a ton of them Pete Nance gets to the post on Andrew Carr and thats a good sign for Nance who was quiet Saturday well thats what you call the Barclay he just backed you down backs you down until he gets inside the paint and just turns and uses that frame to score over the top the king of the fade away Pete Nance the Northwestern transfer who was held to Two Against The Blue Devils Appleby through the lob for Brantford Kansas State transfer going one on one with Armando baycat two in effect that is a welldesigned play by Steve Forbes because its the ball screen and the roll to the rim and the lift on the strong side which takes the Tag Away which means you get the one on one inside this is what you want to try to take on Armando Baker oneonone and try to put him at a deficit defensively and try to draw that foul exactly like Bradford just did because you saw at the bottom of the screen leaky black hes got to worry about tomorrow Monsanto yeah you when Damaris Spritz back up and lifts that opens up that oneonone opportunity inside wake by three they forced the Davis turnover Hildreth pushes on the step through and hes swatted by black Carr tries to rescue it and Monsanto kept it alive Carr on a baseline driving blocked by Nance two blocks for the heels but the Deep still with it with the shot clock winding down Hildreth no Applause Davis pulls up cant knock it down rebound car Applebee with love on his hip high off the glass with the left hand absolutely beautiful with his off hand playing in that ball screen in the middle of the floor the lead is five they got spinning off the glass and he wanted a foul as well what a move I mean Armando baycott always knows where he is on the floor when he catches where he catches he feels the contact on his backside with the defender so good in the paint his first main Bucket from the floor after he didnt attempt a field goal the final 12 plus minutes Saturday see that play right there Bradfords got to really challenge him hes already put Armando baycott was put a foul on him early they bang on the Block love kicks black hoists off Target from that corner spot that he loves in its last Touch by Armando big cut sends us to a timeout five minutes in Aaron Winston Salem well we told you about the Stars coming in and Tyree Appleby hes got four for Wake Forest nicely done with the left hand and Armando baycat one of the top scorers in the ACC they should have college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance its easy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom last year when these teams met here in WinstonSalem it was a Wake Forest 9876 win alondes Williams and Company celebrated and Armando bacon said to us today that he remembered the locker room after that game he said it felt like someone died and he said to us we thought our season was over so as you compare through 23 games this year and last year for Carolina take stock of them its very similar right and so what does that tell you that theres plenty basketball left in front of them and theres lots of opportunity with the race and the league so tight and with seating for the NCAA tournament still a lot to be determined out of a timeout what do you want to see from them offensively theres a substitution so trimbles on the floor and you know I was interested in Kayla glove not getting any shots but now hes not on the floor bacon steps out and sticks a jump shot well the other thing that Hubert Davis told us today is that every possession down the floor he would love for Armando Baker to get a touch so that was definitely the emphasis to start the game he said they need fast break points and they need touches Marsh alive from Applebee that is rinse and repeat with those two yeah and the five position for Wake Forest between Bradford and Marsh combined to shoot 85 percent inside a lot of it is plays like that Marsh is the dunking dick out feeling it no Bobby Clinton The Freshman climbs for the rebound and wake pushes up three Bangkok would be over five from the season from three black the strip Appleby hunting him down and commits a foul on leaky black another good defensive play by leaky black we got him for two steals right here he just blows up that ball screen action he does not let his player get to that screen for Appleby leaky Black coming off his first career DoubleDouble 13 and 10 for the fifth year senior at Cameron on Saturday hey coming up next well take you to Rupp Arena for Oscar shibway and Kentucky hosting Ricky Council the fourth and Arkansas 15 more rebounds on Saturday countrys leader in rebounding then Zach Edie and fifth Armando Baker what a night right for boarding on the boards Armando Baker here Oscar shibwe next Applause Jalen Washington getting run with baycat on the bench after a hot start blackmus both Appleby off the ball screen to the couple hes just killing North Carolina right now in that middle third playing in that ball screen action Tyree Appleby getting whatever he wants has been able to get all the way to the rim several times Steve Forbes always talks about the verb navigating for the work a guard does with ball screens and says Applebees one of the best hes had Davis short offensive rebound leaky black and both teams are in drop coverage in that middle ball screen action so RJ Davis is going to have that midrange jump shot available to him tonight Applause Trimble moves it for Washington who can step out and hit shots but he swirled it out this is going up if you dont get a hand in his face quickly there it is Santo short long rebound tipped out to Appleby in the backcourt Monsanto again yes what a weapon he is for Steve Forbes offense it does not take him long to get his feet under his shoulders and quickly into his shooting form offensive foul on Jalen Washington Applause this is the kind of hustle you gotta have at home look how quickly off the offensive rebound the relocation and the score by Monsanto its a 70 Wake Forest run you said it he hit eight of them in South Bend Indiana on Saturday we asked him today for the mere mortals Among Us what does that feel like he said hey its a normal day Applebee its the roll and the lead is 10 for Wake Forest here at home and Applebees got eight I dont think Steve Forbes could draw up a better shot chart for Tyree Appleby to start the game everythings in the paint right now off that middle action turbo handoff for Caleb love and a floater its the side of the rim and it belongs to Wake Forest on the other side Tyree Appleby the second best scorer in the ACC off to a great start hes in the paint over and say what are you 2728 you got a couple of kids hes had quite the career and what a player for Wake Forest this year I mean when you look at alondus Williams last year and Tyree Appleby what a couple of great pickups by Steve Forbes in the portal hes getting four buckets and has assisted on two others then both those guys playing with the ball in her hands and theres Monsanto what a great find its the change of pace off that screening action and Appleby who also leads the league and assists reads it so well the lead is 13 loves short at The Rim Hubert Davis has RJ Davis and Armando bacon on his bench right now as he searches Applause its March the North Carolina has got to change up their boss green defense in the middle third because Tyree Appleby is absolutely killing him on a 140 run love cant stop it offensive rebound black and Carolina will slow things down theres the Freshman Seth Trimble gives it off to Black theyre sitting on nine points ninth its in Washington The Freshman on the FaceOff now Hubert Davis told us today in shoot around he wanted to get Jalen Washington some extra minutes he really thinks the upsides absolutely incredible he can stretch he can shoot the three hes got range in his minutes continue to get more productive Apple be on a step back to strong rebound black yeah I dont know why he took that shot hes looking at Steve Forbes going my bad because hes had so much success getting around the corner on North Carolina Trimble on a step through to the rim so youve talked about this ball screen and how Carolina has tried to defend it what do they need to clean up against Appleby well theyre theyre going in drop coverage so that means the screeners defender is standing at the logo well theyve got to be a little bit more active and try to turn him into a passer and not let him turn the corner there Damian Williamson got Trimble in the air but I also believe good offense always beats good defense North Carolina might have to put more pressure on the ball not try not to let them use the screen maybe consider a different coverage in the middle of the floor Caleb love throws it away its a Carolina turnover their third we know Tyree Appleby is dangerous off the bounce he comes off the Stagger on the top of the floor and he throws back to Monsanto whos wide open and organized leads the ACC and assists hes got four so far in the game and now he attacks and left it short after Caleb love had almost picked off the inbounds pass from mid Court love slices and his foul thats a great take by North Carolina in transition before wake Force gets organized with their defense Caleb love catches it immediately gets to that strong right hand off the bounce and you see its two fouls uh Davion Bradford the seven footer who had stepped into the starting lineup I think this is what North Carolina needs to do Mike is get to the free throw line right now Music its NBA Wednesday doubleheader starts in Boston with a big Eastern Conference matchup Celtics and Sixers 7 30 Eastern and then Kyrie Irving you may have heard hes now with the Mavs they take on the Clippers itll be Kyries debut our coverage starts with NBA Countdown at seven here on ESPN and the app how did they do that how did they get to the line more I think they got to move the ball reverse the ball switch sides of the floor make Wake Forest guard some Closeouts look to attack off the bounce and play through bacon now that hes back on the floor the lead is 11 for Wake Forest 11 minutes in another guy who likes to Barkley his way to the cup cam hildred Wake Forest clears it out they have the ISO on the strong side and they just go to work first points for the sophomore from England and then bacon went spinning but couldnt finish better pick up Monsanto Bobby Clinton will back it out and hand off to Appleby pop up top for marsh exclusive excuse me that was Clinton on the floor I thought that was Monsanto and a marsh lob hes got a half dozen and Tyree Appleby is steering the ship Davis with a tough shot attacking he saw eight points five assists for Tyree Appleby at the controls now Hildreth drops off for marsh backing down on baycot who stays right with him and Marsh scores anyway I mean Marsh usually scores on putback dropoffs rim runs thats a post move for Mike Marsh 55 buckets and 45 of them were dunks for the seven footer from England Davis on a misfire Appleby with his foot on the gas Damian Williamson in the lane Steve Forbes is fired up and Huber Davis needs a timeout ball movement playing in transition the leave at the front of the rim on in complete control at the house knocking it down from another area code in Jordan Hawkins he has 14 in this game last time these two dudes played he only had eight UConn feeling good wake feeling good early on back to Mike and Debbie in WinstonSalem all right Kevin thanks very much and great day of college basketball weve got four ranked on ranked matchups around the country on the mens side today Steve Forbes and the Demon Deacons with the big lead Armando bacott cuts into it for Carolina well I love coming off the timeout get the ball inside to Bangkok let him go to work and then picking up some full court pressure maybe to pick up a change in Rhythm take Wake Forest a little bit deeper into their options offensively starting five on the floor for Hubert Davis Hildreth left it short no Tyree Appleby coming off the timeout its a kick on cam Hildreth Applause good chance for Coach Forbes to give Tyree a few minutes on the bench and thats a rarity for Tyree Appleby whos leading this week for his team to check out their resume big chance for them here at home this represents a quad two as bacott scores again for the heels now I would go right to Armando baycott until Wake Forest figures out how theyre going to stop him hes got nine Applause heres a chance right now without Appleby on the floor to bust up some of that middle ball screen action Elder have had some trouble with the handle that down love anyway love the rebound good defensive Patience by Caleb love not the foul in that situation Applause no foul calls ball carried off the underside of the battle should have been out of bounds assistant wake attacks and Williamson had a roll off Applause tough catch for baycats spinning for two more thats an incredible pass by RJ Davis and a better catch by bacon in traffic a 60 tar heel run inside of that Carolina huddle trying to fire up his team which is trailed by as many as 17 in this first half I thought it was a tremendous shoot around by coach Davis today was a locked in an emphasis on how theyre going to guard Monsanto and what they were going to do on the offensive end with baycott the last thing he said to him is guys just play together and play fun play have some fun play like youre enjoying it Applause with apple be back into the game love had him locked up along the Baseline and now less than 10 to shoot Hildreth backs it out against Davis off the car screen a switch shot clock winding down on Applebee a rounding out rebound Nance another possession Another baycat Touch she keeps going to work but he walked with it its a travel on Armando Baytown Caleb love has the assignment right now on Applebee and if Appleby gives it up you need to face guard him and not let him get it back I think thats what Huber Davis was asking Nick Caleb love to do the last possession thats something that worked in the first meeting between these teams in January against Appleby set Trimble The Freshman backup guard played a big part in that especially in the second half Monsanto I mean that is a thing of beauty the way he gets his feet down and lets it fly if youre a shooter you know how hard it is to do what he just did Applause he Lit Up Notre Dame like we said Mike Bray said there were some NBA shots from Monsanto as love missed an easy one at the cup Applause Monsanto hunting another and he gets fouled on the perimeter by puff Johnson you see thats what you got to do is you gotta close that space quickly on Monsanto because he is going to let it fly uses the bounce creates some separation lets everybody know hes hot came in with 76 made threepointers the most among all power conference players in the country and now Andrew Carr gets involved see thats a great play by force because Monsanto curls and because hes playing so well it just takes Pete Nance with the curl just enough to allow Carr to step out outside the threepoint line 40 points and Counting for Wake Forest one of the elite offenses in the ACC here in this first half Davis turns it over RJ Davis didnt turn it over at all in the Duke game hes already got two turnovers early which is very uncharacteristic of him Monsanto wanted another rundown by Nance and Carolina is a team with five turnovers so far with three and a half to go in the first early work and transition pushing Bradford up the lane and calling for the lob and a terrific pass where only baycot can get it before the help gets there and you said about doing the early work Hubert Davis talked about that yesterday they needed baycat to be aggressive himself with his positioning to be in a position to get more touches well hes working tonight first from Applebee on a gorgeous fight another good green across them the lane in front of the hoop good execution the two centers for Wake Forest Marsh and Bradford they have combined for 13 points loves they got tried to follow and then its last touched by North Carolina North Carolina has missed a lot of shots at The Rim in this first half wake by 17 against the Tar Heels here in WinstonSalem wake like fun said has scored meanwhile you see the 13 for baycot nobody else with more than two for Carolina baycat definitely needs some help theyre going to pick up again with some full court pressure here and see if they can generate some turnovers or keep the ball out of Applebys hands make somebody else make a play for Wake so Caleb Loves got that assignment right there cant stay with him as Appleby draws a foul on Armando baycat that is two on Baytown well Applebee is quick he has a change of pace he controls the ground he reads the second level so well and hes having no trouble getting two feet in the paint in the first half he talked to us today at shoot around about the first meeting between these teams a loss for Wake Forest in Chapel Hill and he said we thought we had that game but they turned it over that was the big problem for Steve Forbes team in the second portion of that second half and Appleby said the crowd played a big part in it he said he could not hear anything in the Smith Center I mean you look at that Wake Forest record and its a little misleading considering Duke Pitt and the NC State losses were all one possession and the North Carolina won possession Applause Caleb love oh for seven in the first half but you know what I like what Hubert Davis did there right I mean heres Caleb love you got to get him going right hes hes having some trouble finding some offense so youre designing a play coming off the timeout that puts the ball in his hands in a place where youre dictating what shot you want him to take he typically makes that shot five for 15 shooting form against Duke he is oh for seven in this one black back iron and the rebound to Appleby Appleby foot on the gas and he is blocked by Caleb love and then black saves it off of Carr to get Carolina possession see thats the kind of Hustle that leaky black brings to the equation for North Carolina I mean how about the D by Caleb love first of all tonight give Appleby two points at the rim and you know he always looks over at coach Forbes you can see how connected they are my fault I should have scored thats my bad Applause Jalen Washington giving baycott a blow just came in and he couldnt handle it in the post and a costly turnover this is a big 90 seconds headed toward halftime Applause Appleby off the bounce pivoting on love and sends it back out toward Monsanto six left to shoot for Wake thats a good d right there when you stop the penetration and then everybody stays home and defends one pass away three to shoot Appleby hoists cant head rebound Washington Applause love still searching and still cold Monsanto Jacks and he gets fouled by DeMarco done so three free throws coming for damari Monsanto I mean you got a stick with Demari Monsanto we told you how good he is one of the best threepoint Shooters in the country in terms of how prolific he is but then also in terms of volume if you go back the last 30 years in the ACC to attempt as many threes per game as he does and make at the clip he does 41 the only other guy as prolific and proficient is him is JJ red thats thats impressive to being sentence right and heres the thing like Applause on the catch were late we got you earlier on him you got to find him quickly in transition hes got incredible range hes fun to watch I mean hes one of those players in the AC DJ Burns at NC State fun to watch right when the balls in his hands you think somethings going to happen he has added to his total with three triples and then goes to the line and he connects on all three hes got a dozen the largest lead for Wake is 22 and then Carr forces the turnover by low seventh turnover for UNC Applause Monsanto is filling it pulls up at the elbow rebound batted around and secured by Dunn and Carolina can hold for the final shot Applause were gonna go flatten it out theyre going to wait probably about nine or ten seconds come with a flat ball screen lets see if Wake Forest will trap it or if theyll switch to zone or theyll give a foul option C works as well just the 14 foul out Wake Forest with 10 seconds left in this first half but baycat still on the bench for Hubert Davis now Davian Williamson commits the foul who saw this coming for Carolina after the way Saturday went only 57 points in that loss at Cameron love finishes out the half oh of nine from the floor and wake closes the half on a 70 run and leads by 22 after 20 minutes and for North Carolina the largest halftime deficit of the Season as Tyree Appleby and the Deeks they had their way in front of a raucous home crowd lets get you to the studio its the chief Halftime Report with Seth and bonds Monsanto because the accs leading assist playmaker and Tyree Appleby will kick it over there to Monsanto for a triple you see that last note from North Carolina in the last 15 Seasons their third largest halftime deficit and yes its February 7th but you heard Joe lunardi with the guys in the studio at halftime he says theyre already in the danger zone well heres the switch and this is the adjustment theyre going to switch that action right now and see if they can keep Tyree Appleby in front he gets the match up with bacon and he gets all the way to the rim right on cue even with the changing defensive pick and roll coverage and at this end like you were talking about the last two halves of basketball for the Tar Heels their lowest scoring halves of the season going back to Saturday at camera Hubert Davis told us every possession needs a bay cut touch but he walks with it for the second time tonight in North Carolina throw it throws it in there they clear out Wake Forest playing straight up they played DJ Byrne straight up also for North Carolina State and so as long as baycot and no one else is hurting you it might be the strategy for Steve Forbes is to let baycott get his and make sure no one else gets going because Caleb love and RJ Davis I really struggled shooting the ball in the first half and even though DJ burns the 275 pounder for NC State even though he went for 31 in that game here against Wade Steve Forbes still today stands by that decision not to double on burns late shot clock and Carr turns it over to Bangkok heres love attacking and theres his first bucket after he went over nine in the first half yeah North Carolina needs to make the second half vertical which means they got to get up and down North and South not just in transition but looking to attack downhill off of their ball screen action just on the Note they hadnt had a bucket in the last three plus minutes of that first half and tomorrow Monsanto can do it in the midrange as well and he looks over at Steve Forbes because he is feeling all kinds of confidence for Wake Forest Music long into the midrange off the baycats screen and he came up empty and he will hear it from the deeps faithful Davis tries and he is short black another offensive rebound for Carolina and Hildreth swipes it and cam Hildreth lays it in Montana the same goes for Wake Forest Mike theyre in drop covers on that ball screen action Caleb love and RJ Davis are going to have those elbow 15 foot jump shots they got to make some shots and now its an illegal screen set by Armando baycat so hes got three fouls and watch this steal by Cameron Hildreth does a great job getting the deflection and then finishes at the rim and then Monsanto look at this hard drive this move behind his back and then he pulls it and sticks it Music for the uninitiated drop coverage is the post big defensively hes just staying back and not going up where the screen is set and now baycat commits another foul and hes got four the last two coming 13 Seconds Apart and that just looks like a frustration foul by baycot you know that was one of the things we talked about with him today was how he has been able to keep his focused knowing hes the target teams are coming after him and not getting you know frustrated he looked like he got frustrated on that one because youre right the face is always so similar no matter the situation heldra trying to muscle it up over Davis and couldnt and it belongs to North Carolina Applause feels very similar to the game Carolina played here in WinstonSalem last season a 20plus point loss for Huber Daviss bunch Lance Captain alive circles around on Bradford love sit down I mean if anyone needed to get some confidence as Caleb love right now I mean he needed to see a big basket thats his first threepointer and Carolinas first 23 minutes into this ball game LOB from Tyree Appleby again tough to handle for Nance and Hildreth pulls it away he attacks on a Euro didnt get the roll Applause black behind the back now kicks for Davis RJ Davis to the cup on a reverse Appleby going right to the rack back iron against love Applause love starting to feel it wanted another and then its last touched by Pete Nance Applause well everything is coming up Wake Forest here tonight against North Carolina the lead at 23 against the Tar Heels hes smart and he understands their offense he puts RJ Davis in jail then he turns the corner right here on all the Carolina blue throws it back Bradford playing in that ball screen action high off the glass hes taken on anybody that gets in his way he has been fantastic reading the North Carolina defense its been a clinic look at what he and damari Monsanto have done combined Compared to North Carolina stuck on 32 points and down big early on second half as Appleby gets fouled and he grimaces and is slow to get up a guy who hardly comes off the court for Steve Forbes last six games hes played all but three and a half minutes threw some pain at different times this season Applause well he carries a huge offensive load for Coach Forbes hes in command of their Tempo he sets the tone with their d he told us today that in the first meeting against North Carolina that they got sped up you said boy you have even a faster speed than the one you normally play at well I mean you look at his numbers hes out for four outside the threepoint line and hes more dangerous I think getting in the pink so the way you guard him in screening action you saw the adjustment from North Carolina the switch to start to second half hes tough in that middle third Davis is searching hes got the Freshman 24 in blue Tyler nickel into the game for the first time in this one leaky black long two no rebound secured by Matt Marsh and he gets wrapped up Carolina gets tagged for the foul Steve Forbes that shoot around worked on their press offense he also both coaches spent a lot of time on situations tonight today at their at their practice he talked about how pressure played a big part in the first meeting and Wake Forest only four turnovers throughout the game to this point 25 minutes in a switch of Nance onto Applebee off that ball screen he gets the switch he wants and he just gets to the paint off the big so he waits till theres a big on him and then he explodes to the rim love driving to the Rim Yeah thats a great take by Caleb low thats the vertical play Im talking about but look how quickly wake is back at it time for marsh coming into the game Matthew Marsh and Bradford were a combined 80 for 94 from the floor for 85 percent from the five position because of the shot selection like this bigs that run that screen and roll that make themselves available on the offensive glass I mean thats just ridiculous 85 from that position and those two have stepped up in a huge way in this one theyve combined for 15 with Marsh supplying 10 of those Bobby Clinton moves it for Carr rebound black well North Carolina really trying to accelerate through their Pace right theyre trying to push the ball in transition theyre trying to go a little quicker here on the offensive end and theyre definitely being aggressive trying to get to the rim buff Johnson does just that takes a hard fall as he gets fouled you know last year North Carolina shot 36 percent from the threepoint line this years 30 percent it definitely has changed the space in their offense 38 from the floor in this one hey another full afternoon of college basketball Saturday here on ESPN in the app highlighted by our first three games Kentucky Georgia starts us off noon Eastern the number three Alabama and Auburn the game day crew will be there to start the morning at 11 AM Eastern and then here in the ACC eighth ranked Virginia Post Duke have you ever been to Auburn for a Bruce Pearl show I have not but that sounds like an apt description it is fantastic they will be fired up for game day for recently guys women tried to rip down the Rim Yeah thats gonna be a big one it always is when those two play one another as Puff Johnson draws a blocking foul in the paint and then a big one in the ACC eighth ranked Virginia against Duke who ran into that Miami Buzz saw last night in Coral Gables I had to double check the score when I saw it pop up after the game I had last night in Raleigh for the play for k at NC State I looked up and I I was a little bit surprised although I will say this I do think Virginia is the best team and I think right now Miami and NC State are close they split in the regular season and Kevin Keats has his team playing their best basketball right now I mean NC States won eight of their last nine theyre hot what a huge Showdown that is coming up less than an hour from now over on acc Network nine oclock Eastern time tip NC State as hot as they are to your point against Virginia whos trying to respond after losing in Blacksburg over the weekend they always double the block but DJ doesnt catch it on the Block he catches it in the mid post off the lane are they going to double that and then their ball screen coverage is on Joyner and Smith for NC State those guys have Jets it is an electric offense led by that backcourt and then you factor in Burns whos playing more minutes now for NC State and they are surging shot clock winding down and Hildreth couldnt finish with the left hand its down to 19 with still 13 plus minutes to go here in WinstonSalem got to keep chipping away youre trying to cut that 22 Point halftime deficit in half by around the 10 minute mark you can see North Carolina picking up their Pace right here theyre on an 80 run right now after the bucket from Pete Nance man Carolina trying to keep it out of the hands of Appleby and Carolina picks up a foul its on puff Johnson so thats three on him with 13 to go and already the one and one for Wake Forest thats really early to put a team in the bonus you know coach Davis cant be pleased with that Bay cop picking up those two quick fouls and he went straight to the bench which gave him four thats why hes not playing right now I dont know how long coach Davis is going to wait to put Armando back in the game I think you kind of wait to see if you can make a run and make a game of it right and if you can get a little closer and maybe get it to a four or five possession game maybe thats when you see him Appleby poked it away from love puff Johnson went diving for it and then Appleby swiped it and gets fouled by Nance Wake Forest fans had a little issue with the hustle play right here and the foul by Nance foul play on the ball hard foul play on yeah theres no such thing as the clear path in the mens college game so if its anything it would be a flagrant one in that case and certainly not and Appleby makes good on the front end of the one and one Applause 84 free throw shooter and if youre just joining us Armando baycat still sits with his four fouls Appleton Expo Applause Seth Trimble has come into the game and he will run the point here for Carolina with love off ball nickel off the screen back for Nance Strong finish a good note call as well thats a principal verticality at The Rim good finish by Nance foreign here in the second half part of his eight total to go along with six rebounds for North Carolina Applebee trying to shake free he rises cant hit rebound Trimble Trimble off the bounce and hes blocked by Carr Carolina trying to inch their way back and slice into the Hefty deficit in WinstonSalem hes got IQ and hes got a lot of speed around him and a lot of shop makers you heard Joe lunardi with the guys in the studio at halftime talking about what this would do for North Carolina if they end up losing by a large margin as Nance misses and then commits a foul that he puts them in the danger zone and then Joey Brackett said that with a Wake Forest win it would move them from what he calls considered to sort of onto the board in his next four out I mean wake was going from Joe Lunardis not being in the conversation to now they are and should they be able to hang on here as baycott sits with four fouls be a huge win for Wake Forest and a split with North Carolina which could factor into the tiebreaker for the ACC tournament Wake Forest started six and two in the league in year three under Steve Forbes and a fourgame losing skid against really a challenging Gauntlet included as you said three straight twopoint losses and then they bounce back on Saturday in South Bend Indiana against Notre Dame Nance fires back iron long rebound to Tyree Appleby Monsanto the quickest trigger you will find in the ACC Avis is probing hes got car on him cant connect from deep and for RJ Davis two of eight from the floor crj has that logo pullup midrange and he circles back out because he got the switch with Carr on him he takes a tougher shot four games in a row now where his shooting struggles continue a guy who was so key in the first meeting against Wake Forest in Chapel Hill had a huge second half out of bounds it does stay with wake with eight to shoot theres a change of change of screen covers defensively with the trap on the side I mean you want to deny Appleby its very challenging to do hes very quick he knows how to take the right angle and he definitely knows how to get the basketball to make plays can only trap on that side ball screen though right yeah you cant trap in the middle Monsanto straight on thats the rebound its Trimble nickel Nance black and Davis the five on the floor for North Carolina Midway through the second half and RJ Davis draws a blocking foul on Andrew Carr Applause OTS RJ Davis quiet again like we said hes a guy I know his game you absolutely love I do I think your ball screen offense having a tough night tonight Four Points three turnovers for the junior guard and Caleb loves having a tougher night three for 15 shooting now for Caleb love and Carolinas had an opening quick has only made one of its last 10 shots but the lead still large and adding to it is Bobby clickman scores thats what Im talking about love got blocked by car Applause there is a pace to the way the Wake Forest runs its offense in the half court Appleby stop and pop and hit hes got 19 to go along with nine assists Davis a floater to respond thats a good decision thats what I was talking about earlier about RJ Davis in that middle ball screen getting to the logo area and pulling up and knocking down that shot Seth Trimble drives his hand on Tyree Appleby we chatted with Applebee today he had a ton of praise for the freshmans defense on him the first time and said he was great he was face guarding me up and down the floor he said Im not gonna lie he played good defense oh what a reverse by Seth Trimble at that end of the floor he is an exciting player in large part for what he has done already on the defensive end as Davis fouls Appleby free throws Seth Trimble has not scored in the last six games and he makes this play right here look at the athleticism to get to the other side of the rim leaky black has talked about how he gets so low defensively he credits the quads for Seth Trimble being able to lock guys up he was number 49 in our ESPN 100 out of Menomonee Falls Wisconsin and Armando baycat returns to this game with 8 51 to go so he had sat since the 1723 mark in the second half I mean the other thing you could do with him Wake Forest is going to shoot two the rest of the night at the line Appleby splits so you want to see offense through bacon right with him back into this game hes always the margin 20 still nine minutes to go here in WinstonSalem at the Joel baycat comes up to set another screen this time for Davis on a step through and he gets fouled and RJ Davis will shoot two North Carolina Music screen offense in the slot area and what it does is by the second time that Armando baycott comes through to set that ball screen everybody else is cleared out so you got two side and three on the other side and you take the help away so that your two best players RJ Davis and Armando baycott in the ball screen offense can go to work talked about RJ Davis in his season he suffered a dislocated finger right before the start of the season in late October so that explained part of the slow start to the season shooting for him then he got hot and then against Syracuse dislocated the same finger again and hes been quiet over these last few games but his offensive numbers in ACC play have been better his percentages in shooting the basketball from Two and from three have been good inside conference play theyve got it down to 18 as Trimble got a block on Appleby and then goes for a piggyback ride Monsanto standing in a corner saying hey Im right here you missed me which might be a recurring comment you have to imagine with damari Monsanto I bet Appleby hits him next time down yeah boy they are some of the fun personalities on this Wake Forest team were talking with Appleby a few weeks ago before their game against Pitt and he was talking about Monsanto and said yeah hes one of the best Shooters Ive ever played with but boy does he get on my nerves well you know he he had a little issue early on hes had some adversity has had to overcome and you know Steve Forbes Adam and didnt play him and then since then coming into the game since the LSU game hes made 53s so hes done his damage once conference play started love gets the roll Applause again its that elbow midrange Applause Appleby gets bumped no foul love stayed with him and he sends the hit ahead to tremble who bobbled it and now a kick on Hildreth so Wake Forest will take that for transition defense and it sends us to a timeout its been that kind of night for North Carolina two back to Mike and Debbie in WinstonSalem all right Kev thanks very much yeah here in WinstonSalem at the Joel Debbie Antonelli Mike Monaco our entire crew with you this game produced by Kevin Clark and directed by Charlie Reynolds 17point game Wake Forest has been in control Armando baycott cant get it to go in the rebound to damari Monsanto if youre just joining us Tyree Appleby has been in control 20 points nine assists for the Wake Forest point guard who gives it up to cam Hildreth for Dukes offense that has been humming so you got the switch you got bacon you drive him with those four fouls yank it back but he missed the jump shot leaky black off the bounce on Monsanto backs him down fighting for space B caught the offensive rebound and he will go to the line for a couple of free throws Armando or just five offensive rebounds a game thats his fourth offensive rebound keep in mind he scored 13 of the 25 first half points for North Carolina he has not scored here in the second yeah you talk about his offensive rebounding and we know about his rebounding overall its been this way for four years so it fits that what does he have on his right leg but a tattoo of Dennis Rodman to let us take this photo today told us took five hours to do that and come to completion so when he idolizes and hes got it stamped down that right leg another lob in Davion Brantford gets fouled by RJ Davis Applause hes got Tony Montana on the other side of the same leg one of the great personalities across college basketball there you go a couple of free throws for Davion Bradford 54 for his career hey looking ahead at some upcoming womens basketball games for Wake Forest in North Carolina over on acc Network the Deeks hosts number 22 NC State Thursday night eight Eastern and then Sunday number 14 Carolina led by Courtney banghart against Boston College in Chapel Hill at noon Eastern NC State on the struggle boss a little bit Wake Forest has won three of their last four Megan jebia has done an outstanding job in her first year at wake and North Carolinas down a couple of starters on the womens side he sees a young team thats getting better sounds like maybe upset alert tomorrow here Davis had it partially blocked by Andrew Carr closing out on the threepoint Drive still just that one made three for North Carolina that came from Caleb love early on in this half and a 16point cushion for Wake Forest coming up on six to go a lob for Bradford and he finishes with a right hand I mean Wake Forest is just doing such a great job of reading the switches and thats the the second half adjustment by Huber Davis they were in drop coverage in the first half on that ball screen action and Tyree Appleby ate them up and in the second half theyve been switching so Applebys been getting a big on him hes just been taking him to the paint Caleb love wanted a foul as well after he got that to drop and then Davis hounding Hildreth and through it all all the changes from Carolinas ball screen coverage Tyree Appleby has navigated it on the pitch back car cant knock it down rebound Bay cap Ral cars had some open looks from three its a very good threepoint shooter from that stretch four position love too strong baycott cant follow and its clutched by Davion Bradford Bradford and Marsh have held their own tonight in the middle for Wake Forest they knew the assignment going up against Armando baycat that ball touches the official along the sideline so its blown dead right in front of Steve Forbes but a front row seat you know Wake Forest started the game and really took control early quickly got out to a 10point lead in North Carolina just just hasnt had it tonight at all Applebees got bake out on him shot clock winding down Davis the rebound puff Johnson on the drive with the drop off for baycat and he finishes plus the foul Applause foreign Applebys numbers as we take a look at Armando baycott making himself available on the Baseline penetration using the board Applebee is oh for six from the threepoint line and think about all that ball screen coverage in the first half and how North Carolina defended it he got in the paint at will I think theres a different formula that might work moving forward to try to guard him hes really challenging to keep him in front hes got a double double tamari Monsanto and knock this one down hes got three of them already and Carolina down just 14 still four minutes to go they push Davis straza blocking foul on cam Hildreth Carolina hanging around yeah free throws they will go to the line when we come back to WinstonSalem after this ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance its easy to bundle your home and car insurance at progressivecom great coach Greenberg he is fired up well we did a game a couple of weeks ago that had Pitt hit 18 threes that is the type of shooting you would like oh I love that kind of offense now Im telling you Buzz Williams in Texas A M right there picked to finish sixth in the SEC theyre making a push right theyve been playing well keeping an eye on that yeah how about that stretch for Auburn we told you about the one they have coming this weekend with the top five opponent in just Alabama with game day in town still 357 ago with RJ Davis at the Line This is as close as this game has been in the second half and its down to a dozen Applause Wake Forest has taken care of the basketball just one turnover this half just four for the game but only eight made shots since halftime and oh of eight from three in the second half Applebee gets underneath and draws a foul and if its not bake out its five you know it was a good use of the timeout by Steve Forbes because this team was getting a little too casual for a couple of possessions and thats a again Tyree Appleby all night getting to the paint on North Carolinas defense Applause Armando baycount was so big early in this game for North Carolina didnt have a whole lot of help around him he exits with 17 and 11 and in the second half only able to play eight minutes because he picked up his fourth foul not even three full minutes out of halftime Appleby misses both for a guy whos 84 percent from the line this season and now Love Takes Carr off the bounce and gets it to go and its down to 10 and Hubert Davis will take a timeout with the Wake Forest led by as many as 26 North Carolina has it down to 10 but theyve got to proceed without Armando Big Town well and so they can go small and quick pick up some in mind Wake Forest is only turn the ball over four times in this game and only once since halftime Wake Forest feathers that one into Tyree Appleby Tyler Nichols still in the game for North Carolina Seth Trimble that great onball presence hes on the bench because Wake Forest does have plenty of size numbers now three guard lineup for North Carolina in the second half that Force Wake Forest into so many turnovers the first meeting a month ago this is a small lineup on the floor for Wake Forest as well theres the switch couldnt get it to go over love and the heels run love pulls up back iron and the rebound to Appleby North Carolina one for 12 outside the threepoint line Applause so you just take it down deep into the shot clock look for that switch a dump off to Carr or that the 11th tie Appleby assists for Wake Boris nickel off the glass no puff Johnson the follow and its back down to 10 ticking toward two minutes remaining boy risky inbound to Hildreth and that he skips it for Carr Walking the Tightrope Applause and Appleby is fouled by Caleb love his second so a couple of free throws for Ty Appleby all right Appleby puts his defender in jail draws the help reads the second level so well he is eight of 12 at the free throw line in this one the third level would be getting to the paint drawing help and then kicking it out now he hasnt even had to do that tonight because hes been able to be so effective in the middle of the floor scoring against North Carolina in the paint coming up next we will take you to Rupp Arena for Oscar shibway and Kentucky against Arkansas with 159 to go here before we get to Lexington I mean how would you like to be a point guard and come play in this Steve Forbes with whats happened here the last couple of years Applause Mark Johnson off the bounce on Clinton Nance ran it down and then he gets fouled looked like cam Hildreth got him it is on Hildreth and Pete Nance to the free throw line four on can Hildreth Pete Nances first trip to the strike 79 this season for the fifth year senior and he misses the first Seth Trimble enters this game for nickel and will bring some defensive pressure with him foreign to rebound here its a split at the stripe 11 point game and Trimble hounding Appleby Appleby trying to coax a foul call from Lee Cassell and he does right near midcourt I mean Wake Forest last year had alondis Williams all he did was win ACC player of the year he had so much freedom in this offense and now they inject Ty Appleby and hes got 11 assists of his own in this game four more than Carolina as a team Lana has obviously hasnt shot it well theyve missed 41 Shots they have offensive rebounded 14 of those and without bacon on the floor they still for the majority of the game they still have been able to control the glass but the difference in the margin is that Wake Forest hasnt turned the ball over four times as you mentioned one only once in this half looks like Steve Forbes is going to call timeout with the lead at 13 for Wig trying to secure a huge win at home Wake Forest in the conversation to now theyre back on the board Tyler nickel gets fouled in the corner finds Amari Monsanto with still 137 remaining when you look at wake what do you see them as down the stretch in the regular season and how much of a threat in the ACC tournament and if they get to the NCAA tournament well its all about matchups who you play when and where and Steve Forbes knows hes got a couple of principal pieces that are really important to be able to make a run that is great point guard play good size up front that rebounds and scores in the paint Monsanto who it can be a wild card in terms of his ability to make threes Applause you know he can get hot he can make a lot like he made eight against Wake Forest excuse me against Notre Dame Tyler Nichols steps up he makes all three to trim the Gap to 10 with still over 90 ticks left for North Carolina making a push and Huber Davis going offense defense here getting triple back on the court he sticks with Cam Hildreth who gets fouled and cam Hildreth will go to the line for the first time in this game 76 percent for the season he was frustrated a couple of weeks ago by some big ones he missed late against Pitt keep in mind he did have too so he has multiple ways he can help Wake Forest win sophomore from Worthing England who has been one of the most improved players in the ACC this year nickel back in for offensive purposes elgaret splits the lead 11 132 left RJ Davis is fouled by cam Hildreth who has fouled out of this game with 127 left great job by RJ Davis in transition to turn the corner on Hildreth Applause a combined 50 free throws in the game so far tonight thats a lot of free throws part of it is because Wake Forest was in a double bonus so early around the 12minute mark in the second half Applause nice hand for cam Hildreth always so tough for this Wake Forest team heed the parts replaced by Davion Williamson Applause RJ Davis an elite free throw shooter second best in the ACC at 86 percent and hes five of five tonight he makes this one its a three possession game thats the kind of game pressure North Carolina has put on Wake Forest here late nobodys left the building Applause it is down to nine and three possessions and Carolina would set Trimble committing the quick foul on Tyree Appleby who is 12 of 16 at the freethrow line in this one Brian OConnell giving an explanation to Steve Forbes before the Applebee free throws what was it like 13 minutes left in this game when Wake Forest went into the single bonus here in the second half yeah it was around the 12th yeah 12 13 minute Mark thats why we shot so many free throws Applause 37 combined fouls here so North Carolinas got a push and look for nickel to fill behind the RJ Davis push for a three Appleby with 11 assists and 26 points here tonight for Wake Forest and now Keith Kimball and Lee Cassell get together for a conversation and you see for Appleby he also has six rebounds only ACC player in a league game this year 25 and 10 and it looks like has a fan been tested here from the front row courtside Applause well thats some unpleasant things to say apparently Davis tries the corner again and does that again to draw foul and with the chance to score with the clock stops I mean North Carolina is doing a good job of extending this game to the best of their ability right now getting to the line clock stop best free second best free throw shooter in the league and Davis makes another swap for Hubert Davis defense for offense nickel out Trimble in as Carolina has done just that extending this game down the stretch for eight at the line for RJ Davis quick toss ahead and sent back to himself Davis pulls up cant knock it down battle on the boards and Appleby secures it for Wake Forest Appleby is finally fouled by RJ Davis who had a golden opportunity for the Tar Heels that inbounds passed by Monsanto is not going to look pretty on film tomorrow Applause but the effort of Tyree Appleby and his Escape ability taking time off the clock so Appleby at the line hes already made 14 free throws he makes the first we go to Kevin in the studio to remind our audience coming your way Kentucky hosting Arkansas tip off over there in Lexington right now over on the ESPN app you could watch that game and then once were done in WinstonSalem we will go live to Arkansas at Kentucky back to you Hogs and cats fans we promise we will get you to rub once this goes final a minute to go in regulation wake by 11 Carolina wont go quietly Caleb loves straight on for three just the second made three of the game for North Carolina and theyve got it down to eight what a great rally by the heels here late in the game they didnt look like they had much life and then all of a sudden the full court pressure starts to wear on Wake Forest and they extend the game by Falling the second triple of the game for North Carolina Caleb love has 16 second half points for a Carolina team you see the resume according to Joey brackets who was talking at halftime about Hubert Daviss team approaching the danger zone well they have rallied they have trimmed this all the way down to eight here in a quad one opportunity for the Tar Heels in WinstonSalem well wake Force here you gotta cut hard and for North Carolina you might want to trap and see if you can get a steal before youve committed a foul love commits the foul on Tyree Appleby who has made a living at the freethrow line these last few minutes 16 of 20 at the stripe Seth Trimble is trying to face guard him on the inbounds and just cant find a way to prevent Appleby from getting his hands on the ball sixth year senior the transfer from Florida Tyree Appleby second in the league in scoring and boys he stuffed the stat sheet in this one here tonight 29 Points so wait switching on everything no threes we told you the two threes for Carolina they have both come from Caleb love as Appleby connects again 52 seconds left for North Carolina love tries to deep walk hits that as well and the final timeout Nevis and North Carolina just wont go away what fight in the Tar Heels here late Wake Forest not able to put him away the full court pressure has had an impact their ability to extend the game by committing fouls even though wakes in the double bonus North Carolina is one for 12 from threepoint line until Caleb Davis hits the last two triples and love with a huge second half 19 of his 21 and if youre just joining us North Carolina trailed by as many as 26 in this game against Wade and were down 22 at halftime their third largest halftime deficit in the last 15 years and Wake Forest hasnt been able to get the shots to fall here in this second half and now they have managed the North Carolina pressure on every inbounds how does North Carolina get that turnover because right now theyre trading points well the other thing is you know Armando baycat is not available he has found out of the game hes only played seven minutes here in the second half with foul trouble but you got to find Caleb love now hes seeing a big basket and for North Carolina not making any triples they its not how many you make them its when you make them running right with Appleby and before the inbound the foul is called and it goes against Caleb love so thats his fourth and Appleby goes straight to the strike Applause I mean Applebee just finds a way to break free on every inbound well he hes so quick he reads the angles they had two guys trying to keep him from Catching the ball and he still was able to get it now that foul was committed making a play going towards the ball so its still two free throws and good on the first for Tyree Appleby whos got 31 points 19 of them at the free throw line and you can feel the pain for Steve Forbes on his sideline just trying to get to the finish line here at home Carolina come back to the ball here dont let him walk the ball up the floor or roll the ball off the floor youre giving RJ Davis a full head of steam here and now love steps into a three comes up short Davis to Nance underneath 35 seconds left and Trimble bumps Appleby on the Baseline Applause what if played by RJ Davis to tap that loose rebound to Pete Nance under the bucket Applause Seth Trimble has fouled out of this game Applause I mean Davis climbed at six feet even and found Nance underneath I mean what effort by North Carolina to extend this game and to continue to just chip away oh Applebee has been battered in this second half second half alone hes 19 of 23 at the free throw line I mean thats a lot of free throws but North Carolina got back in this game because they changed the rhythm of the game by full court pressing and extending the game by fouling to make it a single digit deficit Applebees 22nd made free throw of the game 20 of them this half Davis again around the corner and he gets the roll 29 seconds left Steve Forbes cant believe that the horn just went off North Carolina is out of time out but gets a stoppage here allows the heels to set their d that is not the home cooking that Steve Forbes wanted seven point game Monsanto gets rid of it quickly to Appleby who is just dancing and feeling confident and like you in may he is parked at the free throw line yeah hes shooting him at a pretty good clip too 22 for 26 hes got seven boards 11 assists 34 points for Tyree Appleby and if you didnt see the way he played in the first half he was really Untouchable with a basketball he scored at will in the pain against North Carolina an impressive show in their ball screen offense he only has one turnover in the game as well 23rd made free throw for Tyree Appleby and how about the note here fourth ACC player in the last 25 years with 30 and 10 plus assists he misses that time so its an eightpoint game coming up on 20 seconds to go for North Carolina trying to make it a two possession game Nance is blocked by Carr and he tips it to Appleby and Williamson is fouled by pop Johnson and this place can sense it at long last I wasnt sure North Carolina could have made a game of this Midway through the second half and they they rallied I mean Wake Forest is going to be glad that theres not two more minutes left on the clock itll be a third straight loss for North Carolina pit Duke and now here at wake as love connects with 84 seconds to go Applause sitting that it ends in the hands of Ty Appleby 35 points seven rebounds 11 assists and a big win at home for Wake Forest Applause Music Steve Forbes his Wake Forest team now eight and six in the ACC three straight home wins against North Carolina that does it from WinstonSalem for Debbie Antonelli and our entire crew Mike Monaco came
