lost three in a row Virginia Tech at Virginia and they were blown out at Syracuse on Saturday Clarence Armstrong throws it up Jamie lucky Tommy morresy complete our officiating crew and Miami with Nigel pack maintains possession to start the game NC Stak starting with a smaller lineup to match up with the small ball that Jim Lena team is played the last couple of years try to get it to omir early Kean Georges pass taken away its a for guard set a new starting lineup for NC State Michael oconnell second start of the year with horn Tanner Morel and DJ Burns back in the starting lineup after one game Off the Bench first basket though its their reliable starter and leading scorer DJ horn and nearly 15 a game starting five for Miami with no Cleveland its Joseph hack and Poler the guards Kean George a freshman has really come on the last few weeks and here the 67 JR try to follow his own threepoint shot he will and hell lay it in nor Shadow Mir has worked hard in the off season on his face up game particularly outside the ark where hes made 12 threes already this season but as a good shooter would know follow your own shot when you know its off good rebounder two time for second in the ACC just under 10 a game on the drive its horn rounded out George loss of allall and popper has it for Miami Kevin Miami leads the ACC in field goal percentage and 3point percentage they average 81 points a game this is an uptempo Miami team thats a Joseph and the Miss three here o con the Stanford transfer his first year of the wack AC State really struggles to shoot 13th out of 15 teams in ACC games 3 from three inside burns his first shot one of the things that Jim Laro wants to do with Miami is mix up their coverages on DJ Burns sometimes you bring a double on the spin sometimes on the bounce sometimes on the catch second leading score at 12 per game for NC State heres pack seconde hurricane starter from Kansas State poppers three is blocked by Morel Tri to save it to O Connell and a foul on Nigel p what a good balanced start for NC State and I mean good Tempo on the offensive end theyve scored been able to set their defense its a tremendous play defensively by Casey morcel who I think is set to have a big game tonight outside the ark hes way overdue he has shot it much worse this season hes getting to the free throw line and hitting very well there andc State a 12point loss Saturday to Syracuse 7765 but it was not that close much of the game theyve really struggled in the first half the last two times out for with six to shoot as pass knocked by George back into his hands hard creates space and parries it a threepointer from DJ horny which is way off balance I dont think he can play any better defense than that thats just a tremendous offensive play by DJ horn who is fifth in the ACC in threepoint percentage you got make him play it off the bounce on the roll omir from pack goir has got the first four for the cas thats an advantage most teams like to put DJ Burns in as much ball screen action as possible and make him move laterally and make NC State try to tag remember I said Florida Miami is the best threepoint shooting team in the league when you tag the roller you leave somebody open let a sa third worst offensive team in the ACC this year at conference games up to a good start though and they are putting it in the hands of H who hits his second Applause three that earlier baskets been ruled a two for horn so right now hes at seven out of nine which is 1 three and he stayed four for five and Taylor deflected that pass with eight to shoot Ry omir screen its Pat threepointer misses off the heel Jaden Taylor the first year World pack member from Butler has the Music ball I would go right back to DJ horn set a ball screen for him got the 68 freshman George on him right now okell rolls it for burns an excellent passer Morel on the drive Morel to the left hand missed a point blank layup and popper takes it the other way d BS of feet and hes called for an offensive Applause foul DJ horn seven points early for NC State the step back in a late clock Situation off the pick and roll creates some space off the bounce hes got it working early for the wolf back hes got seven of their nine earlier in the season against North Florida watch them right angle turn on this play which is ruled to charge and he walked very slowly off the court well hes already missed two games he missed the Clemson and the Wake Forest game looks like hes shaking it off and hes going to give it a go it was a left ankle earlier in the year that was the right one that Twisted awkwardly you see the numbers overall this season are very good he was great against pit on Saturday the six games before that though just 36 from the field less than 10 points points per game so good to see popper still out there that DJ horn basket was reviewed and it is a threepointer the first one he hit so horn has eight of NC States 10 its been the case of L hes really been the only shot maker for the wal pack hell take another one and this one no good from three Bley Joseph with a rebound for Miami midle Brooks say taking over for DJ Burns omir tries to greet him rudely and hell leave it way Applause Music short La will feed Middlebrooks to Clemson transfer looking for more consistency out of him tonight good ball mve up by NC State early theres OT making his second start of the year as Flo is tipped in by the off hand of middle Brooks welcome to PNC Arena in Raleigh North Carolina Kevin Brown Debbie antelli NC stayed on fire from the field early the wol pack shooting 5 for n Miamis two for seven with three turnovers now and an eightpoint lead for North Carolina State team instead has lost three straight but has come out moving the ball well and taking good shots you know this could be a perfect recipe for NC State having lost three and roome playing at home against a Miami team that loves the uptempo game I think thats when NC State is at their best and DJ horn has eight of the Wolf Pack 12 points early in the first half theres a three for Taylor look at Middlebrooks fighting for offensive rebound back for Morel two Miss threes Middlebrook soaring in again and P was fouled before he stepped out of bounds NC State shooting the ball well early Kevin and that has allowed them to set their defense right now at 45 for NC State and DJ horn has had the hot hand a look hes already made two triples in the game tonight this is for the team less than six and part of that is cuz Casey morcel has not been able to shoot the ball well but I think this could be a good game for him to get back in with got a lot of extra shots up today in practice got a lot of shots up before the game today in the arena go to the bench for the first time Michael Noco and the Freshman Paul joob Bay who came out of nowhere to play 18 good minutes against pit on Saturday Joseph trying to feed the Freshman noo and noo throws it right into the hands of tayor a fourth Miami turnover and then noo swaps Taylor but foul was called against pack well thats two fouls early on Miamis Junior point guard Nigel pack look at this big Euro Step through the lane with the size of Taylor and that match up in transition by Nigel pack going to go to the free throw line for two free Music throws you get two fouls in the first half for Jim lar AO even with a thinner bench its usually automatic hes got George ready to check in and George will take over to pierce even though Nigel pack is trying to linger on the floor hell take a seat at the 1319 Mark and this has been a constant in a lot of Miamis losses this year go to the Syracuse game a couple of weeks ago Poler and George got two fouls early Kentucky pack or Joseph beg your pardon omir had two early first have fouls so came without Cleveland well see how long they let pack ride the Music bench lot of dribbling by Joseph who certainly looked like he dragged the feet there got away with it and then sets up George for a rattled in three boy this is a good looking freshman for Jim Lena at 68 he was 65 when he arrived on campus hes grown a few inches since hes been there and he can really fill it up Taylor catch and shoot Miss three NC State is hold for four for the non DJ horn players from three good find by George poppler at The Rim grabs his Miss popper off the back rim no and then its Joe Bay The Freshman who gets fouled on a third chance for Miami thats Miamis tempo right there their rhythm is up the floor running the court hard and wide for Jim Lena and LGA popper with that 42 in vertical misses a couple of shots right at The Rim but Miami sticks in it with with an offensive rebound staying with the play not a great offensive rebounding team the Kans to 10 in conference offensive rebound rate see the Freshman Dennis Parker Jr on the floor for the first time for NC State along with LJ Thomas who was maybe the only NC State player who played well on Saturday in the loss to Syracuse NC state stays with that small lineup they started the lineup the game with four guards and they played with mostly four guards to match Miami popper off the inbound got a good look o Connell grabs the rebound they havent seen Mohamad diar who started the last game fry State one of their bigs yet its been either middle Brooks or Burns alone got to go to work right here double team came late George knocks it away hes showing George a much improved Defender over the course of this year for Miami I mean middle Brooks takes two hard dribbles to the midline and hes a righthanded player theres no help on the strong side for him if he just spins back and lays it off the glass instead of going to the counter no books back from Thomas hell miss this time andll follow his own Miss up its a couple of offensive rebounds for Ben Middlebrooks and stick Music back early four and three for the Junior from Fort Lauderdale and NC state has controlled this game early an eightpoint lead for Kevin kes team try to stap a threegame losing streak at home ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance bundle home at Auto and save visit progressivecom Music that is the trappiest Trap game we see in the League this year how about this Georgia Tech has beaten Duke and North Carolina the top two teams in the league and theyre at the bottom of the league if that doesnt say something about the strength of the ACC and b or RJ Davis with 28 points no one else in double figures for the tar North Carolinas first loss still a top the ACC be one versus two Saturday in Chapo Hill wild chop by oir is back on the floor along with Jo b gets it to George and Jo Bs got another offensive rebound he sets up Joseph who hits from three its three offensive rebounds for Paul Jo B who barely played this season before getting 18 minutes on Saturday against pit What did Coach say to us today at shoot around he was plus 13 in the pick game even though he only had those numbers its his impact on the game Mi he St out a four of five two for its last nine and the two are putbacks by middle Brooks it goes to work here misses grab by Jo B again thats a fourth Rebound in three plus minutes hler a dribbles in all kinds of trouble its a fifth Miami turnover middle Brooks a tough handle for Parker Parker ran right over the canes down there foul is a block against Joseph I mean thats a break for NC State what is Dennis Parker doing giving the ball to Ben Middlebrooks on the Music break I think at Kevin kes head iss asking the exact same question maybe with slightly different wording Im sure well it worked out one way or another Barker a 55 free throw shooter its the first of two all coming up after our game 11 Eastern over on ESPN super Tuesday triple hitter in the West Coast Conference Lola marmount and Gonzaga which is not ranked and not guaranteed to extend it CCAA tournament SC zags need a hot end of the season see how they can do tonight after this game on ESPN Randy Bennett in St Marys playing well Randy Bennett the head coach for St Marys will this finally be the year Gaga is knocked off its perch the West Coast Conference good fine by omir and popper with a jam that 45 angle cut and theres that 42 in vertical Yen dunked for a few games after the ankle injury got one against pitch Saturday as George spikes it into the second row Applause Kean George so athletic watch this cut right here its beautiful no help at the Music rims back on the floor for NC State going to work on omir and another rebound for Joe Bay thats five NC State two for its last 12 Joseph a quick three maybe not the shot Jim Ang L and then Jo B again his kid is everywhere and omir fouled by Burns it feels like there are three Paul Joe Bay on the floor at all times this is just his seventh game 19 minutes and was the most hes played all season I think part of the reason why benley Joseph took that shot is because I thought omir was 5050 with Burns for an offensive rebound its kind of like in transition you know you shoot it quickly if you think youve got somebody in offensive rebounding Music Applause position so five rebounds for Paul Joe Bay tonight he had five in 38 minutes on the season before this andir one for two at the line to make it a fourpoint game its a Miami team that has struggled to get anything off its bench outside of George whos now become a regular starter this season okon from Parker see State rolling with that four guard lineup once more on the handoff its burn terrific feed and Parker finishes really nice job by DJ Burns to recognize Parker who add an angle to the rim believe it or not more than halfway through the half thats NC States first assist well NC State did a really good job of wow as omir knocks down a triple stretching out that trap and pulling omir away from the bucket hes got the DJ Burns assignment and theyre trapping ball screens here now with eight Miami 16 horn with a to piece two leading scores on the season the leading scores on the night so far theres Burns again that short roll is where you DJ Burns can make some plays hasnt made quite as many this season Joe Bay on the catch thats too deep from Applause three Joe Bay just rebounds and plays defense and runs the floor hard look at the switch inside got to get the ball inside to Burns they got Joseph on him Joseph got knocked down under the armpit of burns ball is BL off the backboard in the direction of burns who somehow did not get a touch as George travels and he owes it I mean I dont know if Bley Joseph can do much more in that matchup I mean he even fell to his knees trying to leverage DJ Burns thats the point guard for Jim Lena caught on a switch Burns going to take a seat they manage his minutes Im sorry thats a mistake by NC State you got to find that matchup especially when Miami couldnt switch Music back and DJ did a really nice job of trying to hold his position in there not trying to set another ball screen so Miami could get the switch back middle Brooks replaces him ell lost it take away for Christian Watson just in the game only the second NC State turnover Music 6 for 18 to start pass seven for 19 and theres a drive for omir who has more points than the rest of his teammates combined hes got an early 10 omir too quick in that match up with middle Brooks thats a problem for NC State but its a problem for everyone nor Chad omir this is one of the things that DJ Burns is so good at for the is back to the basket he sees the floor so well watch the ability of Parker to get into his vision off the double team look he just drops it off at the front of the Music rim Im a parking gate and Im all out of whack Kevin Keats NC State team a 5 one start their best start in ACC play since 1988 89 35 years ago but theyve lost plus three in a row home Virginia Tech at UVA at Syracuse turnover is an issue theyve not shot it will they have not gotten to the line hes really hoping his team will play with aggression tonight on both sides of the floor how do you measure their aggressiveness so far D well I thought they started out playing very aggressively and I like this change defensively right here to pick up a little pressure but the problems and issues for NC are definitely fixable you got to take care of the basketball you got to make shots around the rim and when you can score you can set your defense they giv up a lot of offensive rebound seven as Middlebrooks has a huge block on a flying Watson Josephs three no go long rebound George is on the deck with possession of it shot clock is not reset inside noo gives Miami its first lead Miami has been able to hustle for every loose ball early on theyve been on the glass as youve mentioned 8 Second Chance points nine off offensive rebounds for Te its one of the worst offensive rebounding teams in the ACC part of that could be that smaller lineup theres four guards on the floor for the world P morcel slithers inside noo the first two for Casey morcel to give to pack the lead back LJ Thomas getting extended minutes early NC St picking up their pressure defensively off the last time out Miamis going to make a line change here popper omir and Nigel pack picked up an early two fouls just a really good drive by Marcel just a middle screen by middle Brooks and a hard take off the bounce going Applause left I think Kevin Keats is going to run something for DJ horn here hasnt scored in over 10 minutes its the 1630 Mark they get a screen for morcel and Horn got a good look but miss from three h back on the floor from Myers 134 NC State when he left hurricanes did well to survive without a out sport NC State 168 in that span to from George missed it from three so Nigel pack with those two fouls but Jim Lena you got to know who you can trust and certainly he can trust his veteran point guard on the floor not to commit a third that comes in for double team off of omir or is it oms calling for review which you cannot do until theyre under two minutes and Jamie lucky says its North Carolina State ball morcel to jumper that looks like a confident jump shooter right there that looked like last years case and NC state has to be better at their situational offense executing on Baseline out of bounds off of dead balls off of free throws things like that where they they have to execute better George pass deflected Miamis now turned it over as many times as they did in the whole game on Saturday against pit thats eight NC State is plus five in that category porn a step on George porn drives it and George grabs it jet back to back there Kevin Keats has run the augers cut for horn over the top of that double screen up at the elbows hes had two good opportunities Roberts got the on him didnt use the screen this fired from three hes got hold here theyre shooting at 32 and a 21 3 for 14 from three this is the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC omir out with some high hands his first foul its a really nice job by Casey Morel to attack the outside hip to force omir to reach one of the things that Jim Lena can do with nor Chad omir because hes 67 and hes athletic and he moves his feet so well as he can change up his ball screen coverage right now hes going with a hard hedge and hes recovering theyre tagging on the weak side and NC State hasnt punished them for that Donal returns for NC State either team shooting well there you go middle Brooks inside got space on omir just left it way long thats exactly what Im talking about right there you got to score that you got to punish that hard hedge on the top of the floor Jo Bay rewarded for all his rebounding efforts gets a friendly Music bounce theres Morel with a hard drive more cell to the right hand left it short NC state has really struggled at The Rim in this game Kevin watch this what Im talking about the hard hedge by omir and he jogs back and middle Brooks has a great look oneonone that time NC State does get the ball to the roller thats what youre supposed to do they were not there on the tag and if they do pinch and tag then you got to kick to the threepoint shooter does he need to put that up right away middle I think hes got to just be strong over his left shoulder with his right hand and now that DJ burs is in the game see DJ will short roll on those things cuz he can meaning that he wont roll all the way to the rim all the time Josephs going to drive it right into him and draw the foul and finish see FS has got to have better discipline right there youre not back youre not going to stop him if youre going to challenge it then dont let him score Music it you got to make a much more aggressive play on it or you leave it Music alone add in the fact that its a second foul and that is just about a worst case scenario moment for Kevin Keats Joseph completes a threepoint play and DJ Burns who checked into the game at the 4 17 Mark is going to check out at the 411 Mark DJ typically sits or stands at the end of the bench hes just going to sit because he knows hes not going back in this to second half lead is two for Miami which is Trail most of the way good Anticipation by popper and then hes hit by Taylor who rejects his threepoint Dy Music Poler just one for eight with two points in his first half Morel looking for Dr on the roll that had him for a moment didnt get it to him now morcel drills are free when Morel gets his speed organized gets him under his shoulders remember last year he was a 41 threepoint shooter for NC State hes hit three straight now Casey Morel for a first half seven poppler one for eight shooting make it one for nine oms got another offensive rebound and an uncontested stick back this is a Miami team that plays offensively at a very elite level and theyre not shooting it well but they are killing NC State on the glass right now miss 19 shots theyve grabbed 10 of those thats a really good offensive rebound percentage better than 50 he season number is 29 Marcels got the last seven make it 10 for the wolf Packel George popper little hesitation in his game now hell shoot it in the lane hell miss another hes one for 10 I go right back to Casey morcel look hes got his hands ready hes got his feet ready tayor still still hanging out the bottom of your screen in the left corner its oconnell on the drive oon to the left hand Applause no this game is still not seen the under four immediate timeout and it will see it on a Miami timeout twopoint North Carolina State lead in KC Morel with a hot half ESPNs exclusive presentation of colge basketball presented by Progressive Insurance is brought to you by HR Block its better with Music block myle guys dont call debut M thats not nice please I appreciate the respect put on my name though thank you D did not miss a shot today George in all kinds of trouble after the time out Miamis turned it over eight times good change by Kevin KS they go to track ball screens off the timeout got to give Miami a different look Joseph at the end of the shot clock through the iron and a rebound for Taylor Connell stubbl so NC State did not have numbers well NC States one shot defense has been good their second shot defense has not based on those 10 offensive rebounds minus n on the boards with plus four turnovers theyve got a twopoint lead Taylor coms it off for diar jumper rattles around and Paul Jo B is a six3 b of the half so Bay on the floor with Joseph noo popper and George and its thrown away by Joseph a ninth Miami turnover OK Connell gets to his spot and finishes thats a good decision by Michael okono a good read on the roll as well tagging from the weak side to be able to come up with that steal first basket with a 48 Point per game score out of Music Stanford George all alone for three Miamis just not hit from out there its the last Touch by NC State put on pass getting sub minutes and another offensive rebound for Miami put Saturday against pit eight turnovers a season low now North Carolina State forces a lot of turnovers but still this is quite a jump for Jim L team in the wrong direction well NC State plus four in the turnover margin and typically Kevin kes teams do turn you over for extra possessions but Miamis turnovers have been neutralized by their offensive rebounding George rolls it in NC State will take the use it or lose it timeout well be back in 30 seconds for the end of this first Music half uhoh its the competitions crisen and me versus you and down in a words per minute race who says no have you played pickle ball yes Ive never played so you got a huge Advantage right there I believe in John crisen though I like Casey more cell right here its horn early its been more cell late in the half for NC State its oconnell not a big shooter steps up at the foul line and buries it and okell as the final two baskets to the half to give NC State a fourpoint lead really good acceleration they ghost the screens on the top and mconnell gets to his right hand its a beautiful pullup jumper not over penetrating knocking down a jumper some things to improve on for both teams halfs for NC State they scored just 15 and 22 respectively against Virginia and Syracuse theyve had a much better second half team of late theyre a little better in the first half today and they lead by four with the ball at home Kevin keep will start with the same lineup that started the game four guards and DJ Burns hor oonn morcel Taylor and the big man burns who has just two old pack four of nine from three nine of 22 from two inside to get an early touch for burns held up well by omir whos then called for a foul with five to shoot or Chad omir second late clock pump it inside get something productive yeah I definitely think that was a foul by omir Burns gets to earn it at the free throw line shoots it at 60 there TJ Bird shooting it his worst free throw percentage since his first year this is fifth College year lowest field goal percentage of his career just 51 hes over for two there he not been the same DJ Burns this year Miamis got the starting five back on the floor heres RGA popper who was one for 10 in the first half and hits a three to start the second he has the second best threepoint percentage in the ACC at 46 in the Deep Corner that is a tough cover for NC State 46 out of 101 from three and omir got to be careful with two fouls gets the takeaway sets up back oms push shot is not in omir a second chance he missed another one omir trying for another offensive rebound of Miami misses an absolutely golden opportunity pull up three for Taylor not even close not a good shot incredible effort and hustle on one end of the floor and the air goes back out of the building rigel pack did not score in the first half 14 points per game score for Miami the switch with Burns and then throws it away thats tapped by horn and he does take it over for NC State Burns again to strong another rebound for omir heres Joseph Miami is Ping tempo as you expected they might Joseph finds George Taylor rips it away and he stay with a three on three and Joseph hooks Taylor from behind rley Joseph second Music foul this is a tough one right here watch the feet get tangled up Joseph trying to pass it from behind and Taylor is going full Music speed the KE told us before the game this is the first time this group of players has faced adversity with all the new players this season tons in transfers four players with 100 college games six with 80 college games but this group as a unit has never faced diversity together how do they respond at a good look for burds thats the play Im talking about as long as NORAD omir is out here hard hedging on these ball screens Burns has got to roll to the rim or short roll and make a decision and a foul against oconnell there JY lucky has a foul near Mid Court ke is just not going to say anything you know its a late whistle but its the right whistle because okell disrupted him off the bounce frustration from behind is probably with the timing of the whistle as much as anything it is O connells first foul and stay switching omir freshman Kean George five points for turnover in the first half popper again and popper needs a well short omir and popler Chase it down again popper over oconnell no another missed layup for Miami neither team has been efficient at the Music basket Burns for Taylor beautiful back cut when G DJ Burns dribbles right at NORAD omir its a great cut back door and because then stayed rebounded and pushed Miami wasnt matched up properly Packer on the yir screen at Burns for a moment horn with a good hands pack prend to shoot back for popper that threepointer is not close and that kind of defines the night for wga popper this is part of the Princeton like principles for NC State when you dribble right at the defender you freeze them for a second and then theres the back door cut and its a great finish by Taylor not to try to overpower it at The Rim just get two points couple of assists for burns who is a terrific playmaker and hell be replaced by Ben Music Middlebrooks Carolina state has led this game pretty much the whole way Miamis only LED for 89 seconds hor hasnt scored about 20 minutes middle Brooks sets up Taylor thats a big one much better choice by Taylor and a nice skip over the top of the defense by middle Brooks just a 33 threepoint shooter Jaden Taylor I mean the pass wasnt in the shooting pocket but what Taylor did is drop his hips not just drop his hands that allowed him to get into the rhythm of his shot George from popper round it out off the glass heres oconnell his pass is tipped out of bounds by oir NC State played well to start this game theyre playing well to start the second half moving the ball watch how he drops his hips much better threepoint attempt by Music Taylor its your igniter well help get that fixed big story in the league tonight though Georgia Tech and North Carolinas first loss in ACC play 7473 hit him an ups test that H as well Boston College beating Syracuse the Clemson all over M the Tigers right now a third of three projected NCAA tournament teams from the ACC by our own Joe lardy Aon Ry its an eightpoint NC State lead a seven nothing old pack run J Taylors been great in this second half the step back over pack and miss a three tipped by omir the hands of popper I still think NCA can do a better job punishing that hedge but the ball pressure by Miami takes Vision away to the roller popper hit the first shot of the half from Miami theyre 0 for8 C over four minutes without a point Nigel pack is f Nigel pack is the one player for NC State defensively that you want to get over the top of on any ball screen action hes got great range from three and NC State so far has done a really good job on him defensively well we heard Kevin Keats emphasize that earlier today do not go under the ball SC against pack that foul is going to be on middle Brooks on a hard drive by omir so middle Brooks picks up two fouls and 3 seconds thats a tough one but its usually the second bump that gets the Music whistle line out again ohir stepping inside this time hes got 14 so quick good Music counter one rebound away from his fourth consecutive double Music double DJ horn no points since the 1630 Mark of the first half after scoring eight of the first 10 hes got omir on him able to find okon and middle Brooks for a moment now gets it to him in the lane and thats blocked cleanly out of bounds with to shoot omir never gets the double this is single coverage right here he shows steps Up and Under its a good move Music inside deep in the shot clock its horn on the roll Middlebrooks spinning and Middlebrooks bailed out with a foul with 23 to shoot when you go against DJ Burns every day in practice and DJ has that spin move I think you pick it up yourself thats exactly what middle Brooks does right here watch how quick this move Music is was on poer on the help his Music second as Kevin Keats before the game what do you need from DJ Burns and he said its its as much what we need from DJ Birds backups need consistency from Ben Middlebrooks whos had some great games but a double double at Old Miss at 14 points didnt miss a shot from the line of the field against way farest a few games ago but its the consistency theyre still waiting for for the Clemson transfers you can throw di in that category as well is seven as pack penetrates isan George Pat gets a clean look pack has his first points good good ball Movement by Miami you cant let him see a big rim he is too good outside the arc 39 matching the Hurricanes team Music total oconnell across the way good look for horn and he missed it badly 11th rebound for omir who has that double double again man just gets down the floor so quickly pays for their highest scoring year since 19991 back to omir no double team at the moment and omir will shoot over Middlebrooks hes winning that match up right now they have to start doubling do you think he might have to try to turn him into a passer you cant let him catch it that deep Taylor another three his second and the Applause half newc state in the first half did such a good job of forcing Miami out the paint not letting them get inside you know making them run their offense on the top of the floor not below the free throw line but here in the second half Miami is getting the ball below the free throw line whether its Corner threes or interior penetrating passes to omir pack took a bump from Taylor its a fourth foul and a half on NC State Jaden Taylor second you dont want to put Miami to the free throw line you want to get in the bonus early got to have a little bit better defensive discipline Music here P deep one in and out George the only player who actually elevated for that rebound and then hes found Miami is plus 16 right now on the glass again its a lot of Miss threes long rebounds and that small lineup on the floor for NC State Its a combination of all those things they got to pursue the basketball if youre NC State youve got to stop letting Miami get those offensive glass NC state has 16 defensive rebounds Miami has 15 offensive rebounds back to omir oconnell holds up omir finds popper who shot puts it in really good cut by popper to the middle of the floor when he gets in the middle his midrange is outand third make of the night 15 tries wga Poppers got seven the lead back down to three horn is fouled omir came out High thats a third on nor Chad omir and thats the second time hes picked up a foul on that hard hedge defending NC States ball screen action hes going to come out right near the Under 12 for noo Jo B will take somebodys place as well Music dont think Miamis figured out who yet trying to go six on five little power play itll be George leaving the floor and with the extra long delay DJ Burns gets another shift I like putting DJ Burns in on an offensive Music possession and after omir leaves the game Burns returns and the Freshman noo on him ell looking his way Burns was pickpocketed by pack he oconnell has to see that before he throws it in there Joseph going to find Joe Bay its off the heel of LJ Thomas who runs with the ball and is blocked by noo with Joseph in Pursuit old pack wanted a foul Joseph into the body of burns missed the shot no foul by Burns this time and Thomas going to feed Morel whos all alone good push and transition by NC State theres the up and down game we expected this game to be double figure six of the last seven for Casey morcel both teams making big plays at The Rim poppler trying to find his touch he is blocked and fouled by Thomas and Kevin Keat is iate some of the NC State coaches are even more Iran its a fivepoint game FID Lee Carolina Duke and Clemson uh the muddled middle of this conference prevents it from getting any more than threat and everybodys beating up on each other Miamis in the mix right now with a net of 61 the two and three in Quad One games are 41 in Quad 2 they have losses in quadron 3 and quad 4 as well it was a home loss to Louisville so this is another significant one for Jim lus team this will be a quad two win on the road would take them to 7 and four in the top two quadrants a big chance to bolster their NCAA tournament resume in a game again where theyre missing Matthew Cleveland but theyve got some work to do in the final Music Applause 1131 was a three shot foul before he went to break on Orga popper and by the way we said Kevin Keats was irate he was irate at LJ Thomas for committing the foul not for the call to the foul it was clearly a slap on the hand and just to add to your point Kevin doubt Matthew Cleveland being out since December 21st Miami has only had their regular starting lineup in four out of 11 games hard to build some consistency and chemistry that way especially remember that this is a team that has a good portion of their quarterback from going to the final four last year they havent had any major injuries but they keep having one minor injury after another popup omir missed the Syracuse game they lost at a buzzer P missed a couple pper missed a couple and has remain hampered by an ankle injury inside BS leaves it short against miloko Connell fighting for it and he falls out of bounds itll be Miami B here is Matthew Cleveland 15 points six rebounds per game second leading scorer and rebounder with his hip in the win at Notre Music Dame and Miami wasnt deep anyway theyve only had couple of players playing all 20 games Joseph and George are the only two hurricanes to suit up every night this being the 21st now well they only have two starters on the floor right now pack and popper and it will be pack taking it to the rim and scoring I mean wheres the help you cant pinch off the strong side because Poppers in the the corner and you dont want to help off the strong side shooter but you also dont want to get a straight line drive up five a second and half for pack after a scoreless first bouns it inside to Burns Quick Pass and its horn who gets his first Basket in 22 minutes of action that slice cut or that cut on that 45° angle when the ball goes into burns on the weak side thats one that MC state gets quite often is going to get as much space as he wants out there not a shooting threat pack with a switch on burns pack is foul pack finishes and a chance to tie it at the Line This is a smart play by Nigel p i mean watch right here he sees Burns is going to switch off on me are you kidding me Im taking him to the basket right here Im going to score count it and one M Kevin ke wanted a push off there he does not get it was DJ Burns third foul and we have seen this story before from Miami Nigel packed some slow starts this year but in the second half he gets cooking and hes got eight points all after halftime would you go as deep into the NCAA tournament as this Miami Core group did youve already seen a bunch of adversity nothing should f you you should be able to handle every game situation and then Jim Lena is the master over there hes number one in act active coaches in D1 games coached now that Cliff Ellis has announced that at Coastal Carolina that hes going to retire after this season today is number 1228 Jim Len AUM third foul on Joseph there and heres horn again it doesnt take Kim Ms to get going hes very streaky as we saw eight of the first 10 points of the game and then we didnt hear from him for a while well theyve got no on a tough spot he got rid of it to pack and George is down the floor for Miami he Trail this game by as much as nine pack again he is taking over in the second half textbook off the ball screen snake behind get to the Elbow beautiful at the last seven for Miami Orel driving it into popper nocos there and itll be a blocking foul against noo situational offense for NC State off the Baseline out of bounds play horn elevates over three black jerseys and then watch this snake behind goes right at middle Brooks does a great job pulling up not over penetrating fou was a six against Miami so free throws the rested away for both teams middle Brooks had a wide open o conell and he air M it noell was on the Music sideline turn over number seven for the wolf Music back Applause Music Miami has not had the lead since 2726 theyve LED this game for all of 89 seconds chance to do it with under nine to Music play i go right back to pack late clock he wants the ball Morel is good job by Morel not let job theres popper deep in the shot clock wraps it through fights to woko how did popper see noo through the Music traffic first lead of the half for Miami 5250 on the first and the second bucket by Nook and a great wrap around from popper oh good slip good penetration by Taylor sets up more its a great setup its a smart play the slip by middle Brooks the drive behind the penetration and morcel has his feet ready and His Hands ready Kevin Keats had the sense this going to be a good shooting night for Casey Morel he was right on pack now Hopper tries to chase it morcel as a defensive Music rebound told us he got a lot of shots up with Casey Morel yesterday said he let him win the shooting competition Taylor misses from three noo was out of bounds on the catch I dont know how popper saw this wrap around but this is just a great feed by Miami watch this Zips it in there and it sneaks it in between four white jerseys and on the other side Taylor to Morel for three three for four outside the ark the last time he hit three threes was December 20th and as You mentioned Kevin all the extra shooting has paid off for Casey Morel tonight and NC stage three guards moreel horn and Taylor have done most of the scoring and Horn continues thats a long two so those three now have 38 of the 55 for North Carolina State its a really good screen by diara in good acceleration by Music horn once he stayed his LED nearly the whole game as much as nine five straight after Miami took the lead Jim Lena gets Nigel packed off the ball puts benley Joseph in at the point J somehow kept the dribble after slipping and Taylor has his third block shot of the game he deflects the three from Pat a defensive effort by JD Music Taylor and a foul not close to the basket by George thats going to put a horn at the line for a one and one Music DJ horn 79 free throw shooter not the guy you want to send Music there the popper will take Georges Place 4 second under seven to Music go he Music hey Thursday night ESPN in the ESPN app its a top 15 match up in a big 12 number 12 Texas number 13 Baylor Womens Hoops beginning at 830 Eastern right after the Pro Bowl game

Defender Morel flying by and buries a three 13 points on in the second half for Nigel Music pack can really Str it with range with confidence horn the bump from omir the are playing the loow and big right now for NC State horn over Joseph points it in for three DJ hord with 18 pack again omir will try to take diara keeps a pivot foot down leaves away short Tracked Down by popper another offensive rebound time called by Jamie lucky I think hes wondering if the ball hit the rim now would this be a shot clock issue the shot clock did not Music reset like this did raise the room I thought yep so that should have reset the shock clock to 20 AK 14 the clock says Jamie lucky good piece of officiating there you had a very good grade for the officials at halftime I grade them every halftime I never disclose what the grade is they are the only ones that see it okay would you like to disclose what its in between whats the high and the low end do you want me to start grading you I i rather Laughter not my selfconfidence cant take any more HS be a plus Kev a thank you checks in the mail Joseph on the drive keeps the foot down for Miami with just three to shoot its got to be pack hes tied up and hes fouled by Morel with 14 to go and is saying on the floor that would be the difference between a one and one or a two shot foul how good has Nigel pack been under 10 on the shot clock in the the second half he has made multiple plays for Miami great time and score awareness inside of possession from the Nigel pack was ruled a two shot foul for pack hey every Thursday the ACC network has a womens basketball double header and with the balance of the League this year it is great every week this week no exception for Te first in uba 6 Easter and then NC State North Carolina right here in Raleigh at 8 Thursday on the ACC Network its streaming on the ESPN app its not officially branded as rivalry week but it certainly looks like that the Virginia women have won backto back top 25 games Virginia Tech is one of the top teams in the league and then the Rivalry with North Carolina NC State Jaden Taylor with another three his third hes got 11 of his 12 in the second half and NC State continues to keep Miami at Arms LAN Joseph around Taylor Ben L Joseph in the lane losted numbers for the pack Taylor for Morel and a Applause foul really good push up the floor by Jadon Taylor options on both Music sides Taylors played an exceptional second half of the uh just the one poor shot in transition that he shot for three that I know Kevin Keats didnt like I dont think anybody liked it but he bounced right back and knocked down his next Triple and hes made another one Music since sell their best free throw shooter at 83 its the first of two k Taylor played L defensively in the the first half but only had one point he has opened up his game offensively with three threes in the second leading score for Butler last year nearly 13 a game he also has six rebounds struggled in ACC play Kevin ke said his decision making needs to be better three turnovers tonight but his decision making in terms of shot selection has been much better big part of NC States sevenpoint lead with under time to play old pack try to snap a three game losing streak pack another one from dness Nigel pack go ahead and shoot till your arm falls off killer in the second half timeout Miami pack did not have a first half point he has 18 since the halftime whistle and its been a variety of freeze and midrange late clock off the bouns off screens hes 6 for 10 in the second half hes three for five outside the ark 1561 career points the pack hes got Miami back within four in a game where they have trailed almost the whole way horen sets up Taylor missed it looking for his fourth three and oconnell keeps it alive to diara good hustle this the sixth offensive rebound forc stateum then nobody guards the good find that middle screen and roll has been an option for NC State all game based on the way Miami has continued to guard it you know theres only eight ways you can go to ball screen Kevin under overhead I stand switch drop or some variation how many times have you said that in that back is fouled again hell have a chance to continue his ridiculous scoring run but NC State is still on top down the stretch we com righ its your gider well L is not played today but is wal Packer looking to take a 1614 lead in the alltime series a lot of close games between these two in the ACC one and one Nigel pack who now has 16 of the last 18 for Miami 19 points in the second half the hurricanes have just had all kinds of trouble breaking through theyve only LED this game for a minute 50 Pat goes two for two hes for NC State offensively down the stretch down stay aggressive get Casey Morel the basketball ball or DJ horn theyve had the hot hand theyve been nine threes horn morcel and Taylor 38 heres horn and that was way way short not the kind of execution you want coming off the timeout you can set up that three by going inside out theres a lot of different ways you can set it up but not pulling it right there off the the dribble drive on the top of the floor Miami Remember When without Matthew Cleveland missing his second straight game of a hip injury lets see if they trap Nigel pack and try to get the ball out of his hands he get it out of his hands for the moment to popper morels going to face guard him after he gets rid of it popler fouled by hor another late whistle DJ hord wanted to argue decided to nod his head instead his first foul and free throw is coming for popper Miami doing a really good job of stopping the clock getting to the free throw line here again the defensive discipline of NC State dont forget coming up just a few minutes on ESPN their super Tuesday super Tuesday triple header its CT off by royola bar and Gonzaga wiers of course F at the West Coast Conference that game on the ESPN app as well two missed free throws for popper who was 34 for 40 on the year 3 for 15 from the field one for five from three and just three for five from the line for Miami third leading score tonight under three to play the lead is three Taylor on the floor with horn morelo Connell and diara Horn deep in the shot clock and a foul before the shot thats oms fourth and it came with two to shoot what a break for NC State that omir commits that foul with two on the shot clock heres the way the wolf pack started the season 5 one and have lost their last three in conference Music play not a great nonconference for NC Ste eight and three but did not have a quad one or two win in that span so great start to conference play things looking up here in Raleigh seventh year for Kevin Keats hes taken him to the NCAA tournament twice but this on three stretch has knocked NC State off of the bubble right now according to Joel lardy LA to win they try to get back into that conversation trying to stop the bleeding at home and theyve got the lead by Applause five 20 points for DJ horn their leading scorer again its Pat out by Taylor George from way out that is not the shot for Miami got to stay aggressive here at your NC Applause Music State War Marcel and Taylor have owned the scoring 49 points between those three Mi switching all that ball screen action now got oir on him with the four fouls deep in the shot clock again two minutes to play okon for three he almost never takes him from out there pack still a two possession game that pass deflected Finds Its way to George called Jo Bay not a threepoint shooter not much of a shooter at all Jos Drive grabbed by omir and omir has fouled before the shot but it will be a two shot foul in the double bonus I mean you if youre in C State you have the guy you want taking the shot its not packed and then theres no rebound by the wolf pack they have just been really smothered on the glass by Miami Gams are plus 15 rebounding and yet down five kley Joseph for return for Joe Bay and another score on the floor for Miami rir with his fourth straight double double hes been outstanding once again tonight and he makes this a one possession game with 99 seconds to go here comes a trap by Miami gets rid of it opportunity to push you want to attack that pressure decided to pull it out instead andc state has three timeouts and a threepoint lead at a minute 20 ball in the hands of their leading scorer horn omir on the switch horn gets rid of it though its oconnell on the drive he scores it at The Rim how about Michael oconnell back to back misses the three and then takes it strong off the bouns a big bucket by oconnell in just his second start of the year and a 30C timeout in a fivepoint game a smart decision you got to punish that switch its a great take and it finish at The Music Rim youll love this so much space wait with a starting lineup the last few games Michael oconnell made just the second start of the Year tonight rewards his coach with a big bucket Lee North Carolina State a fivepoint lead with the minute three to go try to snap a threegame losing streak and trying to put a major dent in Miamis NCAA tournament resume well outside of the rebounding number the small guard lineup has worked for NC State I think theyve played better offensively but you cant let pack make this play right here at Taylor hounding him with another a minute to go pack leans in with the left hand no offensive rebound back to pack horn in the air and its a foul called pack leaned in to try to draw the contact and a three shot foul stop the clock at 506 he what a heads up play by pack another offensive rebound by Applause Miami did he step inside the threepoint line thats cuz thats clearly a foul official Jamie Lucks going to go over there and take a look and make sure that he is behind the threepoint line took a couple of Jabs with that right foot but I think he stayed behind it I did Applause too and Jamie lucky confirms it and has been a virtuoso second half for Nigel P we got to expect pressure coming here by P uh by Miami following the free throws 6 for six tonight 21 points all since halftime for Nigel pack NC State does have three timeouts and thats a big G Miss can still make it a one possession game but only a threepoint game theres also some chicken on the line I believe there some chicken in his dance oh chcken for Music everyone one 14 three at a crucial moment got to get it across and did they no its a 10c violation and they had three timeouts remaining you have to have an awareness Taylor picked it up and threw it a ball reversal back over to DJ horn you got to get it across the line Applause well see the clock in the bottom left of the screen I dont know why Taylor picked up his dribble you call a timeout as well you reset the 10sec count so an inexplicable mistake Miami gets the ball back down four George has a clean look missed it deep flying Try by Joseph for the rebound Joseph saves it to popper under 30 to play here Comes pack pack hoist a deep three no good omir fighting omir gets the ball he misses a layup and they have to foul horn a million little chances for Miami on the possession they get nothing and they send horn to the line with victory in sight for The Music Wack plenty of opportunity for Miami and DJ horn who started the offense scoring eight of the first 10 as a chance to finish the game off here at the free throw Music line NC State Should face guard pack not let him catch make Miami come back to the basketball dont let them catch it with a he of steam switch on everything dont give up a Music three scorn with 22 de ke will use a timeout a two possession game only if those possessions are threes at threepoint Applause plays its a good timeout make sure everybody understands defensively and then if you get the rebound youve got to be ready for Miami to foul you got to stay strong with the ball I would not let Pat catch it in this situation cant get beat over the top Music dont thats a huddle that needs a win three straight losses after a 5 one start in ACC play Virginia Tech at home Virginia and Syracuse on the road at the low point of the Season NC state has responded with big games from horn and Taylor and Morel and this four guard lineup has given up sight theyve been out rebounded by 16 yet theyre on the brink of closing out the Applause win you need a three here Miami I think so and you like Pat catch it hes going to shoot a three right here oh little pitch 21 back to popper and its been that kind of night for him omir touched it out of bounds NC State ball and it is all over but for the icing on a North Carolina state win a much needed wolf pack win you got to protect your home court in this league you know that horn fouled by George and hell ended at the free throw line with a make if he can do just that home teams in the ACC in League Play have won 53 of the games Kevin on the road its 47 thats how balanced and how tough Its been to win on the road thats why its important for Kevin Keats right here and Nigel pack couldnt do it by himself in the second half but what a second half by that young man starting to feel like its going to be a season of what ifs for Miami what if Matthew Clevelands healthy tonight what if nor Chad oir doesnt miss a Syracuse game no question what if Miami doesnt have major foul trouble early in a couple of their losses I mean the margins have been so thin for team this year they just have not been healthy and havent been whole eightpoint game pack will take it down the floor beautiful second half for him hell finish with 23 and Jim Len angle will use it timeout and try to set up the old 632 second play where is that one in the Playbook well its not there but gives us a chance to talk about whats remaining on Miami schedule these quad one opportunities mean again its there for Miami including tonight four quad two games remaining so after tonight eight games left in one of the top two quadrants on the road at Virginia which is not lost at home this year two with Carolina at Clemson home to Duke at the end of February there are a lot of opportunities for Miami to get wins and thats what weve seen the tournament committee value your net can be a little lower if you get the quad one and quad two wins typically that can outweigh some other flaws in the profile but this is going to be another opportunity it appears thats L by Amy B well youd like to think that where you finished in your league matters but last year Clemson won 15 games and it didnt matter for them so I I dont understand why the lean keeps being devalued but when Georgia Tech beats Duke in North Carolina and conf play and theyre at the bottom of the league I think that tells you about the strength of the lead in North Carolina and Duke both projected as potential final four teams and you know as well as anybody Kevin once you get to the NCAA tournament its about Music matchups accs had an awful lot of good matchups in the tournament the last few years despite getting fewer bids so the inbound to Horn hell dribble it out and the losing streak is shattered a three for Carolina States 24 for
