is out for tonight they dont know how long he will be out so there are adjustments in the back court for Reese beakman and beakman has the basketball first with Dante Harris the Georgetown transfer roie dun rounding out the top five and here is Harris number one roie gives it to Dunn beakman probes done wide open three this is UVA team that comes into this game Cory shooting 43 from Beyond The Arc and thats the strength of this team is their ability to shoot the basketball from Beyond the threepoint Arc without iMac theyre going to need some other guys to step up in this one I like Ryan Dunn stepping up and confidently taking that first look for Texas Southern keep your eye on number three PJ Henry he can go off hes only averaging 9 and a half points per game this year but hes gone for as many as 41 and with the shot clock at three the defense breaks down and right down the middle goes Jamar young and Jamar young beating Blake Buchanan off the bounce on that possession but no more importantly no one there to help Blake normally you find someone in the gaps on that possession for Virginia so the former SMU Mustang gives Texas Southern the early lead now UVA takes the lead on the three ball from Andrew roie and we talked about the strength of this Virginia team when you consider roie IM and Jacob Groves who will be coming off the bench in this game youve got three light South Shooters on the perimeter yeah Groves is seven of nine this year hard to do better than that hell be coming in the game shortly there goes PJ Henry left it short got his own Miss and you get an opportunity early to see the biggest concern for Virginia throughout this season offensive rebounding giving up multiple possessions after a strong defensive Applause stand Buchanan puts up a good fight fight that time and uvas got the basketball pass knocked out of bounds and Virginia will keep it Jonathan CE was the last to Applause touch nice ball movement in the screen to be able to give Andrew Ro a nice look and again Ros going to have to be one of those guys thats somewhat unconscious for Virginia not worry about when hes not shooting it well continue to take those shots to put pressure on the defense yanan found the cutter and done is fouled and it appeared to me that after feeding the ball to Buchanan Reese beakman said shoot that ball well again weve been saying that to reach for the last four years well three years so when you think about that Im sure hes heard it before but he knows that Blake Buchanan has an opportunity in the post he is very skilled and when he catches the basketball in the post he normally has an advantage over anyone Guardian Ryan dun 68 second year from Freeport New York played at Long Island Lutheran and hes averaging about nine points nine rebounds a game but its the energy as we talked about on Friday in the game against Florida that is the primary thing that coach Bennett wants out of him on both ends of the floor hes had a record tying his schol record seven steals in that game against Florida getting in the passing Lanes being disruptive defensively but also just like that cutting to the basket getting fouls on the opposing team Texas Southern is 0 and2 on the young year going through its annual and seemingly endless road trip of High games that fund the program head coach Johnny Jones knows the drill and they have picked off their share of power Conference teams over the years four to shoot tough shot from the foul line goes on the turnaround its Kenny Hunter and Kenny Hunter has the ability hes showing that he can score in the painted area great job defensively by Virginia right there so often times good offense Beast great defense heres roie you can and this time puts it up from 15 but thats a good look for him youll take that if youre Tony Bennett this is Dean strad working on roie bad pass taken away by dun steel number one for number 13 but thats what you know Ryan Dunn does he makes it so disruptable on the offensive end of the floor and you think about he and REE beakman and Dante Harris all on the floor defensively that puts a pressure a lot of pressure on any team Harris being guarded by Cay beakman Miss fires and it goes to Texas Applause Southern theres Johnny Jones and his sixth year as head coach of the Tigers and he has taken them to the last three NCAA tournaments youve been there for the last two swack tournament championships Cory yeah this team in this program and you mentioned the fact that theyre on the road they will not play their first home game until December 21st and so they take a lot of lumps early but they often times it pays off for them once they get into the swack tournament which it has for them the last three seasons yeah from here they will have games at kraton at Oral Roberts at Drake at Purdue before playing a home game in the middle of December theyve lost this year at New Mexico and then at Arizona State again with the shot clock down the three ball Way Off the Mark and an offensive rebound by the Tigers who then throw it away young threw it into the back court trying to find say and UVA takes it back and theres Tony Bennett year number 15 as head coach here in Charlottesville spent three years at Washington State as the head coach before taking the job at UVA beakman driving dish roie thought about it now steps back five on the shot clock Harris glances at the clock gives to beakman he puts it up around and out halfway down but wouldnt fall a couple of good looks earlier on that possession for Virginia that they turned away I thought Ro had one as well as Buchanan in the post Cay still with the dribble dumps it off I think Buchanan got a piece shot clock in one he gets it up on the rim so play Applause Music continues out of bounds on the Baseline and that will take us to our first media timeout five minutes in and the team from the swack is hanging with the team from the ACC ready Off the Bench with 16 points but Isaac McNeely was the big story rolling that ankle and so he is unavailable today Tony Bennett told us not long before tip off they just dont know how long hes going to be out well if you know anyone around here that can fix an ankle is Ethan CBA you had opportunity to see iMac walking off with Ethan CBA after that injury in Virginias next game will be Monday against Wisconsin and Fort Meyers so when you think about that it gives him about 6 days to get recovered Jake Groves looks the defense off and lays it in and Jake Groves has been spectacular you talked about him shooting 77 from three seven from nine on the season coming into this game youre sure Johnny Jones has told his team do not let him have a three that time he gets an uncontested walk to the rim and you know Johnny Jones told us after their shoot around this morning you know we know were going to be up against it of course we want to win were striving to win but weve got goals within the game and we want to bring energy and so far through the first 6 minutes Cory they have brought that energy and are hanging around as CE knocks down the shot they also have out rebounded Virginia and Johnny Jones team has three offensive rebounds thats a sign of their energy well we talked about that in the beginning you know thats one of the concerns for Virginia on the season theres a smaller Virginia team than youve seen in the past Tony Bennett has been concerned about their rebounding coming into this game as well as coming into this season three offensive rebounds for Texas Southern tonight Virginias got one Groves a rare Miss from the Applause perimeter last year Texas Southern had to sneak into its own Conference tournament as the number eight seed they were 11 and 20 in the regular year but got healthy at the right time and rattled off three straight wins to make a third straight trip to the big dance Cay has his pass taken away steel number two by done hes got numbers great defense to thwart the pass to Dun my goodness that was anticipated beautifully by PJ Henry it absolutely was because Dante Harris absolutely wanted to throw the L to Ryan dun on that possession it was a Give It Up to get it back with Ryan dun but a great job stunting by PJ Henry to get over Ryan Dunn comes up with his second steal on the game and hes wanting that back but there was never a time where PJ Henry was going even to guard Dante Harris it was simply about not allowing dun to get the dunk and Harris just has to read that right Cory yes he does just go take that in and Lay It Up of course you want the Highlight play however you want the two points even more heres PJ Applause Henry second Defender comes to get the ball out of Youngs hands and he turns it over with a double dribble and thats the patented post trap Tony Bennett has applied it in all 15 Seasons here at University of Virginia and it is one of the reasons why Virginia forces so many turnovers everyone thinks that the defense is designed to run down the shot clock however they force turnovers often with the post trap are you more impressed with Tony Bennetts resume of creating great defenses or helping to create great Shooters Batman all the way to the bucket I mean you think about the list of great Shooters between Washington State and here at Virginia Im going with great defenses okay because everybody wants to shoot thats easy its easy to work on that its difficult to play defense nobody wants to do that so when you can get guys to buy in and defend thats when youre really coaching them up Kane Murrays comeing into the game for Virginia number 10 in white and again the shot clock coming into play for Texas Southern tough shot zarius mortal has come into the game he missed that shot this is his season debut view he was suspended the first couple of games by Coach Jones and there he has the ball go through his hands and out of bounds its another Texas Southern turnover and takes us to another timeout but still Coach Jones and his Tigers hanging around the Music Cavaliers still has hope for Charlotte this pack ready to howl the stallion of course Barbara Jordan and if we had a fourth spot Im going to go with Yolanda Adams Yolanda Adams does not belong in any fourth spot I dont know she is number one to me when you start talking about the greatest gospel singers of all time its pretty good list so they have made the trip from Houston here to Charlottesville Virginia in what is known as a buy game or a guarantee game as Leon Bond makes his way to the bucket for his first two immediate impact thats the reason we talked about Leon bond in our open simply when he comes off the bench things change for Virginia especially here at jpj and again hes from wossa Wisconsin one of three Wisconsin natives on this roster for Tony Bennett from Stevens Point Music Applause Wisconsin Bond attacking the basket selling it with a short pump fake there but I believe that his goal is to get to the rim Im not sure hes as comfortable shooting the basketball from Beyond the threepoint Arc at this point of his career one of the red shirts that have benefited from that year off acclimating themselves here on grounds and you may have just noticed the PA announcer announcing what sounded like Shaquille ONeal is coming to the game its his son Shakir number eight in Maroon he started the last game but Johnny Jones says hes still not set on whos going to start going forward so hes having auditions throughout this couple of weeks stretch and so Sha here who plays nothing like his father is out there for the first time well itd be hard for him to play like his father when of course hes about a foot shorter and about 200 lbs lighter but outside of that a lot of promise for Shakir for Johnny Jones Groves has it go in and out Texas Southern with the basketball zarus mortal another steal for UVA beakman jumped the route and then he is fouled before Bond could throw it down reee beakman with his first steal on the evening now 55 short of catching oel Wilson for the alltime lead at the University of Virginia and I must say without an asteris right because this is only Reeses fourth year so Im hoping he gets to that point because this season so therefore there is no Asis for breaking a record in a fifth season is he going to get there I believe so hes averaging 23 steals a game coming in last year second in the country or second in the ACC rather at 18 and he rolls in the shot the senior from Milwaukee makes it 137 UVA and I think thats where hes going to make a difference more so this season is his ability to score put points on the board leading this Virginia team not only in assists and steals but also in points that here is Shakir ONeal number 86 fe8 still growing but as mentioned does not play or look like his dad in terms of style he got a hand on the rebound but it comes to beakman good box out inside for UVA dun goes flying above the rim and hes fortunate to have had a soft Landing as the ball went out of bounds but I love the way Virginia is getting out in transition and more importantly looking for those opportunities Ryan Dunn Leon Bond these two guys give Virginia two athletic wings that put so much pressure on opposing defenses by having to get back on defense so much so North Carolina ENT on Tuesday night didnt even crash the offensive glass because they were concerned about Virginia getting back defensively on that transition I just had a little flashback to Sherman Douglas throwing a lob in transition from near Mid Court you only say that because you like to say Sherman Douglas or Douglas Thomas Sherman maybe tomorrow we have two featured ACC Mens Basketball match match ups first Bucknell takes on number nine Duke in Durham at 6 Eastern and then UC Riverside is in Chapel Hill to face number 20 North Carolina at 8 Eastern catch all the action on acc Network and the app with Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman is Ryan Dunn shoots his second free throw its an 80 UVA run the turnovers continue to pile up for Texas Southern they have coughed it up five times and this for a team that coughed it up 19 times against Arizona State the last time out now and no turnovers for Virginia to this point as Virginia comes up with another steal oh and a blocking foul for the trouble as Jaylen weisinger tried to draw the charge instead he winds up on a poster and Jaylen weisinger has to read the room you got to understand Ryan done coming you like shoot like that you got to get out of the way Young fella dont try to take that charge thats only going to get you on Sports Center top 10 well we have seen a couple already this year from dun that tops them all were all feeling the same way as that young Applause lady Applause again two UVA Defenders deflected that pass and knocked it out of bounds but one of the things youre seeing from Virginia is theyre being so much more disruptive defensively theyve got guys that can get out and hedge the screens the way and pick and roll basketball the way Tony Bennett wants it to happen but more importantly is the rotations on the backside where you have so many guys showing off their athleticism whether theyre coming up with steals or getting to Reflections is disruptive for opposing team you Canon back in but thats another example of that Leon bond is contesting passes Virginias not allowing any passes to be simple easy passes and youre talking about a team that normally is playing in the packline defense but right now theyre extending that to put more pressure on Texas Southern and just the second team foul against Virginia wide openen look snaps the Virginia run buried by keln faroo a red shirt Jr from Houston and kelen faroo transferring in from Hampton University so no stranger to the Commonwealth of Virginia the red shirted back in 2020 21 at Hampton and then last year was his first at Texas Southern Harris no Texas Southern comes down with the rebound and Kenny Applause Hunter block shot Ryan done tell you what first 12 minutes his energy has been off the charts it absolutely has and Ryan Dunn we had a conversation earlier in the off season I talked to him about the fact that he didnt look like he was having fun playing basketball and this is a young man who of course has a great personality and enjoys what hes doing out here right now he looks like hes having fun when you said he didnt look like he was having fun did you mean last season no this was this was in practice earlier this year I came up watching practice and you know he looked like he was just putting so much pressure on himself well here he is from the corner free and easy well I tell you what those threes are much easier after you go put somebody on the post and start dunking on people right right now Ryan D his had his imprint all over this first Applause Music half that was a twopoint shot from The Wing by Shakir ONeal the red Shir sophore from Los Angeles his first shot attempt roie before the shot no bucket its an offensive foul on the pass that goes against Dante Harris well we could put together a dunk package for Ryan dun throughout his time at the University of Virginia however this one goes straight to number one by pineapple got now we need to see the reaction to that one because that is number one its not a bad thing when youve got a list of dunks three and a half games into the season that could wind up being on the year end highlight reel and not a bad thing also to have nine points two steals one block inless than 17 minutes of play for Ryan dun here in this first half five different who have scored led by duns nine meanwhile Texas Southern after making two of its first four shots have started struggling against this Virginia Defense no shame in that having missed nine of their last 11 from the field theres a spin move from ONeal that he did in practice this morning that dropped your jaw now he finished it against his own team he didnt finish it drew the foul here but thats when I said okay hes got a whole different skill set than his father he absolutely does and when you think about Shakir and I I wasted a trivia question on you during the timeout lets see if I was paying attention no no you were paying attention to this one asking you why you felt that Shakir was wearing the number eight well I wasnt wondering I never think about uniform numbers but I know why now you were stumped completely his fathers I wouldnt call them favorite teammates but his best teammate Kobe Bryant of course first number was number eight now Shakir was born in 2003 so when Shaq and Kobe were winning championships together their last one was in 2003 however Kobe and sha got became very good friends to the end beakman missed the layup off the terrific feed from the wing yeah Shakir is the youngest of Shaquilles four kids or the youngest of the boys hes got a younger sister actually who just this week signed with the University of Florida and she is nice find the open man in the corner but hes not open for long against Virginia and against ree beakman you know its going to be interesting this year for Virginia and its a stat that their Sid Eric Bacher has in the notes called stocks Its a combination of steals and blocks and its going to be interesting to see who wins the stocks battle this year will that be ree beakman or will it be Ryan dun because when you think about those two guys and their activity defensively youve got two special talents on that end of the floor and do you think those two players are tracking it as well absolutely you have to as a competitor well here in Charlottesville Virginia the fans over the last 15 years have certainly come to appreciate the high level defense they look for it they understand it pman has his pocket pick by Colby Granger Texas Southern with a basketball down by nine now no youre not a numbers guy dougy fresh however that is only Reese Beakmans second turnover this season thats a pretty good number a great number he came into the game with 19 assists and one turnover on the year when you want to talk about assisted turnover ratio it doesnt get any better than that but thats one the things that makes him so great as a player Reese be is not going to come light up the stats from a scoring standpoint every night however everything else hes going to give you his best each and every time out yeah second in the country last year in assist a turnover ratio at 34 to1 and its that combination of taking care of the basketball and playing Elite defense that I think hes going to find a spot in the NBA but look how far Virginia is pressing Texas Southern out on the floor this is different for Virginia defensively theyre not just sitting back in the pack line Tony Bennett is taking advantage of these athletes he has to be able to get out and Applause guard beakman pulls the trigger from Deep look at Buchan and go after the rebound but its a traveling violation as he came down however you love the fact that Blake Buchanan from outside of his area went and track down that offensive rebound that was not one that just came to him you love the fact that he chases after see how far he comes from Beyond the threepoint line to track down that rebound thats the type of energy and effort you want from your first years and just for the record I am paying attention to all of your Virginia specific references that you make has to happen uhoh another one in the stock category another block for Ryan Dunn his second of the game to go along with his two Steals and you coming into that you wouldnt think that there would be many guys that can compete with Reese beakman however Ryan Dunn I Believe is a is a head in the stock category right now as roie comes down a little gimpy defensively done doing a great job keeping keeping his man in front and then not only the block but keeping it in play and coming up with possession after it as Andrew roie ties up his shoe came down a little awkward on that last possession trying to shake it off and so heres Andrew Roy the uh former St Thomas Tommy last years Summit League freshman of the Year Sunday catch a womens college basketball double header on the ACC Network up first number 25 Oklahoma visits Virginia at 2 Eastern followed by Bucknell taking on number 19 Louisville at 4 Eastern both games are also available on the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere talk ACC womens basketball of course which is always at the top of the country shout out to Charlottesville native my young fell nephew little brother Kevin Leatherwood whos on the staff at NC State who got a huge win over Connecticut over the weekend yeah Connecticut is back to be in Connecticut this year yeah and that is like you said a huge win Texas Southern playing without one of its big guys tonight Grayson Carter out with an eye injury theyre hoping hell be back next week Groves commits the foul on the perimeter as he tried to cut off kelen Farooq well Farooq was originally a walkon at Texas Southern and now hes really on the Tigers most versatile weapon he started all five positions Cory last season including point guard when PJ Henry was out injured love having versatile players like that that you can call on to do anything that you need for them to do when youve got guys out hes the right size for it at 66 especially in the swag theres Henry who has been held in check so far tonight still looking for his first points the preseason Player of the Year in the southwestern Athletic Conference Ive said it many of times when you play against Virginia and youre number one on The Scouting Report more often than not its going to be a long evening for you Farooq with the Applause steel out of Westbury Christian in Houston a lot of the guys on the roster playing for their Hometown School many of them transferring back to Texas Southern including Henry who started his career at the University of Hartford and then left when that school dropped its program days after going to the NCA Division 1 tournament Harford Dro down to D3 and Henry came back home to play for Texas Southern three to shoot Cay beats the buzzer and the long rebound comes to the Music Tigers now theres given up offensive rebounds that one youre not as upset about yeah that one is not the same that that was just slipped through Dante Harriss hands he had that basketball in his hands it was just a just slipped out again and the shot clock a big factor Henry with a runner up and over the backboard trying to pull a Larry Bird under three minutes to go wide open for three nothing but net for Dante Harris you love the made threepointer by Dante Harris but Im looking at the read from Reese beakman recognizing the help is coming in to take away Cannon but the re to throw that court that pass across Court across his body uhoh you know I get excited when you see Leon Bond of course Ryan Dunn getting these steals this Virginia team is exciting in transition speaking of exciting the fine from Reese beakman Dante Harris lining up to three knocking it down Virginia having its way steals accumulated for Tony Bennett Club Virginia has finished sixth nationally the last three seasons after going a stretch of seven straight years where they either led the country or were runner up second in the country in scoring defense and right now when you look at this scoring defense for Tony Bennett this is a team that has a chance to do something different and again theyre putting a lot more ex exterior pressure on teams than Ive seen from Tony Bennett groups in the past I love the way that picking up Dante Harris doing a great job picking up full court but you see guys flying around on the defensive end of the floor well in two of their first three games both against the nonpower conference teams UVA has held Charlton State and NCA and to 19 first half points another block shot by beakman and Virginias got it in the hands of dun and one of the things that people dont realize about Reese beakman not only his wingspan but ree beakman is good size for a point guard so getting shots over him of course he can keep you in Fr front of them but showing off his ability to block shots as well and Texas Southerns going to have to go on a heater if theyre going to get anywhere near the 19 scored by two of the first three opponents against UVA this year four to shoot and the whistle comes its a blocking foul against Texas Southern and against Jonathan ceesay now do you know what the record is no I dont say it I know what youre going to do lets lets lets move on look at the halftime report coming up Cory look at the screen why is it I cant ask about the record I just dont think we need to go there Texas Southern Virginia first half recap previewing Duke in Carolina Friday and uh Taylor and Joel are going to have much better things to talk about than what you want to talk about right now no because youre youre anticipating that the record was Syracuse correct yes that was not the record all right lets talk about it then okay so remember the number that I talked to you about with Shakir ONeal wearing number eight Y and again I have to fact check this but I can remember being in Hawaii doing a tournament in Hawaii over Christmas and before that Virginia played Harvard and Harvard had eight points at halftime youre still waiting to fact check that though right youre not sure about that Im not 100 sure but Im pretty sure thats pretty good if it was only eight yes yeah I thought for sure you were talking about that uh game at the Dome to open the season that coincided with the start of the ACC Network I remember very well I know I know you oh I was there for I know you were there I was home crying look at the work inside by Jamar young young man who spent last year at Memphis got his degree but never did play in a game for Penny Hardway he was with the team attended home and away games but uh he is long 611 240 and if theres been any chank in the armor thus far on this season for Virginia has been just this offensive rebounding giving up those Second Chance opportunities especially in the painted area at The Rim theres the architect of the wonderful defense that has been the staple of this program that earned the program a national title in 2019 my goodness thats five seasons ago now just just Five Seasons Thats all uhoh pman goes to the left hand with that 611 Defender coming over I love the Finish but Rees Beakmans one that also can get on a highlight reel going down the lane and dunking all people I thought it was coming shot clock is Applause Music off and one of the goals Johnny Jones told us at shoot around today he was hoping to keep UVA in the 50s seems to be a realistic goal right now but he was hoping theyd score more than 14 in the first half and its another Texas Southern turnover forced by Ryan dun and that will give UVA a chance to get a good shot and also give tony Ben an opportunity to work on some of of the Special Teams things that you do in practice being able to call out perfect timing taking that time out to be able to draw up something that they could use later in the season nothing like live live action reps back in 30 seconds Auto Owners protects your home you say they work on these types of situations in practice what are you expecting to see out of the whos here most likely Reese beakman coming off somewhat of a curl screen closest to half court as possible trying to get downhill see if he can get someone to help and of course a great passer that he is averaging 63 assists a game finding someone on the perimeter to take advantage of it Jordan Miner has coming to the game for the first time for Virginia the transfer from miramac for these final 37 done the trigger man remember his brother is a big league pitcher he can throw the baseball pass instead it goes to beatman looking for his own beats the buzzer but its off the back iron the twopoint shot goes off the iron and Virginia heads to the locker room up by a dozen hasnt been a great offensive team points in a college basketball game and a half is great however I love what Virginia is doing defensively spacing the floor more so picking up pressure further out not just sitting back in the pack line but contesting every pass on the perimeter and Cory you saw the third fact on that stat sheet Texas Southern has outrebounded Virginia 2212 tonight how do you explain that well again thats one of the weaknesses of this Virginia team is rebounding the basketball and Im sure something that Tony benett address with this team at halftime but he we talked to him about that pregame and was that going to be the concern for his team coming into this season he said absolutely theyre going to have to do it by committee theyre going to have to have guards coming in as The Bigs try to take other guys off the glass guards coming in and picking up more rebounds well Ryan Dunn has matched ree Beakmans three block shots on the game now hes got to get another steel to catch up with his buddy well Blake Buchan getting involved in the mix coming up with the block side and again Virginia playing without Isaac mcne because of a ankle injury suffered last timeout not sure how long hes going to be out so in the lineup to start Dante Harris hes got the basketball now drives the Baseline finds the cutting view Cannon and he was fouled by Jamar young what do you think I mean its only three or four games into his career whats the ceiling for big number zero in White in time he could be one of the greats here when you think about his ability to not only get the job done offensively but defensively Blake Buchanan can be one of the greats to wear this uniform hes that skilled this is a young man you like you mentioned this is only his fourth game of his career and what we saw from him against Florida on Friday night he was spectacular he was a game changer for Virginia in that game without his performance they dont walk away with the win he gets one of two from the line his first point tonight he is now 12 of of 22 on the season from the free throw line Henry held scoreless hes number three in Maroon the preseason Player of the Year in the swack who has won their last two swack tournament MVP awards but as you mentioned facing Virginia can give you an off night in a hurry blocking foul so no basket No Slam for young on the foul that came beforehand and I had a conversation with a couple people in the back about this earlier most likely a season to go if Ryan Dunn is out the restricted area where he is this would be a charge however with the rule change this year you have to be established well beyond the point to where he got there the offensive player cannot have even planted their Lead Foot you still have to already be there so it is virtually impossible for a secondary Defender to take a charge on a play as such oh thats going to be an offensive foul PJ Henry thought that he had his first bucket in this game coming off the screen but kicks out his leg and is going to get a offensive foul on that possession Johnny Jones obviously not happy about this and you see that right leg come out I dont think thats part of his natural shooting motion so you want to applaud the officials for calling Applause that heres beakman in the lane little fade away and it rolls on ree bakman is going to have to continue to take advantage of those opportunities when he gets them in the pain we talked about his size and his wingspan he can get that shot off over most guards hes going to play against yeah 63 but longer than that heres another Ste for done and weve got oh that could be flavor two free throws coming I I think kelen Farooq took the last one personally and was not going to allow number 13 to take off that Applause time but look at Ryan dun I mean just the pressure he getting getting out into the oh no thats not even close to flr getting out into the passing Lanes the Virginia bench thanking flagrant and so now he has caught beakman three steals three blocks so far tonight if youre keeping track on your tote board theyre called stocks stocks so they both are six and six six and six right down the middle again yes and the terminology when you guys come to the grounds if anybody comes to the grounds here not the campus but the grounds of Virginia theres a whole different language you have to learn yeah you took a nice walk around grounds earlier today I love the grounds a little different than Syracuse huh no Ill tell you what Ill tell you what Virginia in the ACC is a very solid number two terms of beautiful campus oh who are you saying has a better Camp Im sorry one we dont have a campus we are the number one grounds in the that is true one of one so yes we we no no Im sure there are other schools that have grounds but we just have the best grounds well you know who I think has the nicest campus please tell me who Syracuse youve only been there with snow on the ground you should stop by again that would in the spring summer or fall that would make it not the nicest Cas well PJ Henry is now on the board for Texas Southern its 3116 UVA Cavaliers cough it up and a foul will will send the Tigers to the free throw Applause line Second foul on beakman and to the line goes Deon Stout a senior from Fresno California making his fourth Division One Stop UTEP Fresno State last year Eastern Washington and this year Texas Southern Saturday morning the ACC huddle crew will kick off the day in Atlanta at Bobby DOD Stadium 1100 am eastern with a 60minute pregame show leading into Miami hosting Louisville at noon theyll also have halftime shows and pre and postgame shows throughout the day then theyre back at 630 to wrap up the afternoon and to get you set for Syracuse Georgia Tech at 800 after the game stay right here on acc Network for a complete wrapup and interviews with players and coaches another turnover for Virginia oh thats a finish Dion St can get up Virginia with backtoback Applause turnovers and T Murray going to come into the game Tony Bennett I believe most likely going to get roie give him a break after being a part of those two turnovers clean look from the corner and that is a pretty stroke from the Georgetown transfer Dante Harris and thats how you clean it up back to back turnovers and come down and make a three and All Is Forgiven he has gone for 23 points a couple of times in his career those were with the Hoya and dont look now but PJ Henry showing signs of heating up for Texas Southern well hes the guy for Texas Southern he can get hot in a hurry you talked about the preseason swack player of the year and the last two MVPs of the swack tournament so hes a guy that Johnny Jones relies a lot on Duke Canon was fouled and so number zero will head back to the line to shoot a couple well Texas Southern has made its last three shots and has cut the lead a bit thanks to a 93 run and Johnny Jones again told us this morning you know he understands fully well you go into a place like this you cant assume youre going to get a win you cant even necessarily expect a win but you can expect your guys to reach certain goals play with energy and so far I think theyve done that been able to outrebound UVA and keep the game within shouting distance here and the purpose for Johnny Jones is to be able to build its simply about we talked about the fact they wont play their first home game until December 21st so throughout that nine game stretch where theyre playing Road and neutral sight games they have to continue to build so whats going to prepare them for we call it swac when I go down that would be swack action beakman to Harris nice hesitation move but he missed the lefthanded Runner Dunn fights for the ball he comes away with it attacks dumps it off and Buchanan throws it down Blake you Canon gets the Highlight however its Ryan Dunn after his first career double double Contin continuing to have his imprint all over this game the offensive rebound that drop off to Blake new can in the first year with the Music flush in that game he was absolutely the player of the game came off the bench got four points in the first half but was so effective Tony Bennett decided to start him the second half and hes been a starter for the last two games for Virginia and most likely and no of course no ones spot is ever cemented but I believe he gives Virginia the best chance at the Five Spot especially going into ACC play we could see him as a permanent starter for this team moving forward well he was Mr basketball in the state of Idaho last year number 63 in the ESPN 100 in picked Virginia over Gonzaga nearby wazu Idaho where his dad was a football star and Iowa among other schools and hes the guy its not often that true freshmen are able to come in and start pretty much from day one for Tony Bennett well let me tell you this Ive watched Blake Buchanan at the Nike hoop Summit last year as well as the NBA top 100 Camp two seasons ago there were not 62 players in high school better than Blake buan I can tell you every time that he stepped onto the court not only were Scouts you know impressed with what he did but more importantly his peers as well do you think that ranking then perhaps had something to do with the fact there he is with a steel again hedging the screen and roll but having the presence of mind to get his hands down to be able to come up with a steal in that possession thats not something that you can teach youre born to be able to do things like that and I was asking do you think it has something to do with the fact that hes from Idaho yes absolutely does and he didnt play on one of the large you know aaou circuits so again the recognition for him came later I can remember walking into Orlando into the building and everyone saying hey yall got a great one and I had no idea who they were talking about but they were talking about the young man committed to come to Virginia and he was putting on a show at the milk house well we have seen flashes and glimpses through the first three and a half games of his young college career PJ Henry continues to heat up thats seven points now in the second half he is the leading scorer tonight for Texas Applause Southern T Murrays come back into the Music game Harrison beakman in the back cour dun and Buchanan also inside beakman coughs it up uncharacteristic turnovers ree beakman theres the big fell hustling back to block that shot out of bounds and Blake fanons offensive impact has not been the same in this game as what we saw against Florida but his defensive presence has been even more significant running back we already showed the beautiful steal that he came up with but look at the energy and the effort that he uses to come up and denying that opportunity at The Rim he came from a long way to get a offensive rebound earlier he comes from an even further distance to come up with that block shot and tell me that didnt look like a volleyball player there his mom Debbie played volleyball at USC and then spent over two decades as the head volleyball coach at Idaho Blakes brother plays Division One volleyball everybodys spiking the ball I believe its a block party in here right now beakman in a tough spot in the corner cor able to pass out of it roie thought about it heres dun back to beakman just over six minutes gone in the second half UV UPA up by Applause Music 13 Henry looking to work on Music Applause roie Stout is fouled by beakman Applause Music and both number ones come back into the game Kenny Hunter for Texas Southern Dante Harris for Virginia but whats so crazy is both number twos check out how about that very nice Applause yeah weisinger the backup point guard comes free little bit short uv8 crowd wiered it over the back instead its another offensive rebound for the Tigers and there the foul comes as Groves got tangled up with Hunter but hunter showing the size advantage over Groves on that last possession coming up with the offensive rebound and again this is the challenge for Virginia is how will they keep bigger teams off the the offensive glass I believe Virginia has everything else covered thats going to be the challenge for Tony Ben and his staff all season long and its something that theyre absolutely working on but being outrebounded by 10 here on their home floor by Texas Southern its been three minutes since Virginia last scored and throw that one out the window easy look for Jake Rose and the second time weve seen Dante get it down into the painted area and finding a teammate for an easy look in the air ball by Henry looks like Dante Harris took a shot to the face holding his nose as he dribbles up into the corner for three its a good look for Tame Murray and you can tell Tony Bennett has confidence in him shooting the basketball if hes shooting it that early in the shot clock he knows hes a shooter young man from Auckland New Zealand looking for his first points on the night 4025 Virginia trying to pull away its another turnover forced by by that Relentless and suffocating Virginia Applause Music Applause Defense now Shakir ONeal comes back into the game taking the spot in the lineup of Dion stad number seven sits down you like the fact that uh all the uniform numbers are in play this year with the new NCAA ruling I love it absolutely love it the opportunity for guys to be able to wear many of their favorite NBA players numbers like Kobe Bryant number eight like Kobe Bryant number eight like Carmela Anthony number Music seven grov steps back and misses there is ONeal with a rebound what were your NBA numbers well started off with one in San Antonio the number I always wanted to wear would have L I would have wore one here if it was legal way back in the ancient days when I played college basketball are there any color photos of you here Virginia steel Ro gives it up and here goes Bond Leon Bond Tony Bennett fired up about the way that his team is getting out into passing Lanes Virginia has created turnover after turnover throughout this one and more often than not theyve turned them into points on the other end of the Music floor they had to be better defensively and he has gotten the defensive effort here this evening Virginia has done a great job of not only what they customarily do in guarding pick and roll action but more importantly turning those traps and those Hedges into turnovers great play Here by Blake Yukan and not only getting back to his man but recognizing where the basketball is and being able to come up with the steal and Virginias done a great job of turning their defense into offense here tonight and Cory I think culture is overused when we talk about College athletics but its absolutely the culture here of defense and when you are recruited by Virginia you understand that expectation you absolutely do coming in and again even though you understand the expectation you dont understand how difficult it is to do it and again when you have to be held to a standard and thats one of the things that has been difficult for Virginia over the past couple of years is not having those returning guys to be able to come in and teach it to other guys and when you think about todays game in the transfer portal Tony Ben and his staff are having to teach new guys every year so therefore they dont have those veteran players being able to teach him which is why its so important to have a guy like Isaiah Wilkins on the staff who of course was ACC defensive player of the year to be able to help teach these younger players how its done there have been a few of those from Virginia in recent years had a few had a few five to shoot roie with a basketball around and out Ill ask you this Virginia has held three of its first four opponents this season Charlton State NCA an and tonight Texas Southern to fewer than 20 points in each of those three halves they didnt do that to any opponent last year Here Comes Bond again oh and he missed the layup he got a flat tire on that one you could see when he took off just caught a flat tire on his way up I get it I was born with two flat tires but how so comparing this what youve seen from this defensive team I know thats just one stat small sample size level of competition but what have you seen in the early going does this team have the makings to be one of the better defensive teams during the 15 years with coach Bennett thats tough and the reason I say thats tough is because when you think about the guys who have been here over those past 15 years just got a great look at Isaiah Wilkins you think about you know Malcolm brogen the first ever ACC Player of the Year and defensive player of the year you think about m AIT all the guys and the Personnel that was in the mix its hard to say that they can be better than those teams hopefully as this team jails they get to a chance to where theyre just as good but they have been some great Defenders no doubt dont you think beakman and Dunn are going to wind up as Ro Banks it in dont you think those two guys are good enough and have shown enough that they could be remembered in that sort of ilk I absolutely believe that well Reese bman will be hes already been HC defensive player of the year so hes already in that c category but my point is those other teams that youre talking about it was loaded with guys like that youre bringing Braxton key off the bench youre talking about an NBA player coming off the bench on a national championship team where DeAndre Hunter is a lock down defender in M de beside him and J Huff blocking shots at the rim and Jack salt of course Manning everything on the interior well the whos have nine players currently on NBA rosters and a lot of those guys youre talking about are on that list Applause if you can play defense at this level for Virginia that translates T Murray strong to the basket and hes going to shoot twoo so the guys who are in the league right now Malcolm Brockton at Portland Joe Harris with the Pistons DeAndre Hunter Atlanta Trey Murphy New Orleans Ty Jerome with the Cavaliers Jay huff and Braxton key with the Nuggets Anthony Gil with the Wizards Sam Hower with the Celtics a number of those guys are the ones you were talking about that hey they were great defensively here theyre still doing it at the next level Saturday tune in to our week 12 ACC Network football lineup starting with number 10 Louisville versus Miami at noon Eastern and then the hokes host the wolf pack from blackburg and I see we were talking about Hoops I got to tell you about that too couple of featured ACC mens basketball matchups Bucknell taking on Duke 600 thats tomorrow and then in Chaple Hill North Carolina going to play UC Riverside got you covered football basketball doesnt matter here on the ACC Network were glad youre with us here tonight as the Cavaliers are in the midst of a 70 run and again that defense has stifled Texas Southern theyve missed nine of their last 10 Music Applause shots BBY Granger back outside to Jonathan CE give it back to Granger and the biggest difference with this team in comparison to the teams we talked about to bring that back up again is is getting is finishing those defensive possessions with the rebounding thats where this team will be different that that that is more so a struggle where there was not a struggle for those other teams when you think about the guys who are rebounding the basketball as you see great ball movement the fa the flare screen and then the nice drop off from Ro and you notice how every time Ryan Dunn attacks the basket now the crowd gets excited and their bodies people make sure they hit him like no we we cant we cant be on Sports Center youre already going to have the number one play we cant give you two three or four and we just saw the student section weve been looking for pineapple man if hes here hes Incognito he doesnt have the pineapple head tonight so seven stocks right now for Ryan Dunn correct well you tell me I I believe that was the case I thought I saw a graphics say four blocks and three steals or vice versa that would be so seven stocks now he had seven steals against Florida so any blocks of course and he tied the stocks record in that game but look and again if they count deflections right so theres a deflection by beakman yes I tell you what that is a challenge I mean those are those are type of things that you have friendly competitions sure with with your teammates and again theres nothing selfish at all about getting Steals and blocks and deflections so any coach would love to have that type of competition between teammates yeah Im under the understanding dun pulls down the uh Miss shot by Granger it was Rick patino and his staff at Louisville back in the day that first start or at Kentucky excuse me that started uh charting deflections you guys didnt chart deflections back in the day did you Cory I really wasnt into much of that type of stuff I didnt mean you specifically I mean the coach is who you played for they could have again I wasnt listening during those parts of the meetings Bros with a chance for three love the effort by Groves getting to the offensive rebound not allowing himself to be locked out on that possession continued to work and found himself in a position to get a bucket and now an opportunity for and one when we return name the last team to take third place in the NCAA tournament I mean you really want me to do that yeah okay it would be the LSU Tigers okay yeah Johnny Jones and the LSU Tigers played Virginia and Ralph Samson no it was Virginia Virginia beat LSU in that third place game so you didnt quite get it no I I didnt quite get it right in fact you got it just wrong I got it just wrong right Virginia won the game but it was the last ever consolation game played in the NCAA tournament the 1981 final four I was just shocked that you were asking me that when Johnny Jones told us that earlier today well I wanted to ask you a question setting my partner up for one you could actually answer and you still messed we just talked about this 5 hours ago so believe it or not I dont I never realize who actually won the game but I tell you what Johnny Jones was a freshman on that 81 LSU team that played in the consolation game against Virginia in Philadelphia he scored four points on what was a loaded LSU team that easily could have won the national title but as you mentioned and I didnt realize that was the last time in 81 that they had that consolation game that its you know gone away now 40 years and it makes sense that it went away but uh he was part of part of underdale brown and then assisting underdale Brown part of some great teams at LSU hey Johnny got the opportunity to come in and practice at jpg jpj last night with his team and there was a womens game going on so he wanted to come out and watch some of the action and got an opportunity to come in and see the building was talking about how nice a place it was earlier today then he looked up at the banners and said I played in that game yep yeah theyve got the final four banners up there to our left final four in 8184 and then again in 2019 when they won it all of course but Johnny also remembered that the day of the consolation game between LSU and Virginia back in 81 was the same day that President Reagan was shot in Washington DC and they were playing that final four as Jamar young throws it down not far from DC in Philadelphia and you know who won the National Championship that year in 1981 correct I do okay and that was the second of what legendary Hall of Famer coaching career well coach Knight all right got to give the tip of the cap correct as do we remember coach Knight and who did he beat for his third National Championship God is it theres still six minutes to go how many bad Syracuse references are you going to get into I just asked you a trivia question no no no no no that was a pointed trivia question 6 minutes to go 5227 Virginia has pulled away here in the second half bond from the short Corner thats the next progression for Leon Bond shooting the jumper you can see that he does everything else and a young man who has improved tremendously during that red shirt year we talked about earlier one of the many red shirts thats come in and had an impact on this Virginia team after sitting out his first year young is fouled by Buchanan and will shoot two all right you and I have played a game over the years had a little fun with it its inspired by the Charles Barkley game who he played for who he played for right so in this matchup name the Texas Southern Tigers who you teamed with in the NBA ooh now thats a good one Texas Southern tiger that I team with in the NBA man I do not know its a trick question okay no zero okay you know so what what whats so crazy that you mentioned that is I talk to you about the fact that I do the swack Championship Ive done it the last two seasons that Texas Southern of course has won the championship and on my drive to Birmingham from Atlanta I fly into Atlanta I drive to Birmingham I pass through leads Alabama so I always take a picture and send it to Charles Barkley and let him know Im in his hood and he says the same thing why are you Laughter there trying from the other short Corner Bond couldnt complete well how many whos did you team up with in the NBA um only one and that would be one of the greatest whos of all time of course theres only one the greatest of all time in Ralph Samson but a young man whose jersey hangs in the Raptors alltime leading score that would be Bryant stiff who I actually talked with earlier today as before he got on the flight heading to Arkansas where hes a assistant coach at UNCC Greensboro they were on their way to play somewhere in Arkansas theres number 20 be stey my teammate with the Denver Nuggets for more than one year right you guys were GA two or three years two years when Denver and then of course one year here where we teamed up to win a nit Championship over another one of our teammates in Denver one lonso Ellis and in in spite of Bryant for one year having to give up shots to you he still scored over 2500 points let me tell you one thing Bryant stiff never gave up any shots I guarantee you that I might have got shots up but please believe he was getting his shots you got to if youre going to score 2500 Harris with the bump foul that will send Cay to the line to shoot a one and one got another question for you what you got was looking in the UVA record books today and saw that against North Carolina t you had 14 assists in one game how did that happen theres a lot of there are a lot of misnomers about me out there that happened people think was the game 90 minutes long a score however I dropped dimes too only when it suited you no 401 assists in 85 games in two of those 85 games I broke my ankle so its really 83 games cuz I didnt play much in those games but whos keeping track later who yeah whos keeping track of that another near offensive rebound for Texas Southern but it comes to bond Virginia will walk it up with four minutes to go nearing what will be a fourth win of the Year know we talked about the Virginia game verse Harvard where Harvard I believe scored what did they score in that game 19 in second in the second half something like that well 27 but yeah it it was a a tough night for Harvard but you think about the fact that Virginia right now after having played 36 minutes of this game has only allowed 28 points to Texas Southern and again this is the Texas Southern team thats been to the last three NCAA tournaments and another steal Leon Applause Bond Applause Music Applause well another one of the pieces to the Tony Bennett formula is convincing the right guys to red shirt when they come to campus come to grounds and they benefit from it couple of them are in the NBA well talk about that when we come back as it relates to the Future for Leon Bon theii Music years from now when recruit and keep guys let alone when you asked them to red shirt which seems like a completely foreign and archaic idea certainly to this generation and yet Leon Bond the third red shirted last year and is following a blueprint that Virginia has used effectively in recent years and and these guys certainly benefited from that developmental year they absolutely have of course Devon Hall who went on to become an all ACC performer and defensive player mom AIT who was spectacular a big huge part of that National Championship team but again left out of that are transfers Anthony Gil who decided to come in at a time when you had to sit out a year would you think about Sam Hower who sat out so even though these four guys of course came in as first years and red shirted there were other red shirts here at the University of Virginia who came in to have huge performances later kanane Murray for three first three points of the night for the third year from Auckland New Zealand and I can tell you right now theres a group at the end of the Virginia Bench red shirting that are all going to be very important pieces to this program yeah beginning with Elijah gertrud who tours ACL a season ago but I can tell you right now there have been very few players as exciting as gertrud and with Virginia people will recognize the name when when I tell you he has Adam Hall type athleticism this young man is bouncy and hes good hes a very good basketball player he would be in the rotation had he not got hurt a year ago but this red shirt year is going to allow him to get back to 100 healthy hes going to be special in this uniform thats number 12 Elijah gertrud freshman from Jersey City along with and he wheres 12 and he wears 12 thats a good number yes I agree and the others youre talking about Christian Bliss and Anthony Robinson also so first year red shirts at the free throw line weve got to acknowledge Bryce Walker for making that shot his first point as a who after three years spent as a practice player he was added to the roster last week hes now made his second appearance and by golly number 42 has a one and maybe a two in the stat sheet for points in his career as College Hooper and let me tell you he works hard at practice last week walked over introduced himself to me and I told him Bryce I know who you are but he was telling me about his best friend Josiah who plays at Hampton Sydney College where I was actually headed after I left practice to watch Hampton Sydney knock off Christopher Newport who was number one in the country at the time in division three Hampton Sydney was eight but of course moved up since Bon misses also another walk on Tristan how is in the game Id be thinking to feed the ball to number 24 in white as well here he is with it put it up y well Tristan how played for my my teammate Junior burrow who was never bashful about getting a shot so I wouldnt expect anything less of Tristan ad Nori Collegiate Tristans from Virginia Beach under a minute to go five to shoot bond with a tough Runner trickles it over the iron and for Texas Southern as we mentioned the traveling Odyssey will continue into next month theyve already been on the road to New Mexico and Arizona State tonight here at Virginia then at Katon at Oral Roberts at Drake at Purdue to close out the month of November before they finally host well theyve got two games in Vegas before they host Samford on December 21st so uh hopefully they take their lumps here learn from it get better and as you say we may see him in the swack championship game again this year one more timeout taken here in Charlottesville auto owners insures your car because some glad youre watching us here on the ACC network with Cory Alexander the former who Im Doug Sherman fear the Beak he certainly had a good game as did Ryan dun the two that is I assume Ryan beatman no you dont know who that is is right there blue clues oh look at you go I thought I had you on that one I I thought I had you stu with blue no I got that one so the final tally on the stocks seven and seven seven and seven yep beakman had three blocks four steals done reversed four blocks three steals impressive performances by both I believe that something should that absolutely will be a friendly competition and a stat kept by Eric Bacher and his staff the entire season now this is always one of the most disappointing times in a game shot clock is off and so the the WalkOns arent going to get to shoot I want them to get up a shot well I would say that Bryce has scored and Tristan how got a shot up so they both got a shot up in this game all right Johnny Jones Tony Bennett 6233 the uh seemingly inevitable final rebounds
