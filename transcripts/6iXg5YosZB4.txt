point against Kansas And right now North Carolina at 16 and 11 88 in the ACC Notre Dame at 10 and 17 music 2 and 14 in the conference and just trying to cause some harm to other people before the ACC tournament music begins Yeah And this is a Carolina team that is just simply more talented and they cant allow any of that disruption music to enter I dont care that youre on an away floor Youre the superior team and youre playing for more Its an away floor that you enjoyed so much when it was a home floor for you I dont know if the fans enjoyed it but I enjoyed playing laughter So Notre Dame with their first crack at it Dane Goodwin up top Always a deadly threepoint guy Cormarmac Ryan also makes 38 He handles it now with a shot clock down to nine Good looking to make a move Heres Hammond to lift He cant connect off the back of the iron First rebound of the night for Bacon Good contest from RJ Davis They got to get out on shooters and at least at the baseline have a hand in the face Now you went to the shoot around today for North Carolina Youve been watching them all season long Youve had several of their games as Caleb Love misfires on his first attempt Thats been one of their problems He doesnt make enough shots and hes only shooting 31 from the threepoint line But is there still hope for them Do you think internally You would not think that there was the pressure around this program at shooting around today Very upbeat Coach Davis did a good job of keeping it light and its a very connected group Glove will take a tumble He goes down and hes fouled on the play by Cormarmac Ryan and he goes sprawling forward Well see if Caleb is okay 64 Junior from St Louis Hes dealing with an irritated sprain of sorts with his pointer finger on his shooting hand So on the fall I think there is baited breath if you will from the sidelines Uh because hes playing through some pain in his shooting and maybe thats impacting him A group that is already very woeful from beyond the threepoint line Yeah 31 for North Carolinas been a major problem Theyve not been a good shooting team period this year Big Cut needs to touch the ball on every possession in a half court setting Prove that this Notre Dame front line can defend it Nance with a good roll there averaging 106 six rebounds a game but it hasnt been quite enough has it Well he needs to be a guy that makes the defense respect him Scoring early is a great sign Brian to catch and shoot not there for him And RJ Davis wants to push the tempo Thats something that over the decades you become accustomed to in North Carolina Pushing it pushing it pushing it The transition the fast break thats been missing too In and out by Nance It gets them in a rhythm when this group can move that basketball They have the superior athletes Notre Dame cant keep up when the transition game is humming for the Heels Marcus Hammond puts it to the deck Davis sticking with him Just getting underway here in South Bend Nasty nasty weather outside in the Midwest Has been awful today Cold rain Ryan cheering cant connect Its good defense Good effort from Love to contest Fought through the screen Made it a difficult offering for Cormarmac Ryan which ended up in a miss Bacon commanding the ball Goes in strong Hell draw the foul Goodwin wanted a tie up on the play but a foul He was a tick too late Helpside was coming Goodwin just didnt get there in time If he had been earlier that could have been potentially a charge or at least a strip of the basketball Right idea Half step too late As you see Love he goes down low Goodwin just didnt get there in time Not a ton of contact He gets there earlier There is no whistle So Big the 611 senior cant hit the first one Hes talked a lot about being kind of in wits end recently Hes had a very strong season individually but there have been several times after really tough losses There have been too many of those for North Carolina by their standards Nice job underneath there by Nance Hell draw the foul and get a chance for two more foul shots But hes sort of been a spokesman and hes let it all hang out from time to time Hes tried everything as a leader Hes tried to take it to the media Hes tried to take it in the locker room Bondo Bacotts not your normal vocal leader Hes a guy that puts his head down goes to work expects everybody else to follow cheering Tom thank you very much 1741 to go first half North Carolina in absolute must situation They probably all are the rest of the way for North Carolina Theyre on top 4 nothing over Notre Dame And for those just joining us Pete Nance providing offense early on That is critical to the offensive approach for the Heels Well he battled a midseason back problem But that aside theyve wanted more Theyve needed more out of him at a foul here with 725 to go in the half Give you a look at Hubert Davis Trying season to say the least for Hubert About five or six weeks ago hes very confident about Carolina He said This is going to be a great team by the end of the season Well thats how they started to play right around this time last year and they played their way into the national championship game They have the ability They just have to play within who they are and inevitably it comes down to can they make shots Leaky Black leaking in knocked away from him out off of Notre Dame Leaky the 69 grad always a superb defender Nance will take a step out I think the crowd here wants a Notre Dame possession because they believe that ball came off of Black off the deflection Got to find ways to get that ball down to Bacott early Challenge the Irish front line He comes up and sets a tough screen Gets it back in the paint Heres the kick for Black and that clangs away and a rebound by Lasheski Thats the shot you want Bacott got into the teeth of the defense kicked it out Those shots arent being made because leaky blacks just not build as the shooter they need in that spot Hammond just barely off the front of the iron So a very chilly start for the Irish on a cold night in South Bend Outside for sure Johnson with a bounce for Bacott averaging 17 and 11 Swinging for Johnson and Ashesky with another rebound Hes getting about seven a game OB another possession of good offense Got a good look from Puff Johnson Those shots have to fall Youre running good stuff Its good action You got to punctuate Foul here Can the Tar Hills still play their way to the NCAA tournament How about Mike Bray the Notre Dame fighting Irish head coach at least for the rest of this season in his 23rd and final year at Notre Dame Hes saying goodbye not to coaching He wants to coach somewhere down the line Hell be missed Winning his coach in program history Hes done so much with so little for so long Itll be hard to replicate that with whomever comes in He had a great line and shoot around today He said Every talk about Carolinas pressure I said to my guys What about the pressure for us We havent won it all this year Go out there and play like you have some of that on you Thats going to be thrown away by Ryan Phesiveness together I have one word that was proposed from Leaky Black music He said Hakuna matata maybe thats something that will get everyone going They laughed a little bit They said they re real revisit the word but more than anything theyre looking for any way to stay together find ways to reset And coach said When were making shots when were playing the right way no one can beat us When were not together anyone can beat us Well see what they can do tonight Nice job plugging an old Disney movie too I I love the Lion King and I love the message Theyre halfway there Theyre playing together but theyre not making shots early on yet again Starling on the drive and you cant count that Thats going to be a charge So Notre Dame still not on the board and almost five minutes in and turn it over four times too Notre Dame is a threat because Notre Dame can get hot from the three They take care of the basketball and that is the biggest challenge presented as they face the Tar Hills face tonight But the Tar Hills are locked in defensively Theyre making plays Theyre forcing early turnovers You just got to start to make it go offensively and develop a rhythm Davis nice job staying home Taking a brunt of that swing up top for Love Heres Nance North Carolina has not done a good job passing the basketball this season as Love trying to get something going and gave it away Heres Hammond in transition Notre Dame trying to avoid an 18th loss How about Virginia going down to Boston College tonight Ill tell you whos excited about that Miami and Pittsburgh They are firmly in the race to try and win a regular season conference championship Feels like it kind of opened up the race again at the very top Misfire by Stling again Pull up off the front eye by Davis Both sides really cold Love with the kick in the paint No whistle there No foul Lot of contact Lot of contact on the Nance Offer Like the decision for Caleb Love No three Drive it Get the defense to come to him Distribute Just couldnt punctuate Or its the launch And finally Notre Dame is on the board with a triple Thats how the Irish hurt you Play with space Seek the early stuff A lot of shooters on the floor armed with ability Well these are some of the last games in the career of Mike Bray here in Notre Dame From the corner No Johnson couldnt get it to go from way down but Nance pounds his way in the paint and a whistle as well as he makes the shot Pete Dance at 611 Scored a000 points in this career Theyve needed a lot more from him Dance has been engaged engaged Hes been aggressive and hes had a nose for the basketball Hes been around it a lot tonight Thats a good sign because again the movement is there for Carolina The shots are what they should be Its up to these shooters now to start making those Yeah He had a 21point game against Syracuse He had an 18point game against Virginia Tech I think they were anticipating a lot more of those other than the games like two against Miami two points against Duke where he just didnt show up And OB when hes making those shots it makes the offense more dynamic It allows for some gaps to explore those driving lanes where these crafty guards can be more effective But Nance has to produce He is early on He has all seven of their points as they lead at 73 Pretty quiet so far Well short with that one He comes in averaging 15 a game 610 going against RJ Davis A smallest guard You got to back him in and execute That is just giving up on the play from Nate Leashesky done in and out and a rebound tipped to Notre Dame and they control it Notre Dame with six grads on the roster and swatted high out of the sky by Demarco Dunn the 65 sophomore He got up didnt want what Dunn did on the other side Just checked into the game took the quick three didnt allow himself to give warm but hes engaged defensively on this side Carolina is giving up nothing to Notre Dame in the half court setup Hammond bouncing for Ryan and a pullup jumper They just cant really hit anything They are stone cold Notre Dame one for nine Bank shot will go and a smooth one by RJ Davis Love to see that tempo Really that initial thrust Not a fast break score but an early offense score huge for this anemic Tar Hills offense foul off the basketball here with 1238 on the clock Probably hard for Irish fans to recall their 6 and1 start That was before the losing really began in earnest to Syracuse FSU Those games by music one point They lost to Boston College They lost at Georgia Tech Thats a lot of games a veteran savvy team should not be losing And thats been whats so perplexing You would think when you have veterans it leads to a consistent level of winning and you just havent seen it And for Ryan got underneath got outstanding position He got two points One of North Carolinas victories this year has come against Notre Dame That was 8164 in January Bacon had a big one He grabs his own miss Cant get that one Black inside Misses again Heres the follow and a foul North Carolina relentless on the offensive glass And if that sequence doesnt flex the muscle of what the Tar Hills can do I dont know what does They need to pound it down low and just out bully an Irish team thats simply not as tough So dance to the line where he makes 79 Now in that game when they met in January North Carolina crushed noted him in a glass 4532 Lashes picked up the foul there and that was number two on him So keep an eye on that early Zona the 69 junior in as Hammond goes to the bench and to shoot again Boy hes really been a huge part of the offense here Hes been the main part of it for North Carolina He has nine So two for five The rest of the team total of two points Putting his head down Gets stopped on the baseline Words around back Quick move with a onehander and a beauty Its too easy RJ Davis has to provide more defensive resistance Make him meet a chest and retreat dribble One quick move and its a blow by Thats not an acceptable defensive effort Bacon sitting up high Nance with another touch Hes getting a look every time down the floor Ryan with a rebound Dont like the fading but I do like that hes hunting his and playing inside New York Ryan will kick Works will shoot and a miss Irish are sending nobody to the glass concerned with getting back defensively in transition The feed for inside One and done there Got the look you wanted Armando just got his 66th career double double against NC State Hes won the ACC player of the week six times this year Ryan way downtown and smoothly done from threepoint land Well Cormack Ryan does hit 38 Came into the game 119 points away from joining the 100 point club at Notre Dame Thats the Irishs best weapon as a team They shoot 36 make over nine threes per game Words long wide Well he got an excellent look Comes right back to him for a second opportunity Bryant thought about it Drives in for two points but its in and out Big fight for the rebound And it comes to Nance Davis looking to push it Done Flips it up Boy it was in the cylinder but North Carolina cant connect But again pushing the basketball The Tar Heels with their inability to knock down a three Have to make it a point Get into that painted area Get a good look And when you drive it it allows for those offensive rebounding opportunities as well North Carolina fans grow up You know its like breathing You push it You push it You push it And then you offensive rebound The offensive rebounded Fast break The name of the game Heres Dunn on the wing going up against Lashes 918 to go in the first half here at Southbound Bacon looking for it Going in strong Yes indeed Body to body there against Zona Against Matt Zona Thats advantage Armando Bayott He must demand the basketball and play until the double comes If he doesnt beat it kick it out to a guy who can attack as a driver not settle for a three cuz they dont have that in the bag currently Armando number four in the ACC in scoring Get 17 points a game Ryan again little strong this time ACC commissioner Jim Phillips is here in the house Yeah absolutely Front row as he should be Davis with a misfire The distinct advantage for the Heels is Armando Bacott on the block Hes feasted on this Irish music defense throughout the entire time hes been matched up against them You cant get away from that Take your advantage The three anytime you settle for it the Irish win the sequence Lashes from the corner Air nailed it It didnt touch the iron Shot clock at four now on a drive by Words Very difficult angle No And taken away by Davis They try and double up on him And theres a reach and a foul So North Carolinas hit a bit of a wall but theyre on top 1310 on Notre Dame Kev thank you very much Sean Well check in with you guys as well coming up at halftime Virginia Miami Duke NC State and Pit According to Joey Brackets the only teams out of the ACC right now for sure going to the NCAA tournament Joe Lonardi will not be invited I think to the ACC round table in Greensboro Look its become invogue every season to criticize the ACC Some of it deserved but a lot of it is I I Im not going to cosign I mean there are legitimate teams in this conference that are poised to be second weekend teams and very dangerous contrasting styles throughout this conference Highlevel personnel that can take over and put their team on their back And we did this last year at least the nation did And where did the ACC end up Right there in the mix with two teams in the Final Four Its beyond Duke and Carolina in this conference Miami Virginia NC State These teams are very dangerous And I hope Wake and Clemson have a chance to play themselves in to add a few more options Commissioner Phillips getting a close look at North Carolinas chances whatever they may be right now North Carolina 16 and 11 88 in the conference Just cannot afford any slip up And a foul before the shot So no basket there by Wartz on the drive as Lashes hit the deck 646 to go is back on for Notre Dame Ben Allen Luben the freshmans been playing a little bit of foul trouble here in the first half And in a game where youve tallied 10 points and 13 minutes of play like the Irish have you need one of the guys whos been your most consistent scoreer to be available Looks like hes a little banged up to go with the foul trouble Not ideal for the Irish Hammond gets a good clean look and buries a three They needed some of that and he came back from an early season knee sprain Actually played really well at times He had 18 against Syracuse 19 against Florida State Its imperative Carolina runs Notre Dame off the threepoint line Make them drivers Thats not who they are They live and they perish by that threepoint line N looking inside goes outside Seth Trimble the freshman into the paint Shot clock down to two Words on words down low Black did not get it off in time Would not have counted in any event A shot clock violation Hey we have six college basketball games Saturday on ESPN Number six Virginia and North Carolina begin at 6 Eastern followed by Duke hosting Virginia Tech at Cameron Indoor Finally number 15 St Marys takes on number 12 Gonzaga for the WCC regular season title Thats on the on the line there Words gives up about 5 in to Bacott down low and no identification from the heels to exploit that advantage Those are missed opportunities and lack of thinking through the possession Bryan on a drive No got his own miss Good one from the corner Yes a threepointer And that pulls Notre Dame in front by one Thats their first lead Bang trying to make Carolina back in front Davis has a good look Good one with the rebound RJ Davis just hasnt been the same level efficient guy that he was throughout the season dealing with that finger injury Ever since he suffered that first Syracuse those looks havent consistently gone down Good one A miss there North Carolina has just been terrible shooting the basketball Four for 23 Nance was the offensive story early on but Notre Dames now up by a point with under five minutes to go RJ Davis back for love In and out Now he had 23 in the loss at NC State but hes only shooting 39 for the year 31 from three and he takes a lot of shots Hey a team thats shooting 30 from three I mean these are just tough looks that theyre settling for currently Different story for works though based on that one The 65 Brad sticks it and Notre Dame builds a 1915 lead on 9 nothing run And thats going to be an offensive foul Davis with the personal The Irish shoot 36 risk 36 as a team for three They make nearly 10 a game You cannot go under like Love did with that decision You have to get up in a guy like WS Five of the seven made field goals from the Irish are beyond the arc You got to have a sense of urgency out there defending Hammer gets some room to operate and sticks in a twopointer So all of a sudden the Irish have caught fire Theyre on a little bit of a run here 11 nothing Found Cormarmac Im sagging off leak He dare me to shoot on the drive Love for two Often times when you watch North Carolina Jordan that middle is clogged up Makes it hard for those guys to drive in there because theres a lot of sub 30 threepoint shooters on the floor that arent demanding that respect out there taking away that space Ryan for two more graduate out of New York closing in on 1000 career points in an Irish uniform Poked away by Ryan Took it right away from Love Hell drive it Love got back and played some deep got advantage Glove on another drive They let him go Say no basket there Thatll go against no sir Boy that sounds bleak but its all true North Carolina season low in the first half for scoring 26 against Gardenner Webb and have been held to 17 here And you got Bacott having to run through screens to defend Lasheski on the outside That could be something worth exploring Now they got Lasheski on a low block against Dunn Hammond brings some energy in the lane Six to get up a shot Ryan wont wait Hes had the hot hand Credit to Bacott there to extend out Not necessarily comfortable defending there but well beyond the arc Hand in the face Degree of difficulty high Down for the corner Round and out Rebound snatched by Goodwin Before the commercial break there was a foul on Pete Nance He wound up going to the bench the 611 Brad who was scoring a bunch of points early but has cooled off very quickly since then He kind of leaned into Goodwin in the lane We took a look on the replay and that was the reason for that foul Words flips it up there and draws contact there But back to that whistle were talking about Yeah this happened as a blur as we were going to break So some may wonder what did Nance do He extended those two arms egregiously to provide that screen right in front of the official into the back of Goodwin Absolutely the right call and one of those careless plays if you will Lack of attention to detail that gives the basketball back to the Irish Love with a foul putting Wartz at the line 74 shooter Carolina five for 26 shooting it and they give it away again Thats an unforced error Cam in contact there Hell be at the line and the live ball turnover Hey undefeated 270 and number one South Carolina takes on 209 Tennessee Thursday night in womens college basketball Good match up on ESPN and the app Coverage beginning at 700 Eastern time Hammond one of the many grads for Mike Bray at the line As mentioned theyve got six of them Theesi back to the bench Notre Dame able to build up a lead here pretty much without their top scorer They have their biggest lead of the ball game This feels like a really big possession under two minutes A despondent group in the heels offensively because they cannot put the ball in the basket Got to develop a rhythm here before the break Here were Davis getting Tyler Nickel a freshman of the game here late in the half Armano Bai going across the foul hit by Luben Hell be at the line for two Tell you that was almost another turnover Cormarmac Ryan just misplaced the airborne pass from black down low He was coming helpside misjudged it Bacon with the catch and drew the contact Look at all the double doubles Nothing new for Armando Bacon averaging 17 points and 11 rebounds He is North Carolinas alltime leading rebounder and just picked up his 66th career double double against NC State He had a loss cheering Armano makes 66 at the foul line 2519 For as bad as its been for the Heels two possession deficit Lashes back in up top for Words Wors has to look to shoot that thing on the exchange Its Bacott defending Youre going to have an opportunity there Heres Hammond outside the three Going to make a move on the freshman And thats a pretty one Thats Hammond an older guy whos played a lot of basketball Challenging Nickel the young guy to defend Advantage Hammond Hammond has nine Thats what he averages for 40 minutes Open shooter black but he wont take that one Heres Davis keying on Bacon again Jumper on the way for Dunn Well you cant argue with the look You got a good quality look but they can build almost like a fortress defensively around Bacon because there isnt any real danger or threat posed by some of these shooters on the floor When youre playing on a side its Sneaky Black whos a sub 30 threepoint shooter you can play off of and take away that ability to pass it down to the post Thats whats lacking with this offense and what theyre tasked with dealing with throughout this season in this poor stretch Tar Hills 0 for 11 beyond the threepoint line Lashes cant hit there 5 seconds before the break Done on the spin Going to get a shot up there and music hits it Theyre going to count that Of course they will go to the monitor to double check it but on the court its called good They needed some kind of lift but only 21 points for North Carolina Tell you what zero assists to eight turnovers Some of those giving offense of the Irish seven points the other way They got to be better They got to be tighter They got 20 minutes music to prove it Well theyve got the basketball to begin the second half here against the Fighting Irish at Notre Dame Jordan Cornet Dave OBrien and Angel Gray with you Angel that first half Well not exactly a shooting video frankly for either side but they do go to Bangoff right away to begin the second half And you can see the fiery look from Hubert Davis at this point He really challenged his team at halftime and rightfully so I asked him simply How would you grade the energy and effort from your team in that first half He said F minus We are not together No one is talking So really challenging them to just play together I even mentioned a couple of things Five turnovers in five minutes shooting 18 He said that doesnt matter at this point Were not playing together The energy has to be better And Angel you see this so many times with 18 to 22 year olds Offense isnt going So is the lack of that attention to defense and it bleeds over to the other side Winning teams forget about the last play and pursue a winning play on the next one Carolina needs to be mentally tougher They need to come out here and try and win with effort Jordan and just to go back to even the run the 110 run that Notre Dame made It was because of a made three that was at the sixminute mark of the first half Mike Bray said We get our energy from made buckets We have to be better As theres a steal at the top of the key from RJ Davis but at the end of the day their runs came from the energy that they conjured up on the defensive end Here they come They played through a side to get big caught a bucket Deflections getting their defense to key their offense Here we go over and switched in by Taylor Love Theyre also off to Schneider for assist Davis got one right away So North Carolina showing some life Five for Love 29 26 Notre Dame music Kids are so expensive Dad Now Katie needs braces Maybe try switching your car insurance to progressive You can save hundreds I dont know Dad cheering Maybe

to go Get it and go if youre Carolina Try and run Play fast Nance for Bacon Over the top of two Beautiful movement allows Bacon to go from right block to left Catch and the pass from Nance with his height over the top of the defense Beautifully done from the heels Looking competent offensively but its all been spurred by their defensive effort Look at Davis for a foul is third music Because that ball moves Lasheski was vulnerable and Nance with his size Im going to pass over the top Catch and finish An easy game Well see if this comes down to a battle of the big guys Lashes 610 Bakeot 611 here in the second half And a bad pass thrown away by Notre Dame They dont make many mistakes like that 3130 Theyve only turned it over a few times tonight And we have a timeout 1649 to play Onepoint

out makes the definitive decision Caleb love stepping into one with rhythm Three ball going down Leaky black ball is so shot effort with the put back Then the finish for now Every possession should begin with the big fella getting a touch and the Heels have discovered a rhythm And the art of the pass again Thats four assists already here in the second half Balls moving Theyre playing fast Theyre making proper decisions This is who the Heels can be So theyre on top again 3231 They last led at 1513 forcing three turnovers here in the second half already on the kick out Heres Wartz Got a good look Black has it knocked away Still popped up in the air and corral Heres Black Nance Love for Bacon Spins inside following his own miss which he does so well Does it again That wont drop Unfortunate Unfortunate sequence Right position got the put back just to gather compose and then go back up with it Rushed it and thats the cause for the inability to finish He was off balance Yeah theres no shot blocker that should strike fear in Bacott there He had time to collect Ryan has Bacon all over him defensively Love with the dribble the shot He sticks it The defensive effort is there and its allowing them to get out because these stops whether it be turnovers or rebounds and run but that portion of the game has reentered the chat for UNCC 132 run here for the Tarheelss trying to cut in a bit Slicing cant finish it Keep running if youre the heels Keep running Love pulls up in transition Rebound comes right to Ryan of Notre Dame They have lost 17 games The Irish are two and 14 in conference play At one point they were six and one to start the season It feels like a long time ago for Notre Dame fans Good one draws a lot of attention downstairs Stling on the drive and a free play Its a tough defensive assignment for Nance after his move his feet against an explosive guy like Starling whos able to explore a gap Starling just a freshman out of Baldwinsville New York Big handing off Love will swing it Nance is open Barely got to the rim And now its Notre Dame A rare opportunity to run and lane up and in by Goodwin Savvy play by him And he has put the Irish back in front by a point cheering Bacon out of the double Love will go to the paint Throws up the onehander Thats beautiful basketball Nance has not been hot from three all season He elects not to take the shot He moves it to Love whos been touch and go from three A decent shot for Love He explores the elite shot Thats stinking the game and executing All coming together in one sequence Bacon coming out to guard Ryan Ryan on the dribble goes to the baseline and hes on the line Give Box some credit there Defended all the way through to disrupt Cormarmac Ryan The heels digging in defensively Good

building Now theyre starting to look like the team we expected them to see tonight Carolina shooting 53 for the second half Black on the drive swatted out of the sky by Luben Crowd loved that block 1320 to go Luben Luben has a chance to be a special player Uh we know things are going to change a lot here but he is a critical piece to staying for the future of the Irish and what they can be Black to put it in for BCOM and its going to be a turnover The sophomore Dunn gives it back And looking ahead at Notre Dames matchup Saturday theyre in Winston Salem squaring off against Wake Forest on ACC Network That ones at 700 Eastern time Every time Wake gets on the floor its a big one They have a chance to get into this thing and they are very dangerous Coach Forbes has done a masterful job down there in Winston Salem Likewise North Carolina cannot afford a slip up of any kind starting on the drive No and itll stay on the Z Quick look at the resume What really jumps out is not a single quad one victory but quad one games to come against Virginia had a stunning loss to Boston College earlier tonight and Duke The zero quad ones is the scarlet letter and thats why UVA and potentially Duke are so important to take that stain off the resume and give them a better chance Good one fighting inside for the second chance Sarling what a pretty basket that was for the freshman Played with good space there Allowed no double or any conversion defensively on the ball Allowed him time to offer and finish cheering Johnson will lift Too strong Its not what you want North Carolina was 0 for1 11 from threepoint land in the first half They are now 1 for 16 Stling scoops as he goes for the reverse Boy hes made some pretty baskets in this game Youre playing into what the Irish wants you to do when a 29 threepoint shooter and Puff Johnson elects to take that shot early Love looking for Bacott He has a wall in front of him Back for Davis whos open Boy he was wide open too Black out and he

the most cars under 20000 and our new cosigner option well drive you happy at Carvana Welcome back to PCEL Pavilion Since Mike Gray announced that this will be his last season at Notre Dame after 23 seasons coaches and programs within the conference have made it a point to celebrate all that he has done during his tenure you know like becoming Notre Dames alltime winningest coach Our very own Jordan Cornet delivered this gift from UNCC some fresh Notre Dame colorway Jordans Oh you can see there hes pretty impressed Another one to add to his collection He said after his under arour deal is up by the way But here are a couple other gifts that hes received Virginia Tech they gifted him with a commitment to excellence brick that had it inscribed in it Tony Bennett obviously from UVA gifted him with a bottle of Irish whiskey We already showed you what UNCC gave And probably the coolest gift is from his former colleague the legendary Coach K who showed up to his first game since retiring He gifted him a bottle of wine that had the quote Youre the guy for Notre Dame written on it Jordan I know that you have more that can explain what that means Yeah And that bottle of wine said Youre the guy from Coach K Because when the job became available at Delaware I believe was the story he said Youre the guy for that job at one point but then at Notre Dame when Notre Dame became open with the job that Bray had done at Delaware Coach K was like that is your job more than any You are meant to be the guy at Notre Dame And he inscribed that into the bottle of wine because he was right Most winningest coach in program history at Notre Dame Coach Kane a pension for being right about a lot about quite a few things Shot clock down to six Ryan scoops all the way to the cup for two The Irish when they play with that space it really puts pressure on guys who arent very comfortable defending on the perimeter to attack closeouts and get what they want in gaps Cormarmac Ryan gets it there and swings it Black Shot clock at seven Black will give it up Johnson short range for two Played a music lot of twoman game didnt they Black to puff Back to black Back to Puff Puff says Finally were out of time I got to offer this one up Notre Dame with the basketball up by one Coming up at the 10minute mark here at Purcell Pavilion An absolute mustave for North Carolina Starling hits the deck and draws the foul Starling 64 freshman He can be a lot to handle when he puts it to the deck and goes and fouled on the play as he gets hit by Puff Johnsons third foul Very explosive wildly athletic and plays long when he tries to get to that rim just an incredible talent Its been a struggle for him here because lack of stability from this group this year Hes looked like a freshman and the group around him hasnt helped bring him along because theyve had their own struggles but hes a heck of a player Judah Mint in the ACC at the top in scoring among freshman Of course Philiposkys had a great year and is going to I think walk away with that rookie of the year the ACC And you look at some of these other great freshman at Notre Dame Blake Wesley Demetrius Jackson Chris Thomas they had guys around them that were older established and the program was in a great place JJ just hasnt had that unfortunately this season Nance was involved early in the game then nothing for the longest time The follow is up and good by Linky Black But because it was a good shot attempt over that shoulder close to the rim a good shot attempt begets great offensive rebounding opportunities one in which black takes full advantage So far a far superior and this is for both sides caliber of second half as opposed to the first Thank goodness for that foul on the floor and back to that tip in by so dance draws two three guys attention which allows Leaky Black to come to the teeth of the lane and tip it in That good play to take a good shot allows that good offensive rebounding opportunity music Good Treble just picked up the foul for North Carolina Heres Wartz up high Davis on him Mashes has been really quiet offensively Wartz once again a determined drive off the window RJ Davis just got bullied Trey Wors hit him with the arm bar Created separation Theres nobody there RJs got to be tougher guarding on the bounce Works with a quiet 10 Love with a swing Caleb Love has been better with his shot selection tonight hasnt he Absolutely Especially in the second half Hit this one Yes a threepointer Love coming up 23 against NC State in a loss over the weekend And Carolina by a point Another drive and thatll roll out And once again it was Words pretty much doing whatever he wants Trey WS wants that match up and rightfully so Just couldnt finish there but he can get to the cup and will From the corner Johnson Nance with the following to Puff cant take that shot Shooting 29 in conference Thats what the Irish want Puff has to attack it drive it apply pressure show me that the Irish can defend

received but how about the gift that he actually gave Jordan Cornet Jordan I know that you have something to share as far as him telling you how to get in broadcasting Oh yeah This was this was actually great We played Carmelo 2003 in Syracuse Carmelo gave me probably 30 Gave everybody 30 The next day I get called into a coachs office and Im like What did I do I didnt do anything wrong Carmelo scores on everybody He goes Hey Jordan look Holds up the newspaper for those of you who remember newspapers And says These quotes theyre all from you If you could play the game as well as you talk about it youd be an allAmerican I walked out of there OB said Im meant to be a broadcaster Broadcastings for me I think it backfired cuz he gave me my career not a better effort out there on the floor He gave me a microphone laughter I dont know if we should thank him or you know but actually at the end of the day its so good to share to share with you So I think music he had something He he knew what he was talking about He liked to have fun with his guys Hes they called him the loosest coach in basketball for a reason He has a feel for personalities Thats why hes been able to bring a lot of talent here and do a whole lot of winning over his 23 seasons Picking up the foul 747 left Got a 4747 tie Bacott demanding the ball where he loves to have it and scores two more Beautiful high low set to get Bayott that touch Get him back involved here Flex the muscle down low They cant stop the big fella Armando into double figures Lashes kicks for Ryan and buries it The triple Caleb Love got caught ball watching Good dribble drive down the baseline and swing to Cormarmac Ryan Thats good offense Thats Caleb Love not being locked in defensively as well Cormarmac Ryan with a dozen Bacon again in traffic Yes And a foul too Nance is doing a masterful job getting that ball down low to Bacon Some of these deliveries are not easy Beautiful touch pass from Nance to deliver to Bayott Thats the most recent play down last time before and that was a good seal off from Bacott but good delivery in the pocket to go up strong and a finish once again The two bigs playing in beautiful symmetry Stling with a foul in and out Carolina by one Notre Dame with a basketball and a whistle Bill Cington with a whistle off the ball and that one will go against Nance Number two on Pete Nance 646 to go and a lowscoring affair but play has certainly been much better in the second half Nance has really given this team a lift too 11 eight and five I mean hes making plays that are needed for this team to get a win on the road and keep their tournament dreams alive He stepped up this evening Ritz with a kick here for Stling Loves that paint Wild shot there though and hes well defended Love flips it up Bad decision Those are the decisions that plague this team We had just been saying moments ago his shot selection was really a lot better in the second half but not there Luben handles it Under six minutes left here and a whistle and a foul with 559 to go theyll get Davis for that one RJ Davis picks up his fourth Trey WZ is really trying to give it to RJ Davis every time he gets that basketball Its been one of the more aggressive approaches offensively from Trey Worth that the Irish have seen North Carolina with talented guards but they do not have a point guard Yeah they got two scoring guards that havent been on the same page Its been been well documented and its hurt them at times No question Those two have not had games where they played off each other to the degree they did the stretch last year that led them on that magical run Shesy will draw the foul and Big Nate to the line where he is an outstanding foul shooter 87 He and RJ Davis the best foul shooters on the floor here for their respected teams Chesy should be on his way to an ACC league honor you would think Yeah hes been really good for this group Hes been a dynamic scorer Hes a tough match up at 16 cuz he can shoot it attack a close out and at times play with his back to the basket Hes rebounded pretty well for this group down the stretch too He scored over 1500 points He has seven rebounds a game for the Fighting Irish 5151 showing that zone look North Carolina passing it around the horn getting it to Bacott doubled up Finds the open man Nance and a rebound by Luben Hes doubled up trying to get free puts it to the deck Got it ahead for Goodwin Goodmans sort of been the forgotten man here tonight for Notre Dame Came in averaging 12 points a game Has only five Only taking five shots He hasnt really asserted himself in this offense Hes had stretches like that this season Shot clock at five Under five to play in the game Heres Ryan barely got to the iron Notre Dame by one Carolina with the ball Black the shooter too strong and they shot quickly The Irish want UNCC to do exactly that Quick shot from a guy who shoots 28 You are giving the opposition exactly what they want Its not winning basketball Its just quite simply not Thats a problem Davis about ready to get back in the game Pull up pop wont drop by Wartz Well we have seen some miserable shooting here tonight but were coming down the stretch here with four minutes to go and its anybodys game the entry pass and a foul before that shot by Bacott Thats been the winning combination Nance flash high post Bacott sealed down low High low basketball Nance the two times it worked Went high with the basketball Let it go bounce pass Bailed out by the foul but keep it high Let Mike Bacon play high Quick finish Movement comes out Three fouls for Mike Bray Davis checks in here for Nance High low again Double team Hell spin out of it Cant hit it Follows the miss And it gets knocked out by the Irish with 357 music left And as tight as it gets Notre Dame clinging to a onepoint lead at home music Oh man thats cool Im really liking what youre doing with this overall music shape Shes a little too shy right now She understands

No question about it Its been very very good here down the stretch 5251 Notre Dame on North Carolina Carolina with a basketball and under four lefts Bacon with a bounce Love Davis wants to launch a long one and its around and out but Black with a second chance Love will try it again and way short That didnt get to the iron The second opportunity wont fall Love with another drive and that one will go Second chance opportunities crushed the Irish there Gave Carolina multiple chances to get the look they wanted on the drive Theyve missed a lot of layups here as of late These heels too Got to convert when youre point blank range Caleb Loves able to do exactly that Approaching the threeminute mark and as tight as a drum here Stolen away North Carolina with the theft Caleb Love leaning in and the tap in is good by Big Armando Bacott Stability The rim run Not giving up on the play Thats what you want from your leader thats achieved so much in a heels uniform So a little bit of room here for Carolina but Goodwin has it for Notre Dame with two and a half music left Bacott staying right with him Long one on the way Thats off the iron and no good by Ryan Hell drive it and score the lead Tough stuff for Cormarmac Ryan One of the fiercest competitors these last few seasons in an Irish uniform refusing himself not to give up on the play and the up forgotten practice of following his own shot He is 14 Two minutes to play here at Southbound cheering Nance setting up a move to the paint He goes no rebound up and in by Bacon Absolute warrior Just a warrior Armando Bacon Moving bodies carving out some real estate there for an offensive rebounding opportunity Willing his group 16 points for Bigot Came in averaging 17 5754 North Carolina An absolute mustave Good one in that lane to the right Makes it again a onepoint affair with a minute 18 to go 30 second break here 5756 North Carolina Was on my way to work The car behind me hit me and it threw my body Started getting calls from insurance companies You cant deal with insurance company because they going to try to settle you for less The mayor law offices music is going to do what they can to get you what you want and what you need The Mayo Law is the best in the business Their record shows it Expect the best because theyre music going to give you their best Call the Mayo Law Offices It wont cost you anything to see if we can help If you have a problem call the Mayo Law music an illustrious career with so much on the resume from Armando Bacott Theyre trying to stay off making history and Armando Bacott doing his best with his effort to make sure they dont take that dubious honor of not making the field Look at the offensive rebounding effort here Moves a couple bodies clears them music out gets the foot back after running the floor the sequence before Thats the difference and thats what Bop provides when you need him OP he just always seems to be there His 67th career double double 16 points and 11 rebounds for the senior 5756 North Carolina with just a minute 18 to go Carolina trying to get on the winning side of things in conference play Victory would make them nine and eight in the ACC and still have Virginia and Duke to come and both of those games on ESPN Carolina basketball Davis with one minute left Davis gives away the dribble Its back to him Five to shoot it RJ Davis spins in the lane knocks it down Thats the Carolina guard play I remember Cool under pressure RJ Davis time winding down Spins to win to you music It may just be an elevator Here goes nothing But for a young homeowner becoming their parents its a learning opportunity Come on in The more the marrier Paris huh music Bonjour We got any out oftowners in the elevator Tom it is not easy 10th music floor huh Must be a heck of a view Okay See how everyone else is facing this way Progressive cant save you from becoming your parents but music we can save you money when you auto with us Okay that was terrible Okay lets hang back Were going to try that again So 499 to go Carolina on top by three These guards have been polarizing in the wins and in the losses for the Heels Cool customer They go flat RJ Davis gets his feet in the painted area Spins and rises up Works was there Made him meet a chess Contested Good defense Simply better offense from RJ Davis music We have six college basketball games Saturday on ESPN and the app Number six Virginia and North Carolina at 600 Eastern Thats followed by Duke and Virginia Tech at Cameron Indoor And finally number 15 music St berries and number 12 Gonzaga for the WCC regular season title All of that on the line So Baycon and company trying to gain their 17th win of the season and stay relevant and talk about the NCAA tournament And they got to defend the three The Irish clearly dont need a three but thats who the Irish are foundationally when it comes to their offense Youve got to communicate Youve got to fight through screens Play over the top again You dont need the three but the Irish typically look for one here Styling with it up against Black going strong off the glass for two against North Carolinas best defender Give him nine points Once again a onepoint game And a timeout North Carolina Notre Dame is out of timeouts incidentally with 303 to go I would be stunned if Carolina doesnt think high low basketball here But going to the other side this is atypical of what the Irish do They decided to space it out Let JJ Stling their best player off the bounce to create Tough finish from him A lot of confidence from coach Bray to give it to his talented freshman there And he delivers Notre Dame has the possession arrow North Carolina with the only timeout remaining for either team Starling has put on a show at times for Notre Dame Nine points all in the second half and some big baskets too This is it It should have come to this for the heels but it has execution down the stretch Closing out games A team that has had a lot of losing here late in the most critical time of the year Can they avoid the ultimate loss here on the road against an Irish team a quad three that would be crushing Yeah that is 10 and 17 and two and 14 in conference play and no doubt in your mind that its Bacott who will get the touch here The high low has been so effective when Nance has gotten to that high post and been able to get it down low to Bacott Theyve had great success there Thats the most faith I have in this offense in the half court setting music this evening So coming down to the last 30 seconds of basketball here tonight music North Carolina shaking off a horrible shooting first half and they have the lead here with under half a minute They got downstairs Black making a move off the fake Rebound tipped out by Notre Dame with 11 12 seconds to go at four on the shot clock I didnt have that on the bingo card Leaky black going oneonone I didnt have that Good one to check back in now for Coach Bray And again just 4 seconds to get off a shot Youre going to have to run your shooters off screens here It doesnt have to be a catch and shoot It could be a shot fake and pull up cheering Davis to get it in Daycon standing right in front of him He goes to the paint Davis with a bounce ITS BLACK SNEAKING IN BUT HE CANT CONVERT IT but Notre Dame mishandles it And so its going to be North Carolina ball with one on the shot clock Leaky Black wanted it to go up top I believe had to take the bounce pass and I dont think he knew if he wanted to dunk it or lay it in and that indecision cost 87 to go Irish dodge one there The only thing you have to do is protect the goal So black to put it in Looking for love and a foul with 8 seconds to go Couple more to go A couple more before they go to the line Black gets it in Theres a quick foul Seven and a half left And thatll be on words Its his first And theyll do that again as Black looks for somebody to make a cut And another foul this time by Ryan And that will put North Carolina at the line with 68 left groaning music of a look at brackettology now First four out right now Lardi says North Carolinas on that list with Utah State Penn State Charleston Since the tourney has expanded to 64 back in 85 no preseason number one has been left out of the field The Heels dont want to make that type of history here Its going to be a onepossession game Make or miss Irish are going to have a chance Love 76 at the foul line trying to make this a threepoint game And he does confident and its North Carolina to take their last timeout Notre Dame is out of timeouts music and Mike Gray to draw up a play Now they were beaten over the weekend at Virginia when they had an opportunity to win the game on a threepointer at the buzzer but Goodwin could not make it go music Notre Dame with a lot of close defeats right Syracuse by a point FSU by a point overtime Georgia Tech by a point I mean that gets exhausting And just recently the twopoint defeat in Virginia Be interesting to see how the Heels treat this fouling or playing through and defending music You do what you do So Notre Dame needs to hit a three to send this game to overtime And well need to go the length of the court Goodwins going to put it in and in for Stling Theyre going to foul Smart play Black with the personal in the back court Smart play with 48 to go With how the Irish are loaded with those shooters Thats the right move from the Heels defensive Starling is not among their bet better foul shooters Just 65 He has made one of two tonight And Starling the freshman from Ballinsville New York in a threepoint game and drops in the first one Gets the front end Youre going to miss this You got to block out I imagine the Irish will miss on purpose here Free throw block out from the heels Paramount Little more size Luben gets in at 68 replacing the 65 Ryan The challenge for Stling obviously has to draw iron on the miss Seen it happen before And he did And rebounded away by North Carolina Quick foul with 33 to go as they foul Caleb Long He did the right thing in terms of backboard Came off softly Opportunity to get in there but the Irish arent a rebounding force Carolina has that advantage Coralin can put it away here with a pair A one and one for Love And very smooth on number one 6259 Little over 3 seconds and he makes them both clutch at the line No foul In for words Threepointer He misses that Thats the ball game And North Carolina hangs on 63 59 the final in a game they could not have afforded to lose They did what they needed to do OB They closed out the game Bacon music had some big time putbacks They got the stops they needed and they live to fight another day to make this tournament field music Bacon and Nance both with double doubles Save got
