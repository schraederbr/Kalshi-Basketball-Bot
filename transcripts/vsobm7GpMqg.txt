is theres not going to be very many teams to beat them Nobody And today they face this Howard team thats won the MAK title two of the last three years And Howard knocked off Niagara by 10 yesterday coming from 13 points down to do it They played right here at Cameron So the Bison won on this floor yesterday The Blue Devils won comfortably on Friday And Bryce Harris the Bison star misses his first shot And Camboozer gets bumped by O Aoji And the first whistle of the game the foul on the Howard senior Howard is a team that plays very very hard They emphasize driving the ball to the basket They want to play at a fast pace but if theyre going to have any chance at all in this game today Harris their inside guy hes their star player Hes got to score effectively And thats not easy to do against the size that Duke brings to the line Cam Boozers numbers dipped Hes now averaging 20 points and nine and a half rebounds per game But he still leads the Blue Devils in scoring rebounding assists and blocks And after a few steals on Friday hes now second on the team in that category too One for two at the line for Boozer Gillis the talented point guard transfer from Lehi He gets them in their stuff but Harris number 34 and Cotton number four are their top scorers And this is Cotton who drives and kicks Gillis for three And Boozer riked down the rebound I mean you get an open three in a game like this if youre going to be competitive youve got to make a very high percentage cheering Looking high and he throws it down coming off a careerhigh 17 here on Friday night He played great Friday Hes uh probably one of the most improved players in the league maybe in the country this year Hes getting an opportunity He scored 17 points on Friday going three for three from the field and he was perfect from the foul line until somebody jinxed him with the call They will never let that playbyplay guy back in here No Out of bounds Duke ball for Duke against Kenny Blakey who was part of the Duke championship teams in both 91 and 92 He red shirted in 91 Played as a red shirt freshman on that great Christian Lner team in 1992 Duke of course in their manto man and they have a size advantage at each position Theyll do an awful lot of switching And Dan that size advantage will take place in most ACC games too Its not just against the Howards of the world It wont be quite as definitive Well the other thing is they just are good mantoman defensive players They keep guys in front of them and when they switch they switch so aggressively you cant get anything Its a foul called on Cotton Roger Ays Clarence Armstrong and Adam Floor your officials this afternoon See Kenny Blakey cheering It was an encouraging comeback win for the Bison yesterday but they scored 51 points in the second half to do it Kungbo looking for Boozer who pushed it off the glass and home You know whats amazing is the center and power forward have more assists than any of the guards You know boozers like 44 26 for young I mean what does that say to you about this team They they all pass and their big guys really pass and look for each other Theyre not looking first to score which is what as a coach I mean theres nothing you would want more than that Tough shot Cotton goes and the Bison on the board Foster pass to nobody Rare turnover for Duke This Bison team they really get after you defensively terms of pace and points They play quickly Taking their time here Cotton fakes it Gives it up Gillis still has time Step back over Gungba short Step back over Gungba if youre 5 11 is a bad idea cheering Isaiah Evans to the basket Thats something hes got to do and he has done this year Hes not just a standstill shooter Hes passing Hes making plays and that helps him and it helps Duke Cotton from the Coach K court logo comes up short Cotton is a pretty good threepoint shooter but I dont know that thats his normal range Boozer misfires from deep First threepoint attempt for the Blue Devils after they took 33 of them here on Friday cheering Its a nice pass from Harris and Aoji lays it in Thats the first time that Harris has been able to handle the ball against somebody other than Boozer Harris is 64 Boozer at 69 has been guarding him That time he was matched up against Evans and he was able to get close enough to make a nice pass Foster bullies Gillis and gets two I think thats the first layup Ive seen Duke give up Maybe they gave up one in the game against Niagara but they they dont give up much easy around the basket cheering Using the screen from the Lithuanian Kazak Kevichas This is a kick ball and itll be Howard ball when we come back Sad news The difference today is theyre attacking inside Only one threepointer attempted so far Its their only miss I think the Bison have done a great job getting out on threepoint shooters But again thats the versatility to Duke You if youre going to take something away youre going to give something else up cheering Cotton cant connect Rebound pulled down by Evans Again my advice for Cotton would be to get closer Kaden Boozer in the game THIS IS EVANS STRAIGHT AWAY FOR BRUCE I think he heard you about the threes and said Im going to make one right here But he shoots like that Hes really a special When they drive the ball up the court the defense goes back into the lane He trails along You just cant leave him alone out there with that much time Malik Brown Nicholas Jmena also in the game for Duke Three ball wont go for Bryson And a fouls going to be on the Blue Devils here in the rebound action going against Kaden Boozer John Shier 51 and3 here at home since he took over for Coach K Is that good Well its not perfect but its pretty close Hes done an amazing job I mean taking over for a guy like coacheski is you know obviously the best coach in modern basketball to take over and do just about as well in the regular season And now of course theyre looking for championships and I think they have that opportunity this year Jim what was your first reaction when you heard Coach Kay was stepping down and it would be John Shia replacing him Well I knew from talking to Coach K it was about Johns relationships with the players on the team and his recruiting relationship And thats really the key as we all know recruiting cheering Amen Nice pass MALIK BROWN THROWS IT DOWN Hes now 17 of 18 on twos this season And these guys dont miss a beat when they come in off the bench because they want to start They think theyre as good as the starters And that mentality is just going to drive them Harris great look Knocks it down Boy they Duke does not give up many good looks They got a really nice ball screen away from the ball there Kaden Boozers pass deflected His brother saves him and Malik has another easy deuce His brother saved him a turnover there Sure did Thats what brothers are for Absolutely again I mean they find one another The big guys find one another so well Kayen couldnt control it and yet theyre going to say its off Howard Its Duke Ball Boozer is really I mean he pitches that ball ahead so effectively and thats what leads to the fast break And theres Malik Brown He just runs to the spot He almost got the same bucket against the lob Deflected to the corner Hey Jim when you were talking to Malik the other day did he tell you that the bench guys are as good as the starters No he would never say that Hes the nicest kid in the world He would never say something like that but hes very confident himself as he should be And he does all the little things He doesnt even have to score to help this Duke team Off the catch its Harris for three Jarren Harris he knows what his job is Hes shooting when he comes into the game and hes shooting threes when he comes into the game Only threes Season high 15 made five threes against Army He has attempted two twos on the year but that was probably a mistake Yeah it was an accident Had to be going to be a reachin foul on Brown And Duke can get you open in a lot of different ways Harris like sets a screen at the foul line and then just runs to the spot and Malik Brown sets the next screen to get him open And thats what Malik does Jim Malik Brown has been injured while hes been at Duke But I really think if he can be healthy this Duke head team has a chance to reach an elite level I think hes key for them because he backs up the five or the four He does the little things defensively Um hes just always got his hands on the ball He hes like in the top three or four in the league in steals playing 20 minutes a game Another deep shot another rebound for Cam Boozer his third Brother Kaden fouled Could have been a tie up with Clarence Armstrong called the reach on Brown And another outlet pass to half court This guys not looking to hang on to the ball when he gets it off the rebound He gets it Hes looking ahead and thats just a great twohanded adjustment Thats why hes up there and leading the team in assist at 69 power forward That doesnt happen very often Harris guarded tightly in the corner on the catch by Jeremiah Johnson Boozer fakes it finds a pass This Duke team passes as well as any Duke team that Ive seen in a long time or any team They look for each other and they really move without the ball All five guys Yeah there was very little to complain about from the John Sh perspective after Fridays win Another solid start today 10 for 11 Unfriendly bounce for Howard there Blue Devils by 15 and looking for more Aliks going to take it He can make that shot He doesnt take many but he can shoot out there Hes one for nine on the year now Like I said he can make that Sh has said though he likes when his big big guys take that shot He was happy when Gunga took it and made his first three ever the other night He was happier that Gungba made it than he took it Sar couldnt connect Brown got his hand on the rebound but it finds Howard Prel Bryson knocks down the three Now Bryson is a guy who they were really hoping the Bison that is Were really hoping could come in and make threes Hes a JC guy and thats only his second three of the year Reaching foul goes against Jeremiah doing that for football here So they probably really excited about it That sounds like a dig Jim A small dig Small Sar rejected from behind and Cotton was out of bounds with his heels on the baseline Wow ACC football has been like so ridiculous this year and we we showed you theres a possibility for a sixway tie Yeah Virginia and SMU if they win next week theyre in Charlotte in the championship game Jamena up and in for two But yeah next weekend is going to be fun Plenty of exciting Thanksgiving Day and Black Friday and Saturday action to settle this stuff once and for all Duke does such a great job cutting off the lane and then of reacting back out to the shooters cheering Yeah theyre locked in defensively here again Jamemena tries to stay in front of Gillis did a decent job but Gillis scores anyway But Gillis really does a nice job driving the ball to the basket But Im telling you if thats the kind of shot youre going to get its going to be a long day Sar takes it Not this time either But Kunga has the rebound Kicks it for Boozer Sar attacks the basket They just move the ball so well When they get an offensive rebound they get it out They dont force it The guy gets an easy one cheering Would you use the word athletic to describe Domar Huh Thats one of them Long Hes very aggressive on both offense and defense He moves so well Very smooth Tough jumper Wont go Sar the rebound and hell lead the break And he can jump a little bit too His parents were born in Sagal He grew up in Italy cheering Hmenya Beautiful pass Beautiful ball movement every possession Thats right Even in a big blowout game Dukes fun to watch because they just keep playing and executing both ends of the court Fun to watch this team play basketball Gungba continues to shoot 100 from the field in the brotherhood run Harris too strong Rebound deflected controlled by Saramboozer on the bench right now Heres Jimemena tried to wrap the pass around and it will be Duke ball Camboozer coming back in Well Java made some They actually called it Howard ball So the Bison have it Theyre three and three Theyll be back here in Durham in December to play North Carolina ENT They certainly have high expectations for what they can do in their league largely because of Bryce Harris This possession ends at a turnover Aoji gives it away Boozer kicks it Foster missed it right Malik Brown had a hand on it and theyre going to say off Howard Ball 753 to play first half He said I wanted to win championships He said Brian Davis hosted him on his recruiting visit And this is before they won championships But Davis said were really close to winning one I want you to be here And Blakey was here for two of them Its hard to imagine there was a time before they won championships Great tradition but its hard to win a national title Its hard to win a game in that tournament much less win the championship Amen Up and under move Caleb Foster off the glass When first when we first got in a couple times when I was started coaching I was just happy to get in and then you win a game then Well okay lets win a couple but its never easy How does winning the national title change your life as a coach Jim Beheim It doesnt change it but it makes it a lot better Boozer making things better for the Blue Devils I wonder if Boozer is going to do something today Hes just he kind of plays it easy when he they dont need him I dont think he really feels well I got to go out and get 20 But when he need him hell get 20 The lead is 21 Shot clock winding down Ryson tough turnaround Buries it from the elbow Every shot theyve made has been hard too I mean they theyve got 17 points but theyve had to work really really hard to get that get 17 points Cam Boozer flips it high Malik gives it back Triple team doesnt matter Too much size too much strength down there And again a little interior passing first one then back to him Most big guys dont do that Eight points for Camboozer Three of four from the floor Caught zips it for Bryson Theres Gillis with nine Harris guarded by Sar whos just a feisty guy to have to tangle with And theres a reachin foul on Brown And I believe thats Maliks second Tomorrow night more ACC mens basketball Well if you havent seen the talented Louisville freshman Mikel Brown Jr you got to check out sixth ranked Louisville as they host Eastern Michigan at 700 right here on the ACC Network and on the allnew ESPN app Louisville really looks good early in the year Very good Pick Kelseys done a great job there Yeah they sure have And they took all those threes last year when they couldnt make any And now they got guys who can make them They made enough They did make enough but they were much more uh quantity over quality last year What have been your impressions of Myel Brown as a freshman point guard I havent really seen enough of him yet His numbers are good obviously but uh you know hes got the talent one of the better freshman in the country and its an unbelievable year in college basketball with all the freshman coming in all highly rated and NBA rated and then all the guys coming back and then all the foreign players that have infiltrated our country Thats right Like Sar who just picked up the foul I guess all these foreign players had their visas and everything Okay I guess theyre okay Its a nice pass Bryson missed it Point blank range Heres Sar the other way No whistle Gillis held his ground Gets it ahead Johnson for three And Boozer unable to control the rebound but it finds Jmenya Its not important but I just seen four fouls that werent called So I D from the corner I think sometimes these games sometimes they forget to blow their whistle once in a while Well and if anybody would pick that up Jim it would be you Yeah I love to watch those guys I just cant help cant get enough of it And these are good officials too I wont ask you about your least favorite officials at least until the second half Well I dont have enough time laughter I really dont You could ask me about my favorite ones That would be very quick Clarence Armstrong the veteran ACC ref working with Roger Ays and Adam Floor here today Roger works every game every TV game in the country Feels like he works three games a day sometimes I think he would if he could but hes probably six days a week at least I know youre not big into social media but there is a Twitter account that tracks Rogers every game and probably his every movement and every meal Harris to the basket Two more Theres a surprise Its a two I have not seen him do that Boy they get out and go Really great in transition Theres not that much right now Im not pretty darn good at Harris over Jimea for two Harris is a really nice player Hes the only guy on this team that really can step up and make plays against Duke Kenny Blakey called Bryce Harris the most influential recruit in the So you dont have a guy out there that cant make a play They all can Jim during the break you were talking about the internal competition among the Duke teammates Well Coach Hire was talking before the first game the other day talking about how these guys want to play more off the bench then they just got to go in and play well and thats what theyre doing Said he thought about asking each guy how many minutes theyd like to play and then adding them all up and hed realize I dont have 500 minutes in a game to give out Got 200 You want all your players to think they should start every one of them Thats thats the way theyre going to be productive cheering Howard nice pass Better block Gangba and Jamena were both right there In transition Jmenya fakes the three No look to Ganga Deflected and stolen Maybe he should have looked That was a little bit too fancy He had a guy open on the wing Harris fakes it Takes it Air ball cheering Kayen to Harris and the other Harris Grabs the board Heres Bryce with a gallop to his step and hes rejected Kaden Boozer got a lot of b lot of ball Foul is called Free throws coming for Bryce Harris You get that much contact theyre going to call a foul It was close but theyre going to call that But again Harris is a warrior He got the ball got it out and hes just gonna He made up his mind before half court Im going to take this Im going to go all the way with this thing Its a very competitive kid cheering Tomorrow nights ACC Network featured womens basketball matchup Hannah Hidalgo the nations leading scoreer in the number 24 Notre Dame fighting Irish hosting Central Michigan at 900 Eastern Also available on the allnew ESPN app Heck of a win for Neel Ivys Irish the other night with Hago hitting the buzzer beater to beat USC And how about the game before that 16 steals Thats Dan Bonners career 16 steals Thats a game Did you get that many Dan No somebody in a game they got 18 for me Actually in one game that I played I had nine turnovers and they were all steals by the other team Do you have do you have tape of this Is there or did you burn the footage or Id love to see it But now I played so long ago we didnt have tape We had film film and thats gone And thats gone So you need special equipment and nobody has it anymore Well one of our guys our film guys digitized it all Is that the word Digitiz the word for me And put it on a thumb drive Thats another good word I have that but I dont have any place to put the thumb drive So I still Ive got some games but I dont Im not really that eager to see them anyway but I have them Jim dont take this the wrong way but I can show you the correct dongle to use to get your thumb drive to work Dont pay any attention to him Thats okay Thats all right Ill wait Ill Ill wait a little bit I want to do it when Im alone so that I can review the the tape applause Couple free throws for Boozer Fans reminding Harris about his previous airball as theyre kind to do Gillis not an air ball but not a make either Rebound for Gungba Harris looking for another two Hell get free throws The foul is on the Serbian Stfan Isilovich Well Silvich didnt play at all against Niagara and he just gets caught out in the corner I mean Harris has shown he can shoot the three so well Goes out there you guard him and then he goes right by you First game for Stefan since November 6th against University of District Columbia not a D1 program Harris at the line the sophomore from Hearnden Virginia where he was the Gatorade Virginia player of the year a couple seasons ago I think he heard that we were talking about him just being a threepoint shooter and hes going to show us today hes going to the basket So thats what hes doing Well see Well my guess would be that he pays no attention to anything we say which is probably the right thing to do Be a heck of a story if one of these guys had an earpiece and they were listening to the broadcast laughter while Im playing I guarantee someone they know is listening and will report back to you cheering Rare missed free throw for Harris Duke has cooled off They started 10 for 11 Theyre now shooting just 69 cheering So theyve cooled off and theyre shooting 69 Okay good to know Six of their eight misses are threes Theyve only missed two twos if youre keeping track As we tick under two minutes in the first half Harris has it stolen HERES ANOTHER ALLOWED TWO UNLESS BRYCE Harris has anything to say about it Its a foul on Bryce after Darren his names sake no relation picked his pocket Well Harris is trying Bryce Harris is trying to maneuver himself to the basket You know obviously not going to get it but he tried Thats what he wanted to do Well the most important thing there is those two managers for Duke who come out every time the ball goes on the end of the court to wipe up I dont know what theyre wiping up all the time but thats got to be the cleanest lane in the history of the world They showed some get up and go to get out of the way They went as fast as they could go to get out of the way Hey one one thing about Bryce Harris I want to mention We we saw it yesterday He was on the bench in foul trouble and his teammates helped them make a run to take the lead compeller on the basketball court Call on the floor I believe was Howard Ball So I believe John Sher taking his use it or lose it timeout and challenging this to get the timeout and gets to keep the timeout if they get the ball Seen a couple coaches around the country do this late in the first half You know its interesting with the new challenge rule If youre right you get one more But if youre right twice you dont get any And you know I mean it kind of doesnt make a lot of sense to me that youre right both times and yet you dont have another time another challenge left I I think they should have had something at least in the last 6 seven eight minutes of the game You should get one more back if you were right both times But it it makes you worry about using your challenge I mean if youre going to need it late uh you use it early Thats thats the whole key And the other thing is it makes you very conscious of using your timeouts because if you dont have a timeout you cant challenge Yeah 100 Its hard to see whose hand that is Can see it through the backboard When you look at some of these plays you really cant Its a guessing game Absolutely it is And then you just give it the way it was called But I think the the purpose of this challenge rule more than anything else is to move the game along because in the the past couple years every time the ball went out of bounds everybodys circling their fingers Lets review it And so thats why theres only one challenge What did you call Thats the thing that always got me is when they do it 30 seconds to go and the other team doesnt have any timeouts and they look for it Now the other team gets a timeout to talk about what theyre going to run And thats another thing they were trying to prevent So now the challenge was successful which means Duke you have to call a timeout to challenge But if the challenge is successful then you get that timeout back And so John Sh gets the timeout back and still has one challenge left But if he doesnt use that timeout by halftime he loses it again Thats always been the case right a use it or lose a timeout in the first half So when its 46 to 18 hes not concerned overly about using his time out laughter Boozer the first in the double figures And heres another steal for Darren Harris And this time he finishes Hes being productive at both ends of the court tonight Duke racking up the steels again Cameron Boozer Hello Time out Bison Four Just keep coming at 4 days from now Duke will be in Chicago to take on John Calipars Arkansas Razerbacks Thursday night Pass off the back of the backboard The turnover Dukes got a stretch of games five out of six that are all top top 20 25 teams So thatll be better for them Thatll get them to where they got a better idea where they are exactly Harris doesnt get the bounce Well hes spending too much time shooting twos Hes lost his touch from three Nobody stopped the ball but Howard could not make Duke pay And Dame Sar grabs his fifth rebound of the half About a 4second difference between the game and shot clock And now John Sh will take this advantage to be able to draw up a play 275 An awesome experience Well theyve improved a lot in the last 15 years as Im sure have your your calls have improved You dont want to hear what it sounded like 15 years ago Jim Trust me we wanted to tape or the thumb drive Or the thumb drive Foster with 10 to shoot 14 and a half Duke leading by 32 And free throws coming for Caleb Fouls on Bryson Nine and a half ticks remaining Thats really tough to guard You put everybody down on the baseline and then Fosters so good with the ball You bring Boozer up to the screen Everybody runs to the corners Well you cant help or theyre going to hit somebody for an open three and its really hard to stop these guys oneonone Its going to take a really wellbalanced good solid defensive team to to to bother this Duke team right And its no matter how well the other team plays defense theyre going to have to put points on the floor This is not a Duke team Youre going to beat 50 to 46 The reachin foul and Duke did not have one to give So this is going to be a oneonone opportunity here with 72 to go And thats something you can coach Shire can show his team and say Okay we want pressure here but we dont we dont want to put him on the foul line here especially if its a twopoint game Very busy day on the Duke University campus There was the national championship game in field hockey earlier today Northwestern won in double overtime and and Duke womens soccer also had their second round tournament match Theyre moving on A two nothing win over Kansas Duke mens basketball unable to hit that last shot Evans comes up empty but the Blue Devils still close the half on an 11 nothing run over the final two This is a heck of a team and weve seen them twice now and of course the the opposition hasnt been what theyre going to face later on but this is what theyre supposed to do against a team like this and boy theyve done it twice in a row Yep And not all teams do what theyre supposed to do in games like this Its such a mishmash in the low post that that when they try to go down there Howard has no chance except to push the guy you know to push push you out of bounds Its its uh not a fair fight down there Well Harris actually and he just picked up his third foul and he I I mean hes a very aggressive guy at 220 lbs Hes as much bulk as they have in there but hes got three fouls now And he only had one two seconds ago picked up two fouls in the last fourth here Clairvoyant D and Mor was correct They could have let that one go but no they didnt Well if you have three fouls you have to let that one go Free throw gentlemen Just want to make sure its on the record I fouled one time with 1644 left in a half when I didnt have any fouls at halftime Against who It was a freshman game against Virginia Tech Well the good news nobody was there to watch it so thats true Its a good thing Alex Cotton whos in the top 30 in the country in threes per game makes his first of the day Boozer tried to force that one but Foster bailed him out Again good hustle after the loose ball Gungba just no answer for that Theres nothing you can do Donis Kazakvichas freshman from Vius Lithuania the big Damontis Sabonis fan growing up Hes their tallest guy at 610 but he couldnt score around Gumba Foster into the lane has the trailing Gungba Is he going to try it No he will made his first career three here on Friday night after he had previously been 0 for eight Now hes one for 10 Coach Bonner doesnt Gunga takes that shot Hes seen him make it in practice He wants to have that be a part of his arsenal I think he likes that shot a little better from 2 and 12 ft from the basket I think its greedy with all the guys you have to want Gungba to have that in his arsenal Thats their last option Sh said after the game Friday quote Ive been begging him to shoot threes He also said We got to get him more touches with how efficient he has been Yeah I think the second part is good The first part I think sometimes coaches say things you know just kind of like just out of the blue What do you know about that When its tie game and theyre playing you know Arkansas Arkansas or Michigan State I guarantee you he is not shooting a three He might block a shot though He can do that Well its just so hard to get the ball all the way to the rim against these guys They reset the shot clock to 20 Now theyre putting it back to 14 Rightly so Howard ball after the gunga block Reaching foul on Evans Well Holland did a really nice job fighting for position inside And you know sometimes you just have to be more physical in there He just beat Evans to the spot Now they put the shot clock at 20 after the foul cheering Theyre having trouble getting the ball in balance here Finally its Ed Holland the third that gets free Cam Gillis the former Lehi Mountain Hawk fouled by Foster What theyve tried to do here early in the second half is theyve given up trying to set screens Theyve spread the court Theyre trying to just drive oneonone and theyve had some success drawing fouls You cant The screens dont help because theyre switching on everything and you just end up with nothing after the screen You got to try to dribble but its hard to dribble and get by Duke Each team has been called for three fouls a piece in the first two 10 of the second half And theres the seventh foul of the half And its on number seven Dominar his second Yeah This is sometimes officials do that They just decided I think they have a meeting ahead time said Well we didnt call enough Lets just go out and call some more Jim in retirement have they considered making you an officiating consultant Not even for one second cheering Its a hard game to referee I will tell you that If they asked you for your advice we see another great pass from Boozer Sar missed the layup and bailed out by the whistle It was a foul on Gillis What would your general advice be to Joe College basketball referee in 2025 Its a first of all its a hard game to referee Im not going to sit up here and criticize it Its a hard thing The five have six games all over the country You know you wouldnt let players play five games a night in six different city five different cities So thats one of the problems But uh its just its just a really hard game to referee And they you know they they these guys are good They do the best job they possibly can but its when you look at the replay its hard to tell which what it was when youre looking at the replay So theyre doing live real time So its just a very difficult game to referee And these guys in our in our I think our league is one of the best in the country in terms of officiating what they how they call the game and how consistent they are Referees dont win or lose games They can make calls that hurt you during the course of the game but unless theyre making that one call at the end which usually doesnt happen Of course if I remember correctly there was an inside of your suit jacket that suggests you might have felt otherwise on one particular occasion That was the one time That was the one time I think that in retrospect I was right Of course you were Youre still waiting for your the apology Im sure I dont think thats coming Clock winding down Cotton over Boozer short And thats off Malik Brown Howard ball The other thing that Duke does when you play them here they wear you down They just wear you down with the constant pressure at both ends of the court And you know you just its hard to play 40 minutes with that pressure on you all the time What weve seen from them here early is they have a very clear nineman rotation and everybody who comes in the game really gets after you But they all think they should start and theyre all going to play as hard as they can play every play Cotton doesnt get the bounce Dan of the three of us you are the only one that has played in this building Well you have to use your verbs correctly I was in this building while my teammates were playing You you played in this building a couple times I can tell you the We didnt have chairs We had to sit on those dug on bleacher benches and theyre very uncomfortable Its why the crazies all stand all game long Malik Brown does an unbelievable job of reaching He got caught that time but he does a great job You know we used to teach players dont reach dont reach That was a big thing in coaching Just play with your legs But some guys can reach and get away with it and they get a lot of deflections and a lot of steals and thats what Malik Brown does Call for his third foul there though Plenty of whistles in this fourminute segment Five fouls against Duke four against Howard Ahead to Evans to the pass Isaiah cheering Evans cheering Hes not just a shooter folks Theres Donis Kazakvichas Hes showing his game today Flipped up to Boozer Second chance and hes fouled Theres the 10th foul of the half in about 4 and 12 minutes even get on it let alone for a million dollars I dont think I could get on Dan 2 million for charity Would you try it I would try it I wouldnt get anybody any money for charity Cameron Boozer wins that match up When he wants to score he can just go down there and score He just doesnt do that that much in these games Hes also got 25 lbs on Kazakhstit And so is that all Yeah that guys got no Well they list him at 225 He doesnt look like 225 to me Arkansas on Thursday and then a week from Tuesday against the Florida Gator right here at Cameron Thatll be a great test because Floridas big big guys It wont be as easy for these big guys to get inside and score And theyre all theyre all top 25 teams except Lipkcom and Lipkum was in the NCA tournament last year They are the Bison We wont ever see it again Good But I love Cameron Boozers just got a great attitude about the game of basketball He just takes whats there If he doesnt score he just passes it I mean its hes really a good player Special player cheering Kaden Boozer with a pestering defense now Shot clock at nine for Gillis Kazakvichas rebounded by Boozer They literally almost cant get a shot sometimes Oh hard screen from Malik Brown Roger right there Said its clean This is Jamena for three He got his confidence in the first game in Niagara Now hes hes going to make that shot ends up getting a three on the other side of the court cuz this team moves the ball that way Fifth three of the game from five different guys Jamemena continues to see that threepoint percentage rise right now Cameron Boozer is the only starter on the floor for the Blue Devils Brown had the rebound poked away and then he helps to misdirect the shot and Boozers got his fourth double double of the season and Jimemena lost the basketball Bryce Harris back in the game with four fouls right at Cameron Boozer Quadruple teamed and Bryce Harris scores Actually was right at Kaden Boozer but Caden Boozer is taller than Harris Hes determined This is Cameron and thats a three And hes determined as well and hes very smooth in his determination 22 and 10 for Cameron We started the broadcast saying he had season lows and rebounds and points 14 and five on Friday but hes gotten his numbers and hes also set up his teammates Hes got four assists too too strong on the drive cheering Bryson after the kick out burries the three So far in this game he has made twice as many threes as he did as he had did all year coming in Its so hard for them just to get a shot let alone make one Kayen Boozer draws the foul Theres a theres a loud conversation going on about Dukes point guard situation And look theyre theyre playing great basketball Theyre depending on what metric you look at number one number two number three in the country And theres a conversation being had about is the Blue Devil offense better with Foster or Kaden Boozer running the show Well conversation is not going on in the among the Duke coaches So well but there are a lot of fans out there having that conversation Its a good thing we dont let fans coach the team Yeah fans can have that conversation They can make their comments but theyre not worried about that Theyve got two competent guards and uh theyre both playing well and they dont have to do a lot because a lot of their stuff goes through their forwards Thats where it goes through Boozer Even even with with Ba goes to him Uh and then you have Isaiah Evans too So they they dont need a point guard to make a lot of plays Hey Jim Im good for a couple dumb questions every broadcast I like that Well my question for you Evan and for the fans is how much better do you want these guys to be Well that means our offense isnt bad I mean good heavens My question for Jim is did a fan ever make a basketball suggestion to you that you hadnt thought of before and you thought after the suggestion thats pretty smart Not once in a in 47 years All right Not once And I mean I not that I listen to them but I you know they get back to me sometimes Amen you for two Listen Marv Levy said it best When you start listening to the fans you will be sitting with them Hes a pretty smart guy Ivy Leager Rebound Jimemena after the miss from Powell And its going to be offensive foul Howard Ball and we come back Bison trail by 45 He makes a play when he has to and you know obviously here they cant contain him inside so its a little bit too much for Howard These are the numbers entering the day and those numbers will mostly if not all rise at the end of the day Hes got 22 points in 22 minutes Day might be done Well see with 1130 to go Well and that would be extremely impressive for a freshman in most cases but its sort of you know very ordinary here since Cooper Flag led the team in all those numbers last year as a freshman And again its unusual Cooper flag can play the point or second two guard three I mean Cam Boozer is mainly a power forward Thats what he is And its unusual for a guy like that to lead your team in assists or steals Thats very unusual There have been a lot of great freshman obviously to play here at Duke Zion Williamson was a sensation in so many ways I saw a comment that compared now sadly the late Rodney Rogers It said he was Zion before Zion I want to get your thoughts on Rodney Jim He He was a lot like that Powerful lefthanded go to the basket could shoot I mean just Rodney Rogers was a great player and did a lot at Wake Forest and was able to win championships which is hard to do He was a great great player The Durham Bull as he was known Dan you remember broadcasting Wake Forest games with Rodney Well I sure do You know it was one thing youre down at Wake Forest and Wake was struggling and Dave ODM came in and that was that was the the Rodney Rogers the guy that got Dave ODM and Wake Forest going and uh you know Ive talked to Dave about Rodney on a number of occasions and you know and Rodney Rogers was a great player He had that horrible accident but he never stopped being a very nice human being Yeah Randolph Childris said he would not have come to Wake Forest if Rodney hadnt been there first And Randolph our colleague and friend also said that to this day he truly believes Rodneys the greatest athlete ever to walk on the Wake Forest campus which is a pretty loud statement He was pretty athletic and good Id trust on that Yeah And our friend Dave ODM I believe hes out in Hawaii right now getting ready for the Maui Invitational which NC State will lead off tomorrow Two more for Cameron Boozer His day is not done Now got 24 points Cameron can score as many as Duke wants him to If they give him the ball every time hell score every time He had 35 against Indiana State Nine days ago You might say why is Boozer still in the game Well you got nine got 10 minutes left in the game And what Duke is doing here is theyre working on things Theyre working on different combinations And if youre going to work on combinations Boozer is going to be in the middle of it isnt he Yeah You have to play guys in games like this because the next game he might play 38 minutes So you dont want him to play 20 here and then come back and and have to play 38 minutes after just playing 20 You want them get them used to the pace and playing the minutes John Sh was asked about the different lineups and mixing and matching different pieces to test things out after the game Friday He said You try to coach for the moment and try to win but you also coach for who we can be Yeah theres no question youre using this game to help see what you can do different ideas different combinations but thats what youre doing This is a good game for that Its obviously not a game that youre going to be challenged Another assist for Kaden Another bucket for Gungba But its also a lot better than a day of practice because you got somebody new to look at So players are going to enjoy this game The coaches are going to enjoy this game They know whats ahead Very tough nonconference schedule and a really much improved ACC this year I dont know if Ive ever looked at a box score this late in a game where every player on the team thats taken a shot except one is shooting better than 50 Theres three for BJ Powell But for Duke Dames Sar is two for six Hes below 50 but you got Boozer 9 for 11 Gungba seven of eight Fosters two for three Jimeny three for three Harris three for five Brown three for four I mean everybody is shooting the cover off the ball right on Q Isaiah Evans misses a shot So does Caleb Foster Gungas not missing that one though applause Hes now eight for nine Its hard to miss when youre a foot from the basket Evan I just wanted you to know that off the top of my head I just thought you might not see that as you are about 5 10 Yeah being under six feet I I could show you how to miss from that close Were going to get Evans for the foul with 814 to play Gives us a chance to remind you about ACC mens basketball tomorrow night on the network Sixth ranked Louisville taking on Eastern Michigan Pat Kelseys squad led by Mikel Brown Jr and Ryan Conwell That game available right here on the network and the allnew ESPN app You look around the league Clemson had a nice win today Wake Forest pulled one out the other night The league is so much better and and thats good for everybody Thats good for Duke Its good for every team in the league because youre going to get more teams in the tournament and youre going to get like Duke is going to get better competition all year long in the league which is going to help them when it comes time for the tournament We are nine 10 days away from the ACC SEC challenge An event that did not go well for the Atlantic Coast Conference last year to put it mildly from a perception standpoint Big picture How important is the challenge 9 10 days from now Well its important You want to you dont want to do what happened last year I mean thats something you dont want But SEC is very good Itll be good Itll be a good competition No question about it What hands Hes really when hes in there hes a hard guy to handle But particularly for this Howard team they just dont have the size No he they have no chance But theyre trying Theyre doing everything they can Its just a game Theyre playing for a lot of different reasons and uh theyre doing everything they can but its not going to be a game they have a chance to win cheering 26 and 10 for Boozer This is Kaden his twin brother Kayen doesnt have a field goal today Only one point Hell look to add to his offense when we come back 725 to go Duke leading 8539 725 to play Evan Leeler Dan Bonner Jim Beahheim back with you from Cameron Indoor Stadium in Durham Gentlemen there was a question I was curious to ask you Jay Williams last week said that Camboozer might be Dukes most skilled big man ever He called him a mix of Tim Duncan and Al Horford Well lets lets not get quite out over there right now I mean I mean I dont know unless youre not counting Grant Hill Um but uh hes a really good player and hes just getting into his freshman year He certainly does a lot of things well and uh hes going to be in hes going to mentioned in the category of a lot of those guys but we need a little need a little reset a little time here Still game seven Yeah Bryce Harris playing with four fouls Navigates to the rim but cant finish Pass to Evans and hes bumped And Evans last year pulls a trigger out there from three and that shows you his development as a player that he lets the guy run by and tries to go to the basket Now hes going to get himself to the free throw line You know the other thing we were talking about Evan was the fact that you know the ACC has improved and so they have a chance to get more teams in the tournament Well the MAK is going to get one Yeah And so and thats Howard Howard obviously wants to play very well Theyre playing in this game so they can get better for the Mak When it comes right down to it the only games that Howard has to win are those in the MAK tournament I think maybe Boozers done for the day Hes left the gone to the bench 26 points 12 rebounds four assists for Boozer 10 of 12 shooting By the way tomorrow nights ACC Network feature womens basketball matchup Hannah Hannah Hidalgo whos the nations leading scoreer number 24 Notre Dame hosting Central Michigan 900 Eastern on ACC Network Also available on the ESPN app Two free throws for Evans and well see if he is indeed done for the day as well 11 points for Isaiah But Jim heres a lineup combination we havent seen in two games Well I think theyre just trying to get to the finish line now Theyve theyve gotten about all theyre going to get out of this game And I think theyre going to just try to get to the finish line right now Theyve done a great job but it you know when youre up 50 its hard Its really Its hard to Its hard to watch Its hard to coach sometimes But Howard to Howards credit theyre still out there Theyre still going after it Theyre still playing hard And thats thats a great thing Jamemena you could call him the center in this lineup Cant connect from three Sar and Jmena both 68 Tallest Duke guys on the floor right now Eight to shoot for Harris and hes shoved according to Clarence Armstrong by Kaden Boozer Harris has been very aggressive He got in himself in foul trouble but he he gets a little lane and hes just strong enough at 220 lbs Hes forcing his way through there Yeah I mean hes hes more hes going to develop his game And again thats part of a college experience Hes going to get better Hes going to learn how to do that stuff And when you can really shoot it thats a good place to start Thats if you can really shoot him now you can learn how to dribble the ball You can learn how to get to the basket When you cant shoot its not easy to learn how to shoot But hes hes got that talent And hes going to be a good player First team all league two years ago won the tournament title Preseason player of the year last year He got hurt Only played seven games back with big ambitions trying to win his third title in four years this season Very good play Howard still getting after it defensively Boozer to the corner Sar turns it over applause Sars the one guy in the two games that kind of looks like hes hes trying to figure things out over here I I I dont think hes got it figured out yet Hes a very talented player Got eight rebounds six points in this game But I I hear what youre saying and agree hes not clicking on all cylinders right now Just scratching the surface of his potential Good drive Boozer beaten by BJ Powell And right now without the three big guys in the game youve got no basket protection You didnt see that happening when the big guys are in the game BJ Powell from Charlotte Bucket Hell remember Powells only played sparingly 12 minutes all season coming into today Did not play yesterday against Niagara Harris trying to bully Kaden and Kaden says Give me that The thing with Duke on offense too theyre theyre not as fluid even though they have smaller guys out there because the offense going to be a push on Sar before the ball was inbounded You know you have two veteran officials and the guy that made their calls are kind of working his way into the league I think hes only blow his whistle twice tonight Hes trying to hes hes on the veteran guys He kind of had to call that one cuz he got knocked down Thats something that a coach of almost five decades would notice You kind of see those things sometimes I once asked a guy if his whistle worked He didnt He didnt He didnt like that myself No but you know I cant imagine why I try to you know inject a little humor And at the time I asked him that we were ahead a lot so I knew it wasnt going to be a damaging question Well you could write a book about all the conversations youve had with officials through the years A lot A lot of them None of them ever help me right here on this court Ron Grover whos the probably the best ref in the country in a in a Duke game tight game asked me when I questioned his call He said Now coach do you think I got in my car today drove up here two and a half hours got press came out here just to give you a bad call And I said Ron thats the best Ive ever heard I Im dumbfounded I have no comment left All right young referees out there watching take notice And hes really really good Yeah And we won that game too Not that I think the story helped Travel Bryson at the line Transfer from Vincens Well they really expect big things for him And I thought the game yesterday for Bryson where he had 15 points against Niagara I think the folks from Howard are hoping that that sort of jumpst starts what hes doing Hes made two threes today Good defense The steel Aoji kicks it Its just theres just never anybody open when you get there Theres just somebody covering Under four minutes we go This has been a pretty good battle between Kaden Boozer and Bryce Harris Foster went for the steal didnt get it and pays the price BJ Powell buries the three from the corner Thats a couple of those for him Thats a Thats a piece of tape youll show the team Dont gamble Every time you gamble somebodys open someplace So you dont want that out there Its Its not used to that Its going to affect how you play Well is in the game now So at 611 they got a big guy back out on the court That was masterfully pronounced Dan Well done Harris to the corner This is Jack Scott out there as well Kaden crosscourt sets up Cameron Sheffield whos up there too when he knocks down the jumper Duke doesnt have any real any bad players on their team I dont know if theyre down at 11 or 12 Sheffield halfway down and popped back out Bryson straightaway three and Kenny Blake is going to take a timeout with two game So they got St Marys and they got Mount St Marys your next two St Marys of California No Mary Mary Washington is also not on their schedule of Virginia Well William and Mary they uh they play William and Mary in a uh preseason game and beat him Really Yeah Good win One of the guys that theyre excited to get back is Cedric Taylor transfer from Morehouse College in Atlanta They believe that with Bryce Harris and Cedric Taylor theyve got the two best players in the MAK And Taylor broke his hand in practice three days before the season opener Theyre hopeful to get him back mid December Boozer I beg your pardon Thats Harris Well thats the biggest thing about this game This is just a block and its over and you go home and you try to win your conference cuz thats all that matters One bit Its a moving screen called on Calvin Robbins Jr I know this is no concern to the two of you but this is very suspenseful for some folks out there watching right now Why is that Were not talking about that I dont think one of you just asked me to elaborate and the other told me to shut up Well were talking margins here and were not doing that Ill just say 43 and a half is the number that some folks might be concerned about Trust me these three officials are trying to get out of here more than anybody else Theyre not going to call unless its a Youre right Lot of contact on Blood has to be drawn or if the ball goes out of bounds you got to blow the whistle Youll have to Theyre trying to get it down to the end Hey Jim is it hard I know Dukes really good but two games like this and then you got Arkansas on Thursday Is it is it an adjustment to match up with the Razerbacks in the first four minutes after these two games You think about it as a coach coaches worry about stuff like that and but Duke has played well So its not like they didnt play well and won They played well So that should carry over into the Knicks game even though its a 50point game here And Im sure John Sh you know remembers they did not start the games against Texas or Kansas particularly well Right Thats a point he made and they did start well in both these games So he can use that We got a reach in foul on Ephine Buffachuku Well they didnt start well in any of their games prior to the Niagara game And that was one of their points of emphasis is they wanted to make sure they started well But Jim coaches worry about everything Everything Thats what we do Thats what you have to do And if you didnt worry about it something happened and then you then youre mad at yourself As much as the fans think they care more than we do they dont They They dont care more than Julian Johnson makes that free throw The fans really cared about the free sandwiches they were going to get if he missed both of them So Julian Johnson who went to Providence Day in Charlotte uh destroys the dreams of the crowd there More free throws coming with 43 seconds left Dukes next home game a week from Tuesday against the Florida Gator in the ACC SEC challenge And thats going to be a heck of a basketball game That Florida team is really good Theyve got size Theyve got size to contend with Duke inside And they obviously have experienced players in the perimeter as well this really really good Florida team I was surprised early in the year Florida State took him right to the wire and you know Florida State was picked way down in the ACC Well if not for a couple rough minutes Yeah in April last year Duke Florida would have been the national title game Yeah Yeah 100 John Shy talking about it preseason He said you just want to be in the mix you want to give yourself a chance in March and April He feels that theyve done that every year hes been in charge and theyll certainly be in the mix again Theyre going to be in the mix And the problem is theres 16 teams minimum when you get to the Sweet 16 that are going to be teams that you can lose to Thats how deep college basketball is this year with all the guys staying the great freshman class internationals College basketball is really good right now Really good And the tournament is going to be really good And when youre one of the good teams its not that easy Once you get to those 16 its going to be really hard Jim I would argue that its even before the 16 Yeah No youre right 32 I think You know if youre a number one seed you win that first game The next team you play is an 89 And theyre really good Yeah Yeah I mean it it its theres nothing going to be easy in that tournament I know youre youre probably most proud of the national championship but going from the first four to the final four has to be on your short list of great accomplishments too That was fun to do Trust me anytime you win in the tournament and you advance its fun to do Thats what you think about cheering And when you dont advance its not good No sandwiches for the crazies Well they can get sandwiches They just got to pay for them I say nobodys going to storm them The Duke Blue Devils are 70 9356 They finish off Howard by 37 for Jim Beheim and Near
