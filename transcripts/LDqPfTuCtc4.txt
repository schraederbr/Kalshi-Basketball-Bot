7672 and you see two of the stars in the league right there Marcus Burton and ishmail leet and away we go with game one of 14 from here in shotte and Burton and the Irish as the 12 seed we the white jersey here Nikita constant tenosi starts today because kevi is not available he is in concussion protocol for Micah shrew beber heres rooper on the hard drive and score and thats one of the areas of concern you want for those Panthers the in the game before Notre name shot 56 in their win on the 22nd so they have to find a way to keep them out of the paint and getting easy looks well that was a really good possession first possession everybody touched the ball here is Brandon Cummings The Freshman from outside of Pittsburgh and cam Corin who got off to a terrific start in their win Saturday against Boston College cant find it there he was still it hit the backboard some place heres a look at the noted aim lineup keep an eye on Marcus Burton second Team all ACC and he on Q handles it at the head of the circle constant tonosi scores at the rim and its four nothing thats what Marcus has to do when he penetrates find that open guy make that pass and that was perfect and on the Baseline Corin had it knocked away itll stay with the Panthers and that was a switch defensively matako calling Jordan rope to come over and guard camor on the Block knowing that it was a mismatch and rer getting over just in time to be able to knock the ball out of bounds heres Corin slips down and constant tonski blocks it out of bounds so Micah Shrewsberry now in his second season a year ago they went 13 20 theyre 14 17 now and its been bumpy for Shrewsberry injuries tough nights at the office if you will from a team perspective Cory but I feel like the four overtime win on Saturday helped them it absolutely did help him it helped put them in the fiveway tie that we have for Ninth Place in the League this year and on the other end Jeff capable and this would be a disappointing season for Jeff he was expecting much more from this team and this is a team that got off to a very good nonconference start had big wins have not been able to piece it together especially in the defensive end in ACC play yep Tay Davis here for Burton this is a locko the Princeton transfer who hit a big shot in the fourth overtime the other day against Cal T to shoot for Notre Dame and Burton to work against jayen low heres a loo Davis with four to shoot three ball over Austin and the rebound pulled away by ishma Le pitch guards are really good rebounders by the way better defensive effort at that time made him take a tough shot that they didnt want to take got a lot of great matchups in this game though coach when you consider jayen low Mark Burton matching up with each other and then you also look at a locko guarding ish leget two fifth year guys and Corin is going to be called for the offensive foul here and Tony Henderson the referee with Tommy marsy and Jeff Pond theyre going to go to the monitor here because why constant owski watch down on the foul you see the elbow the right elbow to the jaw thats why theyre going over the look and that I believe thats going to be upgraded to a plager one simply because thats not a basketball play theres nothing to do with the move on that one Cameron Korn absolutely removed his right hand from the basketball to no thr the elbow there I think theyre going to come back with a flagrant one on that could not have gotten off to a worse start so far well you give Notre name credit for attacking the basket after further review the call has been upgraded to a flagrant one all right so cam corn flagrant one means free throws this one was relatively easy you simp when you see the right hand come off the basketball and the elbow making contact above the shoulders thats going to be a automatic because thats not a basketball play if he had his right hand on the basketball still was going into a shot y that would be completely different Nikita kantowski is now six of 16 at the line this year Applause he is well traveled started his college career at Tulsa then went to Northeast Oklahoma junior college and then last year played for King rice in Monmouth thats it right there yeah clear its its a great sign when your guy shooting 6 for 16 goes to the line and swishes both of them yeah look like Koozie at the line Koozie Bob Koozie remember him was he a good of course he remembers them he might Bill sh was the good shooter okay Bill Charan one Shan you take your pitch Burton a deep three air ball and out of bounds to pit all right we talked about the final at the top six nothing noted aim seemingly all the bounces everything going the Irish way here early well the thing too is the pitch guards are not doing much theyre just kind of letting the game come eventually the guards will take over thats what they do heres Le trying to get Baseline Dio Diaz Gram on the floor here to uh replace by the way k a moment ago so the Junior from tenar Reef in the Canary Islands wheres number 25 for pit plays the post theres Burton hesitates turns it over trying to bounce it to constant tski at the other end heres the Speedy cat quick Jaylen low couldnt finish on the scoop and heres Davis for Burt a locko for three no and thats not a shot youre normally going to see Matt Alo taking hes more of a possession guy makes the right play a little rushed on that one in transition but for a guy that made a huge three down the stretch for the Fighting Irish in their win on Saturday as you see the first three go down from jayen low who come came into the year as one of the Bob Koozie you know that guy coach Bob kzi award watch yeah more known for his free throw shooting more known for for his passing but thats a minor point for those of you who dont know who Bob Koozie is by the way in our audience please Google one of the greatest point guards to ever do it theres an award named after him I believe thats it missed shot by low there so we played right around four Applause minutes and Marcus Burton with 15 to shoot pull up jumper good and thats his game when he gets to the pullup thats you know people say well thats not in the game it is in the game today if you can do it like that and be consistent he can Brandon Cummings The Freshman fires it back inside and Diaz Graham a catch and score off a loose ball Diaz Graham was fortunate that he didnt catch that pass and allowed him to be able to open up as Conant Aly went past him trying to block the shot and Im calling him Nikita from here on out Ive said it once and Im one and done WD is that it just once just once okay I cant wait to hear beam say it though thats not going to happen its not happening a locko three ball good thats his shot yeah hes much more of a catch and shoe guy but when you have other players making plays for you Burton getting into the paint rer getting in the paint kicking it out those are the threes Michael Shrewsberry wants to see from his team and when Michael Shrewsberry son went out alako stepped up big time and was really not doing much and now hes really stepped it up yeah 24 including the game winner on Saturday against Cal and that is going to get us to a timeout alongside the Hall of Famer Jim Bean many of these well there was some debate about the fifth but the first four were locked out rock Sal Hunter Sal struggled a little bit this year I think he could have made a case for Watkins or kipo uh that this spot and Terence Edwards as well yeah number of different guys that could have been in that spot but one thing Ive learned is not to get upset with the voting because me and the voters clearly dont look at things the same way well you realize the voters a lot of are in North Carolina I do know that but but once again I just I think that over now this is my 17th year okay being a part of the ACC tournament sure and I dont know if Ive been a voter the entire time but I realized that the voters and I see the game differently theres a hold on Burton on the L for Boston first on Marcus Burton first on Notre Dame thats the switch you get the big on little and now you got to go to them and they did good offense reset to 20 and here is low to work and thats an area where Jay low has to be more aggressive youve got J areski guarding you with the open floors that look like a tackle delich tried to pull the trigger could kzns in the ball game hell flip back to Burton who well short on a three sundra couldnt clean it up but the Freshman from bosni and heroina Obel belich does pull it away he wears 52 handling the ball here at the front this a young man that can really get going Brandon cunnings cumings had a 30point game earlier this year one of the very few freshman to ever have a 30point game and you can see he has the ability to attack off the bounce Elite threepoint shooter but finds himself at the free throw line his brother played a cold game then transferred down had a great year at Pittsburgh my God Michael Shrewsberry looking to the heavens for a little help or maybe maybe the Jumbotron either way he wants some help it you know it doesnt help to look at that I mean its like wait a second even if you get if theyre wrong what does it what good is it just get matter did you did you look coach were did were you a Jumbotron guy I never at one you never looked at one no I knew the call was bad I didnt have to look you know you see the play right there in front of you its the wrong call Cummings hits him both hes an 81 free throw shooter and after the rough start for the Panthers the Fighting Irish have not really been able to separate only a fourpoint game right now as Jeff capable gets ish leet back into the game and cam cor both on the floor two starters so now youre looking at guys who kind of got the wake up call after going to sit down early oh Tay Davis getting looked at a little bit and Notre Dame settled for a lot of threes and not made not a great pass from sundra ends up being a turnover and it was pit that started the game with the turnovers but now the Fighting Irish have given back a number of opportunities y three for Notre Dame five for pit in the first seven minutes here in Charlotte so this is where Jay Ls got to get everybody out of the way I dont know theyre going inside a lot for a team thats guard depend Zach Austin missing on the three I believe without Kev they feeling as though they can exploit something on the interior but if youre jayen low and you get a mismatch and youve got a 69ine guy guarding you on the perimeter tell everybody to get out of the way and just get to the basket heres JR kesn hes played a valuable role after Braden Shrewsberry was lost for the remainder of the year theres sir mohamd the catch and score for the Freshman from Charlotte and every time not Dame has moved the ball and got it inside theyve gotten a good outlook good really good look with threepoint shooting is not the term people use occasionally in basketball vernacular is the balls gotten sticky Cory and the half court with both teams here it really has but that was a good look for is Leed at the top of the key but when the ball gets sticky for either of these teams thats when theyre not at their best theyre a much better team when theyre moving it and allowing everybody to get opportunities thats a opportunity right there for Burton to kick to the corner but a lot ends up knocking down the three ball instead another spot up for him thats what he does Award winner and there is Shawn may who also played in this event did may win it in 05 when the they did not win 05 they did not win they lost the semifinal game to Georgia Tech but Roy Williams said they did win that day even though they lost the game yeah they won by not having to play extra game and went on to go win six games in the NCAA tournament to hang a banner in Apple Hill and thats also the day that Tyler hansboro committed to him oh thats a goodn so thats why he said he won thats a win Burton lost it on the take Austin the recovery who hit the three a moment ago all of a sudden a little momentum here for the Panthers fellas an opportunity there get it back allow J Los already knocked down one to get another good look corn turned it over got it back lost it again now were seeing the effort now coach where we could this could be final game early it didnt look like that oh nice hands by low yep Jaylen low with Austin heres the L and no he missed the dunk everything good except for the finish and Zach Austin just up beside himself from missing that one did everything right jayen low with great hands defensively throws it in a perfect spot all Austin has to do is put that one down but throws it off the back of the rim and thats one that hes going to want back cuz this could be Zack Austin final college basketball game sure could and when you talk about the finale coming in without a win this could be it for him noted a by six Tay Davis found a way to get the ball up on the rim and it fell in first field goal for Davis it wasnt pretty but he got it in the basket so its an eightpoint lead for Notre D the Irish are seven of 13 from the floor Cory hit is just three of their first 12 its been in a struggle and again they got to find a way to continue to get zow in the painted area allow him to make plays for himself or for him for his teammates left hand shot off the glass heres Davis the rebound and Notre Dame is uh looking to see if they can break every time the ball comes off the glass well when another name isnt turn the basketball over theyre getting good looks and taking advantage of him Nikita constant owski has got six to lead the Irish he and Alo have 12 of Notre Dames first 20 and the Fighting Irish now eight of 15 from the field if not for the four turnovers they would be playing a excellent first half in the corner Cummings and constant oski the rebound he had 17 of those in the four overtime win AO in transition this time well thats the second time we should have take that transition shot I dont believe thats his shot I think he a much better catch and shoe got it maybe a little rushed and Leed has it roll around and drop in Pittsburghs guards have got to take over this game theyve tried to go inside have not been very good in there the guards have to do what they do and not score Applause points lead stays eight for Notre Music D deep three for Serta Austin the rebound Co Serta has played 12 or more minutes in each of the last five games for Micah Shrewsberry coinciding with the injury to coachs son and theres low adding a second field goal hes got five the coach look at the last two possessions for the Panthers both their guards Leed and low getting into the painted area putting that pressure on no defense and both coming away with the bucket and they need to do that Serta into traffic Davis a three look at constant owski go get it fires an outlet to serto on a reset right back to the basket and out of bounds its blocked by Applause lean and Diaz Graham both of G GMO and Jorge check in and a quick look at our bracket course this is game one of three today well have Virginia Tech and Cal next and then Florida State Syracuse heres the third and final game on day one here in char WD I looked at the bracket and the order that they have them in when we showed it the first time we sat at the table I thought I prepared for the wrong game I saw I Saw 4 St Syracuse in the middle Im like wait a minute thats not the game were doing when you see prepare for games question I think I think thats a question you may want to ask yourself coach I know you did not get confused at all about that Im here yeah thats it youre here my man I prepared for 50 years man thats a fact that is absolutely a fact only at game time though WD no shoot rounds for 50 years only prepared at game time more shoot rounds in two years than he went to in 50 dont dont put that out there Im going to get some calls chat room stuff in Syracuse no wonder he didnt win enough so you won you won a th000 games twice you won more than enough exactly right here is Davis with 15 to shoot rer look at kick for Serta three off the wing and no good now I dont believe the Panthers knew who Serta was in the first match up between the two they found out though they found out boy they found out when he knocked down four threes in the second half of that game for 12 points and was a big part and not name getting a win look at the Block Mohamad rejects it heres a locko skips it in the corner Serta again sure he can shoot thats his 10 three 12 field goals and aos playing the point guard which he was early in the year when Burton was out and he can make plays he does that now Marcus Burtons over on the bench Notre names lead is Music nine PGE to guo the Diaz Graham Brothers herez Fair to say that those two have a connection no question about that and warge recognizing as soon as he saw the switch that is brother would be open on the Block Cole Serta has been in heck of a story kind of out of the bottom to of the bottom third of the depth chart for Micah shwar here is Sir Muhammad and he had it roll off the back of the iron Davis got and now all of a sudden weve got some pushing and shoving and heres Jeff Pond getting Davis out of there and so is Micah shrew beber and Shrewsberry trying to talk with Tay Davis about his actions because most likely hes going to be the one hes going to be the one the officials are going to go over and look at you see Michael shb still having the conversation with Tay Davis because one you give away points all right jayen low knocking down the first free throw but WD you think the Hall of Famer on my right ever ran out on the floor that fast especially in when it was an altercation going on talking those plaid coat days you think the pla coat get out coach you run out when you run out on the floor I was very quick in the day yeah yes early early in your career very early well early in his career they were in the Big East and they were throwing hay makers out there Ill dont have my man jump out in the middle of one of those that one even accounted what just happening there that would have been a star you would have got a gold star for restraint its a twopoint trip for pit off the free throws From Below Jorge Diaz Graham tried to add three to it and couldnt so its a fivepoint game with five and a half to go but Cory Davis has to stay off the floor with the three fouls now thats going to be a problem because hes the guy that was started getting into the paint for the fighting Iris well see how different they are on both ends of the floor but specifically on the offensive end with him having to sit on the bench and those free throws made it a fivepoint game see Mike Fairley the noted a assistant talking to Tay Davis on the bench and now the ball out of bounds Burton again stepping out bounds moment ago kesn now watch this he throws the ball off the backboard it hit off the backboard and it went back to Notre Dame and then Burton stepped out of bounds so the ball dont lie but the Laughter concert the ball has never lied theres low on the score Jaylen low now with coming up with nine in this first half and continuing to be aggressive attacking the paint and again often times coach you got to make plays for your theyll help eventually and you can find your Shooters but they only going to guard you if youre only going to score guards have got they have to score for pits thats the way they win thats the only way they win games kick to the corner kesn knockdown leg at block is called on is legged whoa the outside line the guy right there didnt call thats the when youre coaching thats when he I mean Tonys Henderson is a good ref but the guyy standing right a foot away says no Im not calling that and now the guy 30 ft away calls it now I can call it from over here but he shouldnt go down that way but but also he calls that so he doesnt call a flop because Im not sure there was much contact on that one and a flop is a possible call 5050 there goes Burton again into traffic roer catch and score for Julian roer the second the senior from Detroit hes got four Marcus Burtons so much better when he tries to make plays than when he tries to make things for himself so much better player three assists for Burton in this first half now too guys fivepoint lead again for Notre Dame Diaz Graham in a mismatch missed the layup and loo the rebound and the foul will go to guo his first third on pit and a missed opportunity there and pit doing a great job recognizing the high low between the twin brothers thats the second time the Jorge has found gear Mo with an opportunity but when you get those Point Blank opportunities you have to finish otherwise Notre Dame will continue to switch and thing is when those guys miss those they go foul somebody yes cuz theyre so upset often compounded with the foul you sound like a guy whos been on the sideline doing this for a little while too fun too Burton out front four minutes to go in this first half Irish with a fivepoint lead Alo good help by pit kicks around to Serta hes short on the three and it is last touched by pit itll stay with no to name well WD you mentioned Cooper flag got snug what do you mean he got I thought he was a defensive player of the year also you know they only going to give so many awards to one guy thats the way that thing works but youre right thats not right I mean again when you look at it from a rating standpoint a defensive rating standpoint he was number one nationally in from a defensive rating he was top 10 in the league in steals and blocks and nothing against Chucky heurn cuz I love Chucky heurn great but Terence Edward was the best defensive player for the Louisville Cardinals Pat Kelce Coach of the Year told us that a week ago yeah he he told us that straight up so now Im ready to hear your input on the coach of the year Well the reason I went with Pat Kelsey web built the program from nothing the worst team in the league no players coming back of note brought all the players in and then started slow because of that but then he just turned it on I mean you can make a great case for John Trier and a case for Brad Brownell in our league if Dave gavit was our commissioner he would have been co coaches of the year it would have been Pat Kelce John shrier Brad Bernell would have been right there though but you can argue this both ways and I love to argue with Cory because usually Im right so thats a good thats why we argue because you think youre right all I dont I know but I will say this the ACC and you know I love my conference the ACC got embarrassed in the ACC challenge they did it was 14 to2 you know the two coaches that got wins John sh Brad brown john shy and Brad Brownell they both be top five teams the ACC coach of the year is not for the year 2025 the ACC coach of the years for the entire season John Shire and the Duke who represented this league in a in a down year for the ACC as well as could be possible yeah thats why he should have been the ACC Coach of the Year saying that hes at Duke and because the players that they have he shouldnt get it is wrong because he recruited those players oh absolutely I agree with all that with Four Freshman in the rotation in comparison to doal with 50y year gu and youre all right about all the points you made the only problem is you could be a Duke and win that game and not even be a good coach its possible its just that one game that doesnt get coach of the year its the building of the program and the coaching of the whole year and I just think you have to if you have to call it in a a 5149 I go Pat Kelson but its not that one game its beating alurn its beating Illinois in the in the garden its going to Arizona beating Arizona at male thats the games Im talking about which why I feel like John S oh he won the biggest games but thats why theyre number one in the country hes got the best team in the country theres no argument about that right now second foul by the way on Marcus Burton quick reminder to you all day between games between sessions of games half time pre post hardest working people Nothing But NE Taylor tanon bomb rides lead with Luke Hancock Carlos Boozer jb2 what are you doing over there man hanging out hey coach let me ask you a trivia question about our panel there what do Luke Hancock Carlos Boer and Joel B all have in Comon MVP look at you MVP thats all you need to say look at you and they got Rings they got Rings they got Rings got winners over there however they all p in comparison to Taylor tan bomb though she carries them every show hey let me add this real quick here with 123 to go the physicality of this ball game has gone back to a day when Boozer did play in this event well you love it you want you want to see the officials allow these guys to play because if you dont then everyone on the sideline and all the all the fans are yelling we didnt come here to see you talking to the officials so let thats what theyre doing theyre doing a great job allowing these guys to play and be physical and that were here for that this ACC basketball youre supposed to allow to do so by the way noted Dames gone 3 minutes without a point thats why the lead has been cut all the way down to three here as we approach the final 60 seconds but coach we talked about it earlier noted a had great chances to be a to put some separation between them in the Panthers but they were unable to do it pni tried to feed it to Mohamad turned it over Irish have given it away nine times in this first half delait for the lead and the rebound for acko so it stays at three now at 2522 and sooner or later pits guards are going to get going its just a of time all right well step aside on a timeout taken by Notre Dame who scor 43 points in this in that game checking back in now and hasnt really been able to get going coach I dont know did it wear into his legs a little bit he played 50 minutes in that game before fouling out in the fourth overtime Johnny Flynn played 58 minutes and the next night played 45 against West Virginia so I think Marcus buron can do that here goes Pon was his team up three and another turnover thats 10 on the Irish delich in transition back for is legett and does le there you go hes bringing it back out recognize they want to get the last shot of the half and I think its going to be leg that takes it its a COR in screen into traffic skips for delich three for the tie hit off the rim and thatll do that Irish will take a 25 22 lead to the locker room 39 of the first half Le it low heres cam Corin working against constant tonski and a foul on Nikita from ke in the Ukraine thatll be his first in the first of the second half on the Irish and Coach if youre Jeff capable at halftime what are you talking to your guys about with ish leet and Zack Austin who connect on that look right there this could be their last possible game if they dont get a win what are you talking to your team about are you bringing that up at half time no I dont think you talk about that you talk about the game and what youre planning to do and I think theyve got to go with their guards theyre trying to get it inside because of the D being out and you know they have some mismatches there but I just think theyre got to go with their guards their guards are good They Carried him all year long Burton shot off balance hit the side job defensively by Le yep and heres Brandon cumins for the tie itll Bound Away look at Leed inside get the rebound kick out low will shoot the tie and missed everything and thatll go to Notre name you know these teams are like zero for 100 or something from three they just arent making threepoint shots get to the basket area try to make something happen there Z for 100 Im not sure its quite that bad five of 31 Im not sure its quite that bad 531 thats not its close I agree its not great but ishell leet with that offensive rebound and doing the job defensively hes playing like this could be his last game hes not really getting much help from his teammates from effort standpoint there goes Davis on the drive and the bucket for Tay Davis thats where hes good thats where Notre Dames good get to the basket get some easy shots pits got to do the same thing back to a fivepoint lead a minute and a half gone in the second 20 minutes of char leg at the scoop Corin the rebound and score Corin the bucket therere just by getting to the basket he gets the center over and now they get the offensive rebound so even though he misses the shot get a bucket and no keage on available today for noted a so those offensive rebound opportunities are going to be there more often for cam of cor constant owski puts it on the deck against Cory and now almost turned it over loo corals it with t to shoot boy look at the contact off the ball heres Nikita hell leave it for Davis soft jumper good smart play by Nikita to drop it off corn was tracking down Nikita would have had a block from behind but as he dropped it off it gives Tay Davis an easy look and now the Fighting Irish pushing the lead back out to five yep two and A2 gone low and leet who combined for almost 39 points in a game or rather 33 points a game Cory have found their way to just 13 and theres a bucket for Brandon cumings his first field goal four in the ball game but another example of how beneficial it can be for Pittsburgh to get their guards into the paint Y and again go to score dont go to pass the basketball only pass it when they take away your opportunity boy in traffic constant toosi he showing something tonight hes got eight played 44 minutes the other day Cory told you the 17 rebounds and only one of those offensive rebounds so he was doing a tremendous job cleaning up the defensive glass and theres a back door conversion to Zack Austin for his second field goal and both teams are now going inside and getting the shots that they need to get back to three again heres Roper digging in on Cummings and cant finish it slapped around and theres Nikita inside again constant owski trying to find something Davis finally Burrows down and wheels on Austin Up and Under missed it lot of work there great effort better defensive play and that was another missed opportunity an easy layup for Tay Davis he just doesnt get a chance to take advantage of Applause Music it low Runner with a left hand and Roper couldnt control it new 20 for pit out of the corner too strong with the three third try is good there you go youre jayen low see it go down continue to get offensive rebounds continue to get opportunities cutting into a one spatters into his own hands gets the floer to go coach if youre coaching ish Lega and you watch him make plays like that what could be his last game what are you talking to him about moving forward just get to the basket in the paint like as you said from the beginning and get some easy shots dont keep getting wrong threes tough threes turned over five Notre name tell you what the Irish have been completely say I know youre asking me cuz youre not going to ask him anything about the state of North Carolina no thats not quite but I would say it has something to do with the Queen B or would I be wrong by be wrong okay then go ahead you you give me the answer city was founded in 1768 in honor of Queen Charlotte of mecklinburg stets she was the wife of King George II nobody knows that nobody out there listening wants to know that lets lets talk some basketball all right just thought Id get you guys a little history along the way well lets say that Charlotte is now the new home of the ACC which of course Greensboro has been the home of the ACC forever and now moving to Charlotte two seasons ago thats it and and now this is the new home of the ACC and to be completely honest despite what a Hall of Famer to my right might think this is the best city to have the ACC tournament I wouldnt disagree with that okay I like that I will say that the last time we were here six years ago was a phenomenal event oh 2019 absolutely you talking Zion coming back didnt finish the regular season but comes back and makes his return in the AC tournament goes on to win the MVP 2008 was really good too when it was here well the the real key its a direct flight from Syracuse good for always important for a retired coach of charter flights another shot violation I tell you pit is having theyre laboring at the offensive end the Panthers are shooting 36 in the half 308 for the game but what Jeff Cables team is doing is Cory theyre going to make it equally difficult for Notre Dame here they absolutely are noted aame is helping them with the turnovers 11 turnovers to this point of the game so they falling right into the hands of what the Panthers want to do but pit yet to be able to get over the top and take a lead with all the opportunities that theyve had Corin jump Hook and the Panthers are in front there it is that thats the thats the part getting over that hump taking a lead and now seeing if that can allow you to build some momentum for the remainder of this second half with 14 minutes to go cam Corin has put pit in front for the first time today now heres Burton on the attack and Notre Dame goes right back in front and thats the Marcus Co that weve known to grow in love and is an all ACC performer this year yeah he he gets to the basket or gets the pullup thats where hes at his Music best Leed trying to wait on somebody to come free yes now Brandon Cummings against a Locka but right into traffic and a kick back Austin a triple Zach Austin hes got eight now pair of Threes in the game for the senior from Winston Salem then we talked about how hard it was to score by start knocking down shots kesn out of a double team constan owski for Burtons three too strong they crash the glass and last touched by pit Music well this is the thing with Marcus bur he is strong when he gets there he just there he has room though the big guy cant come over and affect the play he keeps him off with his left hand theyre not going to call that a lot of contact all the way in but he finishes it pretty good match up air cor its a great match up and is Leed has taken the challenge of going against the accs leading score in this game Burton has really never been able to get going thus far only four points for him on his two field goals kesn right back for sir muhammd second second field goal for sir muhamad who played at Myers Parker here in Charlotte a year ago injured early in the campaign for Micah Shrewsberry comes in averaging three points and two rebounds a Applause game dig down for leged over Burton with the turnaround good box out by Alo on Diaz Graham yeah give Burton a lot of credit standing his ground against a bigger offensive player but keeping Leed away from his sweet spot that ball got kicked away turned over again by the Irish here goes jayen low through the gear boox and a foul on Applause Davis thatll be the third on tay Davis its the second of the half on Notre Dame and well the one thing that should never happen as the basketball gets to the opposite side on underneath out of bounds but kesn finding sir muhamd who gets relocates right to the perfect spot to get the easy bucket to tie this game at 35 so you saw the foul on Davis his third free throw by low is good now sir mohamd from Charlotte whos still on the floor here for Notre Dame is the son of Nazi muhamad who played 23 years in the NBA Corp no that would not be correct I because 22 is the record and LeBron James and Vince Carter both hold that he won a title I know that no5 with San Antonio yeah but yeah he may be play 21 okay but not 23 okay of course won a national championship with Kentucky yes did Nazi muhammd 12 to shoot kesn against Theo six to shoot twopoint lead for pit Theo backs out on Austin long oh hes standing on the line thought was a long two they gave him credit for a three and it bound it away and heres lean but you talk about how good of a rebound oh what a steal of loo and finally Notre name came up with that and what happened there leg with a strong rebound but give Notre Dame credit for building that wall not allowing him to get to the basket and get an easy look end up getting a turnover off The Possession Applause Music so we get a foul and a timeout twopoint lead well Pittsburgh is scrapped and clawed pardon the pun for Panthers to get a twopoint lead here on Notre Dame with just ahead 11 minutes to play and we talked about this at the top and its worth noting the finality becomes a thing Jim the later in the game and it really becomes a thing doesnt it well and also its such a physical iCal game eight free throws is all thats been shot in the game and its this is a physical battle here is Sir muhamad to and he threw it away to Marcus Burton Michael Shrewsberry begrudgingly goes to the table to pick up the ball you guys remember last year when Michael Shrewsberry talked to us about how he had to always calm himself down when his team would make plays that he didnt quite understand and he would he would rever back to the movie uh what was the the superhero movie with Will Smith but he would talk about youre doing great even though they werent doing well and they didnt rebound well on that possession allowing Cameron corn to come up with the offensive rebound and to put back an opportunity to push the lead out to five now cam Corns got all six of his points here in the second half guys thats the second time theyve come out of timeout and tried to run a play and turned it over and again what drives you more crazy coach doing that turning it over on the after a timeout or giving up the offensive rebound put back and impossible threepoint play theyre both bad theres no theres no good in either one of those two first Miss of the day at the line by either School fourpoint lead for the Panthers so Burton Davis conston tonski Cole certa and Sir mohamd on the floor now for Notre Dame and Marcus Burton only has two field goals today and a foul there on the drve and its on on Jaylen low thats his first and the second of the half against pit those two guys are doing a good job defensively theyre on each other theyre making it very difficult to do anything get a chance to see BR Shrewsberry of course Michael Shrewsberry son and Coach Michael Shrewsberry especially last year talked to you a lot about what it look like coaching your son but you fortunately for you you never had to lose Jimmy or buddy for a season how difficult is that had to have been on Coach shry its tough I mean it hurts hes their best shooter I mean it changes the Dynamics of how they play and you know theyve done a pretty good job trying to adjust to it but its still thats a tough loss six for Burton its a twopoint game Corin against constant owski low on the bounce back and scores cam Corin whos averaged 142 points in his last two games is warming up here in the second half all eight of his points thats great twoman basketball with both cam corn and Zen low and recognizing where The Sweet Spot will be for cam corn Jay low putting the basketball in the right spot help his teammate be successful there goes Burton on the drive and score strong thats strong physical tough basketball move but what he does so well is he leans in before as he starts his leap to get into the body of the defender so when the defender tries Tri to jump in the ni it just lifts him up even more allowing him to be the only person in the air at the rim and heres a turnover and Burton in the open floor with low to beat couldnt finish it great job defensively by low getting back and staying vertical and denying that opportunity without foul and going to get a foul off the ball and its going to be on constant tski who was the guy on the ground so watch Marcus Burton as he goes to the basket he launches into the defender so therefore when Cameron K who is bigger stronger when he jumps he lifts Burton into the air allowing Burton to be the only one able to affect the shot and not allowing Corin to block his attempt twopoint game heres low back for Austin and a three and look at Burton go get it with Corin kind of hanging in the Music neighborhood weve seen much a much more Marcus Burton like second half from him after the conversation with Coach Shrewsberry walking off the court I believe he received the message Serta working against delich and I think we get a shove on amsol delich from Bosnia thatll be his first third on pit the panther coaches are incredibly excited about the progress the freshman delich at 21 years of age has made this year I mean averaging about 11 minutes in conference play averaging Four Points two rebounds but they feel like hes got an incredibly bright future as a perimeter player at Applause Music 68 Davis against Austin now rer nice drive and score for Julian roer hes got a half dozen now thats the way rer started the game getting down hill using a strong body to get into Defender bodies and finish at the rim and he does so there to tie it up at 41 yep so rer who had seven against Cs got six here on Tuesday against Applause pit almost punched that away tight quarters J trying to operate in such a tight space but give Jayo a lot of credit keeping his head up but keeping that dribble alive allowing Jorge has gram to be able to get the easy layup and Jorge doesnt do a lot of his work inside the paint WD nope a rare basket right around the iron and heres Burton now trying to use the constant zosi screen just creates more traffic Marcus kind of sizing up leot there yeah but leot was up to the challenge Marcus actually gave the basketball away on that possession sort of the shot fake theres Roper and it hit the side of the glass and thats a shot clock violation and roer explaining to Ser you got to swing that one immediately make that one more pass to the corner and he would had a much better look instead body says no you rather be in one of those top four I disagree because 89 you know who youre playing your first two opponents but youve gotten a game under your belt before you have to come in and take on the number one team in the country and the number one seed in the tournament and you want to have momentum playing against the Blue Devil well as an Old Coach I would not want to be in that position okay well youve been there number two before and it didnt work out well for you so Im sure why usually good when you play the number one team in the country not in the league in the country okay they are that how many times you beaten that one team in the country all together in your whole career your whole career seven years four times okay and you remember all four of those games dont you so its okay to be in that situation where you go beat the number one team in the country remember a couple you just like to disagree with me just to disagree with me well no but one of them was in Connecticut two guys got hurt so that I shouldnt even count that two of their best players were out K hone is listening out there hell be texting me saying well Scotty Burell didnt play in the game I said okay I think we beat him 3730 it was a horrible game B by the way on Davis is his fourth so we got to keep an eye on that for Notre Dames perspective with 635 and remember he got got the technical foul which added a foul in the first half he had to miss some time so its on constant owski its his for so both guys either way was four and it was Nikita who they finally measured it to and then the Miss three by leged so were still tied at 43 with six and change to go and the two teams in this game a combined six of 39 from three so coach its closer to 0400 its getting closer its getting closer should I tell you that they were combined 22 of 54 in their regular season finales yeah I mean when when crazy the way they shot it Saturday and now cant find it on Tuesday but also this is a Notre name team that played Four overtimes and again when you play a 60minute game you have multiple guys playing 50 minutes you Im sure you take off Saturday you practice Im forgive me you take off Sunday you practice Monday and then youre playing on on Tuesday its not a lot of recovery time that could have a lot to do with why theyre missing so far from oh theres the pull up by Burton too strong but look at the slap out by constant owski and Marcus could not save it before he fell into the lap of Mike Fairley over there at the Notre Dame bench so they will uh award it to pit here in a tie game its been about these guards for the for the most part though guys I mean well you mentioned coming into the game you got some high level scores in this one you talk about the back court alone for pit with Jayla low and ish Le and then you talk about the accs leading score and Marcus Burton on the other side so you got some high powerered offensive guards in this game but none have really been able to take over Burton with 10 points low with 13 but never none someone having a big game th far theres Davis trying to get noted aim back in front that got slapped around Bert or no it was rer that challenged and heres Leed in transition quickly and hell feed low Little Euro and scoop for the lead smart play by low not settling for the three on that position and getting to the basket getting the easy layup well the 640 for 40 is even a little bit deceptive because they arent even close its not that theyre missing theyre not even close they had two or three air bars thats what they have to do against the basket thats what you do Davis tried to create a SE and then just threw it away nothing right uhoh Austin missed the dunk thats two yeah but the turnover happened right in front of michah Shrewsberry he was beside himself slamming on the table watching Tay Davis just hand the basketball to the Panther and constant owski and a foul on corin will be his second thats the fourth on pit so you see now number the bottom of the screen possession arrow belongs to pit you see the number of Team fouls five for Notre Dame four for pit and with 428 to go here its going to be interesting we see Zach Austin with the missed lob attempt in the first half and he absolutely has the bounce but came up short on that one getting it stuck on the top of the rim two missed opportunities for Zack Austin in the air which he normally take care of business on those and as a coach thats what you think about after the game you think about Miss dunks Notre Dame thought Notre Dames going to get the ball pit thought it was theirs Jeff C actually was out in the court like he was playing and our officials are going to come together on that one there they go Theyre going to change it you got it right thats all you want to do I love Tommy morsy coming over letting Tony Henderson know he had a good look at it it did not get TI which means it should be Pittsburghs basketball thats great officiate yep twopoint lead for pit little Zone here trying to see what h no now theyre going back low against Burton kesn tried to help now we got a foul off the ball on Jeff pond with the call on Jr kzne I think Junior from South Ben red shirt at 67 his first and the reason I bring up the fouls pit third best free throw shooting team in the ACC cor coming in at Music 78 here is low out front will go inside four minutes thats even more reason for low to be looking to attack the basket weve seen him with the match up all day and he takes advantage of it in the first half you remember me saying when jayen low gets those opportunities against these bigger guys trying to guard him he has to attack doing it in the second half hes been successful 340 to go lead is to four now for the Applause Panthers Davis with 10 to shoot poo standing three got it Matt Alo with three triples for his nine points all three spot UPS thats what he can do and three of the four made threepoint field goals for his team in this game alako shooting 50 only Serta has hit a another three for not today low on the Drive Burton stole it hes got Davis with him Marcus Burton and followed by Applause rooper Julian roer stayed with it all the way absolutely you got to love the fact that roer did not conceive that Burton would finish the layup sticks with it and gets the put back to give the Fighting Irish and the hokes some of the Hoke faithful have worked their way into JY Tech about a two and 1 half three hour drive from here I believe we could having quite a contingent of Hokies in the building this afternoon cam Corin a catch and score again eight second half or 10 now second half points on his fifth field goal coach thats the type of execution you want after a timeout right they get the ball right where they need to get it anything outside of 6 feet has not been good look at Tay Davis take Austin right to the basket and draw the Applause foul first on Austin fifth on Pitch our Star Stories for players that have been crushing it are brought to you by Crush Marcus Burton with 10 Jaylen low with 17 we highlighted this matchup to start the game neither of these guys are shooting the basketball extremely well however they both will have a instrumental part as to the success of their team whos able to win and whos not able to win a lot of will rest on the shoulders of these two point guards in Marcus Burtons case well call him a point guardar 6 and A2 eight in the game now for Tay Davis onepoint game it is 50 to 49 constant danowski way out to help defend low who misses on the scoop Burton saved it and I think were going to foul whistled on Corin itll be his third and thats the sixth on pit but Jeff C applauding jayen low because he likes that look he trusts his point guard getting in the paint making that shot now the Panthers going to go with some full cor pressure zoning it Applause up and here is roer into the front Applause court but they going to switch that match up there they dont want low having to guarte Davis get him off of now allowing Zack awon to switch off Burton with some screens to AO boy loo hit a big shot the other night late in the game heres the drive Marcus Burton misses constant tonosi cant come up with it they go to the dag Cummings had it foul from behind by Burton third on Burton seventh on noted a so one and one at the other end now with 96 seconds to play a lot of contact on that tip in attemp too but they havent been calling him much the whole game so I dont think theyre going to call him down the stretch here either the way hit 78 at the free throw line now as a team and cummings is two for two today hes 81 but you give the Panthers opportunity to put points on the board without having to earn it you foul you foul a very good free throw shooter 85 ft away from the basket and again coach as you mentioned often times when you miss those shots in close you often compound it with the foul trying to get the basketball back thats what happened with Burton and now if cuming is able to make this free throw you allow the Panthers to take the lead youre having so much trouble scoring you dont want to just let them go to the foul our seventh lead change all of them have been here in the second half onepoint lead for pit 90 seconds to go winner gets Carolina tomorrow in the second game of the second round and thats going to a foul on Corin and cam Corin draws his for cam Corin also took the worst of that Collision T Davis going to the rack strong so here is Davis with the Irish trailing Music one and the free throw good dont forget between games here in Charlotte Taylor tan bomb Luke Hancock Joel Barry my man booze shoot game strong over there too tell you what millionar million doll million dollar shoe game over there booze got on to low ones booze is eating snacks and drinking thats what hes doing over there I cant see Joels feet he hiding over there he must not have bought his best out today what we doing over there Joel oh hes got Jordan you know he I mean hes a Carolina guy he got to we Jordan this a prerequisite come in its the rattle of the three finally somebody knocked down a three time out I believed you at one because youre like a you know we call it the West wedia wedia wpia yeah so if you say it Im normally going go with but if if bimo text me then Im going to go with bimo its the second time a conference game has gone to four overtime thats where I made the okay got John madri our statistician here was the statistician in 198 n at the first four overtime game and a tap followed there ties the game at 54 we mentioned Kowski with only one offensive rebound the last time out was a big one there to tie the game sure does and here is low weaving in traffic left hand scoop is short punched out of bounds under two minutes they can go watch and see and hell stay with the Panthers and low will go to the Baseline Shrewsberry wants the officials to go review this everybody twirling the finger they want to review on this one but Tommy morsy is set he knows that it went off of pit and again he wants a review so he can set up an out of bounds play this is the thing I hate about this room but under 2 minutes you should absolutely go review this if theres any question whatsoever look at all the hands in the that is definitely a question coach no no question it wasnt even close Okay thats when it goes out of bounds who hit hit it who hit it yes who hit it who knocked it out of bounds its its whose ball is as we watch this okay look at this look at this right here right here Jim all right off corn who who touches that last who touches this last now the way the ball moves it looks like constant ovis right hand pushes it out now look at look at how we had to go through this in slow motion yeah to see that oh yeah that is an absolute go over and review you abely want to go see that to make sure you got its 338 seconds remaining in a tie ball game Im good with that Im just not good with them having a tough timeout timeout thats Ive never been good that so so heres the element where tie game you see another look at it and that shows you the ball changing trajectory after constant owski hit it okay so Kowski hits it there now you look at does Cam corins right hand hit it on the way out I dont believe it does it may it maybe doesnt but is it my question to you all is is that thing thats why the rule is in under two minutes you go over and look at it all right now Im going to be Switzerland here for a second I see his side too okay because I see where youre talking about the advantage of an extra time called time out Im not against whenever I hear coach ball underneath the basket 341 on the clock all right thats Tony Henderson with all the game management so you dont like the uncharged timeout unless he doesnt have any timeouts left and then he wants the uncharged timeout yeah that thats see see it only when its in his favor but the rule was put for this reason yeah I always had plenty of time out and subs and Subs here is low lots of Subs all right now 17 to shoot so we got about a 13second differential as we wind down the game and it tied to 54 Austin back for low sneaks Baseline he stepped out of bounds with 192 to go an a tie game and now if youre not to a who who just played a four overtime game on Saturday you dont want a shot to go up until the buzz is going off and you dont want it to be a step back three after holding the ball in here like this you would prefer to see Burton get into the paint a but area but looking to score not past the basketball seconds to go here Burton to his right pushes it up off the rim follows Davis and we get overtime in Charlotte and the now they want to see was this a goal tending and you can go over and review oh we got a foul foul been called on Applause Austin so now what will happen they will look to see if the foul occurs before expiration of the clock well so Tony Henderson will absolutely go watch that first to see if this foul was called if it occurred before the clock goes off and the foul would be on the tipet by Davis no foul but if the foul was called I dont know that you can take that away no you cant but there is no foul I dont think so this is the angle we need to see right here does the ball leave his head that happens before before the shot expires the shots up there Music for as physical as this game has been no no foul so two Applause shots and the clock is going to be reset on a Zach Austin foul with a half second to go I hate to see this game end at the free throw line if these free throws win it for no name especially how physical this game has been played I mean was there any contact it wasnt I dont think it was enough to make that call no at that time especially when the consequences of not making it is just go overtime and play additional 5 minutes Tate Davis with two shots and a half second left and theres the first one 5554 thats just not a good way to end I got it Applause and the second one is out and a half second low doesnt get the shot away and Notre Dame is going to advance
