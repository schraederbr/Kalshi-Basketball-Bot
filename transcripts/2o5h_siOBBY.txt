Player of the Year race right now tiger fans ready to Roar here we are underway the opening tip goes to Clemson they come in 112 one one in the conference North Carolina 10 and three after a victory on Tuesday at Pittsburgh johi Wiggins has that one inside for PJ Hall his first touch and hell draw the foul and hell be head of the line the ACC Player of the Year candidate hit for the first time the 610 senior averaging 21 points seven rebounds a game Elliot Kadota freshman with the first personal foul on the day OB you can see early Brad Brownell wanted their first possession to go at Armando Bott force him to defend PJ Hall on the Block there was three different opportunities to try to get the basketball in the hall and got to keep an eye on kdo he got in foul trouble early against Pittsburgh on Tuesday and hes a guy that they need on the floor for them to be successful yeah had seven Music before he fouled out talking about Hall against Miami in a game where Miami just ran away in the second half they virtually couldnt miss they hit 75 of their shots in the second 20 minutes and Brad Brownell hangs his hat on his defense so Im sure thats something that he spent a lot of time over the last couple days talking to his team about knowing how dangerous North Carolina can be on the offensive end and of course heres Davis in the corner his first shot on the way nothing but net for RJ coming in at 21 points per game the 6o senior noi thats about 6 minutes prior to the first basket that North Carolina scored against Pittsburgh last time out took them over six minutes to score this time they do it in the first 30 seconds Johson throws it away Harrison Ingram in transition he comes in averaging 13 points and seven rebounds a game for the tar Hills contact on the Baseline and an offensive foul Ian sheelin doing a great job sliding his feet staying in front of Ingram recognizing exactly where Ingram wants to get when you see Ingram stick out that right forearm thats going to be an automatic offensive foul shefin a big body 68 about 240 and its a big lineup for Clemson you think about chony Wiggins PJ Hall and sheon in the front Court youve got three guys 68 and up Wiggins off the fake Hall outside the three and he can hit that shot 40 Beyond The Arc heres Joe Gerard having a really fine season after leaving Syracuse wriggling free inside that wont drop you got two New York guys going at it right now of course RJ Davis Ark bishop steac and we know about Joe Gerard as the alltime leag score in the state of New Yorks history but we see a guy who is now up to 2005 points in his North Carolina career Armond bot getting great position against PJ Hall and PJ hall jumping getting that foul and as you mentioned fouled out in the game against Miami and important for PJ Hall to stay on the floor as well number one for him Bott a really difficult shot makes a lot of those he had 16 points in a victory over pit on Tuesday becoming the seventh player in Carolina history to score 2000 points hes had some extra time over some of the other guys on that a little extra time Ashs beside the scoring however the rebounding is legit number did that in four years so I put no as beside his rebounding all time at the University of North Carolina couple early turnovers here for the Tigers Ingram will kick it out heres Ryan from the corner yes sir he swishes a three Elliot CAU had his threes up well before the pass was made from Ingram to cormack Ry in the corner he knew that was great offensive execution Wiggins with a pull up pop yes nice Applause answer Chelsea Wiggins at 610 and a half you mention the size of this lineup for the Tigers they can be a handful too on the drive airborne and gets that one to go and one of the things youre going to see Hubert Davis is going to want to make sure he puts Joe Gerard in the action you know how dangerous Gerard is on the offensive end of the floor but youve got to make him defend as well boy thats a strong move by Chase Hunter six4 senior theyre really going to need him OB hes the key I believe Chase Hunter is the key for this season for the clemon Tigers and being in the elite of the ACC tigers have played their way into that classification should have made the tournament last year that was a serious snub as serious as it gets bot keeps on fighting and fighting and finally a whistle 1710 to go here in the first half and a foul against the Tigers and thats going to go against Ian shefin thatll be number one sheflin good opportunity to see Hubert Davis who has gone away from the zip up simply saying that coach Dean Smith Co coach gut they wore the sport coat hes going to wear the sport coat doesnt wear the tie say hes too active on the sideline to wear the tie but he does wear the sport Co we cant get away with that good clear look there by Ryan second effort into the corner for Ingram and he air mail that one another scrap for the ball inside the lane and a tie up possession arrow will keep it on this end of the floor North Carolina up by three opportunity see Brad Brownell who has to be right now the front runner for ACC coach of the year did a tremendous job in the nonconference scheduling as well as executing the game plan had the biggest win of any ACC team in the inaugural ACC SEC challenge when they went on the road and knocked off a ranked Alabama team Tigers still smarting after what they did last year they won 14 games in the ACC they finished third in the conference 23 victories and still did not get invited to the big dance sweet move there by Ryan inside for two it was the disrespect of the ACC that was last year the year before and is continuing this year but when you consider what the teams have done throughout the nonconference much better standings for this league looking forward to the NCAA tournament 3 and 12 months from now forgive me two and 12 months from now Li on top cant get that one to go the big fella got another clear look from threepoint land Kad around the back and Ingram will drive it difficult angle almost an impossible shot and here comes Gerard Joe Gerard averaging 16 points also leading Clemson in assists on a difficult drive hell take the hit and go to the line and thats the maturation of Joe Gerards game coming into college basketball spent four years at Syracuse he was a guy that was know more for his threepoint shooting but now you see him being able to go off the bounce and you see great ball movement from the heels cormack Ryan knocking down the corner three but Chase Hunter finding his way to

for your exs meal delivery kit what there goes 400 maybe not because when you cancel through the app theyll even try to get you a refund Down rocket money today anybody you talk to will describe Joe Gerard these days as very very comfortable he didnt have to change colors leaving Syracuse that was part part of it I think very very comfortable there but hes enjoying his time it got off to a choppy start but hes been really cooking and hes fit in very well with the pieces that BR already had here at Clemson you consider Chase Hunter being able to to play the point guard position but can go out and defend the opponents best offensive player on the perimeter and then when youve got a guy like PJ Hall in the center for your offense youre always going to have opportunities Im not sure that Joe jard played with a center or a post presence anywhere near like would he played with PJ hall right now while he was at Syracuse yeah hes still passing the ball so effectively as you mentioned but not strictly speaking the point guard its a great point and hell miss number one heres our super Tuesday basketball double header Antonio Reeves and number six Kentucky hosting Missouri in rup Arena at seven this one should be a battle of the big man Kyle filipowski number 14 Duke taking on Blake hinston and pit both games on ESPN and the out Ill be at the Duke Pittsburgh game alongside your former Syracuse Alum Jim baham so well be on the call together with Wes Durham at that one so looking forward to that as well nice threeman show there Davis inside drops in two more but do you see how RJ Davis is not solely relying on the jump shot hes become more of a guy that allows his teammates to create opportunities for him a great cut for a bucket Music there Gerard with a pullup sinks it 62 grad out of Glenn Falls New York came in number five all time in the ACC in threepoint makes but can hit the midrange jumper two yeah thats a tough bucket doing that over a great defender in SE tremble Davis gets a look for himself but cant bury the jump shot battle for it and its going to be out of play and itll go the other way thatll be Tiger Applause basketball North Carolina coming in very well prepared for the double team action RJ Davis does a great job cutting Amando bot turning and facing the trap easy delivery to Davis cutting down the lane Tony Henderson Lamar Simpson Ron gr our officials here today but is ACC tilt I love the guys Comm communication and just the the the nonverbal communication to make sure they got that call right which they got absolutely right on the out of bounds very subtle but great job by those guys on that out of bounds and here comes Davis Full Speed Ahead back out for Seth Trimble iss playing very well these days for Hubert Applause Davis dumping it downstairs Bott working strong cant get it good defense around the iron there for the Tigers small thing there Obie when youve got the two bigs on the floor bacock gets double team Jaylen Washington has to get to the front of that Rim even if he didnt get the basketball that would have been an offensive rebound and put back Dylan Hunter and Chase Hunter the brothers on the floor at the same time and heres Chase who cant stick it 13 to9 Carolina come on Davis wants to penetrate and kick he finds cormack Ryan thats not there hes only making 28 from threepoint L nice find Gerard on the drive swatted away by Bott it was a nice find from Chase Hunter and the right decision from Joe Gerard as he was run off the threepoint line however Amando Bott waiting with the glove on that one OB that was all Palm Jesus AR he was angry and he will hit the bench with 1352 to go here in the first half at Clemson Pax and woek 65 grad into the ball game now for Hubert Music Davis Dylan Hunter for Hall hes been pretty quiet so far and he misfires on a three yeah PJ got the first look of the game got to the free throw line knock down two but picked up an early foul so Brad Brownell doesnt want to risk him getting in foul Applause trouble Trimble on the penetration turns not there nice save there on the Baseline by wji but it goes back to CLS smart play by Hunter there tapping it back to PJ Hall to make sure they got Music possession Dylan Hunter to his brother getting that downstairs on the Move by Gody inside RJ Godfrey the 68 sophomore one of the better moves of the day his first bucket yeah well call RJ gfre strong but of course the son of a former Cowboy you know hes going to be strong on the Block Washington off the front iron you notice how I just forgot about all the other teams that Rand goffy played for though right like five others yeah wji driving it no followed up and in by Withers great job by with sticking with it not assuming that his teammate is going to finish on the break gets the easy bucket no Clemson Defender even in the pitcher with them on that Joe Gerard had stepped out hes getting ready to report back in now for the Tigers they come in number 16 North Carolina number eight in the pole oh thats a tough tough shot and hell be headed to the line Chase Hunter with the bucket and hes almost automatic at the foul line This Is Walk come hang out with the notorious do o because he described it perfectly when you say tough OB this is a tough bucket Chase Hunter attacking the rim the contact moves the basketball around the shot blocker and is able to finish thats a tough two right there and opportunity for three jayen Washington bodied up committed to personal Jase Hunter at 86 at the line now G him five points at the outset today and that tightens it up to a onepoint game and you see Brad Brownell actually getting PJ Hall out of the game again a conversation between the two of them as he takes them out and this is a game where PJ Hall might be a little too hyped up he may be a little too ansy early in this one theyre going to need him to calm down a little Davis can hit it the tip and itll be Clemson ball here with exactly 12 minutes to go in the half Gerard hitting the deck on the sideline but appears to be okay RJ gofy operating on the interior and then Jaylen Withers doing the same off the offensive board Carolina by

title number one Michigan number two Washington the final chapter and the stakes couldnt be higher the national champion ship Monday at 730 on ESPN here we go the college football playoff National Championship Monday on ESPN feels like the way it ought to be a number one again a number two that doesnt happen all the time unless youre DAV Sweeney and Nick Sabin I can tell you right now this was a great rivalry between those two coaches while the col football playoff was only four it will change next year of course we go to 12 teams but I can tell you from the 2019 to 20 Ian for 2016 to 2019 season it was great being a Clemson football fan and watching them go up against Alabama Clemson two of those three championships by the way love covering those teams and coming here to Clemson and Death Valley especially for night game oh my goodness you saw daa wearing a Shiner there I didnt realize the portal was that much of a fight tough in the portal you got to go you got to go to battle in the portal OB CL with a basketball and down by one try to grab a lead here Beetle nice speed underneath that was beautifully run and sheelin finished it great job by sheelin also getting Bott in the air and then finishing with the left hand trying to avoid the shot blocker so the Tigers surging in front thats going to be tapped away in Carolina will keep it great execution out of the timeout getting the basketball into the hands of Josh Beetle who turns the corner but Ian shefin finds the right position sealing Bott under the basket is able to finish with that left I think the big early story for the Tigers is they had the lead and PJ Hall one of the best players in the country hasnt played that much heres Bott with good strength underneath for the 611 grab you know we talk about the ACC Player of the Year race of course you can never forget about that guy Armond Bott has been a preseason AC play of the Year favorite the last two seasons oh great look can he finish the dunk as a foul instead Shi up to try and complete it no basket and and I agree with that OB there will be no basket Ron gr was but hes no they will look at it no forgive me they will not look at it but if shefin lets go of this basket hes going down hard and so as he goes he gets two hand push in the back by Withers if he does not hang on to the rim and affect that shot hes going to fall awkwardly so he wont have the opportunity for three Music points so shooting his second shot he comes in at 71 at the line had a 17 rebound game against pit very strong on the offensive glass pulled on 14 against the Citadel and nine of those were offensive rebounds he makes the pair and I got to I love the ACC referees Ron gr immediately looks over to us tells us exactly whats going on the nonverbal communication once again feels like were a part of this they say take care of the broadcast hey our guys do a great job does a great job on all angles and a whistle on the Baseline with 1045 left in the half and Clemson by one hell get Gerard for the personal that is number one on Joe this tiger team is a good offensive team Cory shooting 50 39 from three 75 at the line they average 82 points a game so you know at times they have only been known strictly as a defensive shutdown team thats not true of this team its not true at all this is a very good offensive team and you know what makes it even more impressive OB is the fact that theyve been doing the majority of it away from home so excited to see what they can do here on their own home floor with they havent played much this season Davis blocked by Godfrey that triggers the break tapped Away by Ingram they broke it up nicely yeah gerey held on to that one a little forgive me beetle held on to that one a little long could have gotten that to Godfrey a little earlier allowing him to be able to attack the basket but Gaffrey does the job defensively taking on the challenge of guarding one of the better perimeter players in the ACCC coming up with the block shot RJ averaging 21 a game PJ Hall 21 points a game going headtohead the two player of the year candidates here today had little John we got a couple of rjs and a PJ today we I believe the todays game is brought To Us by the letter J if we take it back to yes watched a lot of the same TV he came up the same way shot clock down to five Gerard needs to get it in the air toe to toe on Davis a good job there by sheff try to keep that one alive loose in mid Court how about his hustle all the way back to Mid Court to grab that and smart play to know that he didnt have to dive on the floor if he Dives on that he probably gets a travel or turns it over going into the back court recognizing no one else is coming at him going to reset the shot clock just under 10 to go in a half off of the missed shot look where Ian shefin starts this possession and then look where he ends up you cant ask for more hustle than that thats the guy that was in the mix under the basket getting out recovering that loose ball for his team and then drop a Applause Don Gerard thought there was a foul on the play quickly up for Ryan to get it inside no and again its shipin he hits the deck but he won the rebound and Dylan Hunter getting in there blocking what would have been a easy layup for Ingram tell you what one thing you cannot question is the tigers effort here to start this game see after all these years cuz you cant hack it anywhere else Chase hunter gets a 15footer and drops it in and Chase Hunter hesitated on that three ball got to his comfort zone raised up knocked down the Applause midrange bigot upset the screen back for Davis inside bot trying to hammer it home and it rolls home for two OB this is the most aggressive OB Armando Bott in quite a while he was very aggressive to start the season early and now you see hes starting to fight for more post post position getting involved in the offense more than weve seen him in quite some time six points so Applause Music far Dylan Hunter on the entry shot clock down to five Godfrey battling on Bott who shuts him down heres Gerard way downtown he cant hit it and Bott is there for the rebound I tell you what Godfrey had a much easier task when he had Withers on the Block because Armando bot put up a strong fight there in a great defensive possession B really commanding the ball too even on the high post here RJ trying to get free hell launch a long one that glances off the iron and its tipped out by Ryan its back over to the Tigers 801 left in and a half PJ Hall coming back on to the floor for the Tigers but as you mentioned theyve done the majority of their damage with him on the bench thats got to be an encouraging side for Brad ronell well hes only scored two points hes only played five minutes but back on the floor the AllAmerica candidate from nearby Spartanburg South Carolina Bo so how they refer to him here in Clemson Hall ameran like that you like that I cant take it as my own it was in the game notes youre an honest man Music no bayot again back off for Ingram hes a guy who can hit a threepointer for sure Kad on the feed I trying to get closer thats a nice little shot along that Baseline absolutely is and high doing a great job coming into the game being aggressive Hubert Davis playing now his fourth big throughout this game and that doesnt even include Harrison Ingram who is pretty much as strong as anybody on the floor I reaches in and commits the foul North Carolina by one Zaden hod checking in and as soon as he gets in the game he goes to work recognizing

great loss tremendous basketball star North Carolina wonderful radio broadcaster too this was really classy what Clemson did they have an empty seat there at the broadcast level for North Carolina put flowers there recognizing what a Class Act Eric mantros was he absolutely was just that a gentle giant OB every time I would walk into the dean no more even if it was a road game that I was calling for North Carolina and of course Eric montros and I battled way back in in the early 90s but I would always see him Id say hey whats up little fella he turned around and laugh and say whats up big guy it was our thing I absolutely miss it Im going to miss it every time I do a North Carolina game but but I can tell you that as a man that had a as a giant even had a bigger heart it was one of the best people you ever meet well cancer took him and you know he was so active when it came to Pediatric cancer not only as a player it started as a player of North Carolina touched him very deeply and continued throughout his life so a loss in so many ways and and so young 709 to go here in the first half and Clemson by one 22 21 Clemson eight out of nine at the line Carolina 0 for one I know its one of the things the Tigers were concerned about with the fouls even outs and again this is with PJ Hall on the bench for most of the first half so thats a great early sign for the Tigers but it shows a level of aggressiveness that the Tigers have played with to start this game now its been matched by North Carolina one of the reasons why we have a onepoint battle Armondo Bott that weve mentioned has been extremely aggressive in the post more so than what weve seen of him as of Music Applause Music Applause late kadoo on the dribble Ingram shot clock down to seven hell swing it and almost threw it away High battling for that and whistle with 643 to go Ill pick up another one thatll be his second in just a couple of minutes on the floor OB on Tuesday night Harrison Ingram started the game 0 for 10 didnt wait till late in the second half to be able to make his first shot he got a layup and then knocked down a three afterwards finished with seven points the first game that he did not have double figures this season for the tar Hills and in this game thus far 0 for three from the field and he looked passive on that possession with a smaller Defender guarding him oh with the rebound dribble down and hooks it in nothing passive about that big time rebound for PJ Hall who looks like maybe now hes settled in and ready to compete again not a big half yet but he has time he has four points b gets it out to Ingram and thatll rattle home a threepointer on the money and thats big for the confidence of Harris Ingram for him to be able to knock down a three especially in this first half to get his first points of the game all up top Chase Hunter gives it up here for Wiggins he sheflin really playing a strong first half for the Tigers hes put his stamp on it shot clock down to three thats off the iron so tied to Applause Music 24 Kad will lock it up there from way downtown it wont drop one and done DJ Hall amondo bacock continue to battle in the post a very physical Affair between these two PJ Hall looking over to the official Wiggins rebounded Away by yes who shuffling underneath two more but give PJ Hall credit he got a hand on that basketball first to tap it over to shefin whos picked up his eighth Point here in the first half thats his season average also averages 10 rebounds a game kick out for high in the corner no shein another rebound Wiggins handling the ball at 610 and A2 shiin downstairs and hell be back to the line well hes the featured guy in their offense right now he absolutely is OB and there was a miscommunication defensively by the tar Hills alond Bott was waiting on PJ Hall who had gone down in the back court Harrison Ingram not even recognizing that shefin cuts to the basket he gets a easy one really and draws the foul on high right there and Ian shefflin who has been as you mentioned the guy here in the first half for the Tigers and hes had some games where hes been the guy before weve talked about the nonconference and in the conference play the first game Ian shefan had a combined 31 rebounds in the two games between Alabama and Pitts and Pittsburgh so hes used to showing up in the big games for the Tigers B number three on high who has racked him up quickly number one goes so shefin with with nine and coming up more womens college basketball tomorrow afternoon 100 number one South Carolina taking on Mississippi State and its Angel ree in LSU against Old Miss we cap the afternoon on ESPN 2 with North Carolina number 16 odre Dame at South Music Bend and sheflin continues a Powerhouse first half and hes going to take a well earned rest here I tell you what though his energy didnt go down it all on the way to the bench and this crowd is loving what hes done here so far this afternoon huge Ovation for Ian shein checking out Ryan with a pull up got it a twopointer going back Ryan with a confident mid ra pullup good to see him confident offensive end got a good one early in that three ball in the corner now hes up to Music seven Chase Hunter trying to penetrate back off to his his brother Dylan hes denied on the Baseline the kick out here for Chase hunter in the corner thats one where you hey bro I think thats my dime right there you got to make that shot you have those conversations after the game though on the entry Washington nice touch off touch and we know he can shoot the basketball two games ago against Charleston Southerland career high 17 points and seven rebounds and now in his second season with the heels you can see his confidence starting to mount as well Hubert Davis trust him a lot more today got that size two Withers came over interrupted the play and knocked it out 340 to go and weve got a timeout here in the first half at Lil John Clemson 28 North Carolina 28 the star of the day thus far has been in sheflin PJ Hall gets a hand on it shefin comes up with another board is able to go with the putot back and were all squared away at 28 here at Little Music

up at the half whe check in on a terrific Big East battle in Jersey plus consider where Tennessee fits near the top of the SEC alol what have you seen from PJ Hall so far well hes going against Armando bot to the better bigs in the ACC foul trouble early but the GU putting up MVP numbers 20 points coming into this game shooting a high percentage from the flooor I think threepoint shooting though is going to be key right now Clemson 0 six from the threepoint line North Carolina doing a good job defending the three I think Chase Hs done a really good job on RJ Davis uh if youre going to lose to Carolina you cannot let RJ Davis beat you hes been absolutely terrific obviously the last five games 20 points a game H with his size has done a nice job of contesting him and basically closing out on balance really fun start to a really good one in the ACC Music o has been entertaining so far Kevin thats for sure 2828 Hall with a Miss underneath weve had five ties and six lead changes as Fury said when we came on the air at the moment these are the two best teams in the conference and OB when you think about what these teams do Clemson of course a very good threepoint shooting team as you mentioned earlier but North Carolina has corm Ryan knocks down to three Carolina is third nationally coming into the game in free throw attempts they only have one free free throw attempt thus far in this game but still have a threepoint lead Ryan by the way with 10 now for the Tar Heels Hall gets the entry Powers into but you see how PJ Hall is able to take advantage of the other guys jayen Washington the sophomore Withers these guys arent the same challenge in the post that you have when Armando botts in the game and of course on Q Hubert Davis get big back to the scores table there he is magically appearing Ryan with a nice feed Washington took the bump and got it to go good body control there by jayen Washington so hes taken what 35 shots this season hes made 25 nice response from Washington and more importantly doing it attacking the basket he he dished out the contact with PJ Hall on that one and actually knocked PJ down Gerard his Defender went down he air mails it though out it goes and cormack Ryan is hurt he is grabbing at his ankle he is is writhing in pain on the floor here for North Music Carolina cor M Ryan who already missed a game this season with an ankle injury trying to tighten that shoe up to see what he can do but when youre in that type of pain most likely hes going to have to check out at least for a Music second so Carolina by three points and cormack Ryan has been the man offensively and coming up on Saturday next week Tigers will highlight ACC Network triple header coming away Boston College they take on BC right here the little John of 3 Eastern and number 142 coasting Georgia Tech with Miami and Virginia Tech rounding out the day at 700 eastern time cormack Ryan the 65 grad hobbling off and he was in a lot of pain in Music if you listen you may have heard on our quit side Mike he was screaming out in pain too he absolutely was and youre talking about a young mans Z off to a great start here in this game 10 points in 15 minutes in this first half for cormack Ryan as Armond bacot comes back in along with Withers and Ingram in the front court now Ryan 10 points two for four from threepoint land couple of rebounds three assists as well for North Carolina Ingram gets to the painted area hes going to draw that foul and head to the line Harrison Ingram makes Music 64 and draws the foul on Wiggins OB youll recognize the difference when we saw Ingram earlier posting up in the same scenario and he passed the ball end up being a turnover afterwards he knocked down a three and all of a sudden hes more confident trying to get into that mid post area trying to score and now only the second and third free throws in this game for a team that comes in averaging over 20 free throw attempts a game Ingram the Stanford transfer was formerly recruited by Roy Williams to come to North Carolina finally arriving this year hes out of Dallas Texas North Carolina on top by four but you look at the Battle inside between Bott and Hall its a different level when botts on the floor nice touch there by Chase Hunter using the window and like Chase Hunter attacking the basket putting that pressure on North Carolinas defense to try to keep him out of the paint he has Applause nine Withers gives it up Trimble in heavy traffic lost it no whistle on the play Gerard gives it up in transition North Carolina comes back defensively and shuts them down what a quick reaction byar here that was great Hands by RJ Davis sprinting back defensively you are awful and taking away a layup from Chase Hunter a nice kick ahead but you see Davis gets a hand on the basketball its not a popular no call here but it looked like a lot of basketball from our perspective looked like a good call yeah toide to get it in Gerard with the left hand no but a whistle 108 to play in the half tough sledding for Joe Gerard to get off a shot as hes foued by Ingram and weve seen Joe Gerard of course the Carolina Tar Hills are going to run him off the threepoint line but weve seen Gerard attacking the basket multiple times missed a free throw earlier in this game but were talking about a a 93 free throw shooter weve got three guys in this game shooting over 90 this year when you consider RJ Davis who leads the league Joe Gerard and Cormac Ryan whos back in the game shoots over 90 as well so good to see Cormac back on the floor and RJ Gody back on the floor now for the Tigers as PJ Hall will take a seat so weve yet to see two rjs and a PJ on the floor together were both jonesing for it we we got to make it happen come on Brad hu stuff we get real excited about North Carolinas made four of their last five shots as you mentioned corm Ryan back on the floor tied at Applause 34 bot out of the double shot clock to 10 RJ Davis no cont attack leaning in thrown away picked off by sheelin thats another example of what Seth Greenberg was talking about in studio Chase Hunter doing the job defensively we talked about he would be the key for Clemson success and hes doing it on both ends of the floor here thus far huh how long have you been tracking our cars value with carvana just like 7 months should we sell it we hold hold silver vans are going for more right now should we our low mileage is paying off you think we should oh depreciation is really heating up you Music think we just dipped 25 now on already sold to carvana go to carvana and track your cars value today North Carolina 34 Clemson 34 tigers and Brad brell taking a timeout to set up up a play here 38 12 seconds on the game clock and 24 to shoot it and this is where you want to be able to go to some of your better offensive sets that try to take a lead into the halftime locker room Clemson 12 out of 14 at the foul line North Carolina has rarely gotten there t Hills got a big scare when Ryan went down with an ankle injury but he was quick to get back in after some treatment thats a great sign tigers have it Gerard gives it up here for Wiggins then its around and out bov with a rebound and although Wiggins is a good threepoint shooter Im not sure if you want to go that early giving North Carolina so much time now Hubert Davis will go with the US itll lose a timeout to draw up what they will want to do to get the last shot of the half tigers by the way 0 for eight from the threepoint line two stories remain as unbeatens Collide for the title the Wolverines are are looking to finish the mission while the Huskies hope to write their perfect ending the Final Chapter to Crown a new playoff Champion number one Michigan number two Applause Washington May the best story Music win all right North Carolina theyve reset the clock at 193 with the basketball ball here and looking to take the lead going into the locker room OB on Tuesday night at Pittsburgh North Carolina was in the same scenario tied with the basketball going down to the last possession of the half they run a screen rescreen for RJ Davis on the left wing he knocks down a three North Carolina never trailed after that point they went into the locker room with a threepoint halftime lead they never Trail in the second half of that game be interesting to see Im sure Brad Brownell has scouted that because if I know it he has has to know it Im sure they scouted that action but itll be interesting to see what Hubert Davis does now knowing that Brad has seen that play our heels with a hot hand here down the stretch getting four their last five shots and Davis will check it in for the heels tied at Applause 34 and Kon is set it up taking his time the Freshman Bott poked away got to get a shot in the air down to three gadal with a bounce bacot going in strong and never got the shot up there blocked anyway so were going to be even at the break Clemson 34 North Carolina here in the second half Clemson with the basketball as we get started they 11 and two North Carolina 10 and three e f s o a t i g e r heres Joe Gerard straight on but off the back of the iron PJ Hall with a rebound Gerard with a second effort he misfires on that one too shefin beats everyone for the board as he did all through the first 20 minutes and lays it in and Ian shefin attacking the offensive glass with amond Bott having to deal with PJ Hall that means Harrison Ingram has to try to find a way to keep shefin off the glass and he has not been able to do that thus far shefin now at 12 points Thompson still hasnt made a three theyre 0 for 10 Bott too strong strong and you could so that that was something that Brad Brownell talked about at halftime actually Drew up a great play to get the three on the first possession Gerard just missed two good looks Chase Hunter around the back heres a three barely Nick the iron and thats often one of the things if you talk to your team about the fact fact that you havt made a three it may put it in their mind I dont know that Brad Brownell said that but often times they start depressing thinking okay Ive got to be the guy that goes out and knock one down I have a hard time believing it didnt come up from someones lips on the drive Ingram got bottle up underneath and here comes Gerard 3634 Clemson former Syracuse star really enjoying his time here at Clemson Hall with a difficult shot over Bott shein another rebound heres another long one that wont fall look at Ian sheff come on man my goodness come on man for Music Applause Applause two 3834 the Tigers Gad looking to make a move dumps it for Bott it bounces Applause Music free go B back to Gerard and a reach and a whistle a foul against the Tar Heels opening minutes of the second half and thatll go against Kad heres third Im not saying that Ian sheflin will be a NBA Hall of Famer but this is why you love college basketball look at this hustle multiple efforts offensive rebounding everything that you could ask in a game Ian shefflin is doing it hes not looking for credit hes not looking for highlights hes only looking for a win here in front of his home crowd hes doing a really smart thing too every time he makes a big play hes looking at the student section they dont need a lot of help to get Roar in today but hes making sure theyre at a very high level oh you thought I thought he was looking at us oh Ill take back all that great stuff I just said about hes looking at the stud behind us took it right over my head because thats easy to do oh okay okay okay I get it now all right still been amazing here throughout this Music Applause Music game Davis hell draw the foul RJ had a real quiet first half only had four points came in averaging 21 a game and and fouled by Chase Hunter who picks up number one and it be if youll remember RJ made the first field goal of the game within 30 seconds for North Carolina so you think about the job Chase Hunter did defensively Ryan catches fires no another rebound for number four for the Tigers shefflin came in averaging 10 rebounds a game so hes a great rebounder hes added the offensive side today Hall on bacot this should be interesting spinning to his right but no and Manda Bas done a great job defensively on PJ Hall as well thats one of the things we got to make sure we highlight Withers lines it up cant sink it Bott takes the hit underneath with 1652 to go second half had Little John and Hall with number two and we talked about the energy and the engagement of this game from Armando Bob weve seen him more engag and I have the thought that maybe has something to do with the fact that hes playing against the guy that theyre talking about as the ACC player of the year but defensively Armando Bott has been spectacular here this afternoon maybe taking it a little personal I like that thats the way its supposed to be thats my ACCC OB thats when you were calling games 30 years ago when I was playing in this Applause level Kido open from three hell drive it instead and a whistle that was with six on the shot clock for North Music Carolina so Gerard with his second and thatll be two shots for Elliot kadu makes only 58 freshman from West Orange New Jersey fivestar Music recruits the foul line has been a real challenge for him but hell drop that one in our super Tuesday basketball double header coming way Antonio Reeves number six Kentucky hosting Missouri and then Kyle filipowski number 14 Duke taken on Blake Hinson and pit both games are on ESPN and the app North Carolina now just their fourth and fifth free throw attempts of this game but Clemson 0 of 12 from Beyond to threepoint Arc and if youre the Tigers you just got to continue to run good offense dont worry about that number sheflin in close but no loose ball comes back to Davis and here come the heels down by two Withers puts that one to the deck Ryan will kick Davis yes sir a Applause threepointer when you help off of RJ Davis youve got to find a way to recover quickly otherwise he will burn you from well beyond the threepoint line RJ with seven bot tying up in the paint

will argue the point know whos really the best team in the conference right now North Carolina and Clemson though they have the net Advantage here yeah so when we come in saying weve got the two best teams in the ACC playing today we we have numbers to support it these are called receipts OB we got receipts for it right now when you see the ACC net rankings North Carolina and Clemson and Duke to that point have all played very very challenging schedules to this point but North Carolina and Clemson have done better against those gutter teams this is great early news for the Tigers who were snubbed in the NCAA tournament selection last year and they never should have been Hunter was shot clock down to five and lost at and back over to the tar Hills and thats five turnovers for the Tigers who are down by one Clemson still has been unable to hit a threepoint shot there 0 for 12 and yet right there with North Carolina but these teams seven and five turnovers respectively have both handled the basketball very well here for especially how physical this game has Applause Music Applause been Withers with a follow away shefin right in his face and Hall there to collect the rebound and Hall fortunate on that one Bott actually beat him to the rim got inside position the ball just bounced over botts hands for that offensive rebound Chase Hunter back for Hall three on the way makes Music 40 as far as threepointers there is a lid on it for the Tigers today Bon powering blocked by sheelin it comes free heres Ryan up top he cant sink it but whos trying to finish that one up with a thunderous dunk another opportunity here for Carolina Kad will drive it and kick it Bott is fouled in the lane to many chances here for the heels winds up a foul against Clemson thatll go against Dylan Hunter were used to seeing North Carolina on the offense of glass the way that they were on that possession getting multiple opportunities you know and there one thing about when you renovate these beautiful Arenas is these highdef jumbotrons that show all the last plays that the fans will never agree that was actually a foul called against their team even though it was clearly a foul couldnt be more clear 1432 to go the second half so North Carolina to check it in to like Valen time out here Big C handing off for Davis a three he makes a lot of shots just like that but its been a hard day for him shooting it and that time its Dylan hunter in comparison to chase but still doing the job defensively PJ too strong Withers able to maintain the dribble crowd didnt like that either they thought he had given it up Bott doubled up and a jump possession a will keep it on this end and the officials are going to step in to make sure it doesnt get a little too nasty North Carolina by one Obie Ive been on the other side of that when youve got a smaller guard getting tied up with a bigger Center and the bigger Center tries to snatch the ball away Ive been the smaller guard who ends up on his back like Dylan Hunter does here there is nothing extracurricular there theres no reason for tensiones Im a great job by the officials making sure nothing happens from that but I love the energy that both these teams are playing Applause with Davis with a shot clock down a five North Carolina open for the last four shooting it Ingram heaves it big rebound keeping that alive trible heres Ryan to the paints some contact lost it itll go the other way Clemson fortunate another offensive rebound Seth Trimble coming up with that basketball but Joe Gerard does a great job sliding his feet and an unforced error by corm Ryan trying to attack the basket on that possession Tigers who gone four and A2 minutes without a point cant buy a three today at least not yet and this is where you go inside to Godfrey give him an opportunity Wiggins finally ends the grouts their first triple of the day they are one for Applause Music Applause 15 Davis for Ingram thats an answer thats thats experience the guys who have answered the Bell was cormack Ryan in the first half for North Carolina and this time Harrison Ingram stepping up against a huge shot to quiet this rowdy Applause crowd jide gives up the dribble Wiggins Godfrey shot clock to three and whistle North Carolina upset with a call 1235 to go and for bot number two and Armando bot going over having a a conversation with Tony Henderson just letting him know hey the same thing is going on on the other end of the floor when Im battling for position but I love the relationship between the players and the officials where where you can have that conversation Tony Henderson listening to Amando Bott allowing him to express himself but yet no further penalty other than the common F PJ Hall will had a long conversation before the second half get underway with the official Lamar Simpson about armbar and an explanation on that they went back and forth its just a good conversation Wiggins with a little jump shot but cant stick it and Ingram collects it on the Baseline Carolina by one well see if RJ gets cooking now for the Tar Heels gives it up here for Trimble on the spin and a Music whistle as Gerard went down and hell pick up the foul thatll be his third Seth tremble does not extend the left arm he keeps it in so therefore thats going to be a good call if that left arm does extend away from his shoulder then Joe Gerard gets that foul but otherwise its going to be the third on Gerard hes one for nine all for four from three Gerard today and three fouls Ingram pounding his way inside shein made it very tough on him again and out it goes back over to Applause Clemson the first made threepointer for the Tigers all afternoon long chony wiggin stepping up knocking down the big one however Harrison

lead here thus far kind of expect that both of those guys getting their a ARP cards this week so just under 12 minutes to go 424 41 North Carolina you know I just turned 50 Im actually starting to get those emails Gott used to Music them Godfrey wants to get to that painted area with a little hook hair mailed going to be tipped out 9 seconds on the shot clock and never got to the iron but I believe thats an advantage for the Tigers and Brad Brownell clearly thinks the same when he comes out of his timeout wanting to get Godfrey an opportunity there but great job defensively by Ingram standing up to the stronger gy Wiggins on Ryan now take advantage of that Heights rebounded Away by Carolina neither team shooting the lights out North Carolina one for their last seven Clemson on the day one for 15 from threepoint L Washington handing off for Davis talk about a guy who can get rolling and that one just flipped out of play and another turnover allowing Clemson the opportunity to jump in front again I thought I had a look Obie I thought I had a look and Im sitting directly at Center Court which half court may be a touch out of my range now at 50 Perhaps Perhaps but I was still deciding whether I was going to shoot to the right basket or to the left theres no Advantage either way for me so I if I got it I would have just thrown it back to RJ I hear you you take the dime yes I absolutely Music will Dylan Hunter sheflin handing off for Chase Hunter no Bott on the floor PJ Hall wants the basketball inside Hall getting in tights and a whistle there with 1055 to go but PJ was directing traffic trying to point to his guards where to throw the basketball so he can get it recognizing hes got jayen Wat Washington behind him picks up the offensive foul normally youre looking for two hands in the back number three on PJ Hall but I love r r now encouraging him once he gets to the sideline hey were going to need you come on stay with me three fouls hes going to sit down for a little while but I dont think hes going to be over there Applause long trible trying to pen Applause heres Davis again long one yes sir nothing but net from threepoint land RJ Davis continues to step up whenever they need him up to 10 points and double figures for him who just had his streak of 20 plus point games broken at Pittsburgh on Tuesday only had 15 in that one had scored over 20 eight straight games going into that sheflin the first half star for Clemson hooks in two continuing to play at a very high level today Clemson feels as though they have an advantage against whoever Ingram is guarding and when when shefin or garrey are on the floor Davis shortz one and done there another rebound for sheelin who has 14 points nine rebounds four Steals and three block shots today OB if it aint broke dont fix it give the ball back to sheflin allow him to go to work with Ingram behind him Gerard I think he forced that shot and Bott with the rebound and thats what Brad Brownell wanted on that possession Clemson unable to get into Applause it Ingram thought about it Tribble gives it up Ingram off the fake powering his way inside takes a nasty hit hell head to the line to shoot two Music yeah when your father is you know a NFL linebacker any hit that you take from his son should be nasty and this time Ingram attacking the basket but contact by RJ gy forcing him to earn those two at the free throw line his dad Randle playing for a bunch of teams 11 seasons in the NFL of Dallas Seattle Tennessee Washington and the Chargers womens college basketball coming your way its a very busy day and evening as it turns out on Sunday starting off with the number one team in the country South Carolina and Mississippi States Ingram that one rolls off North Carolina an excellent free throw shooting team struggling a little bit probably due to their lack of attempts Gerard nice give in the lane beautifully run for Hunter who drops in the bucket you know it gives CH Hunter a lot of credit but not standing on a threepoint line waiting cutting to the basket getting the Applause layup paon woic will fire one up there yes sir a threepointer we talked about the experience guys wji stepping up knocking down a huge three for his first points of the game tar Hills were last in the ACC in threepoint shooting last year its a big reason he came from Brown and also cormack Ryan slithering inside on the drive its Chase Hunter 820 to go bot with a bounce feed trembles the open shooter got it much improved threepoint shooter Seth Trimble put the work in this summer and knocks down now his first basket of the game and backto back reserves Off the Bench and wji and tremble extending the lead to four for the tar Hills Trimble with the foul as he hits Joe Gerard who set a very cold shooting day but at the drop of a hat he can get very very hot Trimble with his first foul 802 to go North Carolina on top Music 5147 Chase Hunter the six4 senior from Atlanta Hall dumps it down

correctly Ian shein has been all over the place his hustle his energy his effort even though he doesnt get an offensive rebound for that possession hes the reason why they score and then of course hes the reason why they score again off offensive rebound flexing to the crowd Ian seelin has been all over the place here this afternoon along with those numbers four Steals and three block shots too so everywhere is right and we have to mention up though North Carolina top 5349 yeah this is the home ACC debut for the Tigers they played their first two ACC games on the road to start this season so its the first time this crowd at Little John seen them in a conference game angr cant connect wins it back shefin right there with him Kad on Gerard with a pullup pop Bott back inside two more now Armondo Bott with a double double of course were used to seeing him coming up with those I believe hes somewhere in the mid 7s now 75 oh there you go it doesnt get any more mid 70s than 75 does it it Chase Hunter little crossover yes that was sweet chase the senior brother Dylan younger brother of the Applause sophomore and kadoo too strong Im not sure thats the shot North Carolina was looking for not that Kad cant make that shot but on that possession you probably want to get the hands the ball in the hands of Bot who just got his first basket of the second half all sticking right with it on the second effort though PJ hall now up to eight points but its been a struggle for him to get going offensively give Bott a lot of credit for what hes done defensively on Hall here this afternoon under five and a Applause half Seth Trimble bayot on hall Hall going down and going to call that a blocking foul Armando Bott that is where he lives and got the basket hell be at the line and thats the reason why I was saying on the previous possession you want to give Armando Bott an opportunity if youre North Carolina because these are the results that you can see as PJ Hall tries to draw the offensive foul on that one unable to get the call and as he goes down its an easy layup for Bop Armondo looking for the threepoint play has 12 points 11 rebounds 80 at the line and connects and amondo who has passed Charles Scott in this game on the alltime scoring list now with 2016 points as fifth in program history oh yes oh it hung on the iron tantalizingly before dropping in he has 10 OB right now were having a flashback this is Dale Davis versus JR Reed were talking about late 80s you got two big men going at it it in the post with these respective teams bacot again they double up on him shipin came over there and deflected it Paul may have gotten a hand on it too Chase Hunter now an opportunity for Clemson to tie hell go for the twopointer thatll roll off the rim and a whistle with 4 and A2 minutes on the clock and Bott immediately looks at Hubert Davis and at Ron Gro and gives the them the approval yes that was a foul on me I did it does not argue the call is third PJ Hall heading for the bench and hes got four so Clemson to check it in threepoint Applause game Davis coming out to guard Hunter shiin spins in the lane bigot all over him great defense there are a lot of plays we can say that about Armando bot throughout this game he has done it all now his 12th rebound to go along with the block shots and the DME Davis to the other side of the iron to lay it in 60 55

contest here today thats it the tar Hills starting out their ACC schedule they had a home game on December 2nd against Florida State and then three straight on the road but if they win this one they

but I know this young man pretty well this is going to be motivation for him moving forward throughout this season and one things for certain every time he shows up hes going to give you the energy and effort necessary North Carolina did a great job on Hall and Gerard Hall 21 points a game Gerard 16 points a game and for long stretches of the game offensively North Carolina made them nonfactors and North Carolina is doing it in a different fashion than were used to seeing the tar Hills this is now the will be the fourth straight game where the tarel have held their opponents ACC opponents under 60 points if they dont get the 60 throughout this game so that North Carina doing it defensively where normally its an offensive exhibition when youre watching the tar Hills play they CAU 14 points 15 rebounds and a lot of really good defense today for the Tar Heels trying to get back in it with a three but I mean they had that stretch where they were old for 14 from 3 point distance the tigers that has not been helpful for them today to be outside their threepoint line North Carolina by 10 with a minute to go and Ive got to correct that number its the fourth straight under 70 dating back to last season ACC opponents they have held under 70 points Carolinas on a nice roll they really are come out of here with a victory as Ingram will missfire on the long one and Trimble firing that one off for Clemson so North Carolina will keep it with about 45 seconds to go but after those backtoback losses to Kentucky and Yukon they knocked off unbeaten Oklahoma first team to defeat Oklahoma so theyve already faced them Arkansas Tennessee Yukon Kentucky its been a brutal schedule on today going on the road and seconds away from knocking off the number 16 team of the country and
