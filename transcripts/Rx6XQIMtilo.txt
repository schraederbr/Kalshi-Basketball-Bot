tonight Wester we welcome you to game one of our ACC Network double header still to come tonight Florida State and Louisville from The Young Center but pit whos trying to maximize their fivepoint Victory the other night against Wake Forest backing it up with one of their own and Burton has just drawn his second foul Marcus Burton The Talented freshman averaging 15 points a game in League Play Dan 16 points overall now picks up his second foul 2 minutes and 17 seconds into the ball game game and that will bring Micah Shrewsberry bench into play early and he gets his son Braden fellow freshman from State College PA into the lineup and Michael Shrewsberry was less than pleased with that particular call heres Carrington thats a three from the front its long the rebound pulled away by IM who will down with Marcus Burton on the bench do most of the ball handling here for the Irish well hell do most of the ball handing because Shrewsberry is in there to shoot it J hands to eyes thats jayen low defending him they hand off and feder Rico switches surprise there tend to shoot heres kesn who lost it on the dribble Notre a will turn it over so without Burton on the floor IMS will be the Principal ball handler for the first year head coach of the Irish and now all of a sudden the challenges for his team are what here defensively Dan well I think the challenges are basically offensively because Burton create so much for them driving the ball to the basket and Himes just is not that kind of a driver so Notre Dame is going to have to get much better ball movement and theres Jaylen low whos kind of perfected this drive and scoop huh hey he really has weson since hes entered the starting lineup hes played very well and the Panthers have played very well four double figures of his last five and five of his last eight for the Freshman from Missouri City Texas Kevin ji on the pivot move against feder Rico feder Rico and its blocked by the big man you see no help given by pit theyre going to let feder Rico handle that match up oneonone theres low for feder Rico and hes fouled going to the basket Irish got the three from kesn but since then it feels like pit is starting to build some momentum here kesn the foul his first third on Notre name well pit certainly looks very smooth on offense that you just saw low go off the screen and score and now this time he goes off the screen and passes it to feder Rico and they really do a nice job getting the ball to feder Rico in those screen and roll situations the problem here is feder Rico is just an awful free throw shooter 42 is not good 22 of 53 after the Miss there you see Aus out ishmail leet the Junior from Prince Georges County Maryland has come into the ball game Federico missed them both score holds won feder Rico may be 40 on the year but hes under 30 an ACC play that is true Matt Zona is also checked in he replaces Kevin ja a little more scoring perhaps out of the post was Zona Davis against Henson all the way to the basket good hard drive for Tay Davis but again that Drive West occurs after a number of passes a lot of ball movement thats tough to guard three ball from the left Carrington and Im not sure thats what Jeff cable want pits been doing a good job moving the ball and getting good shots you can get that shot anytime in the shot clock you dont need to throw it up there that early kzne against leget trying to get Baseline looking for a shot and leg at the rebound of the Miss Panthers going to try and see if they can sort something in transition low again look at the scoop wouldnt go feder Rico slaps it out fresh 20 for pit good play by feder Rico but low he draws all the defensive help and nobodys able to walked out Lefty three rebounded by Shrewsberry and thats a shot the Panthers will take every time now you need to make him but thats a wide open shot off an offensive rebound out front his eyes its a good match up between shw bear and Carrington KES Davis whos got five here or four here early of their seven now with one to shoot out of the corner eyeses missed it knocked away in a fresh 20 Zona got his hand on that one again Wes we said it before your defense doesnt stop until you have the ball you got to rebound defensively and then a good job by feder reached in knocked it off kesn out of bounds it will go to the Panthers but Bob Carrington and Jaylen low have factored into the scoring here early Carringtons got four Lowes got the other field goal were underway tonight at the the Oakland Zoo greatness is a feeling a moment you can never get enough when you do do a doll days good food tastes better with the dollar Daisy a doll do a dollar everything tastes better with the dollar Daisy when you have a history of greatness the real challenge

free with turbo taxfree addition roughly 37 of taxpayers qualify form 1040 and limited credits only see how at turbotaxcom thats me onepoint lead for Notre Dame you see Bob Carrington of course and hes part of this equation for pit Dan its you know when you get this far halfway into the ACC season you get some personality characteristics of these teams right well for pit its 40 plus combined from two guys look at the big wins at Louisville at Duke and certainly the other night against Wake Forest 40 or more Dan theyre three and0 when two players combin for that and interestingly enough Wes theres a number of different players on there the only one who repeats is Blake Hinson so the Panthers have a lot of weapons but they have to make shots Wes theyre 0 for four from threepoint range to start the game and when they have struggled this year they have struggled shooting the ball so with Burton on the bench and the two fouls 2 minutes and 17 seconds into the ball game lets see how Notre Dame sizes up pit here also our first look at Julian roer the second wheres number one for the iris theres low on the drive he got fouled or no foul called I thought for a moment that low was going to be whistled instead rer crashed into the cheerleaders and Notre names got it with their tough defense again Notre Dame is one of the top defensive teams in the conference yep and theyve got some magic numbers about who they are as a basketball team in ACC Play heres Zona knocking down the three ninth triple of the year for Matt Zona 11 of his 16 field goal attempts coming into the night were threes in the AC DC won he doesnt shoot a lot of them but he shoots a very high percentage sure does and the lead is four heres will jeffris the hero the other night missing the long three out front to start well he was the hero the other night but not with his threepoint shooting again an early three by the Panthers and sometimes that defense by Notre Dame they force you to do that yep heres rooper left side for Davis and a foul off the ball I believe is going to going to be tagged to ishma leet and it is itll be his first first on pick nice job by Zona to recognize that he has a mismatch and heres Zona he sets the screen and steps out this is the classic pick and pop situation and again zonas a guy doesnt shoot a lot of him but he makes a very high percentage timeses heres Shrewsberry and Zona leg it gambled on it couldnt come up with it now with seven to shoot I Henson now the switch times all the way through Scoops it up and scores tough shot for Logan Imes and thats his average in League Play two points and Notre Dames got their biggest lead theyve doubled the number on pit here early that is a really tough play and an important play cuz he had nowhere to go Shrewsberry team building a little confidence it feels like Dan with some of their conversions offensively here Leed trying to answer for the Panthers cannot Jeffers will slap it out the Notre Dame defense right at the moment is preventing pit from getting into the lane and Pits offense is dependent on guys getting into the lane and that ball got knocked away and Z of the recovery thats thats really a tough pass leg it for all the good he does for the Panthers hes a little guy its hard to throw it to him inside when all those big guys are around him head of the Circle Zona jeffris is there played some important minutes the other night 12 of them against Wake Forest last nine he was really an issue for Fon Reed Miss layup Hinson trying to get to the basket got stripped of it last Touch by Notre Dame so thatll get us to a break Notre Dame who saw Carrington knocked down a field goal early the Irish building a little confidence on offense here as this half moves along in Pittsburgh

door Music Dash just want to leave 12 hours of uninterrupted pain relief Music a you got to Frank it up Frank it up Frank it up yeah oh oh its the perfect blend of flavor and heat I put that on Music everything 126 noted a Irish got to feel pretty good here for a team that comes in dead last in a ACC play at under 40 from the floor you see kind of how their threepoint shooting is improved in ACC play ahead of what they did in nonconference but Dan two of their five field goals from behind the line to help build this sixpoint lead well Wes while 34 isnt great its much better than 28 and Notre Dame actually scores 40 of its points from Beyond The Arc in ACC play and not only are they two for four bit pit is 0 for six from Beyond The Arc so the Notre Dame defense has done a great job pushing the Panthers out when we talk about the Panthers were talking about a team averaging 933 in their last four games and theyve been 45 or more from the floor in three of their last four there goes Leed on the drive and ishma leet a quick score out of the timeout Wes if youre going to get out and prevent the three and contest the three then theyre ought to be room to drive and that time Leed found it yep Irish had been on a 7 nothing run prior to that drive there we saw the numbers for legot the other night against Wake Forest 22 points 4 threes N9 of 16 Burton back on the floor by the way with the two fouls now theres Roper inside kick out and the three away no good and dier mo Diaz Graham the rebound first time weve seen the one of the twins from tenar in the Canary Islands Carrington a soft two again thats a tough two West its contested he can make that shot but its early in the shot clock you got to move the defense because moving the defense gives you a better chance than an offensive rebound if you miss Burton out front heres Carrie Booth young freshman Talent top 100 player a year ago from Colorado and a Fall Away by Shrewsberry and a foul on bug carington will be his first Jeff capable of course last season the ACC Coach of the Year got to the second round of the tournament the other night career win 250 he is one under 500 here at pit and that ball got red out by lean into the lap of Tim O whos on Jeff sta nice catch by nice catch by Tim I mean ball was right on top of him and he didnt Flinch were fortunate Tim didnt put the ball back in play before the whistle um the 8889 I mentioned it for only this day they won 24 games last year theyre 13 and8 this year nobody knows how hard that job was that he took over I mean people thought it was hard it was harder and he deserves a mountain of credit for the building well theres no question Wes there was rock bottom and then theres where they were and that I think Carrington just picked up his second foul yep two in a row on Bob Carrington is the third on pit and with 10 27 to play now they going to give free throws here to Burton they are and Jeff Cape was very upset about that saying that Burton was passing the ball oh it that looked like he was shooting it to me you know Burton for a freshman hes really smart he felt that contact and threw the ball up in the air 15th best free throw shooter in the ACC rattles the first one so Jeff capable was upset but I think the officials were right on that one yeah and they were right on that one because Burton is one clever fellow yep you got one of the two and now hes coming out of the game Wes this is nice job by Micah Shrewsberry to get him in try to get things into a little bit of a flow but then get him out personality though is the Games personality is playing to noted As favor yes it is Irish and Michael Shrewsberry told us earlier in the year I W see if theyll get in the mud with us and thats where Notre Dame likes to play right now as this particular team for Michel Shrewsberry now pit has had no success Wes when theyve stood out on the perimeter and fired away theres Austin defending IM trying to work off the Carri boo screen nice pass inside boo traveled with it Carri boo going to be an excellent player but some of this is a little too fast and like a fast ball up below the chin at times but load made a really nice did a really nice job defensively just getting there hes surprised boo Bruth Applause wall fivepoint lead for Notre Dame look at Henson dig in throw it up on the glass wouldnt go kesn the rebound hon thought he was foul he thought he was foul but thats his first shot West Shrewsberry on the drive Diaz Graham tries to close him down and then Shrewsberry lost it itll be turned over to pit so some unforced errors here by Notre Dame now giving Pittsburgh an opportunity with n and a half to go and this is is a problem that Notre Dame has had all year with the turnovers and heres Hinson hes getting driving into the lane looked like they just break their hand down on the ball that was Applause Roper leg it Diaz Graham Le working around the screen fights all the way in guo for three rattled out now Wes that was pretty good ball movement the defense had to drop all the way down nice pass out by leg it they they missed a wide open shot you have to make that shot at a high percentage if youre the panther pit is 0 for seven from three Notre Dame is two for six on the Miss there by Booth pits only scored on one of their last 11 possessions Leed scoop and score wow Leed has been such a valuable guy off the bench for pit West especially over the last four or five games he generated rates a lot of offense tell you what between Im score and one by Le it weve seen two pretty good plays at the basket here in the first half threepoint game itams picked up on the dribble heres kesn against Isaac Austin or Zack Austin rather heres KES dribble it off his foot but it went right to Roper two to shoot heres Imes leaning in and it hit the rim and Hinson finally collects it thats good hands by hon and great defense by pit low off the screen Austin free ball too strong and Robber will let that go out of bounds thatll get us to a timeout substitutions coming for both teams when we continue from the Pete on a Saturday night look at ishmail leac old Dipsy Doo like boner back in the day back after Music this its bow time get fired up tonight because Bojangles has your dinner covered southbound scratch made not one of these but one of these thats more home

strength and stamina for life out here available at Tractor Supply Applause goodbye we want it all we want beards and lattes great oh we want to be invited great and not attend great we want to take the shortcut you lost and not be in danger reverse sadly we cant have it all except its Sport Clips where we check in with the pros in mens hair and totally check out with pure uninterrupted re relaxation Sport Clips its a game changer well this is a 1310 ball game just under 8 minutes to play in this first half and we talked about Marcus Burton being the leading freshman scorer in the league and Bub car Arington right there with him Dan and so far theyve got five total and four fouls well the interesting thing here Burton you can see coming back in the game as Carrington stays on the bench but both of these players Wes are extremely important to the offensive flow of their teams the other guy whos important for Jeff Cape was Blake Hinson and he has only attempted one shot tonight Hinson on the floor guo Diaz Graham ishma leet Jaylen low and Zack Austin meanwhile times is returned here is Marcus Burton again playing with the two fouls and the fallway two is cleanly through and thats really tough they like to run Burton off a couple of screens if you force a switch particularly against the Big Guy Burton is able to back him down and then step back with that little jump shot very nice play lead is back to five here for the Irish Notre Dame has won the last five and eight of the last nine against pit Henson working inside Lo lost it on the dribble against Davis turned over by the Panthers here I think you dont want to do if your pit is force it Hinson had an opportunity for three but that was a bad pass forced him to put the ball on the deck and try to drop Burton looping around top of the screen Davis Imes on the attack all the way into traffic hell scoop it up and score how many times has Logan Imes done that twice in this first half already great job getting inside looks like hes in trouble uses the rim to protect and here all of a sudden have a sevenpoint lead again to the opp Micah Shrewsberry went with this lineup the other night talking to us today about it allowed him to free up Marcus Burton from handling the ball Hinson tries to answer three2 strong pits now 0 for nine from behind the threepoint line and thats a shot youll take from Hinson every single time Burton sevenpoint lead here for the Irish look at Burton he doesnt have to worry about the ball here right IES is the guy hes going to set the offense and push it into formation here pesna five to shoot hell drive it against Austin whoa what a screen that was off the ball by ji cuz if Austin goes down you know it was a screen well he certainly didnt see it coming Burton didnt see that one either heres low for guo caught in score boy nice pass nice catch thats a basket that pit desperately needed Wes the Panthers a team as you mentioned that relies so heavily on the three theyre 0 for n and yet theyre only down five in an extremely lowscoring first half noted AES only committed four turnovers and of those turnovers pits only got two points so far thats also factoring into this fivepoint game with Davis times again will drive it to the basket and draw the contact from The Freshman Jaylen low looking from Missouri City Texas this what youre talking about with the screen wow now Austin Austins a big guy he may have embellished that a little bit but he never saw that screen and this is really again you get the screen and you have to get a little bit more pressure on the ball handler than that because low had a lot of time to survey the field and he made a nice pass fed Rico back on the floor for the Panthers to replace G mod Diaz gram heres J now with Federico and the jump H good for Kevin JN just a 33 field goal Shooter had no points the other night at Virginia four against Boston College last Saturday he had taken 11 shots from the floor Dan and produced nine points in his previous five ahead of those leg at the push and Music one and the foul on Jr kesn will be his second second Irish player with two and thats four on Notre Dame well the one guy whos been able to get inside this defense has been legged and that was a very tough shot the defense collapses very effectively but the help had to come so even if he misses that feder Rico was in pretty good position for an offensive rebound this mle at the Rhode Island transfer 87 games for the Rams knocks the free throw down hes now pits leading scorer hes the 12th best free throw shooter in the AC seven for Le one of the things with lean W is hes a guy at Road Island he was used to starting games and hes provided a very valuable weapon for pit coming off the bench Burton on the drive is Roper Burton keeps it for three and its spun out on him did everything but go in front court is low Carrington Trails three ball Applause away hit on The Bard for from behind the ark and thats a really nice job by the Panthers to get some transition going you dont have to play against that set Notre Dame defense if you get get something before they get down the court and get ready all of a sudden Panthers to within one Shrewsberry heres Burton Carrington playing with two shot away and the rebound for Henson remember Blake Henson scoreless and thrown away by low hes with the pit turnover problem with that pass was who he was throwing it to theres no sense throwing it to feder Rico in transition like that laer right hand push feder Rico the rebound ja is he can make a shot West when hes really close to the basket but thats a tough looking Applause shot low heres fed Rico Carrington another one out Applause front look out now look out Dan a Carrington hes made two in a row Weston coming in he shoots 25 from three in ACC play so thats a great sign for the Panthers if hes going to be hot from out there nine nothing run by pit and we get to foul off the ball thatll take us to a break the foul is on Roper itll be his first the fifth on the Irish but right now the Ball Game Belongs to baltimor bub Carrington Panthers in front a deuce when we continue from the

check in with the pros in mens hair and totally check out with pure uninterrupted relaxation Sport Clips its a game changer how many times have I felt this good let me c for you one 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 so how many times have I felt this Music good well the Panthers on a N9 nothing run to take a twopoint lead here on Notre Dame and Dan stop me if youve heard this before H but here goes pit again with like a bob Carrington ishmail Leed combination you see what they did the other night 46 24 for Carrington 22 for leet look whats going on here theyve got 17 of the 21 here in the first half legot is the guy that really got everything started West was the ability to get into the lane and Carrington has now knocked down a couple of Threes but remember Carrington is out there playing with two personal fouls and hes found himself matched up against Burton whos taking it to the basket but as you noted its not just two guys like every night the same two they can mix Henson in they can mix low in the game I mean its its amazing kind of how the processing occurs but if they get 40 combined from two guys in ACC play Dan hard to beat feder Rico here is Carrington back for Hinson a three and he is fouled by Tay Davis first on Davis six on noted aim with under three to go and Blake Henson a 66 free throw shooter well you dont go this deep into a game if youre Blake Hinson having only attempted two shots and not scoring any points unless youre drawing an awful lot of defensive attention and Dave is just a little bit overly aggressive right there first one from Hinson is too strong he is 60 92 now at the line and thats if youre Jeff capable youd like the guy gets to the free throw line 92 times to shoot it a little better than that and theres his first point of the night I will say you start digging in on some of his numbers hes shooting 41 from the floor in conference play 38 from three which is fifth best hes had nine games of 20 or more this year four of them in League Play Hes averaging over three threes a game made in the regular season and also in conference play and you see where he stands in power conferences he and Boogie Ellis the southern cow running the room you see oh by the way RJ Davis down there at the bottom from Carolina heres IMS on the drive its a threepoint Notre Dame lead Shrewsberry for the tie Braden shrew Bs 45th three of the year and weve been talking about Hinson and thats thats shrewsburys first field goal attempt of the game yep he averages 2 points s made threes in ACC play per game thats fourth best legot wants in on the fun spins it out feder Rico tried to keep it alive touched it last and Bill cumington going to award it to pit well shuberry is a guy whos in the game looking to shoot the three thats a great job to follow the dribbler and get to an open spot 70 of his field goal attempts in ACC play are from Beyond The Arc wow thats a huge number so its not a secret what hes out there to do Henson tried to throw it away low tried to get to it ims kind of did a nice job fronting him all the way to the corner so it will belong to Notre Dame well the Notre Dame defense has been very good well and its kind of what they have to be right yes absolutely theyre theyre last in the ACC in scoring but theyre number two in the ACC scoring defense so they have to turn this into a lowscoring battle there you get a look at it really do a nice job defending the three behind Virginia in terms of opponent scoring and this is I think what pit needs to do they need to take the ball and get out and go heres low back for feder Rico you see the Panthers have a wide open middle as well theres jayen low he tried to find a crease nice job by Davis to stay in front heres Henson with t to shoot look at the ball movement Jeffers heres leg firing into the traffic on the dribble hell skip for Henson in front of Shrewsberry at the bench he bangs it home but thats great ball movement sure is michah Shrewsberry looks at Davis like hey what are you doing but that ball movement was so good Davis went to help out and Henson is just a hard guy to help off on Panthers by three under a minute to go H whos had a couple of field goals in this first half on drives keev ji trying to back down feder Rico Roper with five to shoot I will be the man triple away and no good Henson had a shot at it J tried to save it but did into the pit bench and Tommy Morris he says it will belong here to the Irish and Jerry heers over to help out here and now will be reversed so it will go to the Panthers well theres a real Scramble for this basketball because Hinson cant control it and its clearly number 14 jot that knocks it out of bounds so pit who started the night missing their first nine threes have hit three of their last four and down about a 5sec differential as we go to the locker room here in our first half skip for Henson three ball again sure uhoh yeah that is an uhoh for Notre Dame thats an oh because when Henson gets hot he gets unbelievably hot yep sure does wow so Blake Henson waited around didnt he let everybody get comfortable then he said you know what Ill shoot this rock from out here back after this its bow time hey sweetie hey Mom H land at three any ideas for your first meal home B jles what you dont want my cooking well okay this holiday order your family favorites in the Bojangles app now that tastes like home its bow Music Music time Jason cable kind of providing a corner man there for Blake Henson whos knocked down a couple of Threes here and Dan youve said it pits move the ball wonderfully here in the recent moments well you move the ball watch the defense collapse everybody gets in the middle you cannot give Hinson that much room Davis has been trying to shade Hinson all night long not help out quite so much but that time he got a little too far away and Hinson made him pay for it 16 to3 Run for the Panthers here in the last 4 and a half they have scored six straight Wes but the job that Lega did getting into the lane drawing the defense after the ball movement its hard to drive into the Lane right at the first but if you move the ball and move the defense that creates driving lane 2822 ball game final 7 seconds for Burton playing with the two fouls and jeffris commits the foul out on the perimeter the redard Jr from Erie the his first five on the Panthers and thats why they put Jeffers in the game they were going to give that foul mhm so five on pit six on Notre Dame with 47 left to go dont forget Auto Owners Insurance halftime report Kelsey rig standing by with national champions Joel Barry Luke Hancock and Jim bahim boy what an interesting day weve had in this league Virginia Tech L at the half at Coral Gables Matthew cel 15 points 13 rebounds Miami a winner Virginia got 17 from Jake Groves Dan and a road win at Clemson Groves has had a couple of good games recently for Virginia and Virginias a team that if they shoot the ball well if a guy like Groves can score 17 then that makes them very very dangerous and uh Kelsey rigs will get you caught up on the three ball games underway at this hour Duke Carolina Georgia Tech NC State and Raleigh and of course thoughts on our first 20 minutes here tonight at pit coming up in 47 well now Marcus Burton remember Wes hes got two personal fouls and hes in the game to create offensively and what hes got to do is be careful that he does not commit a charge usually you can be careful on defense but when youre aggressive sometimes its hard to be careful on offense burtner Shrewsberry here right I would say so yes inbounds are going to La for Davis and threw it away did he ever touch it if he did 16 came off I I didnt see anybody touch it did he touch it must have because theyre taking the ball in bounds over there Tommy Morris is saying Tommy Morris hes asking Bill Covington Jr did you get a touch yeah and Jerry heers going to go to the monitor here can they look at that well they can if its a timers error and if you started to clock incorrectly then that comes the timer err its going to go back to 47 and they nobody ever touched it and the clock started so what they can review that not as an out of bounds play but as a timer error heres Carrington three at the horn is an air ball and pits going to take a sixpoint lead to the locker room Notre Dame kind of started this ball game with the style of fight they could win Dan what happened though pit went on a 16 toot on the floor for Notre Dame and here is Burton on the drive and hell skip it for Imes back for Davis T Davis all the way to the basket good strong move hes got six what great ball movement again the lane is totally open and that allows after that ball movement Ro Dame to drive to the basket Davis had a double double 10 points 10 rebounds and their win at Georgia Tech and theres a pit turnover here is Burton trying to beat low does Jaylen low the foul before the shot and low second first of the half on Panthers but Davis has a wide open path to the basket because you see feder Rico is recovering from helping out on an earlier play and cant get back and here jayen low reaches in now this is interesting Carrington started out guarding Burton but Carrington cant guard him now cuz hes got those two fou there goes Burton and one thats who he is right there in a nutshell Thats The Power of Marcus Burton driving ding to the basket feder Rico whos a foot taller draws the foul he just does a great job getting P low and taking the ball right to feder Rico he gets so close to him that feder Rico cant use that size and Wes thats what Notre Dames offense was missing in the first half yep three in the half six in the ball game Michel Shrewsberry has got his rookie up and rolling his team to within one after five in a row to start the second half Carrington trying to find a spot just below the foul line and he gets the front rim roll double figures for buob Carrington hes got 12 now on his fourth field goal and thats his spot he likes to get in there he likes the physical contact hell make almost all of those shots hton again s on the attack Music Applause through tend to shoot pesi back for Burton from the te in pit wow yes sir Marcus Burton has 6 and a half nine in the game and were tied at 30 weve talked about his Improvement in his threepoint shooting during conference play but that was a deep one heres Austin trying to answer and does how about Zach Austin just his 17th three of the Year Dan what Wes what are we going to have here in the second half nobody could make a shot in the first half and now theyre going down yep everybodys lining up two minutes gone Panthers back in front Burton on the drive challenge couldnt finish it PTO Rico the deflection and the rebound low for hson you know where this is going and a foul on Imes first on Logan Imes first on the Irish in the second half this is situation where Burton really is standing on the te in pit that is a deep shot and this is just a nice play you draw the defense you kick it out and Austin you know he does not a high volume threepoint shooter but he shoots it pretty well percentage wise heres Henson how about another 10 for Henson his third three how about high volume and high per thats Hinson yes it is lead has grown to six on a pair of Threes Austin and Henson from behind the line Burton lot of dribbling trying to find something kesn had it poked away Austin touched it last tend to shoot for Notre Dame Hinson really does a good job Wes off the ball finding the ball and then just stepping into his shot you know thats where theyre going inbounds play the release and pose is also impressive yes absolutely from Blake Henson kesn and I think Austin bothered it Austin has a reputation as being a very fine Defender and he showed you there that reputation is welld deserved in the corner Austin drives through skip for Carrington open three wow four field goals in this second half for the Panthers and three triples in them theyve made Seven of their last nine from behind the line theyre doing a theyre doing a great job finding open guys after after driving the ball into the lane look at that West yep burton all the way in cant finish fto Rico the rebound Panthers looking for more can Carrington find a trailer Applause nope working against Davis penson against Imes here comes the double team hell slip it across bub all the way down Fall Away in front too strong just a little bit off balance thats a shot that he really likes and he makes a high Applause percentage and a whistling foul off the ball thats Carrington and thats three on Bob Carrington freshman from Baltimore three on pit Jeff Cap went out on the court he thought it was the time he thought hes 1 second ahead of heavy on the uh he thought that was the timeout media timeout here he was going out on the court to get his coaches together and they said hey come back for a men like Kevin Keats out there defensively yeah but unlike Kevin Jeff wasnt trying to play defense heres Burt around the top oh boy Austin got a hand in kesn was able to gather now heres Davis driving in on Henson hard shot and draws the foul Blake Henson just his first four on pit that now will get us to the timeout Jeff cables out hes ready for the coaches meeting Panthers going to go to the bench

Bren Shrewsberry draws the foul its his first its the second and we were talking last night this area has got such a proud basketball tradition Dan of which pit is a big part of wow this this town is a great Sports Town us and it its a great Sports town because it doesnt just love its Pro Sports it loves its college teams and the high school sports are a huge deal around here hon went to the floor look at the collision with Austin and kesn battling and Zack Austin going to be tagged with his first thats five in the half on pit of the seven fouls called in this front well now the Panthers theyre doing a great job making shots in this half but theyve gotten a little bit sloppy with the basketball y still protecting a fivepoint lead and Notre Dame again this is a Notre Dame team that struggles to score sometime but my Heavens they will fight you yep Zona here is Burton tried to go back to Zona hand in the passing Lane itll stay with Notre aame with 16 to shoot well and heres legga the Jack of all trades coming into the game for pit Carringtons got to go to the bench hes got three fouls low was having a really tough time guarding Burton so now leg going to take the job yep and heres Diaz Graham against Sona remember in the first half that was feder Rica for pit and what we get there foul off the ball on not to name I think kesn think youre right I didnt see what he did JR kzns third obviously something nefarious comington caught him yep illegal screen so that brings Julian Roper the second back onto the floor for the Irish to place J to replace JR kesn Applause thats an illegal screen you have to get stopped and you got to give your the guy youre screening room to change direction Diaz Graham High aring three look at the rebound inside and the stick back from isma lean well Wes what doesnt he do for the Panther yeah and the thing were starting to find out and its taken getting halfway into League Play to sort this for some schools pit cant win unless his leg is playing well yes I agree with that Shrewsberry three bounced out heres leg at the rebound and turning and burning for the transition chance the Euro to the basket and the foul is that on Burton uh well see I think so well see yep no its on uh eyes and Lega doing a great job on the offensive board there and Wes coming into this game he is leading rebound oh it is on Marcus BG he held up two fingers I thought but it was three so it is Burtons third Dan four on Notre Dame and heres Le it to shoot the two that thats a foul that Burton really needs to he needs to just get out of the way last that third foul is more important than two points and leg get a pretty good free throw shooter he may get the two points and the foul lead is nine on Isel leet free throw and when I say he plays well he doesnt have to score to play well legs one of these guys Dan you can just tell it looking at a statline 5 and A2 rebounds steel and a half two and a half assist I mean he does a lot of things that impacts Jeff Cables team theres no question about it but its his contributions become multiplied when he can score Zona had it blocked from behind he has Austin roll there and some friends heres low Gio fakes the hand to Austin instead leg it Baseline falling down delivers it to low Henson playing the angle Burton blocked that away it will stay with pit Carrie Booth will check in for Zona another look at what Pits doing defensively well weve been talking about Notre Dames defense West but pit has done a great job swarming the ball I mean they held Notre Dame to 22 points in the first half Austin who blocked that shots their leading shot Blocker on the year and an ACC play three ball low five for Jaylen low and a timeout for Micah Shrewsberry largest lead of the night now for Pittsburgh

of attention that he draws two guys go to Blake Hinson loow just steps back into the open area thats great ball Movement by pit and even though Blake Hinson wont get an assist or anything on that play low gets open because Hinson draws so much attention y pit eight of 20 from the floor or from behind the line I should say theyre four for five here in the second half remember they missed their first nine yeah they started out 0 for Nine West so that means they made eight their half 11 yep and I dont care how good you are as a defensive team if somebodys going to make threes at that rate it becomes a very difficult proposition and I thought it was interesting their average in the regular season is 93 they shoot 33 against the conference stand but they stay with it they dont get Absol deterred At All by misses a lot of dribbling Shrewsberry with seven to shoot Burton in the corner this is Davis it hit the side of the glass shot clock still ticking Shrewsberry it be a violation Wes that was a great observation about all the dribbling Notre Dame is not a team built around that much dribbling particularly if the dribbler is going to be anybody other than Burton just dribbling and their basketball coaches old and new who will tell you if it doesnt carry you somewhere dont do it wless youre going to the basket and a foul called underneath the goal unless youre going to the B get a dribbler thats what the defense wants the balls not moving you just have to guard one guy first foul of the night or second foul first one in the second half on Julian Roper fifth on Notre D 21 to shoot for the Panthers here is Henson against Davis and thats an offensive foul thats going to be on Diaz gr yep sure is GMA wont like like this but its a nice piece of officiating by Bill coming to Jr because it happens after the ball after the play is moved on hes moved on for the play but nonetheless a violation committed with the moving screen well Pits doing a good job moving without the ball but you got to get stopped if youre DZ Grand hes back on the floor out of the timeout threw it away this is the other part that Notre Dame is always concerned about they are dead last in the ACC turnover margin and Conference play and thats Burton is usually the guy who takes the ball in that situation and without Burton suddenly now theyre down Music 12 if you love to travel Capital One has

aite 8974 the great Buzz riddle coached a team that featured the legendary Billy Knight who was here tonight as part of the celebration Keith star also a terrific star on that team Hardon the pun 2009 Jamie Dix team went to the Elite 8 and you talk about a team now heres a look at the 74 team theres Billy Knight but he could go get you a double double and that 09 team how about levance fields and Dean Blair by the way we saw levance get up some shots during the shoot around today I got news for you Im taking levance fields in the pickup game well these were a couple of great teams West and that pit team of course in 7374 they lost in the Elite 8 to North Carolina State yep thats the game David Thompson Will fell over the shoulder of Phil Spence tripped over the shoulder of Phil of 68 Phil Spence he has gray of a three and another one on the board for the Panthers and we were talking about the proud basketball history of this city Dan that 74 team encapsulated that didnt it well they had nine local guys on that team Wes and high school basketball in this area from about the mid50s through the late 70s I mean there were tons and tons of great players yeah boy good to see Billy Knight man what a player that guy was of course in a long NBA career in front office work as well theres low at the foul line and saved by Diaz Graham to eyes thats really the first tough shot that pit has taken in a while yeah and Notre Dame that you cant put this much pressure on your defense youve got to put the ball in the basket Roper with 14 to shoot feels like Notre Dame is trying to keep the fuse here right because anything comes up empty theres three on the shot clock Booth misses the jumper saved by Austin and deflected to leer pit has been flammable here in the second half look at Ley driving through got it R out took a shot and here is Roper missed everything air ball on a three good Heavens crowd here at the Oakland Zoo will let him know in conference play roers only a 23 threepoint shooter so if youre the Panthers thats exactly one of the guys you want taking shot yep wrap around for Henson hell take roer down and draw the foul third on Julian roer the second six on on the Irish and Dan the offense for Jeff Cables been in high order here yeah it sure has been and again the defense goes with low and that leaves Diaz Graham all alone weve seen that time and time again you got to be careful about overh helping when the guys are making so many threes 24y old Blake Henson at the line first one good two out of four at the line is Henson hes got four and the half 11 in the game thats really a nice job by pit to find Henson at 68 down against the 63 Roper and just I mean then hes got 30 lbs on him as well thats really a tough matchup for rer and he now heads to the bench fifth best score in the ACC at 18 a game coming in hes averaging 162 in conference play which is eighth in the league order 15point lead under 10 to go Irish need to find find somebody to get hot here Burton the most likely of the candidates hes into traffic look at that play by Leed ishma Leed has been terrific Wes he stopped him he didnt go for the fake he maintained his feet and then when Himes finally does le the FL which he has to because hes going to get a 3se second violation he just swats the ball away and again were in a situation for Notre Dame where theres under 10 seconds left on the shot Applause clock kesn three ball misses and that is last touched Tommy morsy looking for help Jerry heer says itll stay with the Irish with a 39 shot clock Micah shrewbury thinks theres a reset deserved here it didnt hit the rim didnt hit the rim wow the M Davis has the cut right to the basket and then a push will be called on Austin Zack Austin second seven on the Panthers with 926 to go so one and one coming up here for kesn you understand Austin being aggressive because the Panthers aggressiv this on defense has really helped them and Wes theres not a lot of contact there but its contact that created an advantage by knocking kesn out of bounds and so by definition thats a foul free throw by kesn good you may have seen Austin step in had kesn missed Austin would or Austin would have stepped in early and kesn would have reset on the one and one Leed in and Austin out for pit during the exchange well you know if you commit a foul and then you violate the free throw that causes you to be taken out of the game thats whats known as a buzzer play you do that the buzzer sounds and out you come yeah so just come on out is that the deal yeah did you often find yourself in those spots where you well no usually I was sitting over there anyhow so you got to get in the game to be taken out 17 to shoot low ishmail oh nice play around kesn right back for Lows three nope Off the Mark now that ball didnt go in the basket West but leg it did a great job getting the play back on line J in traffic went for the block Diaz Graham swats it away draws the foul G Mo second thatll be eight on uh pit W keev to the line pit has gotten a really nice contribution from dear Moz gr tonight yeah ke AI one and Applause one free throw good by the way Michel Shrewsberry said something interesting Kevin J played for him in Penn State last year watch watch gam oaz Graham here Dan uh the soccer around here is pretty good is it that good how about that well if it was really good hed have bounced the ball up in the air stop just stop he kicked it out of bounds come on Jai hit both sides but back to the Shrewsberry statement about ji he he talked about kebba ja coming with him from Penn State right heres Diaz Graham three and he said part of kes role on this team at noted Dame will be to spread the gospel and what hes talking about is the culture yes the philosophies the processes the foundations so whether J scores rebounds yeah thats all important too or blocks a shot as he did there and help force a bad shot that could has the rebounds jas biggest addition to the Notre Dame team might be the fact that hes the messenger for what Shrewsberry ultimately wants in this and kevs got two more years left too thats you got to bring in guys like that West when youre trying to build your program now you know he doesnt give him a lot of offense on the inside heres Diaz Graham finds low look at the little Runner too strong there and Burton a heck of a job to make the play Davis at the other end and a foul will be called got Carrington I think its I think D gr well step aside here Timeout on the floor hit by 11 at the under Music eight

be there well there you go were going to put beheim upstairs in The Crows Nest and well get a look at filipowski and the Blue Devils who are double figures down in Chapel Hill in the second half but well this guy here has had a terrific year for John shot all part of our coverage Wednesday night starts at 7 on acc Network won you saw Carrington on the bench the official signal 25 but he wasnt signaling 25 he was signaling two plus five seven so the foul was on Carrington and that was his fourth yep hes got 15 tonight Hensons got 12 leet has 11 and Tay Davis has put together a 10point ball game its his third double figure game against the ACC tonight mat Wes and Notre Dame is battled back a little bit and theres federo off the Leed L they just lost Applause it and again leget saw that play develop West and made a perfect la ja working against fed Rico trying to back him down blocked by feder Rico recovered J blocked again feder Rico heres hson yep away it Applause is west great defense and then you push the ball up in Applause transition the lead has ballooned to 14 now five in a row heres Burton trying to answer cannot feder Rico the rebound well the last couple of possessions Notre Dame having a hard time getting it over fto Rico well I tell you what his Junior season starting to develop a little more confidence isnt he yes Le it into the traffic fallway is short PTO Rico tried to keep it alive ims out of there with it for the Irish Shrewsberry and Roper wait at the table Davis tried to get it to or f j tried to get it for Davis and threw it off the basket been a c tough tough couple of possessions for Kevin J thats Panthers again theyre spreading the court here looking for the mismatch inside oh hitson at the Block against the double team and draws the foul that going to be on Burton it is Marcus Burtons fourth Dan weve been talking about leot and his ability to see the court everybody goes after leot nobody picks up feder Rico feder Rico and when Blake Hinson West when hes cruising down the sideline like that in transition its a guarantee if nobody gets to him hes going to pull up and shoot that three free throw Applause good I when he started the dribble at the midcourt line you know how we say they step into a three he was already lining up the dribble he was he was pacing his dribble so he could step into that three yep and the lead is 16 and Hinson by the way now has 10 in the half and 17 in the game Wesson remember he didnt score about the first 12 or 13 minutes of the game he only took one shot correct Shrewsberry on the drive and low will commit the foul Jaylen Lowes third 10 now on pit so for the final 535 Notre Dame will shoot a pair on every common foul and the Irish under 70 in League Play and just above 71 in regular season efforts Mikel Shrewsberry is really upset even though a foul was called Jerry heer just told him thats enough Shrewsberry whos been double figures six of their last seven including 25 in the overtime win of Georgia Tech had 17 the other night at Charlottesville and itss both of free throws there he has five now and I think thats a key for Notre Dame when shrew is scoring the ball effectively Notre Dame has some offensive punch Y and thats not to blame him for whats happening today but they need more than five points from him I like the fact that hson goes for the double team and had the ball raped out of there and turned over says Jerry heer so it will belong to Notre Dame well Hinson he can see the double team coming West right but even though the double team is coming he knows the guy standing behind him is Burton and Burtons got foul trouble so hinsons trying to attack him Hinson litigating as he would do so meanwhile jeffris has come on to replace feder Rico for the Panthers the other thing that I would point out Wes in 10 ACC games coming into this week Blake Hinson had a grand total of three assists as you get another block there and ball goes right to Davis and he scores so usually when Blake Hinson gets the ball hes not passing it back 12 for Davis on his fourth field goal under five to play Lean look at this reversing through and foul I believe thats Tay Davis yes and that will be his second and eight now on Notre Dame in the half and Micah Shrewsberry the walk in front of his bench and here is Le and free throw good well Michael Shrewsberry is well aware West that his team is a little offensively challenged but I think hes a little bit upset because he feels like theyve had too many defensive breakdowns tday right missed the second just saw that note on your screen about Miami and Virginia on uh Monday night on ESPN tell you what that that game has some implication to it here is low off the Miss by Notre aame and a technical foul on Micah Shrewsberry whos way out on the floor with Jerry heater and hes got to be careful he doesnt get a second one and hes going back to his bench but Wes we just said that he was really letting Jerry heer have it Jerry heer told him stop and he didnt stop right side of your screen Jerry heer runs past him and hes out on the court yelling at him and you know thats when the coach goes out on the court like that Wes that has to be an automatic and certainly Michael Shrewsberry got hit with it Bob Carrington missed the first one and hits the second and now Michael Shrewsberry has come back up there and Clarence Armstrongs telling him to go back to the bench excuse me Bill Covington Im sorry what am I talking about heres low now 15point game 420 to play jeffris low all the way on the drive with a left hand yes you pointed it out earlier hes really good with that scoop shot and hes hurt and Jaylen low is going to be tended to by Daniel Anthony the trainer so low comes out of the ball game and Austin is going to return to play with leget Carrington jeffris and Blake Music K and meanwhile Applause down 17 now Notre Dame wants to see if they can find something here offensively as we go inside a four throughs Barry and hits in the rebound it was a sixpoint game at the break and noted aim started off the half knocking down a couple of jump shots got the thing kind of within one possession Dan and theyre now one of their last 11 from the floor well again they had they had a couple of defensive breakdowns pit had some pretty good looks at it like this one Austin had it spin out and then Notre Dames offense has really sputtered and that again thats their last in the ACC in points per game yep so the offensive problems are not new for Notre Dame and they know that and they they try to make up for it with really good defense 11 to shoot Burton working on leing on the drive shovels it out Roper all the way down and fouled by Carrington his nights over so bub Carringtons going to foul out hell finish with 16 tonight but the Panthers are in front 17 with 305 to play tonight at the Music peak you and auto owners help make it possible its

your eye on the mop just above the P hes going to step on that mop and Wes thats you can really hurt your groin like that I mean does a split oh my yep so hes back and on the floor and here is Julian Roper for pit and or noted a rather and the free throw for rer is good thats his first point hes been off the bench now in the last four Applause ball and the second one missed on the front rim Austin to rebound three minutes to go Notre AES got 47 points Pitts got 40 as a back court foul on Davis thatll be his third nine or no 10 thats 10 on the IRS M Notre Dame they have no choice they got to apply some pressure Pit by the Ways got 46 points combined from Henson Carrington and Leed of their 62 which is one less than the Irish have with the free throw a moment ago Dan they have theyre in Raleigh on Wednesday and next then they get um six days off before they play Virginia on a Tuesday night well see it in Charlottesville this a team right now that I would I mean if you start looking here at the schedule tonight would be four of five five of eight for cas team thats a team thats playing really well and I think you know inserting low into the starting lineup sort of changed the dynamic a little bit right and again West coaches have to be able to Tinker with their teams and develop them thats what Jeff has done and thats a tough schedule coming up of course West but the opportunity suddenly is there for the Panthers theres the pass stolen away and down the floor goes Burton good play by Marcus Burton whos now got 12 in the half and 15 in the ball game on his six field goal thats a tough bounce pass look at this backourt pressure look at Austin trying to keep it alive shrewbury took it away 13 point game a three here cuts it to 10 with two to go jeffris out front heres Shrewsberry back for Burton that was tipped two minutes to go heres burton all the way to the basket and a foul called on Applause jeffris so will jeffris out of eie draws his second and Burton will go back to the line here to shoot two hes got his 15th straight double figure game there a freshman well Jeffers is a pretty good Defender West but he was really at a disadvantage there Burton got to back up and start take a get a running start at him and Jeffers just couldnt move his feet quickly Applause enough so here is Burton at the line free throw is good hes now got 16 in the ball game on his third free throw tonight and you see Marcus Burton is there with Bob Carrington look at the D1 freshman with 13 or more points four or more assists only four of them Isaiah CER and Malik Mack of Harvard on that list CER now hes the catch me out out in the Pack 12 be able to look for him another point game I think its affecting the Panthers that Carrington is out of the game BR low fight through Jaylen low all the way the basket with the left hand seven for low in the half nine in the game well thats the way you handle a press Wes you make your opponent pay for pressing You by getting an easy Applause basket a minute 30 to go lead is 13 Burton Jeffers trying to keep him from the drive Henson tried to help there goes Davis for the basket T Davis with 10 and a half and 14 in the game Burton is just so good finding people even in traffic this is be an eight ACC high for Davis who had 12 against Miami and 10 at Georgia Tech he had 19 against Western Michigan in November here is jeffris for the D nice pass first busket for will Jeffers and we get a stoppage here with 58 points seven left and I think Bill Covington Jr is over to do a little game management here West its possible that that basket was scored before the clock got under a minute uhhuh and if thats the case then the clock has to keep running got it so hes doing some math over there too yes he Music is and Jerry heer has joined him at the end of the game if the clock is under a minute then it stops on any made basket but if its not under a minute when the basket is made then the clock has to keep running right so you see Austin deliver the pass here Jeff wide open and he dunks it down with 599 and you always tell me the ball comes through the net is when the is when its is when the basket is
