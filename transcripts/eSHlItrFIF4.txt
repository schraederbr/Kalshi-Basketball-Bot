will make it work Florida State in their teal uniforms playing homage to the seminal nation today and UMass coming in off of a huge win against BC at uh Springfield midweek The possession will stay with UMass coached by Frank Martin Their first year in the MAC and they come in on a fourame win streak Banks at 29 in the midweek win against BC And Florida State playing an attacking halfcourt pressure defense And I think we got a clock issue to start or a foul Yeah I think they should have had a full shot clock there They had it at 20 was the issue Lets take a look at todays starting lineups brought to you by Auto Nation First for Frank Martins Minutemen Seven and three on the season Danny Kbuchio runs the point Freshman from White Plains New York And the key inside is Leonardo Batilio Bedio excuse me And you see already Tom Florida State especially in dead ball situations Loves to junk up their defenses do some trapping and thats a big concern for this UMass team You want to stay aggressive but you dont know where its coming from and they have had trouble early And Bennett solves it and gets fouled on his way to the rim Florida State 13th in the country nearly 11 steals per game But a good job there A lot of thats just going to be meeting your passes winning those 5050 balls and you want to make the opponent pay If you can get out of that trap attack the basket Dont let them off the hook and reset and match up Le Jones charged with the foul So two coming for Bial and the Italian native 69 from the line on the season numerous stints with the Italian national team and theyre under 15 under 16 and under 18 teams Hes off to a really nice start this season is Betty 16 and eight Unable to converge there there though And the starters for Florida State coming off of a loss at Houston at Toyota Center They out rebounded the Cougars by two but lost 82 to 67 and Luke Lax in his first year replacing Leonard Hamilton has shuffled the starting lineup numerous times including brand new lineups each of the last two games Alex Steen did not play in the last game for him but hes expected back today and laps a former Florida State guard took him to an ACC championship before his time in Tallahassee was done and he Dane has brought a lot of NBA feel to this program Yeah its a really exciting style of play and thats a good job there by UMass Break the press Like I mentioned earlier you cant just break it and pull it back out And for Florida State you must find 24 and white He is public enemy number one as Banks from three Le Jones tries to answer The rebound lost into the hands of the Seinals Put up short and out of bounds off of FSU Itll go back to UMass Heres Frank Martin back in South Florida Final four trip with South Carolina And now well take UMass on its maiden voyage into the MAC after years in the Atlantic 10 Well see A10s George Washington in game number two against Florida today Bennett with the touch Hes going to get it into the paint After convergence he gets free and lays it up and in Id say about 90 of the time he wants to go over that left shoulder to his right They did a good job at first sitting on it but then they let him keep using that pivot foot You cant let him get to that strong side And a UMass takeaway Banks will step back and pop the three Yes sir And the Minutemen off to a rocking start here with transition basketball 8 nothing UMass You want an example of how confident hes shooting the ball Thats a twoon one And he pulls it out and says You know what Its better than two How about the three ball Coming off a careerhigh 29 in that win against Boston College Florida State looking for an answer There it is Their first triple Theyre going to take a ton of them Almost 30 a game But Coach L says Look were shooting about 40 from three when we take good threes that we chart If its average to less were shooting around 18 That would certainly qualify as a good one Tie up inside Le Jones got his hands on that one with Bio And itll be Florida State basketball This is a uptempo Florida State style offensively They score 84 points a game They are second in the country in threes attempted Dane They shoot nearly 37 threes per game Thats an astonishing number And I think a lot of its just the quality of looks they want But when you have shooters on the perimeter it opens up the middle as you saw right there Really nice find Malik Maluke Maluke is coming off of his third career start against Houston last time out Kuchia solves the mantoman pressure And heres the freshman from Archbishop Steen act around the offense Shot clock at four Hes trapped near midcourt Now its at one A hurried three is good Marcus Banks Jr is coming off of a 29point performance where he went six of 10 from deep and hes already hit three in the first three minutes of this one Well and its late shot clock and if youre Florida State you just got to stay connected to Banks Theres no reason to really help off where theres only 1 second on the shot clock as you see here I mean there theres really no need I mean thats help defense yes but you got to be aware that hey theres only one second on the clock The only thing that can hurt us is leaving my man Banks is on fire Nice drive and a dump off inside Betty old closes out Fingertip on the crosscourt pass but a three nonetheless and goes in for Martin Somerville An unconventional way of getting an inside out touch But those are the looks coach LS wants is a paint touch assisted threes not off the bounce or without getting any penetration Somerville played last year against UMass Went for 22 in that one and a foul on the drive Well well take a look here as McCrae really initiates the penetration and just a good find across the court Thats not easy to do from a center but good awareness Nice kick out And Tom previously Betty got the drive there Thats a position Frank Martin was saying hey hes really not accustomed to playing on the perimeter but its best for us big picture for three and white to learn how to step out Maybe not shoot a bunch of threes but take a big off of bounce initiate some of the offense And Bettyol I think is as good as Banks has been from three I think Bettyol you could argue is the real key to their offense to give him that inside presence McCrae picks up a foul and now UMass going back on the attack down to the baseline And Martin Somerville through traffic stops and midrange off the side Tough carum and gets it right back and banks it in Somervilles got five early A great elevation on that finish too by Somerville Just rose up over the defense with the left Whoa elevation My goodness UMass coming the other way Betty now looking for something to happen It was Hank and Sanford who had that last bucket for UMass and a foul An open step on the sideline Lee Cassell all over that one What a start to this one And Florida State getting in on the fun high above the rim setting us to break This will not grade out well defensively for Frank Martin What a drive here by Jones and finishing with a tomahawk slam stop Top is All right Congratulations Smoking and a 46 spoken further Its V week on ESPN as we continue Jim Balvanos fight against cancer 1310 UMass with the lead over Florida State Tom Hart alongside Dane Bradshaw Marcus Banks coming off of a big one midweek Hes kept the momentum going He has And if this guy can see it he can make it He has had way too clean of looks in this game Whether its transition guys helping off too early not finding him against the press And its been easy money for 24 You got to try to make him put it on the deck a little bit even though hes capable off the bounce But this is a guy that has rain threes his entire entire career Thats why hes at UMass coming off a stellar last couple seasons at UNMBC where he lit it up He hit the gamewinning free throws to knock off Boston College in the midweek And straight off the bench KJ Parker throws one in from deep Well UMass giving Florida State a little taste of their own medicine And its the Simols that love to beat you from three but right now UMass is doing that McCrae trying to answer McCrae coming off of a 16point game Gets his first bucket and then back inside for UMass Nothing doing another offensive rebound for the Minutemen Parker pull up midrange Got it What a start sizzling for Frank Martins team They made seven of nine from the floor Yeah theyre seeing a huge rim right now But look at Florida State makes or misses they are pushing I mean that is a fast break after a made basket Thats trained habits because you get the ball out of the net and youre not holding up for anybody Its kind of what we expected up and down and well see the same thing in game two of our double header today Pull up three is off the mark Florida State two for six from three Uh youll see the pace that both these teams are comfortable playing UMass is going to make a tough contested midrange shot Youll live with that for Florida State But they get the ball up the court And heres McCrae Hes really the key to their offense He leads them in minutes points free throws assists but he also has to lead them in decisionm I think hes taken a couple questionable threepoint shots without working the offense as he did on that last one If you joined us late UMass jumped out to an eight nothing lead behind Bankss threes And he misses for the first time now Gets another touch Florida State mixing it up defensively and the loose ball rebound belongs to the men in teal today And here come the nullles pull up two rebounded by Daniel Hanken Sanford and then let Sanford a 68 senior bring it up He was committed to Frank Martin at South Carolina Stuck around for one year during the coaching transition and then rejoined Martin in Ammerst And that one just rolls off the front of the rim I like the energy hes playing with though Good aggressive drive No good from Tom Mason I mean I I think we could have a 10sec second shot clock and everybody be fine in this one I mean Im good with it He is a no leave guy And I know you never want to leave that corner spot Youll hear so many coaches say never leave ballside corner Thats just one of the most high percentage shots a threepoint shooter can see And Banks has had a couple of them already And a foul charge to Parker on the drive What a start for UMass Eight of 13 including five of six from deep Oh this is just penetrate pitch Penetration kills You draw that defender in and as much as you want to help thats typically the spot you dont want to help from Is that corner especially with a shooter like Banks Banks gives him 34 minutes a game He takes a seat here Will probably return right after the under 12 timeout Alex Steen on the floor for Florida State for the first time in a couple of games groin injury cost him the Houston uh contest and a three from AJ Swinton They just roll shooters off the bench dont they They do And theyre going to have to make some of these contested threes that theyre going to shoot that many because this is a UMass team that defends the three almost as good as anybody in the country Sixth according to Kim Palm holding teams of 26 from three Kuchia with the bounce underneath and the reverse no good Rebounded by the Seinals Near steal at midcourt Florida State trying to take advantage and cant Quick touch and launch and its an air ball from AJ Swinton who just hit a three a moment ago And that was only his third and 13 attempts on the season for FSU And Tom what did Coach L tell us earlier this week on the Zoom He said Man we we watched so much film We showed our guys look Id love it if you got more points if you shot it deeper than the than the threepoint line but you dont Weve got to step in more He said our percentages are lower because were taking NBA type threes and we need to crowd that real estate a little bit better Great look inside and they get a bucket and one What a feed from Danny Kuchia And Dmitri Clerk is going to the free throw line for a threepoint chance And the junior from Lusan Switzerland will be at the free throw line win We return

Florida has free resources available to help you win Visit Floridacom to learn more ACC mens Basketball is brought to you by Auto Nation and American Bank UMass at the free throw line Dmitri Clerk trying to complete a threepoint play Clerks giving him three and a half points and three boards a game only a 44 free throw shooter who started his American college career at Pensacola State Greg Martin was raving Dane when we talked with coach about uh his transition to this game as he splashes in makes the free throw Yeah I think the newcomers including the freshman point guard Danny Kbuchia have really handled the pressure and the mixing up of defenses of Florida State extremely well early and not let it disrupt them and been the aggressor He had seven boards in a win against Boston College Three ball from Jones is no good This is a Florida State offense which is eighth in the country in threepoint rate They get 53 of their field goal attempts from deep carried over the inline by Steam To your point though Tom that 10 of their 16 shots have been from deep But I think what coach Louch wants is quality of looks Look how deep that one is is He said Look you dont always have to tow the line But we got to have you eaten up some of that real estate to improve the quality of threes that theyre getting And I think its important for them too not to take what we used to call my turn shots Even though you want to play fast it cant just be my turn Threepoint attempts if youre Florida State Loose ball trickles over the sideline Itll be Florida State basketball Luke was going through the stats with us this week when we were previewing this game They had the week off since the Houston loss 7 of NCAA games this season have more threes attempted than twos And its a Florida State team which set an ACC record and a school record with 49 threes attempted in their game against Georgia Southern And I I think what made Luke so proud of that Houston game was yes they want to play fast and shoot a lot of threes but could they hold their own after a couple disappointing games And he said I dont believe in moral victories not a big moral victory guy but to be able to outrebound a tough physical Houston team was a big positive sign for this team as he searches for some toughness and identity And again trying to figure out where the minutes are coming from and what rotations youre going to have on this this new team They got 19 points off of 31 Houston turnovers They turn their opponent over on average 19 times a game as Swinton knocks down both free throws UMass got off to an eight nothing lead in this game and then Florida State started to whittle away at it Its a UMass team that built a monster lead against Boston College and gave up a 232 run in the second half They held on to win thanks in large part to a pair of technicals against BC in the game in Springfield Yeah that was crazy Usually when you lose momentum the way UMass did you dont recover But they found a way to win late Parker will reset Eight to shoot Just pulls and drills it Parker has been coming out with a ton of confidence The junior from Lakeland Florida And now a steel Heres Wimbley off the glass Too strong And Parker had his hand on it for a moment Another tie up Well Frank Martin just challenged DJ Wimbley Jr a moment ago and now hes answering now We takes a seat and this UMass defense will fall back into manto man I take that back Theyre in a zone Leaves miles open You feel like youre playing with fire going to zone against this Florida State team that loves the launch And you rarely you can count on one hand how many times you said Frank Martin in zone that I think hes become a little bit open to to say Hey look maybe we got to mix it up every once in a while steal a possession here or there He was telling us pregame hes calling around to his guys Andy Kennedy good friend of his now at UAB the former assistant to tell me more about the zone And AK said What do you dont want to know anything about the zone No no I got to learn what youre doing He said You hated that zone No but maybe I got to come around there Parker for three Wow what a start for UMass The quality of looks that the top shooters for UMass have gotten in this game is is something coach Lox and his staff are going to have to correct moving forward in this game Largest lead of the game for the Minutemen The three from the corner is no good Its out of bounds off of Florida State will go back to the Minutemen on a 6 nothing run and seven of eight from deep Well Parker comes into this season 40 from three and if you want to get a good clean look get an offensive rebound And thats exactly what the Minutemen were able to do there And thats a whole another analytic conversation Weve seen the trend going around where it used to be conventional wisdom said Hey if you dont want to get beat in transition dont send as many people to the offensive glass the numbers have proven otherwise and so it gives you that other option to crash the boards They miss a bunny Seven second chance points for UMass You know in that game midweek against Boston College Dr Jay popped in the locker room to give them a pep talk Pregame it was about preparation and playing with confidence Theyre playing with a ton of confidence over the last three halves of basketball Youre right I mean that I I think the energys been there from Florida State but I just think UMass has had a swagger and I think they got some of those open looks early with this early tip and that thats what you want to see when you get a couple shots to fall It gives you that energy and momentum to carry through Betty returns after Luca Damian gave him a couple of minutes on the bench and a kick on the inbounds and well try it again and Jin Gay will pull the trigger for the Minutemen on a 6 nothing run Make it eight nothing on the easy look inside for Daniel Hank and Sanford They have done such a good job on their baseline out of bounds plays early in this season They try to get some flex cut action sometimes for Banks and if not for Banks these easy post ups down low Jin commits the foul on the drive Florida State has missed its last four field goal attempts Tom these are the baseline out of bounds sets where it is a designed post up And that is not by accident that he was wide open They started on the opposite block came over and just pinned his man And those are those you know if if you can be a plus four plus six on your baseline out of bounds plays that can be the difference in the game And right now UMass showing you a good example right there Semino shooting 39 from the floor just three for 12 from deep lob and a finish and a beautiful dunk Asham Mohhamd Mohamd giving some size off the bench at 611 Banks got off to a sizzling start He hasnt gotten a shot off in the last few minutes but has 12 points And now a drive Splits the defense And its a goalending call And theyll count it And the first two of the game for Banks In fact the first twopoint attempt Look back at that previous possession where the breakdown was Keep an eye as they get the ball in bounds here Two and White is going to try to switch off of this He doesnt like his matchup there Hes saying Hey switch Come over Take my spot take my spot and you just cant do that in the middle of the play when the balls on your same side Whipped into the corner and the three is good Cam Miles for the triple Anxious to see the patience Frank Martin has with the zone that is not a natural love for him to begin with Heres Betty Hall trying to get into the paint Lost a handle on it gives it up for another midrange and a Florida State run out and a near walk They get a blocking foul on Kbuchia Thats his first Its a 10point UMass lead Minutemen looking to build off their midweek win against Boston College Theyve won four in a row and a double digit especially this time of year So Auto Nations been a partner for over 15 years Uh 5 years with the Total Basketball Classic Uh Orange Bowls donated over or provided over 50 million to South Florida Weve raised over 45 million for cancer related causes So big big numbers but also just shows that were aligned in purpose and an impact and trying to get together and support the local organizations and communities Oh that is wonderful Now do you have any basketball ties or loyalties to any of the teams playing today Im from New York so no but since this is the Orange Bowl Im going to go for the Florida teams Thats a Thats a wise move And by the way quarterfinal coming up uh on the football side Texas Tech will play host to either well play host to either James Madison or Oregon UMass with the run out up by 10 And heres KJ Parker trying to get to work and a whistle and a foul What is your role like on a daily basis Its chaos every day but its always fun Um big on sponsorships big on supporting our business buying selling and servicing cars So December is a big month for us Well and with the chaos you would fit in nicely in the TV industry Awesome Awesome Thank you so much for stopping by Best of luck today And of course with the Orange Bowl coming up here in a few months of the quarterfinal and a foul on the drive and Frank Martin a little bit fired up Dane Yeah hes uh he can see the momentum It hasnt clearly shifted necessarily to Florida State but hes like Hey were not quite getting the stops the way I want to get it and get that transition game going a little bit more I think early too they they established Betty a little bit more Got him some touches down low See if they cant get the big fella number three Couple more paint touches Frank is a fiery individual yet he is also incredibly loving We had a chance to cover him when he was at South Carolina on a regular basis and hes the best man He and what he did at South Carolina that Final Four run to me will always be attached to the rise and credibility of the SEC in basketball Seven to shoot and its stolen away by Florida State trying to get the lead down to single digits and they give it up Theyve been able to get a couple stops just hadnt been able to convert and that time yeah you force a turnover Youd like to think youre off to the races but right back ball and here it is again A dead ball situation free throws Thats where you most likely see Florida State try to mix in some confusing defenses Banks mostly threes today Got one two off Shot clock late again Betty finds the cutter and the reverse falls off It was Carbuchia that time and both of them have missed reverse layups and similar looks And that was spin and into the paint and off the glass The lead down to single digits now as Robert McCrae the fifth sends it home And now the answer is two strong on the other side from Parker See I love that last one from McCrae Hes a big guard with some size 64 There you go Hes a playmaker for others We saw him get in the paint now Consecutive possessions as opposed to settling from three Hes really a doit all guy for this team Possession arrow stay with Florida State Take a look at McCrae here Hes got it Good shoulders here Nice spin move Gets to the angle that he wants Nice off the glass Mohhamd back to the bench as Steam replaces him Going manto man out of the baseline out of bounds and knocked away by Daniel Hank and Sanford Hes had a big impact on this one 17 starts for him last year He had 13 rebounds in their matchup earlier this season or pardon me last season between UMass and FSU Quick look inside Nice touch and finish Little ticky for Florida State Thats a great sideline out of bounds play where you just get a back screen and ball reversal and try to get an easy layup and Florida State picked him off 7 nothing FSU run now to make it a sixpoint game UMass led by 13 up 34 to2 That was the largest lead of the game and a foul on the Banks drive will be charged Martinville Well take a look at that back screen Take a look at five getting screened on that backside Really nice job as the inbounder cuts towards the basket UMass the scoring dr approaching three minutes now Baseline out of bounds again Another post up and a nice finish by Hanken Sanford Thats four points for him just on simple out of bounds plays They are stealing multiple buckets when given the opportunity down there Another kiss off the glass Theyre finding the driving lanes open Yeah McCrae has a size advantage a physicality advantage He does a really nice job playing off two feets that that is preached so much in todays game Averages 14 points a game Hes also one of the best assistmen in the country coming in fourth in the nation assisting on 46 of buckets while hes on the floor Kuchia tried to split the defense with a bounce pass Florida State with the steal Heres Somerville and hes fouled by Marcus Banks Jr Kuchia last two turnovers have been those onehanded passes Hes tried to throw a onehanded pass Hes tried to throw onehanded split through defense and thats just something hes going to learn as he gets older and these this valuable experience he has But this is a Florida State team You better make surefire passes So Somerville just four of six from the free throw line on the season and hes got one more coming his way Duke and North Carolina highlight Tuesday nights ACC Network double header Cam Boozer leads the third ranked Blue Devils against Lipkcom at six and Caleb Wilson and the 14th ranked Tarheelss host ETSU Both available on the ESPN app UNCC has won its last two against Kentucky and Georgetown against South Carolina Upstate today and two free throws for Somerville I feel Dane like one of the biggest games in the ACC is Kansas taking on Will Laids NC State team today on tobacco road How fun is that to see NC State under Will Wade in year one certainly extremely competitive and see always going to have a great matchup and strategies coming out of Will Wade Wimbley kicks it back out Eight to shoot UMass has used a lot of clock this afternoon and the three banks uh planes off the back of the rim Heres McCrae again 64 senior all day There you go AND IT GOES And hes letting UMass know about it too Saying You cant guard me man You better get some help Bring a double team He might get attacked But thats the confidence and swagger you want from your point guard keep it under control But hes feeling it right now like nobody can guard him He is taking the opponent in spin move Say mouse in the house and one You cant guard me Hell answer the phone for you too He just might be in his pocket You might hear a lot of jumbling noise but be patient with him Well Robert McCrae the fifth has changed this game And theres some young coaches trying to change the game especially in the ACC Jay Lucas has a home game today against Louisiana Monroe A bit of a changing the guards in the Atlantic Coast Conference especially when you consider the Hall of Famers who have moved on but ACC in good hands There are some young stars in this league And then you see in the SEC side of things you know Todd Golden what he got done so quickly at Florida national champion Gator Well get to see later today Banks fouls him on the three And not only is it three free throws coming for Florida State but that is the third personal on UMasss leading score It couldnt have got off to a better start for Banks But once they made him start defending and thats all credit to McCrae taking him inside and then now a frustration foul He doesnt feel like he got him but the ref saw it differently And so four for five from three for Banks but its been relatively quiet since in those three fouls Martin Somerville knocks down the first He only had six free throw attempts coming into this game on the season Sophomore from Buouie Maryland played at UMass LOL before going to Florida State And Somerville is one of those guys you you have to account for as the defense He he is the epitome of spreading the court offensively 49 of his 57 shots this year have been from three And so thats a big component to having a offense thats going to be spaced out surrounded by multiple guys that can shoot That is a successful trip to the free throw line line Its a first lead for Florida State now up two and a 10 nothing run and a foul near midcourt Charge to Somerville Daniel Hank and Sanford to the free throw line Just 52 on the season Earns another and thatll end a 10 nothing FSU run Hanken Sanford has been really efficient in this game 12 minutes Hes got seven points five boards three assists I think his energy has been really big for this UMass team The one 122 look for UMass UMass over the last three halves of basketball Has been a streaky team on both ends of the court Three in and out Rebounded by DJ Wimbley Jr Here comes Kvuchio looking inside and a foul charge to Steam A wrestling match with Steam and Betty But thats a really nice job of Bettyol running towards the rim trying to get a low low post seal on Steam and now is going to get rewarded by getting himself to the free throw line I mean this is the game within the game Youre trying to get to the bonus trying to get some of these easy opportunities at the line And that was earned by Bettyol just beating his man down the court and being physical 69 free throw shooter and it falls off the rim Mohameds given Florida State good first half minutes off the bench Wasnt a perfect pass and Somerville couldnt get reset in time to knock it down Um looking to reclaim the lead Bial turns a corner takes it himself off the window And thats all really a little big screen So you got your point guard essentially setting a little hidden ball screen for your center Thats the action Frank Martin wants to see his big man be able to do to take their offense to the next step And an answer on the other side for FSU Kobe McGees first bucket of the game Under two to play first half Parker tees it up and the loose ball out of bounds off of FSU Well watch zero and white here Hes going to just pause get in the way just enough and then keeps the defender away from helpside and a nice tough finish by Bettyol So those are sort of the actions you can do that maybe werent as popular five to six years ago where you would traditionally just have your big man down on the low post but being able to play inside out and being a decision maker with the ball is the next step in Bettys game Well you mentioned UMass has been so successful in the baseline out of bounds plays Weve gone to post ups a time or two Now theyre a little bit more spread out on this one Keep an eye out for five and white Parker at the top of your screen If they cant get a post up they want to get their top threepoint shooter a clean look on these And Parker certainly that the ball boy might be the MVP of the first half He was working hard to get that spot dried up Theres another look in the paint Got him off balance but couldnt finish And the rebound kicked out to the NLES Heres McGee McCrae was open for midrange They dont care for those And a bump and a launch after the bump KJ Parker conducts his second person Im with you I thought McCrae maybe could have taken that but I I think him trying to get a paint touch on the initial offense as we see the foul here has completely changed this game for Florida State As much as theyre known for threes how has Alabamas team been so successful Its not just the threepoint shooting its the pressure they put on the rim first Its rim first threes second Where I think Florida States been a little bit more three first rim second until McCrae has really changed his attitude And to your point Florida State is eight for eight at the rim in this first half One of two from the line for Cam Miles Its amazing how your threepoint shot will start falling and your quality of looks will go up the more the opponent has to respect you attacking at the rim Barbuchia will kickstart the offense Seven to shoot Drive and a kick And the three is good for KJ Parker You cant do it any better than that Kbucha as a freshman just being able to handle the ball get in play off two feet twohanded pass drive draw kick Thats perfect by the young point guard Under a minute to play first half first game of the day Beautiful drive and finish by Le Jones for his first bucket This has been a shootout Karuchia drives again Oh and the pass lost on the sideline by Jing I think Jing probably could have caught that but all three of his turnovers have been onehanded passes and I think thats really hurt him See a nice reverse coming up right there by Jones Florida State now over 52 from the floor Still more than half their shots coming from three Theyre going to use some clock here Heres McGee from McCrae Got it Just a little easy twoman game Shot clock off for UMass Seven to play in the half Little Florida State pressure and a timeout taken right at midcourt with 41 remaining in the opening half with UMass has the ball to start the second stanza and a turnover Ninth of the game for the minute So what does Florida State look like in the second half They team that started the half or finish You think McCrae tries to get inside I think it starts with some penetration but thats a good look right there They got towards the end of the first half man The loose ball rebound belongs to the minute Push ahead to Kuchia And a skip to Banks Hell let it fly A little too strong Well thats fitting Weve had uh two threepoint attempts in the first 30 seconds of the And theres Robert McCrae to fifth with the reverse Yeah McCrae now five of five from two 0 for three from three So hes starting to figure out where he can impact this game the most Ben has it rejected as Mohamd starts the second half with the flourish Well he timed that thing perfectly didnt he I thought UMass got it right where they wanted but denied Florida State up by six Floater wont find its home and its brought down by Banks And now push ahead and a jam by Hank and Sanford Thats way too easy defensively but a great rim run there and a good advanced pass Hanken Sanford can really run the floor Nobody there Its Mohamds second bucket of the game Yeah some good offensive possessions but I got to chalk the pass two up to bad defense I mean these things have been wide open Youve got to be helpside You cant let somebody just roll straight free to the basket Banks left open in the far corner He started red hot He is certainly cooled off Jones gets tied up turned around off one foot Betty on the board Man a bump on the drive will be the second personal on Robert McCrae the fifth Fast and furious already And Hank Sanford just going to run right down the middle of the court and Banks just does a nice job keeping his head up Threads the needle Its just way too easy Banks with the ball fake along two Thatll get him going again He started four for four and then fell off in a one for four run Hes capable of getting all the way to the rim but he he really prefers midrange and three and just a talented scorer that has a great feel and knack of how to get himself open And a trap at mid court Now they fall out of it Off the rim and UMass with an opportunity here down four Bennett all run in the four Garbuchia through traffic and an easy rebound into the hands of McCrae Florida State team that loves to get up and down the court as McCrae throws it in 10th in the country in tempo And hes playing bully ball whenever he sees Banks on him he just knows hes got the upper hand strengthwise and hes been able to get three consecutive buckets the last time Three times 24 has been matched up on them The question will be if Banks can then even it up with his own offense Somerville slow to get to his feet after picking up his third And this is the matchup they get in transition But every time McCrae sees it hes going at him And especially with Banks as valuable as he is Remember he got three fouls in that first half So Banks has to be careful not to pick up the fourth and Florida State knows it Theyre going to go at him on the other end to try to get the sharpshooter back on the bench He averages 18 a game Hes nearly there And a baseline out of bounds waiting for UMass will have Kuchia pull the trigger Its a Florida State team that lives by the three but they will let it fly And no surprise there over half their shots Benny all gets it to go The baseline out of bounds have been killing Florida State Thats I I got to think at least eight points on a similar play whether its Betty Whoa Mohamd with the two hand miss An aggressive take from outside the paint and a foul on the drive will send Jaden Jingay to the free throw line Its a second on Jones and theyve been able to get some open three looks in the previous games I think thats helped open things up right here on the interior Its just clogging up space and sealing your man off And its a its a great way to get a easy two if you can get the positioning and angle and credit the inbounds passer as well You got to have a good passer taking it out of bounds St Janes got another free throw coming Theres a Florida State team Dane you pointed it out that has really good sides especially in the back court Jings playing the three at just 64 and being asked to guard guys across the board 65 67 y hardnosed defender though and he makes them both Once again a one possession game Yeah well see if fatigue becomes a f factor in this fastpaced game UMass is essentially playing eight whereas Florida State has gone 11 deep so far Pass right over the top of the trap 64 McCrae to Miles to the corner and the reverse to get a hand on it Itll end up being a foul on UMass And that ones charged to Jaden Jing To your point about the depth thats now the second starter with three Jones has had a couple of these baseline drives there against the zone Hes an aggressive player and hes had a couple questionable shots here and there but I mean this is what you want when you want to have a highpowered offense and a ton of possessions ton of shot volume Ten says No problem Im your guy And so Le Jones whos from up the road Neptune Beach Florida at the free

Indor and Caleb Wilson a number 14 UNCC play host to East Tennessee State at the Dean Smith Center Both also available on the ESPN app Sorry I was too anxious to get into fighting Brook Savages of ETSU Yeah former graduate manager at Tennessee for me Used to be a state skinny rebounding for me after practice Coach taking on the North Carolina Tar Hills Betty all pump fake Got two guys in the air Basket interference got to be And so count it Lar Lonardo Betty got eight for UMass and the Minutemen hanging around Down two at the under 16 timeout Great rivalry between Indiana and Kentucky There was a game back in the 70s where Bob Knight literally slapped Joby Hall across the face Kentucky would come back the next year after blowout loss in hand Indiana Its first loss of the season There is no love lost between the oldtimers especially in that rivalry UMass Steel push ahead to Banks Hell pull from three and rebounded by Florida State That could have been a goahead shot for Marcus Banks Cam Miles left hand off the glass and in tough feed inside They get it down low and the little jump hook goes for Daniel Hank and Sanford Hes got a dozen And great post feed big to big and tough two right over the rim and stolen away by Hank and Sanford Oh one of the few mistakes McCrae has made Got caught in the air Just his second turnover of the game Tried to lob it inside and a hold charge to Steam who thought he took a shot to the head on the post up I wonder if theyre going to take a further look at that one He is pleading with Isaac Barnett Oh it was incidental This unless you see it Well there it is And then he got hit again Golly Yeah just Betty has been so physical trying to post up and demand and and this UMass team has really been trying to get those low post touches Banks driving a dump Betty all with a pump fake and then another What a clinic that is Just the pivot work the patience the pump fakes all began by Banks getting the penetration and the nice dump off the corner three off the front of the rim UMass has done such a good job making Florida State be one and done Just one offensive rebound for the Simols and no second chance points UMass has made four out of five Now Banks drops it off See what Carbu puts together Got a half step dump off and a left HAND AND A FOUL and Betty on going to the free throw line for a threepoint chance as UMass claws its way back in front Kuchia does such a terrific job here getting downhill at the basket gets in the air in that last second sees the defender come over and dumps it off knowing hey if the rim protectors in the air let me dump it off to my big and one Really nice execution by the freshman point guard 69 from the free throw line on the year Hasnt made one in three attempts this afternoon Been a game of runs between these two streaky teams Threepoint play for Betty Hall Hes got a bakers dozen A 7 nothing UMass run over the last minute 10 Heres Miles and he gets fouled on the drive I like the mindset by Florida State They turned down a few contested threes and just tried to get the ball going side to side within their half court offense Third on KJ Parker He had foul trouble piling up on the other side for Frank Martins team 15 to shoot Heres Jones looking at a zone Try to go high low and eventually got it and then Betty all commits his second Thats really too easy though against the zone Good spacing by Florida State And Swintons open here for about 5 seconds Banks just never ever sees him He just stares at the ball the entire time not realizing 19 and Teal had slid from the corner down to the block So AJ Swinton sophomore from Cabin John Maryland out of Bishop Okonnell also spent time at Oakill and Death Limited free throw attempts on the season Five of seven First miss today by yourself HEY MARCUS Did you just get bumped by the Orange Bull mascot I did I didnt They need to take that under review It was almost above the head and neck area You need some more room in the aisle If youre going to walk through the big citrus with a crowd tried to talk trash to him but he wouldnt say anything character Remember to get your vitamin C boys and girls UMass up two Banks with the feed inside Clark NOPE BENNETT IS RIGHT THERE AGAIN WELL he has been a constant presence for this UMass team especially on the offensive end Well and UMass is imposing their will right now Even though its just a twopoint game UMass is getting the ball wherever they want Just a duck in seal passing Sometimes its big to big That time it was guard to big and then the second chance opportunities Thats now the seventh offensive rebound and nine to zero in second chance points So if Im coach Lou for Florida State Im saying Hey guys wheres the team that outrebounded Houston You showed how tough and physical you can be Lets prove it now here in the second half and not just ask our offense to win the game for us Betts nearly at his season average already one for two from the line and the rebound ripped down by Leger Jones Nice drive and a beautiful finish by Swinten above the rim It all starts with McCrae I love the play call You can ball screen a zone Everybody thinks ball screens against man but when you ball screen the top of the zone good things happen And really the second straight time Banks couldnt do anything about it but hes losing sight of that man on the back side of the zone Threepoint UMass lead scored the first eight of this game Filthy comfortable first half lead but Betty all has been a monster inside That is 12 in the second half already for the UMass big Yeah the difference in the game right now for UMass is second chance points and baseline out of bounds play Thats why theyre not only in this game but in the lead Donovan Brown with the foul Keep an eye on that corner there I mean they are forgetting about the guy going from the corner all the way sliding down to the block Of course Banks had to come over and try to stop ball So I dont blame him there You got to stop penetration first but the ball watching cant occur Offensive putback falls off They did such a good job you mentioned against Houston on the glass but they couldnt convert the offensive rebounds into second chance point production Betty Hall going to work oneonone Jump hook rolls home 18 now for the Italian Stallion Really a fourpoint swing because Florida State had two bunnies at the rim They could not convert and then UMass gets it done through Betty There he is again Oh blocked by the rim and the second opportunity goes for Slim I hate to pick on Banks cuz hes such a star on the offensive end but they switch sides of the zone there Hes on the right side and again he gets back cut coming from the corner I value the offense and appreciate the schemes here but I think some of it has been bad defense Carbachial AOI with the kiss high off the glass Its his first make of the day behind the back HANG IN A SPIN AND IT GOES How fun is this game to watch and call Just up and down and some terrific individual plays Multiple weapons all over the court Heres Kuchia looking for another bucket HES GOT IT BACKTO BACK buckets for Danny Carmuchia And hell be at the free throw line when we return from the under 12 timeout UMass leads by five and a chance to add to it He may just be a freshman but Kuchio from New York is coming into his own here Getting himself a nice and one Tom Hardane Branch shots a fivepoint UMass lead to what has been an up and down game Plenty of offense and threepoint opportunity rolls out for Kuchio UMass has made each of its last four field goal attempts Robert McCrae the fifth imposed his will on the offensive end Hes guarded by Marcus Banks Jrs got three fouls but they cant get it to him Yeah theyre trying to deny McCrae the ball They dont want it back in his hands to UMass Smart strategy by Frank Martin Once he gives it up dont let him get it back UMass shooting 61 from the floor the second half Thats a high percentage look Dmitri Clerk his nickname is ghost He just kind of ghosted his way to the rim that time Yeah And when you get hit on that ball screen and nobodys coming over to help the helper thats what happens Everybody was hooked up on the shooters on the backside Miles fake left went right and then a dish after the drive An open three from the corner Tom with his first three He got his first career start against Houston last time out Then it was a week off for finals for Florida State Back into the rhythm Nice spin move Follow tip Good And Hanken Sanfords got 14 Sixpoint lead for UMass This is feels like arena football or something I mean just theres trade buckets Thats a tough one right there Thats where you got to get out and run right now if youre UMass But yeah a lot of it trying to get down and guard the ball keep your man out of the paint It looks like they might go back to that ball screen action that worked well for him here Kuchia with the hesitation Heres Brown for three Why not Donovan Brown the 62 seniors got his first make of the day The bench loves it and its a ninepoint lead for the Minutemen UMass sizzling in the second half at 63 Nice wraparound pass and the layup good by Mong Hes got backtoback buckets for FSU Well when Florida State gets the ball in the middle of the paint there they are so good at cutting off that corner Theyve gotten at least six if not eight points here in the second half off similar action Where does UMass want to go against the zone How about right into the paint for Banks and the teardrop too strong Offensive opportunity lost Here come the NLES Push ahead to McCrae Yeah And he just calmly takes it to the rim Hes got such a great pace and balance and strength and gets in there Doesnt fly out of control off one foot Nice finish Two years with Jacksonville He was on the Atlantic Sun tournament team First team all conference the preseason player of the year for the Dolphins last year No good from the corner and punched out by Sanford You mentioned fatigue for UMass a few minutes ago Feels like from an execution standpoint thats setting in as Banks commits his fourth And on the other side of the court heres UMass The young freshmans going to get down the pick and roll action hits the slider and then that time whips it across the court And that is all practice execution knowing where your teammates are going to be And Ive just been really impressed by the young freshman Kuchia and how hes played against this Florida State pressure And and Tom the other thing as a freshman when you see all types of different defenses every time down it can typically confuse you Hes handled it great Well he comes from a great program Archbishop Steppen Hes from White Plains New York And guy that was in that back court wearing that same high school uniform year or two ahead of him Boogie Flan will be on the court for Florida in game number two Boogie was a fivestar recruit Started with John Caliperry at Arkansas then transferred over to Gainesville to join the reigning national champions And Tom Banks got that fourth personal foul We mentioned that every time McCrae sees Banks on him he was going to go at him and thats what happened right there Got that fourth foul So now UMass has to figure out when you put in your best offensive weapon at least from a perimeter shooting standpoint back in the game I imagine theyll try to make it to about the 4minute mark WHOA WHAT A FINISH BY HANKEN SANFORD Thats how you solve the zone Uh we saw the great elevation he showed on his runners and floaters and now you see it above the rim UMass with a breakout offensive game today Heres Sanford again Gives it up back up top Three good KJ Parker with his first bucket of the second half UMass sending Notice its an eightpoint lead for Frank Martins squad as they put together another off one due to second chance points by the UMass men And they did it in the first half Nine to nothing in the first half That really was the reason for their separation Theyve continued it here in the second half And its one thing to get offensive rebounds Its another thing to convert them I mean UMass has gotten quality look after quality look on those second chances leading to a whopping 14 to0 advantage against Florida State And Tom you and I were talking that the trend of teams really crashing more to the glass And you think all right if youre aggressive attacking the glass you might give things up on transition but thats not the case UMass is 8 to8 in fast break points and they hadnt lost anything despite being aggressive going towards the offensive glass And an offensive rebound for Florida State looking for a second chance opportunity McCrae lost it Got it back Leads to a three Another offensive rebound and the foul charged to UMass and Donovan Brown Yeah they got the switch And its one thing to switch its another to switch and box out effectively And that time Brown got switched out on the bigger defender or opponent Eightpoint UMass lead 714 to play a first game of the day from Sunrise Florida I was going to have you expound on that I didnt know were going back to back Finish it off strong Cheers to everybody fighting the fight and all the terrific doctors and everyone who contributes to such an incredible cause there Nobody more brave than those going through it Remember go to vorgdonate Heres Alex Steen on the inbounds We approach the 7minute mark of this one Jones cant get rid of it almost walked with it and threw it away anyway Jay with the steal and now KJ Parker dishes it off and a strong take but knocked out of bounds by Betty 10th meeting all time between these two Florida State leads the series 5 to four Scored 92 points in a 92 to 59 victory last time they met Heres McCrae We can see right over the top of the defense it ends up on a foul charge of Betty which is his third Time and time again Tom as theyve tried to go in some of this zone UMass has just sort of forgotten about the guy in the bottom corner and thats where this cuts going to come from The bottom corner is going to just slide in behind and find the opening And now a chance to get themselves to the free throw line And it all starts with good penetration by McCrae But you got to be able to see man and ball and sort of stunt and bluff and make that ball handler guess Its been really easy completions if you will to that cutting corner So Le Jones at the free throw line St Bonaventure last stop Before that he was at Barton County Community College won a junior college national title A big game against Georgia Southern earlier this season where Luke Lax really announced his arrival Jones tied a Florida state school record The great George Mloud who played in the late 80s He went 10 for 21 from three Dame 10 for 21 People think youre a shooter if you wouldnt have put up 21 in an entire month I just hope that wasnt the same defender Is anybody going Parker will run some clock up a touchdown with 620 to play Looking at a zone Betty all got deep Good positioning Hes got a 20point game His positioning has been elite this entire game And a set play by Frank Martin And then a wideopen three on the other side skims off And just keep an eye on Betty all And theyre going to distract the opponent with some action up top And thats really all just to set up the post up down low Its just get everybody moving to one side Clear it out and post up right there against the zone on the bottom guy And Betty all has just been so good Hes eight for 11 now And then Hank and Sanford eight for 13 So the efficiency theyve had at the rim this entire game whether its second chance or first shot has been really really good Florida State in the bonus One more for Steam The issue though is Betty all just picked up his fourth personal foul Hughes got four Banks has four Jay has three Parker has three Another one for the senior from up in Panama City Beach Florida Alex Steen He goes two for two from the line Its a sevenpoint game Swinton returns for FSU and Ste gets a breather UMasss depth will be tested here See how Frank Martin balances it PARKER SLICES THROUGH AND ONE HOT HAND TOMAHAWK JAM by Hanken Sanford Hey hes been phenomenal in this game And the defender falls down and he just slices right towards the basket He he makes the game really simple and as a result hes got 20 and nine Kylo look reverse No rebound by Clerk Well Frank Martins program if it can hold on for the next five and a half will have real momentum headed into the holidays with a midweek victory over Boston College in their 48th meeting but the first since 2014 And now looking for a win against an ACC foe KJ Parker to the baseline Three to shoot Heres Clark Has it rejected Gets it back Couldnt get it off And then he goes tumbling And Hanken Sanford widely escorts Clerk away from a possible scrum Theyll take a look at what happened after the rejection Its a high percentage look though Prior to that Hanken Sanford just gets an easy two there You see the defender fall down and at that point it just became real easy for UMass to convert against that press of Florida State But Florida State finally came up with a traditional stop as were going to review it But they can ill afford to get that stop taken away And so Lee Cassels got the headset on the shot never got off It was a shot clock violation So it wouldnt be a shooting foul Yeah And a call a foul was not made So its either nothing or a flagrant And it was above the head and neck kind of as the defender was falling I could see him upgrading this one You got F1 I could see him doing it Uh maybe well get another look at it but I just It certainly wasnt a play on the ball They blocked the shot It was a little bit of frustration afterwards and unnecessary So you see the shot clock will be well expired So thats not a concern Its whether or not thats a flagrant one and whether it was a play on the ball not that first block but this and a little headlock from Le Jones By the way already has three personal fouls And to your point it was not called a personal foul at the moment Theres also a push from the back Yeah By Swinton Id be more surprised if they called nothing Um and this kind of goes back to the physicality of this game Despite it being highcoring I thought Jones got frustrated early in this game with some times that he was posted up in the physicality and took it out there at the wrong time And at a time where Florida State finally got a a good traditional stop to see if they could convert and get cut into this lead more but Im guessing it might hurt him now Yep Itll be a dead ball contact technical foul on Leger Jones and the key being dead ball right So theyll call it to your point because it was dead ball Theyre calling it a technical and that allows because of the dead ball situation UMass can pick whoever they want to shoot the two free throws as opposed to Clark going to the line And so theyll choose KJ Parker 16 of 17 on the season and he is money again I mean that dead ball situation really hurts because otherwise Clark it wouldnt have been a good situation but thats 44 free throw shooter indeed Getting upgraded to somebody near perfect And so Parker knocks them both down and UMass has extended the advantage now to 11 with 509 to play and they get possession State would have been much better off had that foul occurred before the shot clock expired By the way that might have just been a shooting foul They may not have even worried so much about the flagrant aspect Parker for three and the rebound ripped out of there by UMass That was Jin Gay with the rebound Another opportunity Hank and Sanford splashes it home Hes got 21 Three off of his careerh high and he has had backto back offensive outbursts for UMass And Jim Gay gets that great offensive rebound I felt like he really saved the game against Boston College with a big time offensive rebound late in that game when their offense was hurting no momentum and it led to a big three And number 11 in white is just a guy that wants to help the team Its his third year at UMass Frank Martin raves about him Hes just hes just a winner Just wants to help the team as you saw on that last one They go under the screen and he makes him pay KJ Parkers got a 22point game UMass on a 10 nothing run And Frank Martin squad looking to deliver a message here in the Sunshine State His South Florida homecoming looking good And now shes running the whole thing And what a great surprise for Frank and a fantastic honor his South Florida background The best compliment I can give Frank Martin is the multitude of coaches and people out there that say I would want my son to play for Frank Martin I mean not just a teacher of the game but a teacher of life wants to take males and turn them into men And the growth that weve seen the player development over the years has been really incredible Thats the fourth on Jing played for the great coach with Shaky Rodriguez Another one coming for Le Jones Jones has been really aggressive on the offensive end but boy what a uh dagger the technical foul was there right I mean that that was what a ninepoint game Florida State about to have the ball try to cut into the lead Plenty of time left and then the run just really escalated after that Under four to play UMass trying to add to it Theyve held Florida State without a field goal for five minutes now Hank and Sanford has been so good against this trap just meeting his passes getting the ball in the middle of the court and one wide He Hes really made life easier on his point guards when they have a big time receiver in the middle of that lane He transferred in from South Carolina where he was recruited by Frank Martin A bright spot for Florida State Kobe McGee 304 in this one He was shooting around 30 from three but career 40 A guy in the preseason coach LS called a sniper The jump hook wont go Clerk no Second effort Yes Dmitri Clerks got seven He has doubled his season average today Leads 15 And the ball knocked away and a UMass steal by KJ Parker And theyll slow it down and run some clock Well for Luke Lax Dane I think the issues going into ACC play will be evident especially on the defensive end as Hanken Sanford hangs and hits Im going to go ahead and put him down for my 2025 Auto Nation Orange Bowl Classic MVP of game number one The efficiency too 2510 on 11 and 17 Everything going his way But you know to me this is a guy that yes he scored well and he shot well but that that came as he started impacting winning early He just came in making the right plays making the right reads And its funny how you when you get lost in the game all of a sudden you end up with what could be a career night Oh and a challenge at the rim Set him backwards and a tie up will keep the ball with Florida State What an effort by Daniel Hank and Sanford the senior out of the Queen City of Charlotte North Carolina That is just remarkable And the energy I mean that was playing as if the game was on the line not as if youre up 18 points coming over all out effort Just absolutely love the way hes played this entire game So Miami pardon me Florida State took a 30se second timeout And you know Tom a lot of times players will get out of the way and well joke Oh well he made a business decision there Didnt want to get dunked on You do that for Frank Martin Youll make a business decision All right Youll be on the end of the bench and wont play And so that even though theyre scoring a lot and theyre playing fast for UMass theres still some of that Frank Martin DNA of toughness on the defensive end This year marks the 22nd year of honoring team parents throughout the Orange Bowl Youth Football Alliance through the Duffy Sports Grill Team parent MVP program Candidates nominated by their teams coaches park commissioners and fans for all of their efforts contributing to the success of the team Each of this years Duffy Sports Grill team parent MVP winners were honored during an offc court presentation earlier today Well better luck next year on the parent MVP nomination Theres always next year 2026 new goals Corner three is good Florida State looking for some late life as Kelvin McGee splashes it down And then a turnover by UMass on the baseline Now we know Florida State scoring bunches It would have to be from behind the arc And that one rims out Another opportunity Mulligan done payoff He hit that one OB will be two Why not a third time and a foul after the offensive rebound Were going down the other way And when Florida State has had a few second chance opportunities the few theyve had just havent been able to convert whether its an open three or an easy layup And coach LS Ill give him credit just hearing him in the press conferences saying Look we cant allow our offensive success or lack of success to dictate our defensive intensity And as much as hes an analytic based guy he goes Look Im not going to start our statistically best five if the effort and the energy is not our best five And so hes searching for that right mix And to me theyre looking for that glue guy that toughness that physicality And if you want to earn minutes and solidify your spot in the rotation and in the starting lineup man its an open try out right now for just straight up and three good from Somerville And hell go to the free throw line Florida State though D got away from what gave him success in the first half by getting it to the rim In fact theyve missed their last 11 at the rim So teed up from deep let it fly and a fourpoint opportunity on the way for Martin Somerville Now Parkers had a heck of a game and been an unsung hero with 22 points six of nine from three but makes a mistake there Thats the last thing you want to do is a fourpoint play when youre sitting on a big lead Just two minutes to go So Somerville at the free throw line The song returns for the NLES Florida State will open ACC play with North Carolina and that talented North Carolina offensive team coming off backtoback wins against Georgetown and Kentucky Home run ball and overshot it Wow So fourpoint play Throw the ball out of bounds and that should be taken out back underneath Florida States bench Thats right And it wasnt touched in the front court I dont think Unless Unless theyre saying that Kbuchia grabbed it before it hit the floor must have the bounced inbounds and then he caught it out of bounds across the end line Well dont know if he knew what he was doing but it was helpful Pass goes to the zone whipped out to the wing back into the corner and the hurried Florida State offense just is not able to knock down the threes in a step on the sideline Dane on the other side Frank Martin is trying to build a winner in Amherst And this will be a huge notch in their belt to get an ACC victory following the win against BC the backtoback ACC wins and and just the balance theyve shown Theyve got four guys 16 or more And when you look out here you feel like roles are established um you understand who the point guard is who the shooter is who the bruiser is down low guys coming off the bench and theres a lot of teams right now in the country that dont have those things figured out yet And UMass certainly looks like a team that does Every coach we talked to here even mid December says Were still learning our team The floater good Thats McCrae Hes got 21 124 to play 10point game Weve seen weirder things havent we And a whistle on the foul And lucky that was a foul because the inbounds was delivered to the scorers table Um had to hold on for dear life Got two gamewinning free throws from Marcus Banks against Boston College in the midweek win after they allowed a 16 to nothing run Part of a 232 BC run And Tom Frank Martin told us he said Last years team was you know not quite as connected as this team is in terms of just looking for the open man and flowing offensively and and thats not on one guy Its just the chemistry it team is looking for And this group right here despite a little bit of a lackluster close theyve got a 100point game first time since 2023 in regulation And right now they are jelling And it theyre a team that makes each other better And thats what I like to see Parkers got 24 Three ball Good Somerville with the triple Hes got 17 Three possession game And knocked away Itll stay this direction Frank Martin says just catch it Dont look to turn to make a play Just catch it And thats something I talked about Hanken Sanford doing such a good job of beating the pass but McCrae just really sold out trying to get that steal They actually hit the century mark a little bit more recently in the season opener last year against New Hampshire So 103 to play Been a frustrating defensive effort for Florida State Ill give them credit though This game was starting to get away from them and that fourpoint play really ignited them and they have not quit 63 ticks remaining Here comes the trap in the back court And a near steel and a tip out of bounds And Luke Lax is going to say Please take another look at that Florida State has one timeout remaining This will be a coachs challenge for LAS Hell retain the timeout if he is proven to be correct UMass turned it over 13 times tonight Thats about their today Thats about the Florida State opponent average Yeah thats across the court from us So it wasnt right in front of us but in real time I thought it was off Parker towards the end there It was McCrae in turquoise that reached in and did it go off his hands or Parkers That look certainly makes it look like it was Parker touching that I agree I dont I dont think McCraes deflection would have caused the ball to go that way I mean Parker gets it at the end And wow the way Florida State can shoot the ball If they get this convert with a three man Lee Cassells got the headset on taking a look at the monitor trying to figure this out His stripes have curves Have you noticed that Hes been in there doing those latap pull downs Fantastic crew led by Sean Hall and Lee Cassell with Isaac Barnett 579 remaining And if they figured out who it went off on then they have to backtrack make sure the timing is right Shouldnt have been much of an issue Did it hit the sideline Theres Cassells hand going up Or did it hit the scores table Looks like its about right So Florida State gets his Dane with 57 seconds left Down nine How quick do you get a shot off I know theyve got some quick actions Certainly a ton of sets and if youre UMass obviously you must defend the three Itll be Florida State basketball Dows retains that timeout Under a minute to play and even McCrae gets some penetration Do not help off shooters Open against the zone Wide right Another opportunity to tee it up No good Florida State fights for it but it ends up with UMass and into the hands of Banks Now the Seminals trying to foul A weave all the way through Nobody got a hand on him They tried to find Bennett all but they couldnt foul him And finally with 3588 left they get the foul on ESPN on the app Henkins a double double 26 and 10 at the under 16 timeout in Notre Dame tied at 10 So after the timeout Betty will inbounds Heres Banks AND LOOSE BALL KNOCKED AWAY BY FLORIDA STATE POSSESSION arrow belongs to the NLES 31 seconds left down nine Frank Martin thinking can we just get out of this place trying to hold on to a lead forever Theyre holding on for dear life And you just get that deflection I think Banks was expecting to get fouled immediately There were hands in his back but once Florida State had the trap they werent going to foul out of that Under 30 to play Deep three off the front of the rim Another opportunity Theyll throw this one up Another miss 17 seconds left down nine Three ball corner good Leane Jones drills his first of the game and a quick timeout taken Its a sixpoint contest with 13 seconds left Florida State trying to get their matchups Theyll probably switch everything into the corner and a quick foul 910 of a second off the game clock Yeah coach Lax thought Banks was maybe a little out of control about to bobble that ball out of bounds They called the whistle early I think the right call on McCrae and so it puts Marcus Banks Jr at the free throw line Banks only has two points since the 817 mark of the first half That was when he hit his first four threes Got off to a perfect start in this one Been a journey for Marcus Banks Jr out of Hampton Virginia Few different high schools Spent a prep year at Fork Union then went to Kawi North Carolina to play at Western Carolina Adessa Junior College the next stop and then UNMBC led to America East and threes last year A quiet second half He was having to play with those three fouls he got in the first and then picked up a four So maybe not quite as aggressive as hed like to be Quick three no good And that will be academic now Florida States going to run out of clock and not running out of three zone Betty all squeezes the rebound Backto back wins against ACC opponents for Frank Martin and his UMass Minutemen man They go to
