program he understands the history the tradition wants to seeon Syracuse team return to some of that former glory Lamar Simpson Chuck Jones Brett Smith your officials tonight as we play ACC baset B Late Night Out West Stanfords only lost this season at home came back in late November and its their resume wise worst loss of the season a quad Ford defeat here against calp from the big rush than that theyve been very difficult to beat in this building they work late in the clock raino finds Blakes back to the big man a straight on three and Reno turns acknowledging the student section who were counting that down but there you see the effectiveness of a sevenfooter that has a three ball laid in The Possession Pick Pop able to knock it down now raino picks up Eddie Lin as he backs him down sneaks it across the L Jer Davis Powers it up and R clears away the Miss thats a good look from lumpin youve got to convert those if lumpkins going to demand a double team guys have to finish for Syracuse oiah sers lets it Fly this is his first attempt at a career best 27 over the weekend and a win here over Florida State first year Cardinal transfer from Applause Music USC about a 3000 mile Trek for Syracuse out to the West Coast got here Monday night wont go home until Sunday night late in the clock a turnaround for Taylor wiggles Applause out ug shot ugly Syracuse lost at home Saturday in their most recent game against pit despite outrebounding the Panthers by 17 a lot of that was lamin 23 r unsurprisingly has the first five for Stanford tonight and thats been the biggest difference in his game zero hesitation as he drops a nice jump hook to the Baseline thats something that he added to his game he really didnt have that a couple of seasons ago and now hes just so Polished in the paint di Davis lost it dribbled it off of his sneaker the first orange turn over something red arrey really wants to see his team limit tonight Applause Blakes taken by Davis this guy Syracuse in search of its first points two and A2 minutes in Elijah Moore misses his first attempt get back to the practice only the second alltime meeting between these two programs on the hardwood and first at a campus site they met back in 201 11 at the NIT preseason Tip Off Tournament a victory for Syracuse sers lays it in its a 7 nothing start for the Cardinal here on the farm defense defense Music Applause defense hasnt been Syracuse main issue as much as the struggles theyve had defensively this season but right now a lid on the bucket Starling partially blocked Reno saves it in and its recovered by camon there you see the defensive presence of Reno rotating over getting a piece of the shot and getting Stanford out sters couldnt finish this time but grabs the second effort Mah sers has been the best threepoint percentage shooter in the ACC in conference Applause play long range Miss from Mareno right now the orange have to try to find a way to get the ball inside the lampin let him challenge raino in the oneonone and see if he can get some things going nice spin move but he turns it over tough start for the orange out west still scoreless down seven against the Stanford Cardinal at our first stoppage tonight well every bit as good as advertised Maxim raino off to a hot start end of possession and the long ball is good and then on the Block Unstoppable youre going to see the Finesse on display but he plays both ends of the floor at the other end making the rotation for the Cardinal with the block settling in at Stanford Maples Pavilion Maxim Reno to nobodys surprise has fueled this seven nothing start for the Cardinal tonight hes one of the nations top scorers top rebounders and he leads everybody in double doubles with 16 this season and Cory hes already halfway there at our first time out tonight hes that rare combination of talent and confidence he knows his team is going to count on him he knows he has the green light and that makes all the difference when you get the ball and dont have to hesitate or think and youre the number one option you kind of play a little more relaxed than most guys out there and he is a handful defensively because he can set screens and roll he can step back with the jumper he can post up and the reason that Stanford scores as well as they do a lot of guys feed off the action that he creates Kyle Smith says Maxim rmo hes hes not nicoa yic but hes our Nicole AIC and says a good Pro compy came up recently for maxim is Kelly oen the ex Gonzaga Bulldog whos now with the Toronto Raptors and he been in the league for a while I mean hes gone from a bench big in the Pack 12 a couple years ago to a likely first round pick after his final College season this year I think there are a lot of teams in the NBA who have a pick in the first round that could use a 7 one guy with that type of ability I think the way the NBA game is played now its an open game he is going to flourish at the next level Starling steps back and it horseshoes off the iron Syracuse cannot buy a bucket 5 minutes in and Syracuse has it applied more pressure offensively they have good guards that can get downhill theyre going to need to try to penetrate against Stanford create some opportunities Stanford off to a three for eight start on this end Blakes finds a crease and draws a foul its on JJ Starling Jaylen Blakes will take the first free throws of the night and there you see Blakes getting a layup opportunity because defensively lamin had to stay with raino we couldnt come over and help and like I said guys really eat off those ball screens with Maxim here on two one2 Jaylen Blakes The Graduate transfer from duke spent the last 37 Seasons with the Blue Devils hes got three 20po games this season its been a big breakout campaign in a lot of ways for Blakes who never averaged more than three and a half points per game in three seasons with the Blue Devils and he leads Stanford in free throw attempt this is part of his offensive game N9 nothing start for the Cardinal winners in five of their last six and three straight kind of gotten themselves back in the NCAA tournament Applause conversation s step three barely graes the iron Chris Bells first attempt Off the Bench and he is a Flatout shooter but coming in ice cold probably want to get a little more reps up and down the court before pulling the trigger raino carries the three man down and thats an easy bucket for raino hes got eight of the first 12 and a pair of triples tonight now has the team lead with 38 this season lamin kicks Applause Music it Jer Davis from the corner still nothing in the point column for Q lamin had a twopoint opport opportunity and passed it up that probably would have been the best shot attempt they had on that possession right now Syracuse do a little soul searching I mean 12 points isnt enough to win the game but you do want to get on the board here soon bles Nails the Baseline jump shot its a 14 nothing start for Stanford now you see coach ay up a little concerned with the effort given by the starting unit stuck in quick sand on this end of the floor well right now they havent established a threat in the paint everythings been from the perimeter and there you see the turnover leading to some transition sers downhill puts it in and give him one on the house Stanford couldnt have dreamt of a better start on their home floor well you see the indecision by Syracuse on the perimeter theyre really not sure what to do this is just a weak pass and get picked off and then transition good strength a little bit of weight room taking it hard to the rack we talked about the defensive laps of Syracuse and talking with Coach earlier today he stressed he wanted to see his guys put forth the better effort on the defensive end and right now 17 unanswered for Stan defense defense def Syracuse seven shot attempts seven misses and three turnovers make it four the moving screen on Pete mustovich the Freshman from Serbia Off the Bench Stanford going to their bench because they can up 17 Syracuse going to their bench because they need some jumper cables on this offense right now coming out flat against the Stanford team thats play playing in Rhythm foul before the shot attempt and its on Kyle cuff red shirt Jr from Harlem in his second season at Syracuse after a pair of red shirts at Music Kansas very discouraging start after the long trip out west sers and cuff took it away from behind great block right there by C to rotate over and give them energy Applause Music the C mercifully has the first Syracuse Point first time they attack the rack first time they score lets see if they go back to it a sarcastic cheer from the Stanford student section behind us yeah theyre theyre not fans they were starting to feel bad for Syracuse thats a lot of basketball to play the question is can Syracuse lock in defensively and they give up another layup Ryan agarwals first points at 7 and 23 minutes off the bench over the weekend here against Florida State Music Applause Music 192 lamin Movic right left Reno has another rebound already hit seven are you doing go there you do what can I shoot stand for seven of 13 to open the game on this end Ager wall across the lane on car gets it back in a crowd sers Benny geler for three its good timeout red oy Stanford is sizzling on the farm tonight of 20 points in the opening half ball movement is what makes Stanford so effective and right here on the offensive rebound they swing it around and they drilled a three ball corner pocket its the Cardinal trying to run away early about it I mean you got to do your own Dirty Work and Stanford taking care of business at home you see the record Joel lardy not having him in yet but youre right they tack on three or four more wins theyve got to be in the conversation right now five maybe six teams from this conference looking to get a bid now the high laob inside broken up by REO another takeaway for Stanford already the fifth Syracuse turn over AAR wall you know hes a very underrated shooter one of the best Shooters Stanford seen in a while and there you see the ease at which he can put up three points team here five points for agar wall as this game opening Avalanche continues ju Carlos touch on Sy second field goal almost halfway through the opening 20 another result of St s attacking the paintt instead of staying on the perimeter playing hand ball theyre trying to get downhill they need to do a lot more of that over the final 10 minutes and a half that one popped out for agar wall Sanford four of six from the perimeter to begin this game 11 made trades last time against Florida State fell out of the shot F smothered by raino bad pass on the floor and the possession arrow keeps it with Syracuse 13 on the timer for most players when you talk about shooting you want to be completely open agal is not exactly all the way open but he has just enough daylight the ball comes once Syracuse fails to react shooter defenders too slow that is an easy three for a shooter like him nager will sub 30 from the threepoint line but the way are going for Stanford feels like every time they trigger up a shot its going to find nylon down to five to shoot its Bell elevated and missing from the Baseline you Applause TR only when Syracuse is posted away from the JMA Wireless G this season at Boston College giler took that shot from San Jose and life touched by Stanford open your eyes not a bad time for a heat check up 21 on your home floor well the psychology behind it is he had the mismatch in the post he saw his big was being guarded so even if I miss it we had a chance at the offensive rebound which they did have a chance but coach Kyle Smith not pleased with that shot C drives it strong finish two plus one for Kyle cup scoreless over the weekend against pit fun fact tonight Chris Syracuse three for three in the paint heres another take straight line drive muscle play by cuff beautiful Hang Time Syracuse will try and chip away at this big deficit nine and change until the break Jer Davis is back as Eddie lamin six lamin hasnt been much of a factor tonight no he hasnt they went to him once in the post he had to turn over and hasnt seen the ball since but most importantly with Reno out of the game you would think this is a prime time if youre Syracuse to try to get some stops and make a Applause runer the former walk on gets rid of it aara transfer from Harvard averaged 14 and half per game for the Crimson last year Blakes in trouble Gaylor off balance in and out outstanding defense by Syracuse now you see him pushing it in transition Jake Von Carlos is fouled more free throws for the orange thats probably their best defensive sequence guys rotating to the ball they contested the shot got the defensive rebound and were able to push it in transition and right now if youre the orange you dont want to look at the scoreboard you want to keep your head down just chip away and get stops lot of time left here in the first Applause half Carlos first year Syracuse Orange transfer froma hey Thursday night features two top tier womens basketball matchups starting with 13th ranked Oklahoma and number seven LSU on ESPN 2 at 7 Eastern then at 830 on ESPN Iowa State takes on 11th ranked Kansas State both games also streaming on the ESPN Applause app 257 Stanford has led by as many as 23 in this opening half on their home floor just the second alltime meeting between these two programs theyll only play once this year and the plan is for Stanford to return the visit to Syracuse and Conference play next season aara Mak a double dribble AAR a little confused thought the ball was knocked away but it wasnt backto back stops for Syracuse can they continue to build on some of this momentum theyre trying to establish first Stanford giveaway of the night is Max raino back in after a short rest Applause Music Davis High to set the screen for cup Baseline out of control Blakes hit the deck and its another stop for Music Applause Stanford everything on this end runs through raino and hes on the floor Al Smith says Blake sers and raino have made up a big three here on the F and thats whats led to this team success winning five of their last six coming in JJ Starling conspicuously quiet at the outset tonight too Syracuse leading scorer with a goose in the point column as jquan Carlos flutters it in well hes a solid player and a disciplined player more importantly hes not just going to go out there and force up shots go Davis knock it away and its going to stay with Stanford Syracuse with a little momentum for the first time tonight seven straight for the orange and Northern California still down big for the Stanford Cardinal 20 games under your belt theyve only had a full lineup probably five or six times and although thats true for a lot of programs its hard to establish that consistency when youre missing key guys when you saw the defensive struggles for Syracuse theres an obvious schematic difference between what we saw from Jim bayy and his nearly half a century at the helth of the program and red arrey and the way hes gone about his manto man defenses you think Syracuse basketball you think that vaunted orange Zone that hasnt really been their look defensively the last couple years no and thats the key I mean obviously he is a product of beheim era very familiar with his zone defense but when you take the helm youve got to incorporate some of your own personality and philosophy you want to keep a lot of the tradition and every coach does that you bring new things to the table but you definitely keep a lot of things from your time as a player Bell finally hits or rather Lucas Taylor out of the corner Taylor sinking his 16th triple of the season in the first for the orange tonight and Taylor and fell both with nice Strokes from long distance be interesting if they can create those opportunities good defense there by lampin to go straight up no foul can Syracuse get backto back possessions with Applause Music scores see if Starling can start to cook off the glass and in for his first points tonight the lane has been good to the orange of Syracuse and single digits at halftime would be a huge accomplishment given the way they started this game this is a 121 run pieced together by Syracuse the last 4 and a half minutes they want to get the ball to their run stopper right here Maxim Reno beautiful shot right there and another stop for Syracuse the confidence building for the orange R picks up lamin defense defense defense Starling spins on sellers now back to his right couldnt kiss it home off the glass and raino grabs his ninth rebound to this opening half starting to see the orange a lot more aggressive in the oneonone it took him a while to get started but the difference is they played good defense up until that play no rotation easy layup seven points in this opening half for Ryan agarwall the red shirt sophomore in his third SE season with the program there werent many holdovers from the previous regime there at has our colleague the longtime coach here giving way to Kyle Smith in the off seon right now youre looking for some signs of life if youre a Syracuse and plays like this give you some hope nice little penetration kick to the corner no hesitation they knock it down but then taking it strong to the rim thats where theyve had had some Applause success Davis his fires on the first to two few stickers on his suitcase red shirt season at Providence out of high school spent the last three years at Delaware and the orange they have recovered nicely since that slow start well like I said you dont have to do it all at once but if you can head in in half with a single digit game kind of make up for that slow start theyve made a run raino Giant Steps down the lane and draws a Applause foul you know normally when youre 7 foot one this pump fake is just that its a threat but he actually can shoot the three so you have to respect it and once lampin leaves the ground two raino knows exactly what to do attacking the rim Applause Stanford hasnt had a conference scoring champion since Landry Fields back in 2010 Reno currently leads the ACC at 202 points per game was the most improved player in the Pack 12 Conference last season now making a run at ACC Player of the Year in his final Collegiate go around this one ACC player of the week for a third time this season after what he did in a pair of Victories last week here at home and you look at his numbers in this conference and if they stay where they are its hard to make an argument for him not being player of the year but with Cooper flag and the highlights and the sizzle its just going to be difficult lamin through the contact then scores over the top Areno for his first points tonight lets go boys Eddie lamin played in this Arena as a conference B last season as a member of the Colorado Buffalo Ager wall has it knocked Applause away Starling catches lets it Fly and buries the three timeout Stanford from 23 down back to single digits well we knew it wasnt going to be a runaway situation for the Cardinal The Qs stringing together defensive stops and and that was their first transition bucket getting the stop Corner ball three and the qs making a Applause Music run minutes of the opening 20 in Maples Pavilion Maxim Reno already on the cusp of what would be a 17th double double this season and after Stanford scored the first 17 points of the game Syracuse has done a nice job to weather the storm here before the break well you knew the defensive stops were eventually going to come for Syracuse 17 to Z was completely unreal and unacceptable but most importantly Syracuse finding some luck from range and attacking the rim getting into the lane high percentage shots and if your Syracuse you just want to keep your foot on the gas no reason you should be happy with single digits and if youre Stanford youve got to do better than this coming out of the timeout with the turnover and the qes are of and running right to the rim well Taylor took that Euro Step around raino but hes from France Blakes for three short off the side of the iron and the Cardinal missed seven of their last dat attempts talk about a drought he always shoot your percentage thats just a rule in basketball so if you start off hot Gyer Davis oh he tried to it back and throw it down but it went in softly a little contact on there could have been and one but beautiful pick and roll I thought he got away with a offensive foul on that ball screen but theuse is in the house as they used to say back in the day nice little run raino Miss fires agar wall the offensive rebound but does not have the follow got to finish that all by yourself under the rim no excuses just given more opportunities for Syracuse to cut further into this lead Starling leans in lamin had it and the foul on Stanford will keep it with Applause qes I thought we were going to be on poster watch with this one were going to see a really tough screen and then a nice pocket pass takes off get a piece of the ball up top thats why there was no foul call but gets the friendly bounce and would you believe were at seven points Syracuse with the ball down just seven nice punch back from the orange try and get closer before the break through his final two and 12 minutes by 23 early Starling lamin bobles it cross the floor its intercepted by Gaylor a sixth Syracuse turnover this first half lamin a good passing big man just didnt see the defender but Syracuse starting to lock down on the defensive side of the Court see if the Cardinal can score a bucket here beautiful back door oiah sers finishes off the assist from Maxim Applause his second assist tonight a point away from a double double already Maxim raino the leading scorer in the ACC tops in the country in double doubles lamin and the entry pass deflected out talked about Lins ability to pass sometimes hes got to look to shoot but when the defense is excited they overextend you got to hit them with the back door beautiful release nice pocket pass easy Applause two darling resets late in the clock Davis faces up on agar wall extra pass Lucas Taylor Davis grabs a second effort and lost it out of Applause bounds goys we we go Music boys go Applause go Maxine REO Al to picked up by lamin and lost the handle on the way up itll stay here Syracuse swore they saw hit off raino last and they may have a case on this I dont know that anybody knocked this ball away it looked like he might have lost it on the way up that balls off of raino but somehow it stays with Stanford I think theyre going to say it was knocked out of his hand but to no avail The Qs on the break Carlos high off the glass with a southpaw flip boy the momentum has completely shifted in this building Stanford came out on fire but its been Syracuse over the second 10 minutes that has imposed their will gotten defensive stops and finally getting some buckets in transition and knocking down some threes as well raino for Applause three geler grabs the loose ball on the Applause perimeter a 9 seconds separate the shot clock and game clock gayer downhill Ted in by raino and thatll give him a double double and raino may have gotten away with a little push in the back but when youre talented they let it slide offensive put back good for the Cardinal final seconds to the opening 20 Davis finds Starling in and out the opening 10 minutes you know when you talk to coaches Chris they all say oh the opening 5 minutes of the second half you know those are the most important minutes of the game and a lot of times you just dismiss that as coach speak but in this situation it is absolutely true can Stanford reestablish the tempo and the dominance or can Syracuse just continue the Run they ended the half on they go right to their money man oneonone this is the match that we talked about I didnt get to see a ton of it in the first half and lamin wins the first battle of the second as he forces the raino Miss despite the height difference Renos not going to move lamin off the block hes too big for that can he score over him and theres a senseless turnover by Davis an illegal screen you got to be set against the Music defender do J Davis picking up his second foul of the night the E Syracuse Music Applause turnover sers swings it Blakes for three camon on the defensive glass off the deflection earn Stanford a second bite at the Apple Agarwal teas it per of Misses from the outside Stanford will get another chance on a Syracuse foul another one on Jer Davis in a game like this you have to come up with that defensive rebound the first time raino was able to tip it and keep it alive and right there you B possession but an off the ball foul gives it back to the Cardinal Pete mustovich who had a season High 10 points over the weekend at home against pit is back in Off the Bench replacing Davis Reno skips it to sellers he back pedals out peels back for three and buries it and you know the thing about that is Stanford was 33 one for three on that possession but they walk out of there with three points because of the offensive rebound and the foul Syracuse did their job defensively got two stops but unable to keep them from scoring Starling to the rim couldnt wrap it home lamin puts it back off the glass and thats the benefit of attacking the rim it free up lampin for those offensive rebounds the 23 rebounds for Eddie lampin against pit Saturday the first orange to do that since Derek Coleman back in 1990 you talk about orangeman royalty when you mentioned Derek Coleman huge fan of his from the Big Applause East another moving stren its on movich so Chris were talking about creating opportunities right now you penetrate you miss raino goes for the block and it frees up lamin all by himself hes the big man out there easy kicking for Music him Blakes raes his inside and scores first second half points for Jaylen Blakes who is just one for six in that first half Applause def Stanford stretches this lead back to it dozen feel like the orange need a bucket here to kind of calm the R its lamin missing short but a late whistle for a foul its un Reno and it will send Eddie lamin Jr to the free throw line for the first time tonight first foul on Max Reno tonight 53 at the fre stripe our next NBA double header on ESPN is Friday when the Nuggets square off against the 76ers followed by the Suns and warriors in the night cap it all starts with NBA Countdown at 7 Eastern on ESPN hey whos going to get Jimmy Butler the Sons The Warriors maybe somebody else maybe he stays put in South Beach and keeps going toe for toe with Pat Riley until the summertime the disgruntled employee sweep Stakes not sure Id be lining up to uh bring him into my locker room right now unless this is all just a game but Jimmy Butler one of the most solid players in the NBA a true professional up until now jayen Blake sticks the three backto back makes for the Duke Applause transfer Deford has drilled six triples tonight defense defense defense def staylor picks up his dribble finds an open jquan Carlos he answers back the third trade for Q beautiful Vision right there they saw two Defenders rotate in good skip pass good shot in rhythm with the hopster transfer has been a nice spark Off the Bench as Blakes turns it over Starling Coast to Coast Movic patience in the eye of a storm slow to get up as they bring out the mop men he lost the shoe good good hes able to put it back on official stopping the play right here loose ball qes might have gotten away with a little bit of a reach youre going to see Renault with the ball but then right here gets knocked away good hustle play by the orange first point for the young freshman coming off his career high during in his 19th game here in game 21 for Syracuse program thats suffered just one losing season the last 50 years Lakes into traffic and the foul called its on jquan Carlos and Jaylen Blakes will trigger up a pair of free throws on the other side Syracuse they trailed by 23 early but theyre hanging around in the second half on the farm Music series split but North Carolina snatching both games last season theres definitely going to be some payback in the minds of Blue Devil Nation Duke will try and stretch a winning streak that currently sits at 14 games theyre the only unbeaten team in the ACC meanwhile North Carolina with that loss at pit last night very much on the bubble still but certainly no lock to get to Mar Madness and that would be for the second time already post Roy Williams that the tar Hills arent in the big dance well they can write the ship with a win against Duke and you can bet that is the discussion in the locker room thats the billboard material all things can be washed away if they somehow emerge with a win the EX blue devil Jaylen Blakes delivers with a pair of makes at the free throw line out of the timeout Stanford back up double figures Applause Eddie lamin so good at creating up top shot clock in a single digits lamin the behind the back pass off Target and taken by raino a great thought great look poor execution R knowing when hes double team and he knew who was open but just didnt make a great pass Blakes has it slapped loose down to the deck to get it and the possession arrow points the way of the orange Music on the floor for the first time for Stanford tonight what a job that Pat Kelsey has done in his first season with the Louisville Cardinals Clemson was an elite 18 team from a season ago very much in the hunt for the ACC regular season title despite Duke winning its first 10 Conference games yeah a lot of people feel like its Duke and louville and then theres not a whole lot of spread between everybody else but definitely think thats a league that can get five teams in possibly Applause six oiah sers finds Reno Stinson the Baseline and it bounces in the Freshman from geny Applause Washington didnt see the floor in the opening 20 nice aggressive oneonone Applause move Starling with an opening miss it off the side of the iron taken by sers his third board tonight starlings going to have to heat up for Syracuse hes a guy who can get 20 points in his sleep and right now hes been relatively quiet you dont want to force things but he definitely needs to become a factor in this game aara off the raino miss Applause Stinson that would have sent the student section into a frenzy a fan favorite The Freshman pulling the trigger for a nice little oneonone then a bit of a heat check just Applause now lakes and movich getting tangled up inside jquan Carlos Spence and the entry pass broken up and stolen by Blakes zigzagging down here Hill he stops at the free throw line and Stanford will slow things down yeah up 12 with a lot of time theres no need to rush get a good shot and theres no better shot than this oneonone opportunity great pass sson the slasher off the feet from Reno and a timeout Applause Syracuse Stanford trying to reestablish themselves offensively and no better man to make that happened and Maxim Reno with the dime Cardinal of Music 14 in 38 points yeah when you got the big boys coming in your building you hit them with everything but the kitchen sink and 38 wasnt enough to get it done but thats a sign of a good club strapping on play well on the road good set play out of the timeout they drill a three thats beautiful execution thats coach red Audrey right there drawing up a great look for the orange out of the timeout first points of the night for Chris Bell the Northern California Native who grew up in conquer Reno answers back with a straight away Applause mate Maxim Reno showing off his range tonight with his third triple hes got 14 and 12 thats just real leadership you take a three and your best player answers with one to kind of keep things at a distance he doesnt hesitate he cant Bell picked up by Stinson sneaks it inside and it bounces in for Movic backto back buckets for the orange before that timeout they had some turnovers and thats why coach red ay called that timeout wanted to get guys together because theyre ining a time of the game where you have to play solid defense and take care of the ball good rotation defensively and they get the Applause stop Kyle tff getting his first second half run off the crossover leaning in on sers and it pops Applause out 13th board for maxim Reno Music averages almost 12 a game in the rebounding column flashes the leather takes it downhill spins and the soft touch from Maxim rof got to respect the three and then once he gets on the move its just hard to stop Applause him this another night at the office for the leading scorer and rebounder in the ACC quickly climbing up mock draft fors cuff gets it back shot clock didnt reset and fouled on the way up with five to shoot Kyle cuff pair of free throws when we Music return well tonight it has been the Frenchman taking control how do you want it he can give you whatever you need three ball from distance and just when you think youve got that figured out little pump fake action oneonone to the rim Unstoppable sevenfooter another Stellar night 17th double double of the season for the senior from Paris France one of a number of great basketball stars to come from France in recent memory of course Wy whos already taken the NBA by storm backto back number one overall picks have come from France and well before Victor weiny was a superstar he and Maxim REO were teammates back home in France Max seems actually a little bit older than W oh you look at all those names its the French Revolution guys coming in to the NBA obviously 450 of the best players in the world and when you see those draft positions you instantly know basketball is so popular globally and theyre turning out that kind of talent just had the Olympics in Paris where France finished as The Silver medal award winners just had some NBA games in Paris last week and theres theres wemi before the world knew about him and I think the world has learned a lot about Maxim Reno in his final College season here on the farm both those gentlemen have learned about protein shakes based on that picture good Lord here is raino backing in lamin across the floor to Stinson shot clocking a single digits aara Applause into the paint spins right off the side of the glass and recovered by Syracuse Applause inside Bell from the corner puts it in plus a foul he has a chance at a fourpoint play and Chris Bell has come alive in this second half transition has been the friend of Syracuse all night they get the ball up court in the corner and just poor decision making you want to close out without fouling talked about Bells ability to knock down shots and there you see he only needs a little bit of room to get it off and man that was just what the doctor ordered if youre Syracuse trying to get this within Striking Distance and cant cash in on the free throw we we we Chris Bells been shooting 50 from the perimeter over his last seven games up 50 mil from here went to De laal high school before Prep School in Utah his third season at Syracuse AAR on the crossover sneaks it in agarwall and he scores off the window boy agarwall just moving without the ball he made that whole play happened the offense was stagnant then he made a great back cut and right now youre Syracuse 11point game Maxim Reno is out of the game can you make a run jquan Carlos knocks down the three backto back downtown hits for Syracuse and if youre Kyle Smith how much of this do you watch before you go back with your seven footer can this unit continue to get Buckets Carlos first double figure scoring game of conference Play Perfect five for five from the floor aara operating downhill again and at home nice oneonone move by aara kept his footwork made a nice little Up and Music Under first point to theight by Harvard transfer off the Cardinal bench now both teams in a rhythm from the field lamin knocks over camon and throws it down that was a great no call a flop call with would have negated the basket and thats what Stanford wanted and the referees this is the ACC youre not getting that and here comes Reno back out Benny gay lays it in on a defensive breakdown and youve seen a lot of those tonight from Syracuse just pour on the ball defense defense is where the orange have struggled the most this season second to last in the ACC and scoring defense big Eddie lamin getting back to work isolated with camman and scores with the left hand this time hes firing up the orange well they know thats a free lunch on the Block anytime Lin has the oneonone right there theyre just going to sit back and let him cook but can they get over the hump Blakes draws a foul Stanford continues to attack and more free throws for jayen Blakes but Eddie lamin keeping Syracuse within Striking Distance the big man making big plays in the paint right there little weight room action and the second time around he knows hes going to hit pay dir with a nice little jump Hook off the Glass Syracuse trying to make a Music run only happened once in the last half century it was a few two years ago one of the final campaigns for Jim beheim at the helm meanwhile Stanford this is their best start since the 1920 season of course there was no NCAA tournament that season to talk to people around the program they felt like they would have gone to the big dance if there was one in 2020 but certainly trying to make a case this year top 70 of the net in Kyle Smiths first season and the win tonight would go a long way certainly its all about resume building winning the games youre supposed to win and I put air quotes around the word supposed to because nothing is as it seems anymore in college basketball so many changes and rosters transfer portal nil the Blue Chips arent really Blue Chips these days you just kind of have to go out and Win Every Game and respect every opponent Maxi Reno back on the floor for Stanford took advantage of that stretch where he was on the bench little seven point run they got a couple of layups and a three and now it is go time for the cues down Applause 10 Bale will penetrate and wave it off jayen Blakes absorbs the charge and I dont like that call one bit not at all I think the defender is late getting over he does a good job of body Applause control either way he was there he was set he was above the arc so by the book thats a charge charge player control but man its a tough call inside of s minutes Stanford nursing a 10point lead jumped out to a 23point lead early in the first half and Reno is hit on the swing not in the act of shooting but its the seventh on Syracuse so Maxim REO will tow the foul strike for the one and one third foul on Pete mustovich Applause youre up 10 7 minutes remaining in the game Ill give you one guess who the ball is going to go through nearly every possession if youre Stanford okay thats your thats the job of your leader to take you home get you over the Finish Line Id be surprised if he didnt touch the ball every possession for the rest of the game he has often been the closer for Stanford during this stretch where theyve won five of six Applause in your eyes how does he project at the next level oh hes going to be Sensational hes going to be Sensational because he can shoot and the NBA is filled with coaches that know how to use his skill set a lot of time they spend trying to develop guys to get the skills that hes going to be walking in the door with so when you got a guy with size who can shoot you know he doesnt have to be Luca donic but all he has to do is take advantage of those lightning quick guards they have in the NBA get accustomed to the speed speed of the game hes going to score a lot of points at the next Applause level Stanford back up a Applause dozen tough night for JJ Starling two of 11 from the field a guy that averages 19 a game for Syracuse lamin will take his chances with Reno floats it to Carlos watched by cers Davis late in the clock Starling catching shoot and it rolls off Roo juggles and claims his 14th board tonight good possession for Syracuse they got a good look but Stanford collecting that defensive rebound the clock is your friend up 12 its all about ball security here if youre the Cardinal Rano sets the screen for Blakes and it was not a legal screen he lost his footing and knocked over jqu Carlos ma thats a third on Maxim know well the first mistake is you go under the ball screen which youre inviting the three and then theres a little incidental contact he kind of sells it to the official cuz he was dead in the water the moment you go under that Music Applause three gire Applause Davis into the paint spins on o far and floats it in now its time for the orange to try to dig in defensively and string together some stops if theyre going to make a run here yeah its going to have to start on this end for Syracuse when they had that big run late in the first half they did it by piling together stops Reno provokes a three its off the heel and Carlos whistled for traveling I thought he was bumped by Jaylen which took him out of control instead jquan Carlos gives it right back to Stanford and thats a tough call but it appears to be the right call Red arrey is not happy no because he understands how important the rest of these possessions are got a double digit lead with five minutes to go you need every stop and Stanford will get a chance to run more time off the clock but they give it right back for TR little indecisiveness shown by osiah sers whos been quiet in this second half been held to three points after popping off for a career best 27 on Saturday against Florida State on a night where Jak Juan Carlos who averages less than six points a game leads Syracuse and scoring who do you want the ball to be with down the stretch for the orange trailing by double figur Lin to touch it but you want Bell and Starling to get good looks from three those are the kind of guys that can splash some points up there for you pretty easy there you see the double team in the kick Chris Bell Way off you got what you wanted you just didnt knock down the shot Syracuse six of 15 from the perimeter Bells gone two of four with all those attempts after halftime Ager wall around the raino screen out to Maxim s side step three off the front rim and chased down by Applause Davis clock will soon become a factor here Davis takes it inside and scores off the window good job right there by raino not committing the foul just surrendering the bucket because the clock is their friend theyre going to get a opportunity here to run more time want to get a high percentage Applause shot Lakes at a step then reverse it in wow no call some contact there on that layup JJ Starling heat up down the stretch nice cross over shimmy and a finish at the cup this is a sixpoint game boy that was a filthy move you could see it in his eyes from the moment he got that oneonone out front The Qs putting together a couple of good possessions in the oneonone we talked about getting the rock in the paint Davis little body control and at the other end just a beautiful crossover finishing the lane we got a two possession game Music another strong case tonight 17th double double of the Season which leads the country hes done his part and on a night where Stanford open the game of 252 it is Syracuse heating up here down the stretch Cory this is the closest the orange has been since it was 7 nothing Stanford 3 minutes into the game that was an eternity AG go Syracuse kind of forfeiting the opening 10 minutes of this game and turnovers have kind of plagued them in certain situations but right now they find themselves in a two possession Affair three and a half minutes to go can they get the stops they need and thats going to come down to how they defend Maxim raino you know the balls going to go through him lamin JR has been tasked with guarding him in the oneonone little full court pressure Trap by Hughes and they get the turnover beautiful call out of the timeout coach SH now that full court pressure speeding up jayen Blakes and the orange get it back you make the mistake entering the ball to the corner and a reckless pass but great anticipation he tries to dribble it it hits the out the in line and Syracuse steals a second possession can they score is the question I feel like a bucket here really turn the tide and then give it away on a sloppy bounce pass perhaps trying to do too much starlings bounce pass taken away by Reno Stanford hasnt scored in three and a half minutes little dribble hand off offense and they finally end up with the pin down getting it inside of their goto man R perfect I talked about how polished his game is that was just an NBA like play isolation took the contact and hit him with the floater jump Applause up inside of three minutes taking a lot of time to develop Starling off the side of the iron it has not been his night and a frustration foul given by starling to Benny Applause gerer good call good good Chris you got to look at the spacing they give raino right here hes got the whole side of the floor to work with takes a little check up and over nothing but net and I dont know thats going to be tough to defend even in the next level in the NBA thats just a beautiful move one and one here for Benny geler theres Now 23 of 25 at the free throw line will play one more game here in California against the Cal Golden Bears on Saturday in Berkeley Stanford will make one of their shortest ACCC road trips to Dallas to battle SMU on Saturday try and take a four game winning streak to the Moody Applause Center another Miss from Bell kind of feel like opportunity slipping away and thats going to be over and back on Blakes as his foot went over the Music line Syracuse a little life here inside of two minutes down nine good defense right here you watch that right foot drop back over the line good call by the official toally accused with three empty possessions can they get a bucket Applause Music here Carlos stops and starts elevates 15 to lead Syracuse Off the Bench for jquan Carlos tonight and the lead is down to seven with a minute 45 to play jquan Carlos to the rescue with a season High Off the Bench hes had the hot hand with plays like this the floater in the lane is good Music Syracuse trying to make things interesting down the stretch within 7 minute 45 to play steep heel to climb but it its not out of the reach here how did the orange pull this off well you either need Miss free throws or turn turnovers and youve got a better chance at getting the turnover so right now youre seeing the full court press can you get a deflection can you speed them up and maybe get an on the ball steal or something to that effect Stanford solid from the line you just got to try to create a situation where you can get a loose ball Stanford is taking good care of the basketball tonight just eight giveaways Gaylor had a step and the former walkon lays it in and when your sevenfooter is out there at the top of the key taking the big man out of the picture you get those kinds of layups acceleration and finish for gerer ninepoint lead for the Cardinal approaching a minute left to play at Maples Lampkin fouled raino had been knocked down and lamin immediately turned into the body of the Freshman Aiden camon what game are you watching G has played a big role down the stretch tonight as Syracuse has tried to claw back into this game Well normally lamin has to come down and defend the rim but he cant because Renos stepping out for the three and at the other end soon as he gets the ball he turns in little blocking foul cant convert one more for Eddie lamin who spent three seasons at TCU out of high school last year at Colorado having his best year with the Syracuse Orange Applause and he cashes in a pair of free throws Chris Bell back on the floor for red atrey replacing Jer Davis repossessing game you need some miscues from The Ore from from Stanford if youre Syracuse and right now theyre going to let them run clock and Trust in their defense SL Gaylor lost his balance and somehow got it to Music sellers lets go lets go lets go t clock in a single digits tellers three Blake s in Now Syracuse has the foul they cant play this out and Carlos puts his hands on Gaylor well Jaylen Blakes came out of nowhere and makes this much tougher for Syracuse with 408 to play and thats just a winning mentality the shot goes up and everybody starts backpedaling to get back on D except Blakes he runs to the ball and wins an extra possession for Stanford Big Time play might be the play that seals this Applause game even with the make here its a three possession game still but a lot of things would have to fall into place these final 40 seconds for the or timeout called Stanford has its fans fired up about this program again might be closing in on their fourth straight win go ninepoint lead for Stanford over Syracuse with 4 seconds left from Maples Pavilion the finale of the three game home stand for trying to sweep it beat Miami and Florida State on their home floor here last week theyve led wied to wire tonight you want consistency you want your key guys stepping up this will probably be a team win if Stanford can hold Applause on Syracuse just look at the opening minutes Carlos having trouble with the handle still stumbling and hes fouled in the ax taquin Carlos somehow kept his dribble all that time as he zigzagged through the Stanford Music defense you should be fired go back to scrubb all right AC network has a mens basketball triple header this Saturday starting at 2 Eastern with Florida State and Boston College followed by Virginia Tech at Virginia then at 6 Eastern Stanford rolls into Dallas to take on SMU dont miss it Saturday on acc Network Andy for a number of years coached against Stanford at USC in his first season with the SMU Mustangs one of his former players oiah sers one of Stanfords top scores told me yesterday that simply put its been circled on his calendar and he hell be ready for that one no motivation needed for that one I tell you yeah didnt get a ton of run down at U last couple of years under nfield but been part of what Kyle Smith calls a big three that theyve been able to form at Stanford with raino sers and jayen Blakes and the beautiful thing about that if youre Stanford youve got guys that are consistent and most importantly you can take a couple of possessions off when you got two other guys that get Buckets Kyle Smith widely regarded as one of the great program builders in the sport right now what he did at Columbia San Francisco most recently Washington State Stanford should they hold on here they will already have one more win than they did the entirety last season before the calendar flips to February just a remarkable job done by Ty smth as cam blocks the Starling attempt in the corner STS out with 207 in a 9point game and even more impressive theyve hit that Mark as the New Kids on the Block in a new conference go with a lot of questions being Music Applause answered go too much time winding off here for Syracuse Starling keeps it and Blakes will cradle the final attempt of the game the Stanford Cardinal have won six of seven and continue to make noise in the ACC 7061 your final score for Maples Pavilion
