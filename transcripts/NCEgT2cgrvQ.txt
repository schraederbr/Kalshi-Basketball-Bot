back to college basketball on Saturday nobody in the country could have done a better job than they did here at Clemson and we are underway as the Tigers win the opening tip they come in with 19 wins North Carolina 14 and 10 Carolina with a little tweak to their lineup well get to that in a moment heres Chase Hunter the top score to float one up there and a miss but tipped out by shefflin locking straight on well drop that in hes coming off a huge day against Duke he absolutely is and van Luen closing out short we know that Victor lockin can knock down the three ball youve got to run him off the threepoint line not give him open looks lock with 22 on Saturday he had only played 15 minutes in that triple OT loss to Georgia Tech so that made all the difference shot clock is down to five the pass inside and a nice job for Trimble to float on in for two you give a look at the tiger lineup brought to you by C DW and that includes Chase Hunter coming in at 18 points a game along with his brother Dylan who averages about six off the back Iron by Hunter Chase Hunter who hits about 44 out there and for North Carolina we mentioned a tweak to the lineup Jaylen Withers at 69 because they desperately need size to combat the big guys for Clemson he gets the start tonight yeah and you we watched Clemson attack Duke on the interior I and hu Davis saw that as well making sure he gets a bigger lineup in to deal with sheflin and locking on the interior where theyve been 40 points against the Blue Devil so theres a point of emphasis to get it inside good hold the point guard with a Miss shefin trying to spin and its knocked out of play by Withers now as we mentioned the Tigers have jumped back into the top 25 they were there briefly in December Auburn if you missed it is still the number one team in the country they did not fall from that perch despite the loss to Florida Alabamas number two Duke and Florida tied for third and when you consider Auburn not dropping off that top spot a lot of it has to do with their strength of schedule they already have 14 quad one wins on the season hard to say that theyre still not the best team in the country thats right sheflin working hard they never got to the rim so a shot clock violation for the Tigers Hubert Davis with the ultimate compliment to I sheelin he talked about how he can dominate a game and he doesnt have to do it with the scoring his rebounding 20 boards in this building against Kentucky was a top five the first top five win for the Tigers this year and of course was significant in a double double against Duke on Saturday Davis through the lane and out of the corner theyll knock down the three on target Withers the fifth year man jayen Withers of course coming over from Louisville has experienced playing in this building against the Tigers has spent all five years in the ACC locking trying to follow his own Miss couldnt get to it kadoo picks it off with Carolina coming up Saturdays onepoint win over a pit 67 66 thats all they play it seems is one possession games and theyre used to being in close games Hubert Davis told us earlier today hes just used to it now as RJ Davis is able to get to the midrange hes been shooting the basketball much better over his last four games really quick turnaround between these two little JW is really really warm as Hunter drops in a threepointer thats Dylan Hunter the 63 junor out of Atlanta and his brother trying to put together a big game tonight Dylan Hunter getting much more comfortable in that starting lineup it was the spot where toy Wiggins F but Dylan Hunter making such an impression on Brad Brown now on both ends of the floor as he does there with the Tigers the turnover Lockett feeling it drops it in from threepoint land then Allen Luben once again closing out short hes already shown you that he can knock down the three ball youve got to get out and take Victor lockin off that threepoint line Kido with the dish and a quick strike by Luben whos coming off 17 he was instrumental in that victory over pittsbur he made eight field goals Obi at this point on on Saturday we had already seen Clemson turn the basketball over time and time again Duke as a matter of fact had 18 points off turnovers did not get a point off turnovers in that second half were also watching the Tigers use the three ball to a different level than they did Saturday only four of 10 Saturday didnt use that but right now getting the job done by on the three by so a 99 tie early and a pullup pop for the Clemson Tigers and Dell Jones Applause a Scramble for that still on the deck Tigers Come Away With It shein with a dribble now will scoop and Miss from close range another rebound for him and again Tapped Out high and another Chase for that still alive Carolina picks it up lofted out for Davis moving it inside Washington for the slam and thats an area where Jaylen Washington struggled early in the year he would have tried to lay that up possibly miss it or get it blocked youve seen hes learned youve got to dunk those opportunities and get the short two points especially after the team have to work that hard to get the basketball back on the defensive Applause end Clemson picking off another top five team over the weekend Zachary slamming on the brakes thats become a regular thing here for the Tigers under Brad Brunell and thrown away back over to the Tar Heels it goes both teams getting after chony Wiggins on the floor to pick up the basketball unable to get it going and of course Ian shein one of the best offensive rebounders in the league but give North Carolina Credit they had the same hustle to match coming up with the loose basketball turns into a bucket on the other end Carolina getting hot theyve hit their last four Applause shots Davis back out for Kad looking for the bounce feed but an errant one off Jackson and Jackson not score Saturday for the first time all season Wiggins will swing it Jones the ultra quick freshman Wiggins back and outside for two nice little floater great play by Chanty Wiggins there to take advantage of his size and then the turn around right over top of Drake pal who was under siiz having to defend him kiddo really pushing the tempo Drake Pow with a Miss although the Freshman hits a lot of them 39 out there yeah I mean be shooter on the perimeter Obie we had a little conversation earlier today about his follow through he knocked down four before he left shooter round so if he starts making shots Im taking a little bit of credit for that I think you you absolutely should this one tied 1111 we talking about the close games that Carolina has pretty much played almost exclusively close games in half of their games with five minutes to play the game was within five points and it started early you talk about going to Kansas in their second game of the season and then then making the trip to Hawaii first playing against the University of Hawaii in Honolulu and then Maui Invitational but theyre just used to playing in close games and expecting it down the stretch Zachary tough shot off the window and hell be headed to the line now the head point guard out of Salem Wisconsin triple hand off action at the top of the key no one leaving the shooters on the perimeter so JayZ making the right play getting to the Rim able to finish through the foul opportunity for the n one and Jackson with a foul Chase Hunter to the bench for Clemson Zachary good foul shooter 85 and a threepoint play and Jaden Zachary truly leads this defense hes the guy that gets after defensively the point of attack as Chase Hunter checks out now Dell Jones will have his opportunity to go up against last years ACC Player of the Year in RJ Davis to see if he can keep him from getting going tremble to drive it and deflect It Away by Hunter Wiggins will line up a long one he sticks it OB there are six players on the Clemson Tigers roster in their rotation that shoot 40 or better from three this is a elite threepoint shooting team you cannot give them opportunities in transition Jackson left it short again the Tigers collapsing on him oh great Hands by Jackson Jackson coming from behind on the theft pile tiptoeing through for two nice response defensively the tip from Ian Jackson and then you have Drake pow getting out in transition showing off his perimeter skill crafty move to get the bucket Clemson an 82 run in the last minute and a half Foster trying to move underneath that iron Washington right with him and tipped out of play North Carolina some tight defense Trimble got his fingers on it OB this game means a lot these two teams both doing a tremendous job hustling making the effort plays Dylan Hunter with the block shot kicking it over chony Wiggins on the trail three knocks it down but then Drake pow coming up with the steal after Ian Jackson with the rear tip is able to turn into a bucket in transition Z lost it but there is a whistle Bill cumington Jr calling a foul there along with Roger AES and Lee Castell really fine crew here tonight for this big Monday pile with the personal you said it big Monday you got to have the 18 te on big Monday right here and in a very important game OB this is an opportunity for North Carolina to get a quad one win on the road but for Clemson theyre looking to stay right in the top spots of the ACC locking is already hit a couple driving it and short with it Foster working hard underneath will draw the foul but heres the question will he get free throws he did not shoot that basketball so Im not sure if he gets free throws on that one as Roger SS goes over I believe it is going to be a Shot Two Shots but Foster never attempted the shot he brought the basketball back down as you see Foster coming in does a great job getting the offensive rebound but when he doesnt shoot that basketball Im not sure he should get two free throws on that North Carolina with their third team foul as the first one dribbles in for foster who is a grat out of Brooklyn only 47 at the Music line Clemson of course going all the way to the elite eights of last years NCAA tournament there were those who didnt think they even belonged in the field and yet they went all the way to the elite eight and lost to a team and Alabama they of course go on to the final four that they had beaten previously and what was the best win for the ACC in the ACC SEC challenge in the inaugural year and of course Clemson 20 in the challenge the only ACC team to be 2 and0 another rebound for the Tigers theyre out rebounding North Carolina 11 to3 particularly on the offensive glass been a big issue for North Carolina all season long yes a telling stat in their wins and losses good shredding to De its locking coming out of nowhere but the follow will up and in by Luben thats another area where locking truly helps his tiger team had three blocks on Saturday but that time V Allen Luma coming in getting the second chance points for his second basket of the Music game Jones thought about it put the head down he lost it picked up by Trimble Trimble on the return lays it up and in and hes off to the foul line Trimble at the line line where he makes 83 Tar Heels with Su NC State Virginia FSU Miami and Virginia Tech of course Duke as well left on their schedule and we see a switch up right here OB North Carolina going to go with the diamond one 1211 pressure hes try to get it trap and see if they can find a way to turn Clemson over and it works just like that Mish handling the basketball by Hunter Jackson with a scoop follow wont drop comes right back for Trimble he stays with it and lays it in and only out of the timeout so one possession for Hubert Davis but it absolutely works as SE trial was now up to seven points making his impact on this game coming up 15 against pit hit multiple threes in that one for the first time since November November game against Auburn no se tro actually leads North Carolina in rebounding which is very rare Drake Pow with the big rejection on the other side but give Foster credit for stick to it and banks in two but you talking about pow before the game as maybe a pick to click tonight I believe he could be the guy and hes getting the job done weve seen him making multiple effort plays on the defensive end but Clemson continues to respond that basketball is off Van Jackson and he he didnt go after it thinking that he was going to get that call but higher did a great job getting his hand in knocking that basketball off of Jackson great cut but Drake pal coming over denying that opportunity but miles Foster getting in picking up the offensive rebound and putting it back for two fou to McDonalds AllAmerican from Pittsboro North Carolina and Zachary to set it up leads this team and steals great Music defender Chase Hunter to drive it back off to his brother Dylan with a shot clock down the one he passed it up they got to get a shot in the air and they do not not in time strong stance defensively by the tar Hills normally when Chase hunter gets a head of steam going downhill he gets all the way to the rim but North Carolina did a great job building that wall not allowing him to get that easy look you asked him after the game against D cuz he made a running shot a driving shot that really sealed the deal he had been hitting a lot of Threes but he missed a bunch of them earlier in the week we against Georgia Tekken you said did you have a conversation with your coach Brad brell about that and the Really meaningful shot down the end of the game you know about driving it instead of settling for the three said they they did yeah and Brad bro also told us that he trust Chase to make the right decision but again the Memphis game and in the Georgia Tech game he settled for threes in overtime late games and it didnt work out but once he puts his head down going to the rim it is hard to stop him from getting the shot he wants back out for Davis shot clock to eight as he flips it up there and hits the triple and thats just a great individual play great offense beats good defense every time Dylan Hunter play good defense but RJ played great offense locking with another three on the way and hes hot here in the first half hes been the guy OB and he carried them offensively in that win over the Blue Devils and now nine points with Victor locking off from beyond the threepoint Applause Arc Big Time defensive play once again for the Tigers heres Hunter to launch it and a three defense into Applause offense El he an El Carolina looking for the answer downstairs a quick strike for Luben but thats the concern when when you play against Clemson can can you make enough twos to beat them when theyre making threes at this clip six of nine from Beyond The Ark and they will foul Zachary on his way to the Applause 10 RJ Davis going off the bounce great individual move to knock down the three but not to be outdone on the other end of the floor Victor lockin knocking down his third threepoint field goal of the day and Chase Hunter getting involved into action the three in transition the Clemson Tigers right now six of nine from Beyond The Arc Obie they were only four of 10 against Duke it was the emphasis of getting the basketball inside but you can see they want to use that three as a weapon here today but for a lot of that game they were shooting about 58 in total and coming up next number six Houston taking on Baylor and only the fourth match up ever between the kougars and the Bears and is coming up at nine ESPN Zachary with another one and extends the lead Applause 2825 Kau had seven assists against pit on Saturday Luben with a dribble down left to just Applause short Zachary denied on the Baseline out for Chase hunter in his sixth year for Clemson locking again little bounce up and in for two more hes been a goto guy for them thats his first basket inside the paint hes already knocked down three threes but when he gets his opportunities he can absolutely show off his F skill thats a lot of what he did against the Blue Devils on Saturday Davis did not cut and that one thrown out of play by Kad Absolut Ely hilarious hes the funniest guy on the team and hes done it before a little bit in Russia I would absolutely go see that now Im not sure Im going to buy a ticket but I would absolutely take my comp ticket to go watch Victor locking on stage oh another one here you may be buying a ticket to see him play this game at a very high level he may have to put his second career on hold to go pick up a third career he is showing that he has the Inside Out touch that could possibly give him an opportunity to play at the next level Davis around the back gives it up for the wing jumper but that wont drop for Withers 3225 locking open again man is he feeling it another threepointer I tell you what OB has he had himself a 48 Hours the first half tonight what he did against the Blue Devils on Saturday picker locked in is absolutely locked in underneath a quick strike for Davis and give him seven points although kind of quiet in the early Music going Chase Hunter wants to get into it blocking again another touch back out Hunter off a terrific fake gives it up for Zachary cant drain it but they gave up two good shots to get a great shot thats a great shot for Jane Zachary it doesnt go down but you love the way this Tigers team is sharing the basketball and playing for each other you can see the importance of sharing that Brad Brownell has placed on this Applause team Davis drives it Scoops it off the window it wont fall for him and sheflin Scoops it up thats a tremendous recovery by the Tigers as well with locking going for the block shot youve got to get other guys back in to come up with a defensive rebound of course none better than Ian shefin to be to pick it up Jake Hy breeder gives it up and a difficult shot he made it shefin will also be headed to the line looking for a threepoint play now we really havent called his name a whole lot but on this play a really tough shot and a nice play by H breeder to attack draw two Defenders and then find Ian sheflin in the painted area goes to the opposite hand the left to finish opportunity for the n one and again theres not much we can say about shefin with Victor locking dominating the way he has in this game now the much anticipated Laker debut of Luca tonight at ESPN ESPN plus and Disney plus Lakers hosting Utah our coverage begins at 1030 Eastern 730 Pacific take me a little while to get used to that uniform Luca in the 77 speaking of the Lakers this gu to knows a little bit about the Lakers of course former general manager of the Los Angeles Lakers and North Carolina great Mitch cup came over and talked to us pregame little conversation said hi to you the son works for the Atlanta Hawks and so of course he was formerly the GM of the Charlotte Hornets now meeting his son halfway to come check out the game Withers taking it in strong and before the shots and Brad Brown count that Brad Brownell is upset with Lee cell on the other side he responded quickly about that bucket being counted yeah theyre going to wave It Off and a good job by Roger a coming over and having a consult there and they wav this off cuz its way before the shot but they know the NBA promo we just showed it cuz thats a bucket at the NBA thats called continuation but in college basketball Roger a is letting us know no basket Dylan Hunter with the foul 3827 NBA draft Big Board rankings were talking about Drake pow moments ago and jackon but I can tell you right now there everyone here watching is going to walk away saying hey we need to take a look at Victor Locker this big fella might have an opportunity look at pile handle the ball too witherss on the Baseline and a shove right along that line with N9 seconds on the shot Applause clock and in support of the 68 senior Ian shefflin for the Tigers got Dicky B to wear one of those the other day that didnt take a lot of arm twisting Ill tell you that right at home again not mad at that at all and a great marketing tool they did such a great job for Dicky the other day welcoming him back Davis with a Fall Away knocks it down and a once again a nice individual play by RJ Davis who has nine points but Obie look how difficult it is for him to get looks were talking about the ACC Player of the Year a season ago and was averaging over 20 points per game its been a struggle for him to get those opportunities and the lack of an interior presence has allowed teams to really hone in defensively on RJ really missed Armond Bott all season long lock and again hes been too much to handle so far and look at what the interior presence does for the Tigers on the other end of the floor other guys get an opportunity to eat because lockin is able to dominate in the post good penetrating spins it up and in for two most of the Carolina shots have been really tough they really have and you got to think about the fact that lockin is in the painted area he does the job defensively as well already with a couple blocks in this game Jackson ready to come back on knocked in by Zachary gives him about 11 points a game kadoo again over the top it was intended for Washington and turn over see if locking gets Another Touch here he is Im shocked hes not looking at the basket OB if Im shooting it that well Im absolutely looking every opportunity to be able to get his shot up hes in the lane for a short one it rolls around and out he gets it back and two more and give Dylan Hunter a tremendous amount of credit getting his hand on the basketball knocking it free from North Carolina ends up in the hands of Victor lockin who gets the easy layup he has 20 here in the first half hes tired OB hes gased right now put him in pick and roll action po will lift one lockin going to chase it got to it in the corner yeah not too tired to be able to go get the possession back Victor lockin needs this media timeout bad but I tell you what nothing gives you a boost of energy more so than getting an open look Dylan Hunter Zachary locken and didnt get the cut he expected by Wiggins hes Wes our coach so Im not going to mess that up and Brad blame me for losing a game they beat Duke when I didnt go and so Im not going until I do a game that they dont win and youre just a little superstitious yourself shot clock down to eight Davis fires an Aaron pass thats happened several times here in the first half where in North Carolina now locken was a little bit windy but man is he playing his tail off 22 points 9 of 12 against Duke and that was over the 40 minutes already 20 tonight yeah and again he has been the focal point and one thing I can tell coach Greenberg is the point has absolutely been to get the basketball inside you see going inside to Chanty Wiggins and we know Brad Brownell very well hes going to find wherever the mismatch is for his team they EX Ed Duke on the interior 40 points in the paint for them and they were trying to attack as well early in this one but they started knocking down threes which allowed him to build a 14point lead North Carolina trying to make a run here in the last 90 seconds Powell into the paint with a turnaround too strong but chy Wiggins able to slide his feet and the size Advantage for Wiggins at 61 absolutely shows up when he contests shots Hunter just kept on driving a very determined move for two and now the biggest lead for the Tigers up by 16 and it be the up 16 and we really havent had to talk much about Chase hunter or Ian shein the two stars for this Tigers team because Victor lockin has pretty much taken Applause over Jackson body to body with Zachary shot clock a factor down to five Davis crosscourt tough pass heres pile shot another one and done but great job defensively by the Tigers blitzing RJ Davis forcing a tough pass he delivers it to Drake po but its up against the shot clock in a contested hand and right now the Clemson Tigers fire huge on Saturday doing it again inside Little John the student section North Carolina hasnt scored in over three and a half minutes last half minute of play before the break Chase Hunter 44 beyond the threepoint line shefflin shot clocked to seven shefflin keeps on driving it and Scoops into that is a big body too and a body I think that dbo would love to have somewhere on his front line well hes only in eight against Georgia Tech this week he had 20 rebounds against Kentucky last last seconds of the half North Carolina has gone four minutes without a point Kad with a bump and ends that drought time for a heave Zachary got it off but its going to be well short but that first half was mostly all Clemson 4933 at the break and theyve gotten everything theyve wanted on the offensive end of the floor of Carolina can recover RJ Davis with a bounce here for tremble and a quick whistle as Hunter went over and fouled him and OB of course Im always working on my officiating I had a conversation with my guy Roger SS earlier about what I didnt think should have been two free throws attempted by Miles Foster but Roger SS explained to me the difference between the NBA game and the college game any upward motion even with you dont let the basketball go is still going to be two free throws so once again I was wrong but you know thats okay doesnt happen very often you tend to work a lot in the NBA as well that is out for kadoo Here Comes Davis on the penetration hell scoop it in RJ Davis getting downhill the question for North Carolina is can they start to get something going from Beyond The Arc they were only two of eight in the first half from Beyond the threepoint line and now you see them back defensively in a Zone trying to find a way to slow down this Clemson Tiger team RJ with 11 and a quick strike again Hunter on target they have been shooting the threes and playing Zone against a team thats shooting 388 from Beyond The Arc in ACC play is different as Victor lockin becomes Victor blocking on the interior OB hes getting it done on both ends of the Applause floor Elliot Kad trying to attack but Victor lockin playing center field his third block of the evening thus far so not just doing it offensively getting it done defensively as well triple trying to get free underneath but cant knocked away from Applause him Jaden Zachary very heady point guard lock and dishing down for shefflin and hell draw the foul in the opening seconds of the second half Tigers coming off a giant win the upset over number two Duke on this floor and then a court storming along with Dicky be in the house on Saturday how many link connection do you have and then heading right back at it against another in North Carolina on big Monday Dylan Applause Hunter Hunter will pull up and pop around and out it goes locky keeping it alive yeah once again tapping the basketball out cant get his hands on it for offensive rebound just Taps it back out to a teammate and now they can set up another possession Chase Hunter taking a look at a shot clock entry for locking back out Hunter hell driving dish Zachary off the fake and shefflin still working still working trying to keep it alive hits the deck Davis tore it away RJ Davis and blocked Chase Hunter outstanding defense and a tangle and a foul shefflin going body to body there with Jaylen Withers OB in preparation for this weekend I watched a lot of Clemson basketball and one thing you often see is Chase Hunter with Chase down blocks and he comes up with another one here RJ Davis thinking hes got an easy layup Chase Hunter gaining ground coming up with a big block denying that opportunity withs picked up the foul its a great point because he did it on Saturday too in the waning seconds of the big win what would have been a opportunity for North Carol for Duke to tie or take a lead in that game he comes up with another chase down block Hunter just threw that one away right to Davis hell lead the break difficult angle lays it in and and Lockton was trailing that one looking for an opportunity but a great job by RJ Davis using that left hand getting it on the glass and another bucket in transition for RJ I may not feel like it but Davis is 13 well hes been really all the offense for North Carolina but hes had to work so hard to get his buckets we talked about how many of them have just been great individual plays in the first half Zachary going airborne and a blocking foul as he hits it hes headed to the Applause line so count that basket hell be shooting for the threepoint play and JayZ attacking the rim Jaylen Withers getting in position however you have to be there even earlier than that we watch RJ Davis with the nice touch with the left hand in transition but you mentioned it Obie RJ with 13 points the only player in double figures for the tar Hills and hes six of eight from the field septum will three for five other than that no one else is shooting close to 50 so the all the offense has come from those two guys Withers who got the start tonight just picked up his third foul for North Carolina kadoo cant get it to go but there is a foul on the play stops the clock at 1715 left here at Little John North Carolina in danger of losing their 11th game of the season and falling to seven and six in the ACC tons of time left to turn this around but in a sizable hole now Dylan Hunter with foul number two and so Elliot KOB be at the line hes a 70 foul shooter the sophomore from New Jersey Only Hits 30 from threepoint land and a lot of teams simply elect to play off him and dare him to hit that shot and Ben Allen Luben clapping up his teammate outside of that you dont see a lot of Life on this North Carolina bench right now Huber Davis is up hes going to be energetic but at some point its going to have to be someone in uniform up encouraging his teammates to try to help them make a run here on the road 5537 Clemson locking over the top off the backboard shefin caught it into the corner for hunters that was in and out that would have been too much I mean again the pass off the glass to kick it off for the three that would have been a little too much if Chase is able to knock that one down youre begging if you think that should happen right Davis fires it up there but no pal kept it alive and that one goes down for kadu and again not his Forte its really not North Carolinas but got that one in but the Tar Hill bench did stand up theyre applauding and again this is a time where I would like to see them up encouraging their team while theyre on the defensive end of the floor seeing if they can get some energy going within their team locking with another touch going to work and blocked good defense there by Washington to stay right in his face Davis finding Powell and a foul by Hunter and a 15point lead for Clemson youre talking about Hubert Davis who said on his radio show Carolina plans to hire a general manager and support staff in this era of nil and the portal he said the old model for North Carolina doesnt work anymore and again Hubert also told us earlier today that when he took the job he wasnt really about the general manager position being a part of what they do because he grew up in an era where Dean Smith was the guy and Dean Smith ran everything it its completely different model in todays game he now understands the need to have someone else in there to be able to take some of the responsibility off him as the head coach not only from a recruiting standpoint but also to help with the student athlete experience in Chapel Hill boy got to make your foul shots right there missed four straight college ball nonnegotiables have to change your management style got to have a GM roster construction is huge weve heard John shy and Duke talk about that a lot this year as often as we have covered them how important it was on the drive H breeder denied knocked out of play then itll be Clemson ball and the most important one of all that list for the University of North Carolina nil bring a different element and you have to have someone that can concentrate solely on that Hunter has to get a shot up with a shot clock winding down and down it goes for three he has 11 Kau trying to weave his way through will draw the foul with 15 23 to go Seth tro able to knock down the three ball now North Carolina three of 10 and thats been a struggle for them this is now the the fourth game in a game in a five game stretch where they play on the road with the one game at Pittsburgh in between and they lost the first three row games and a lot of it has to do with their lack of shooting from Beyond a threepoint r when theyre on the road Clemson by 18 Davis with a bounce feed Kad downstairs pile going up strong for two nice play by Elliot Kad getting in there and hes had a few miscues throughout this game Elliot cadell leads the ACC in conference play in turnovers and thats been one of the areas of concern for North Carolina as they get back in the zone defensively right now but the way clemon shooting the basketball zone is is absolutely dangerous when youve got so many shooters on the perimeter Ws got a nice look as he turns around and sticks it to his size 610 its a great View and Obi of course you grew up in the zone going to Syracuse watching Jim bahim with the Zone forever you know that when youve got a 610 guy in the middle that can shoot from around that elbow line elbow area its always dangerous to have someone like that on the inside of a Zone fou here you bring up ccus and Jim beheim the master of that zone a Hall of Fame coach but I think of roster construction like that acquiring guys who could play his style he was great at it he absolutely was one of the best in the business and you had at CCU at its best youre talking about guys like Ronnie celey Manning the Middle With Derek Coleman and Billy Owens on the outside but that roster construction has always been important the difference is theres dollars and cents tied to it today in comparison to before where you have to get a return on your investment that you didnt previously got to have that GM Washington has it poke free but hunter lost it Davis takes it back heres Jackson from the corner he got an excellent look there and knocked out of play itll be Clemson ball and the Tigers sitting pretty here with 14 minutes to go at Music home waiting for kadu seven points five assists and four turnovers you know one of our questions for Clemson would be would they have a hangover after that huge win against the Blue Devils on Saturday theres been none of that from the players now Im not going to say that wasnt the case from the crowd because this crowd is nowhere near as loud but you can only imagine how they partied on Saturday night Carolina forcing to turnover on the run out heres RJ Davis to lay it in nice job by Kad leading Davis right into that layup throwing it ahead allowing him to track it down and get the easy one but North Carolina going to need many more of those miscues from the tig to try to get back into this one Clemson has popped back into the top 25 with todays national poll at number 23 on a way downtown and another great touch on it as it spins home and youre talking about the accs leading threepoint shooter in Chase Hunter and so to see him make big shots like that is nothing rare to this Clemson crowd now North Carolina missing the two and coming up in 13 minutes to go the Tigers trying to run them out of Little John here tonight on a big Monday Baylor and Houston to come shefflin with the swing Hunter again and hes starting to feel it hes getting into a shooting Groove hes up to 16 points it was Victor lockin in the first half its Chase hunter in Sansa 2 and you see the all ACC guard going to work kdo on the move and the feed doesnt quite get there to pow fourth turnover for Elliot kadu and hes had multiple games where hes had three or more turnovers and again when you have the basketball in your hands that often youve got to be trusted by your coaches to make the right play Oh Hunter round the back shefin straight on 6544 the Tigers and both Zachary and lockin getting ready to report back on for Brad Applause brell way downtown Davis but Applause no another rebound for Clemson where they have dominated on the glass tonight Ill tell you what if the Tigers the way they played on Saturday and tonight if they keep playing like this they are going to be a handful for anybody and and Obie honestly I believe the loss to Georgia Tech was a huge wake up I honestly felt like the Tigers came into that game after having beat Georgia Tech by double digits in Atlanta thinking to themselves all we have to do is show up rejected by Applause Wiggins Davis trying to tiptoe that line but he cant do it and he turns it over and again thats a turnover on Kad he threw the basketball and put 11 points in the second half he has 16 for the game first half was the man with the ball Victor lockin who will draw the foul with had 1059 to go locken was on fire in the first 20 minutes he had 20 into the back court for Dylan Hunter the backup point guard except the last several Games been starting and you look at locking in the second half half is giving away the scoring load to chase Hunter off the fake of beauty going in strong with the kick heres Dylan Hunter and a whistle on the deck weve got a foul but let me tell you what I love about this Clemson team Victor lockin who got got it going in the first half he pump fakes he gets into the painted area he has all right to take that shot but he gives it up to the corner the one more pass and because they dont make it Ian is able to get inside position for offensive rebound a great offensive possession for the Tigers when locking could have been selfish but did not power the foul spin mve by locken the scoop no shefflin went for the board and tapped it right to North Carolina and Kad will set something up for the floundering Tarheels they have gone almost three and A2 minutes without a point Jackson trying to end that cant lay it in and its been a struggle for I Jackson as of late you mentioned scoreless on Saturday for the first time in his career and unable really to get much going here this evening as well oh what a move there by Zach and a blow by in a reverse for two just a veteran play by Jaden Zachary AKA JayZ who has a huge smile on his face hes kind of the uncle of this team OB hes one of the older guys but making plays with young legs Kido will knock it down but with n and a half minutes to go a dominating performance by Clemson and a reach around and a foul there by kadoo and Zachary with a beautiful move yeah attacking the basket the nice reverse and then as he goes against two freshman showing off his veteran Savvy and then the smile sticking out the tongue like MJ used to do back in the day running down the floor after he made a move as such Zachary had a good career at Boston College before transferring his career high at BC was 22 points guess who he did that against I would say Clemson and they really remembered yes they did when he was when he put his name in the portal they were right there to be the first team to call recognizing and and give r BR now a lot of credit for again identifying those guys that fit last year was Joe Gerard they needed shooting they bring in Joe Gerard he comes in and plays that role this year has been about defense JayZ doing a job defensively on that possession against the 2024 ACC player the year RJ Davis and wins that battle Locka will try a long one too strong this time Zachary with the rebound though and they continue to pound the glass and theyve got a big Advantage there and they have all night but one thing we havent seen we havent seen a lack of effort from RJ Davis one things for certain and RJ playing in his fifth year is absolutely been giving North Carolina everything that he possibly can as Seth Trimble gets the transition bucket Hubert Davis trying to urge his team to get up 94 ft under eight and a half to go here at Clemson High breeder on the attack will lay it in of course theyre expecting him to try a threepointer just kept on driving North Carolina defensively has let that happen way too often tonight yeah it life has been easy for Clemson on the offensive end shooting 51 for the game but OB they shot 59 against the best defensive team in the league and the Duke Blue Devils on Saturday so you got to give this Clemson Tiger team a lot of credit for what they can do offensively without a question Brad Brownell still coaching him up trying to orchestrate what he wants offensively while using time on the shot clock you might have thought coming off the great win against Duke and the court storming and everything else as Zachary pulls up and drains it that there might be a little bit of a let down not for a minute tonight for the Clemson Tigers well you think about all the different Veterans for the Tigers that have gotten going we saw Lockett in the first half Chase Hunter controls the beginning of the second half half and now look at what Jaden Zachary has done as of late they have different guys to step up at every moment and he comes up with one here Zachary on the attack Dylan Hunter sticks it he knocks down a three and this is turning into a runaway 7448 timeout there she is a proud mama Brandy Lewis of chaste for the wooden award but Reno with 20 double doubles which lead division one basketball Im not sure hes getting enough love for that I dont believe he is and I dont think Stanfords getting enough love for what theyre doing in year one of ACC play especially having to travel cross country to come over and battle against North Carolina and Duke Etc give them a lot of credit for the way they performed in year one many trips across the country a here with 1633 left 7448 biggest lead of the ball game here for the Clemson Tigers they are sailing here now one and two nationally so be a big match up when we see those two teams go at it and Auburn to the surprise of at least a few people remaining the number one team in todays top 25 Poll Alabama despite the huge victory over Florida over the weekend and it was very close in the voting but couldnt quite overcome Auburn and Duke dropping from number two to a tie in the number three position do you remember we talked about that in our game on Saturday if Duke were to lose and because Duke and Auburn have been the best teams nationally this year I dont have a problem with auburn remaining at number one and again Alabama has the losses that Duke and Auburn dont have and so when you consider that I like the way they did it North Carolina with some pressure Hunter will break that got the turn over on the first possession and we saw Carolina do this in the first half they got to turned over and able to score off of it but Hubert Davis backed it off now we most likely will see a lot of this one two11 pressure for the remainder of this game if they can score Dylan Hunter shot clock inside 10 the pass interrupted there by Kad as he went tumbling out right into the bench of the Clemson Tigers 49 on the shot clock and Ian sheflin coming back on now for Clemson nice of Bill Covington getting over there giving Elliot kadoo a hand up and again got to get a shot in the a fast Music 49 Wiggins turns and dries Slams on the brakes lost it draws the foul by Trimble thats a bailout Seth tremble upset with himself after that one knowing the shot clock is going down difficult shot for Tony Wiggins having to beat the much quicker tremble off the bounce couldnt get past him to get to the rim had to go to the midrange but Seth bailing him out sending him to the free throw line trembles first and Wiggins to shoot Wiggins out of Grayson Georgia he was high school teammates with Ian shefflin in Georgia those two find their way to Clems it together got to imagine that was a pretty good high school team didnt lose many like maybe one he has nine along with four rebounds heres tremble he cant bury that and again the Tigers crashing a glass I sheflin I think he elbowed Dylan Hunter on that rebound Dylan walking away holding his arm and now Roger AES and leasel will get together thats called friendly fire right there OB when your teammates hit you but Dylan Hunter is a intelligent young man he should be smart enough to know if Ian shefin gets his hands on the basketball get out of the way because he is going to do everything he can to protect the rebound North Carolina got it back but then quickly fumbled it away off Davidson out didnt affect Dylan Hunter doing the job defensively but you you see sheflin getting his hand on the basketball oh thats what it was a little hyperextension there got his hand in there over the shoulder of Ann Sheffer more pressure here from the Tarheels again broken now its Zachary to bounce it here for Dylan Chase on the Move off the fake draws the foul and hell be shooting here with about 5 and a half left OB its one thing about coaches they can never stop coaching dbo is not in this game but look at him checking time and score making sure that his team is doing what they need to do hes back in the Huddle checking once again time and score seeing what they need to do to operate on this end of the floor coaches cant stop coaching it doesnt matter whether their team is playing or not doesnt matter which sport it is and you want to talk about two guys that are connected great friends and Brad Brownell dbos Sweeney Brad Brownell is now I believe the longest tenur ACC head coach thats correct when you consider the fact that so many Leonard Hamilton he will beard Hamilton leaves yes correct whos announced that he will be stepping down at the end of the season good follow up up and in for two by Luben dabble by the way is is pretty talented among coaches on the pickup game and another quick strike by Carolina as Withers will lay it in he loves play basketball oh yeah and noon ball games especially when you get an opportunity to play here in Little John can absy of the teams that have won the most in the last 10 years in ACC play you got to throw Kevin Keats in the mix for the the run last year getting NC State to the final four but outside of that these are the coaches that have established the way that this league has handled his business over the last 15 years lockin inside no the rebound tipped by shefflin wont go loans been shut down in the second half after a tremendous first half in which he had 20 Applause points Clemson on top 7755 Music locker without a point here in the second half long one coming and a lot of iron but it wont drop for Hunter Davis off the fake against Hunter and swatted Away by locken and for what he hasnt done on the offensive end hes done it defensively and goes with the over the Rival North Carolina Tar Hills you know Seth said it you know during the first half when he had a studio hit with us and he was complimenting the Veterans for Clemson and he is so right it has showed up in a big way in this game hasnt he it really has and and thats one of the things is Seth Trimble took a hit in that trap I believe theyre going to get Dylan Hunter with the offensive foul but Dylan hits Seth with the back of his head Music so 341 to go its an ugly play yeah in the Trap Trimble reaches in doesnt get the basketball but Dylan Hunter trying Music Applause to I hitting that cylinder and it will give North Carolina the basketball back 20 on the shot Applause clock Davis to get it Applause in Gad and tipped out by Clemson so itll be Carolina ball great job defensively by Chase Hunter not giving up that Music Baseline tonights game checkin brought to you by All State Hunter has been a show in the second half with a dozen yeah Chase Hunter Jaden Zachary those two guys have really stepped up in the second half as Withers gets the offensive rebound give it to North Carolina theyre still playing with some effort but the execution hasnt been there witherss throwing that right to James Zachary we just mentioned the leadership that he and Chase Hunter have provided for this team in the second half thats been a difference in this game they went in the halftime with a big lead but when you have that type of Veteran leadership theyre not going to give that lead away 16 for Zachary averages Applause 11 the turn and fire and thatll rattle home for Davis RJ Davis now with 18 points has passed my guy Bryant stiff on the alltime leading ACC list in scoring thatll be tremble with a foul just over three minutes to go his second Ill tell you what though as well as Clemson has played you tip your cap to them first and foremost theyve played a terrific couple of games since you have been here at Clemson they absolutely have and again it starts with the way that they really play against whatever the matchup is when they play Duke they threw the ball inside they made sure to make Cooper flag make K malat have to work on the defensive end of the floor you come out in this game and North Carolina changed their lineup to try to match them up front Victor lockin knocks down three threes and all of a sudden Clemson shooting the basketball extremely well theyre 12 of 22 from Beyond The Arc which has been a weapon for them all year they didnt have to use it against Duke but they use it here today loocking commanding the ball spins to his right Banks it in his first points in the second half he was Sensational in the first 20 minutes and now another block for him thats his fifth of the game return on investment OB you go go to the portal you get Victor lockin and he gives you these type of performances in ACC competition backto back games where he has absolutely been a star of stars 22 points in the win over Duke on Saturday 22 points to match it here today four or five from Beyond the threepoint Arc five block shots to go along with six rebounds nine of 16 from the flo you couldnt have asked for anything more of Victor Lockett absolutely Jaden Zachary bounces it here for Chase Hunter and a slam and this is one happy building thats for sure certainly was on Saturday as they Rush the court after the victory over number two Duke your brothers heres Tyson and he cant knock that one down OB and for the second straight game Ian Jackson who had a string of 20point games Midway through the season hasnt scored yet he was 0 for three from the field on Saturday 0 for seven right now in this one that official timeout with the W has been outstanding for the Tigers now with a 23point lead here at home tying his season high with the five blocks Wiggins cant bury that and a whistle with a minute 32 to go as hiy breeder hit the deck but he commits a foul and if it stays like this for the Tigers it will be their largest margin of Victory ever against North Carolina you know there was a time where Clemson couldnt beat North Carolina well that was in Chapel Hill but they went to Chapel Hill last year and got a win and right now Brad Brownell has his team confident that they can beat the tar Hills wherever they are and they absolutely showed up and played like a confident team here this evening man did they ever 6 62 points for North Carolina so weve talked a lot about their defense tonight but the offense has certainly not been explosive either Ian Jackson his first two points in the last two games and again Carolina needs his production to be successful Hy breeder turns and fires and knocks that down had a career at Air Force before coming to Clemson tell you what you got to be in shape to play there Jackson off the side of the Applause backboard and the fans all around Little John standing up they did a lot of this on Saturday and theyre up again with less than a minute to play against North Carolina they have had a whole lot of fun these last three days what a recovery too for the Tigers who lost in triple overtime against Georgia Tech on Tuesday here that was a stunner and Brad branell will tell us that his team was not looking ahead to Duke but human nature shows when youve got a team that can play like this on this floor once again they beat Kentucky here in early December they beat the Blue Devils theyre going to get a win here today against the tar Hills theres no way you can tell me that they did not take Georgia Tech lightly and again that reason theyre tied with Louisville with the two losses in ACC play but they will go down to the wire with the Blue Devils to see who is the ACC champion this will be a quad one for the Tigers itll also be their 20th win of the season they will improve to 20 and five on the run out and a whistle as Jackson went up for the Layin hell be headed to the foul line L didnt touch him go back to road so the ACC regular season title very much up for grabs again after what the Tigers did to Duke and now theyre putting another one in the win column and theyll improve to 132 in the ACC and playing their best basketball and of course no stranger to going and getting wins on the road so Brad Brownell understands that his defense will travel not scared at all of any environment that theyll see on the road Thomas spinning inside comes out free to Powell up ahead and Tyson will lay it in K Tysons brother Hunter play to Clemson Hunters probably going to reach out to Kade after this one 8565 Clemson drubbing North Carolina tonight on a big Monday they knock off Duke and North Carolina in backto back games here at Little John Coliseum and a crowd loving it here and so is Brad ronell as they improve to 20 and five Clemson playing great basketball on the year
