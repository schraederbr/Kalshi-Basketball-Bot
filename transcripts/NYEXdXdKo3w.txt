and Louisville will control first sky Clark brings it up he missed the last two games with a rib injury in fact hes going to play through a broken rib the rest of the way last time out Louisville against pit did not have a point guard no Tyler Johnson either he was out with a concussion Johnson back today in an early turnover for Louisville live ball turnovers have been their issues as we look at the starting five for the Irish coach told you about Marcus Burton Braden Shrewsberry is head coach Micah shrewbury son and Tay Davis coming off 17 last time out against Georgia Tech and Im going to be anxious to see how Carrie Booth plays tonight hes going to have to be a force in this game offensively defensively and especially on that glass starting lineups for Louisville sky Clark is back Mike James the teams leading score he gets blocked and Brandon Huntley Hatfield averaging 15 and8 over his last 17 there is Shrewsberry using the shot fake step back three good he has improved so much hes improved his range and he already had very good range I asked michah Shrewsberry when did you start to develop that type of range with him he said the third grade when he went to the NBA louville goes to work on offense and it looks like Notre Dames in a Zone well they are but really what theyre trying to do is protect theyre doubling off the Forman theyre backed off I think theyre going to live with a shot like that their double is the thing were going to watch for tonight because I think they plan on doubling everything that goes into the post neither team shoots the three especially well and thats too easy for Huntley Hatfield absolutely hes gotten so much better at the elbow area with a jump shot but that time he didnt waste the jump shot he put the ball on the floor got to the Applause rim Kei over to Marcus Burton one area where Notre Dame has cleaned it up over the last two games they havent turned it over as much only 14 turnovers in those two games combined they average about 13 a game in Music conference Louisville wearing its Black History Month jerseys entry pass to Huntley Hatfield theres the double shot clock down to eight down low to Glenn left it short nice play and they were short at getting to the double which allowed Caleb Glenn to go to that left shoulder with his right hand and try to put that shoulder bump on that Kenny Payne teaches so well Shrewsberry green lights another three thats a great sign not only is Micah Shrewsberry being the father but the coach when you see shots like that go in and right now Kenny Paynes got to make sure they are not behind his screens and Notre Dame came into the game as the worst shooting team in the ACC is Louisville gets the Applause Music Applause answer nice curl theyve tightened up already on Shrewsberry and Burton will draw the foul on the jumper theyll get sky Clark his first now watch shwb now as he comes off of this hes ready to play he takes a shot fake step back stays in his shot holds his follow through Brandon Huntley Hatfield on the other end theyre in their ice defense theyre trying to force it to the Baseline he goes exactly where hes supposed to be and that elbow area drives it into the lane for an easy two explain what you mean by Ice defense well what theyre icing what they want to do on the side is they want to force everything to the Baseline and what you cant do is hold have your screener there too long so theyre releasing early Brandon Huntley Hatfield goes to set the screen they worked on it hard today they see that theyre going to double when the ball gets driven he gets to the Elbow they were able to execute a pocket pass and a pocket pass is basically a pass thats thrown under your knee and received under the receivers knee they executed it perfectly Notre Dame defensively has been pretty strong most of the Season that has been their calling card offense comes and goes as James contested no good Glenn cant pull down the rebound Here Comes T Davis SE Hall transfer on the drive hutley Hatfield gotten the away Clark looking for Glenn the pass behind him wis open nice drive nice kick Glenn for three no good Caleb Glenn one for seven on the season from Deep youre getting good looks though that was an open look youve got to take that shot the worst thing he could have done is try to drive that into traffic shrew Berrys got six J down low good position on Huntley Hatfield nice play a big part of Notre Dames offense is the game gets moving are those Twan actions on the side hoping that theyll get some type of two on two type of action that worked out perfectly for him white Catch and Release got it Trey white the US C transfer last four games averaging 17 and N with a pair of double doubles and you like to see that he set his cut up it was a solid screen but he set the cut up he created some distance off the screen got a wide open look cabaji the Penn State transfer followed Mel shrewbury to South Bend and its big to Big theres Carrie boo beautiful play by Carri booth and Marcus Burton channeled his inner John Stockton with the screen a bit of a move moving screen but he got away with it I like that theyre going to let these guys play tonight hudley Hatfield puts it on the floor through the double team and gets the roll thats whats made Brandon Huntley hat feel better thats why hes averaging these points in the last five games cuz hes assertive hes on the attack hes not wasting time hes not wasting dribbles hes not overthinking hes attacking he had a game in early January against pit only have three points in that game and Kenny Payne told him hey this is not acceptable since then hes become a consistent double digit scorer for Louisville well thats the number one thing thats affected him in his career and and look look at how quick he is getting right back up see in the past he drop his head almost a three in the key Clark from the outside a beautiful pass Brandon Hunley Hatfield the people that have followed him that have helped build his curve theyve been waiting for this assertive guy to take off Kenny Payne I know he has those fights every once in a while they try to get it out of him but he is getting it out of him a former fivestar top 25 recruit heres Burton through the sequa oh this is a phys field again defensively Ive seen five fouls we havent called I love it lets play no stops in the action wake the echo of the old Big Applause East good choice in the pass Bradon Huntley Hadfield with that kind of distance between him and his Defender would have took a tough shot Clark zigging zagging white off the shot fake falling away and this time they called it well they had to call that theyre going to protect the shooter theres no doubt about that lets watch this now Shrewsberry comes off lines it up stays in his shot knocks it down beautiful jump shot the back screen from John Stockton Burton gets the dunk for Carrie booth in the paint family Christmas card or Christmas present list by wearing red tonight wear it another time Shrewsberry also played his college ball at Hanover Which is less than an hour from here you can tell where hes got his discipline his mom and dad they are uh uh obviously they did a great job raising that family so awesome to see them here one of the first year head coaches in this league he took over for Mike Bray who had been in South Ben for more than two decades and you look at Notre Dames roster from a season ago they started four graduate students this year youre starting three freshman two sophomores it is a young team in an era where its hard to be young well and and I say this and I I never use this term lightly hes a teacher and what he did is he not he didnt just hire recruiters he hired guys that can teach the game and Ive had the the good fortun to see two walkthroughs now in the last two weeks I mean you can see it in the development they have a patience with this guys with these group but they will not let them not be responsible for trying to play the right way playing hard and playing unselfish good defensive recovery by the Irish Huntley Hatfield called for the travel its a good call I thought he was going to get back to his left shoulder right hand jump hook spin because thats really something that he loves to do but I love the fact that he is playing assertive that hes playing aggressive no body language playing with confidence Matt Zona into the game for Notre along with JR kzn changes everything with Matt zone and not only does he roll but he can step out pop and make a three Burton gets trapped under the trees and turns it over thats the kind of mistake Micah Shrewsberry its its a double barrel mistake he he wanted the foul on the way up and then there was nobody there for him to throw that outlet pass to on the right side I think hes a little bit more little more myth that was not a foul called on the way up Burton takes it away at five steals last time out pulls up and missed completely kesn there to clean up Burton took a very risky shot Brandon Huntley Hatfield did a great job getting back getting his hand up thats where youd like to see Marcus Burton shake and bake and get to the rim off one more Applause dribble Bo he got a foul on kesn Notre Dame up by two on the road 1153 to go opening half file 100 is going to be uh foaming at the mouth to get back and score some points and their defense usually causes problems for uh North Carolina to get into the paint Virginia got waxed on Monday by Virginia Tech you just dont see a Tony Benet coach team lose by that kind of margin no what A Tale of Two Mondays with what they did to Miami the week before then to have it done to him week later Miami what couldnt break 40 look at that quickness by Caleb Glenn he didnt get it but thats how quick he is he is an out of his area rebounder and theyve got Glenn defending up top against Davis was a good match up because Davis can start their offense I mean we we may get to the end of the half and hell bring the ball full court trying to create a play great pass great pass by Tay Davis he is a skilled player he can dribble he can pass hes getting better as a shooter he can make plays in the lane hes a roller Sean Hall transfer an Indiana native Tyler Johnson who missed the last game with a concussion back out there hes a spark plug Off the Bench a freshman white contested three over kesn no good tough shot by white he shot it but he faded to his left he didnt give himself give himself a chance to make that Burton one for three now Davis spinning inside and turbines to the rack for two thats quick he has improved again were focused on the Freshman but he has improved so much really since Christmas thats when hes really started to make a jump in the ACC he figured it out and they can play through him they can do a lot with him had 17 points last time out against Georgia Tech and Huntley half field kisses it off the window nice lift that that is is the Improvement that is where Kenny Payne has done a fantastic job of making these players and making this team better this time of year you want to be heading towards playing your best basketball its not as much about the record for Louisville are they getting better Hunley Outfield may have gotten away with a foul he had his arm draped around the waist of Tay Davis as as a coach I judge your team so much on are you getting better do they still look like theyre enjoying playing when I watch Kenny Payne run practice today when he makes points theyre listening theyre authoritative there theres a demand to what he does the passing got sloppy early on in the practice he stepped right in it picked right up that thats the sign of a guy that knows what hes doing and hes improving his team hes improving their individual skills and hes getting them to play more unselfish doesnt mean theyre playing great doesnt mean theyre playing efficient doesnt mean theyre making the shots but theyre playing better kzne the three at the other end xan Payne Kenny Paynes son into the game pay launches in and out rebound kesn Louisville has done a really good job of getting matched up they havent dealt with all the screens row of it theyve done a good job getting matched cuz you have got to be prepared for quick threes in transition Notre Dame kzn puts it on the floor against the Freshman Curtis Williams Williams got a Applause piece Johnson pulls up too strong something to watch here coach Notre Dames three out of five in the early going from Deep defending the three of late has been an issue for Louisville it it has I mean there is no doubt they havent made many threes and theyre giving up far too many in the last four games but they have a break right now cuz Bren Shrewsberry is not on the floor Bo but Carri boo is a 26 threepoint shooter even though 60 of his shots are from Deep the Irish four of six from Beyond The Arc despite being the worst threepoint shooting team in the ACC if we dont talk and thats an example of it right there yeah you saw the somethings got to give sidebar Notre Dame comes into the game last in the ACC in offensive efficiency Louisville last in the ACC in defensive efficiency Huntley Hatfield kicks it out to pay and he misfires Louisville one of seven from downtown and to further the point in the last three games Louisville 10 for 45 from three yeah thats just not thats why when youre shooting 78 from the foul line that is one of the most important things you can try to get to because youre just going to get frustrated if youre missing threes especially when youre being defended well there but thats where you want to get the ball to the rim offensive rebound those Miss threes try to get to the foul line Roper puts it up and on the flip side against Pittsburgh Louisville gave up 15 threes on 31 attempts they gave up 11 threes on 20 three attempts to BC free throw opportunity coming 2414 Irish tonight 9 Eastern on ESPN we send you out to Baton Rouge Antonio Reeves and number 17 squaring off against LSU thats number 17 Kentucky and LSU trying to make it two straight wins against top 25 teams is it so Marty Gro isnt it always well yeah that will be a festive Pete Movic Center tonight one way or the other very festive even if its not it is even if its not it is some of the best pizza slices Ive ever had baton downtown Baton Rouge what was the time of night uh late late late and the slices were very inexpensive I was hungry and I went back I went back again Burton trying to make his way around Tyler Johnson shrewbury knocked down a couple of early threes Burtons the top scoring freshman in the ACC Logan Imes back to Shrewsberry freshman to freshman and thats three triples for Braden Shrewsberry beautiful action we may get to go back and see that but great recognition by two freshman recogniz and Brandon Huntley Hatfield trying to force the switch getting it making two extra passes wide open three heres white working on IMS and Trey white gets the deuce to put an end to what was a 90 Notre Dame run thats exactly what you have to do if youre Louisville right now lets not shoot jump shots lets not take challenge shots lets get the ball in the paint whether by the post or the Applause drive Booth inside J the follow and a foul on the floor before the shot watch this setup now watch as we get into to this action okay theres the pass one dribble kick they had just recognized the switch they got Brandon Huntley Hatfield in the switching action the next pass goes to a Bren Shrewsberry again the communication Louisville not where it needs to be but the quick thinking quick acting of Notre Dame paid off watch the hand off to Burton here there it is they were looking for the switch good job by Huntley Hatfield theyre in the ice coverage forcing him down no good Burton rebound sky Clark thats sometimes what Burton does he does not get enough lift on his step back thats thats an area hes got to continue to improve Huntley Hatfield wants it they get it to him there you go theres the double picked up his dribble thats what you cant do nice kick out there hes able to see over the Trap Mike James leading score for Louisville quiet so far no points 0 for four from the field and he turns it over you got to come through there youre like a running back when you get into the paint you got to protect the ball when you come in Davis Around Huntley Hatfield everything but the make heres James the other way Hunley Hatfield puts it on the floor off the window plus Applause one that is a beautiful play and Ill tell you why not just because he made the basket but because he drove the ball with his left hand dropped his right shoulder did put it back in his right hand he was not doing that earlier in the year he was not doing that at Christmas time he has improved his handle hes improved his drive we were talking in the break and you said Notre Dames going to continue to double the post The Bigs for Louisville will have to dribble theyll have to dribble out they have to dribble basically up I should say you dont want to dribble out towards the Baseline sideline you want to dribble up towards the wing you want to make the pass and then you want to Sprint back into the paint and now you get a single Music coverage the last thing you want to do against a post double is dribble it once and pick it up when youre down by the Baseline sideline area or especially the Baseline now its a now its a triple team because you have nowhere to Pivot because the Baseline is right there Tyler Johnson picked up the foul only three team fouls on both Applause sides shrewsburys got nine three from Deep ims the freshman and that is going to go the other way its a good play I tell you what with Notre Dame right now the guards are screening better than the bigs are and and thats important that your guards can screen The Bigs are not giving getting getting the freedom that they need which is allow and Louisville theyre not even really fighting through the screen theyre just brushing it and going by him and theyre then theyre matched up and its making a little bit harder there for Notre Dame good defense by Louisville Clark white Huntley Hatfield James and Glenn on the floor for Louisville Huntley Hatfield no good good play though thats that forcing the ball to the side or to the to the to the sideline Baseline action the ice action Huntley ha was where he needed to be Burton pulls up left it short again battle for the board Roper had jump offall possession arrow Notre Dame what happens to Burton a lot of times when he shoots that pullup hes got a high release its a high arch he extends it but he tries to shoot it over length too much watch this he gets it up but hes trying to shoot it over the length that thats not a good shot thats not a good shot I love the idea but take one more dribble get to the rim or take that dribble and kick it out Burton so far one for five hes got four points hes led the team in scoring in five straight and eight of the last nine games as the officials are trying to get the clock right right now were looking at when you to line up high like this were looking at some type of roll back action hand back to Burton this is where hes good space is wide open Shrewsberry open no good Glen skies for the caram Applause hudley Hatfield wanted it was upset clarkton go his way now white the pull up and the rebound to Shrewsberry see thats where Glenn has got to get on the glass youre not going to beat anybody with one man offensive rebounding against three other people Glenns got to get to the glass that was not a good shot by Trey white he was open but hes fading to his left theyve got to find a way to get hat uh set here early in the clock Burtons three not there rebound Clark throw it ahead throw the ball ahead dont always get into the drag dribble where the Notre Dame defense is sitting there waiting on you CLK hits or turn around and shoot the pullup because the defense backed off what do I Applause know 60 Run for louiso the Irish have missed their last six skot Clark needed to see one go go in coming back off that rib injury Shrewsberry from 15 in and out not a bad shot but right now youre giving this lead up because youre taking tougher shots Clark works the Baseline Huntley Hatfield retrieves nice pass finds a cutting white who gets Two Shots see thats where Trey white is good 2022 Louisville trying to make it three straight home wins something they have not done in conference play since 2021 well I think this is a situation right now where its hard to score for Louisville theyre getting some pullup jump shots you got some guys that are used to scoring that are not scoring theyre getting some random basketball I think theyve got to loosen it up with some of their what they call their Memphis action where its up high and we get some handoffs into some quick ball screens or even just get into a high middle ball screen to try to free this paint up a little bit get something off a roll rather than off a straight post up where the double is coming quickly from Notre Dame theyre well drilled on how quick they want to double and the free throws thats been a big part of this Louisville offense All Season Kenny Payne telling us before the game attack the lane get to the foul line that is a huge component of this offense 20 your great offensive strengths at 78 in the league mat Zone up looked good when he left its hand and the rebound to Trey White good read good swing this is exactly how they drew it up another roll nice play Emanuel cor for throws it up hes got two shots coming only nine free throw attempts on the season hes made five very good recognition by Louisville though theyre theyre in that ice defense trying to force it to the Baseline they execute that pass to the middle of the floor they swing it out they get another pocket pass and they get a foul out of it thats you know a foul is a finish and sometimes thats what you your players need to understand two of the top teams in the Pack 12 highlight our ESPN womens basketball Thursday Prime Time matchup Utah and UCLA Charisma Osborne and number 12 UCLA taking on Alysa peely and the 18th ranked Utes last time they met in Salt Lake City UCLA ranked number two and that was Utahs highest ranked win in program Applause history now this is a big moment its 249 its a fivepoint game if youre Louisville right now you want to turn it up get a stop get on that break again youre getting to the foul line you dont want to give up a three in a situation like this theres going to be some curl Music Applause Music action Burton the team later in scoring and assists been a quiet start for him gets to the Lane OK cor for recovers and gets the Applause block Clark looking for The Cutting James throws it away yeah thats a random play it was a good intent its a random play now I really dont have a problem with this play with Burton right here he shook the man he got to the rim thats just a really good Block its a really good block youre not youre not upset with that he had he thought he had separations thats just a guy that was able to get his hand out it because hes got incredible Wings span 69 sophomore from Nigeria okor for hes guarding Zona Zona dips inside Matt Zona Notre Dames top returning scorer this season he averaged less than two points per game last year it gives you an idea of how much this team lost and what a hard reset it was for Michael Shrewsberry well no question the cor Force got it deci side like Im going to guard that not look over to Kenny Payne like he got fouled you know right now this is this where the double becomes an issue yeah of not used to theyre not going to be able to play through him shot its the three second three for Louisville and Kenny knows it hes bringing Brandon hutley Hatfield back in cor for is not ready for that double team a game high 10 for sky Clark who is playing with a broken rib but hes done a really good job hes guarding hard he hes got a tough match up here with Burton hes staying low Roper puts it on the floor a lot of dribbling OK cor for walled him up that had no chance that play had absolutely zero chance of succeeding and you can see by looking at mik Shrewsberry he agrees with me thats not a play you make with a minute left in the half Notre Dame has missed 11 of its last 12 Clark almost lost it now out of Music bounds and I think they said last touch not today Micah Shrewsberry cant believe the call I like this by skot Clark he shakes him Burtons got to do a better job of staying in front but Clark gets it he goes straight up he gets squared up and he holds his follow through nice three itll stay with Louisville 11 to shoot now if that ball goes into the post with the Guard were going to see the double team there as well Notre Dame has got to be happy with the doubles white has his shot Applause blocked Irish can go two for one Burton accelerates not good defense sky Clark took it easy he relaxed Marcus Burton has got quickness speed and he can play through contact sky Clark is still standing looking for his shoes hutley Hatfield looking for Glenn right idea Glenn could not control it this is where Louisvilles got to pull it together on this this is where the frustration kicks in were trying to make plays that arent there and then sky Clark comes down and he doesnt lock in defensively you got to put both feet down have have load your hips and guard the ball and the last thing Marcus Burton needs to see is a wide openen rim with that speed and quickness and thats where Louisville thats where they got to overcome this right now dont turn one or two mistakes into three or four mistakes in a row and that has been the story of the season for Louisville where a mini run by the opponent turns into a massive run first half shooting star for Notre Dame has been Bren shrewbury well and again hes so quick and he sets up his screens Huntley Hatfield leaves his feet uh Mike was behind the play you cant be in that situation like James was Shrewsberry can shoot the ball he doesnt need much time he certainly can create from a deeper range and and he gets it off quickly hes played well on the road his production up in ACC play and he has Shrugged off his last game one for 11 one for eight from three against Georgia Tech last Wednesday Notre Dames had a week between games how big is that this time of the year oh its huge its its great for rest and Recovery its great for rehabbing and getting your guys mentally fresh physically fresh its a great time to add things its a great time to look at what youre doing well build on it find some counters to it and then add some things and I think thats what mik Shrewsberry did about a second and a half differential game clock and a shot clock Logan IMS The Freshman looking for help Shrewsberry lets it Fly tip back Burton heaves it up air ball and thats how the first half Applause ends I think well see more postups from the Louisville guards as well as Brandon Huntley Hatfield white can certainly do that Huntley Hatfield drops it in for an easy two hes got 10 beautiful place well designed by Kenny Payne coming out getting that pocket pass on the bounce pass from Trey white for the easy Brandon Huntley Hatfield layup now thats where you want to see sky Clark just determine that hes going to hes going to win this match up with Marcus Burton be aggressive be assertive not be behind screens like this Glenn picks up Burton on the switch T to shoot Burton puts it on the floor Tay Davis on the drive and a Applause turnover now we watch this action right here great play gets it swung theyre running their offense theyre letting it happen Trey White comes off theres no hand pressure from Notre Dame delivers the fou pass layup both teams have got to pick up their pick and roll defense hand pressure theyve got to play with more length theyve got to play with active hands theyve got to go after balls especially with as many bounce passes are being thrown whs three not there Burton snatches the rebound J setting the screen Shrewsberry back to Burton Burtons got to look at The Rim from three cuz Carri boo looking at it Booth misfires J the offensive rebound oh thats a money Shrewsberry spots up his 4 three cant lose him like that and I like Carri boots aggressiveness I I love the fact to me hes a Young Noah Clowny whos with Brooklyn now absolutely who played at Alabama last year theyre different in certain ways but Carrie boot has got that kind of potential both good Bloodlines dad Calvin played in the NBA for a decade now the get GM good job kicking it out you cannot leave Braden Shrewsberry open at any point hes wide open on that just what he needed to see go in just what his teammates needed to see go in an open Applause three Booth picked up his second foul now as we watch Caleb Glenn shoot this free throw hes got to get some lift off of his toes right now he sh he shoots a very flat footed free throw when he misses if he gets that lift he holds the follow through much better you look at Louisvilles threepoint shooting coach they have not done well from the outside the last three games meanwhile their opponents shooting it at a ridiculously high clip ridiculously high and some of that is ball movement some of that is overh heelp some of that is just being behind plays but they they cannot win giving up threes like that Booth offline now there you go theres a throw ahead head there thats exactly what you want your guard to do recognition sky Clark has a tendency to dribble the ball too much in the back court laterally rather than get the ball Advanced by a speed dribble or a throw ahead like that right away its another step towards a bonus and boo picks up his third foul he exits as Julian rooper the Northwestern transfer enters this is where youre yelling at your teammates to see the ball so you dont get beat on a cut Carols pass taken away Shrewsberry the other way lays it in hes got 14 to lead all scores thats just a sloppy pass but theres been one weakness that the Louisville team has had all year it is the passing at times its stationary when theyre going too fast they do not deliver the ball on time on target the way that they have to that becomes a discipline issue of how you throw the ball and its been this live ball turnovers thats the stuff I feel for Kenny paying on because you see the the attention that hes trying to put on that and the walkthroughs you just you cant Pro careless short armed passes Clark has a trailer white spots up way off oh Burton launches and Davis tips it back amongst three Cardinals rer not quite Threes Company both teams have got to pick up their effort on the offensive class its a poor choice you cant throw a straight ahead pass that is a straight ahead there was no angle on that that is not a good pass now thats just a soft right hand and the respon abilities that he has it is important that everybody know hes being coached just like there and sometimes you got to coach him a little bit harder because sometimes players have a tendency well hell let him do this he wont let me do that and you can never have that and be successful but you certainly cant have it when your son is on the team and I think Micah understands that to a great deal he has got better he has gotten so much better this year so whatever Mike is doing with him is working this slippery Burton and a foul call to down low good drive by Burton but part of the Improvement of notor Dame with their offense and guys shooting is the fact that Marcus Burton is learning how to deliver the ball earlier to his teammates at times hes learning how to throw it ahead hes got so much speed and quickness and ability to finish at The Rim but that making those simple plays for your teammates sometimes its like hitting a home run you dont have to hit the home run to round the bases get on base let others Drive absolutely great point guards are singles hitters and then all of a sudden they make everything else that the game is not complex to them they keep the game simple a foul Glenn picked up the foul you watch ber you know hes going to have a chance to be a special player in the ACC looking ahead at the off season what is that next step in his Evolution finishing better uh against link reading decision making of who hes got on him should he make the shot should he should he take an extra dribble to get to the rim should he make the kick meanwhile Clark coming back from a rib injury hes playing with a broken rib hes got 13 and hes five of five from the field Marcus Burton has also got to become just an Absolute Pest defensively and I think he can be that he can be a guy that can guard the ball Fort now their style of play right now is to guard at the heel or heels at the threepoint line which is certainly working but eventually hes going to have have to be a fullcourt pressure guard consistently especially to play in the NBA five to shoot Burton kicks it out to Davis two to shoot Davis shot fake did he get it off in time they missed it didnt matter the Run youre going to have you got Hatfield youve got him he wants it going to work on ji and draws the foul good feed good feed now sky Clark if he could put This Together making the passes the way hes making these Shots tonight great pass ready comes back Im not sure they can win tonight if he doesnt pick it up and become more a part of this offense cuz hes not hes defending okay but hes not doing anything special he needs to see the ball go through the ring and Kenny Payne has gone to his bench Curtis Williams Tyler Johnson in there I like Curtis Williams I know his percentages at 30 in the league are not great I love watching him shoot the ball it looks like a good stroke watching him today I feel like its going in when you watch it at practice it did he just got to stay with it and not get Herky jerky and move his feet a lot Kenny Payne told me when Curtis Williams has played his best he makes the extra pass he gets assists he gets rebounds he plays defense he said for a young player sometimes if the shot is not falling you become disengaged in other areas he wants to see Curtis Williams be a complete basketball player even if the shots not there well Kenny just summed up 18year olds theres pros that feel that way but it you got to be a special player to keep going hard defensively and on the glass when youre shots not going in because young players treat it like theyre getting discouraged rather than just being disappointed for a second they get discourage like the world is ending keep going ninepoint lead for the Irish it is their second largest of the game they led by as many as 13 at one point you great Drive almost fresh shot clock Huntley Hatfield blocked at the Music Applause rim and Notre Dame can extend to a double digit lead that one Stripped Applause Music Away Brandon Huntley Hatfield right there he wanted the foul it was one on three he went up strong no problem with the move he decided to get back and get that strip because that could have gone either way hes inside Balls there it comes into him he goes up theres three people around it he wants a foul but he came back deflected that ball kept The Possession alive for them to defend kesn backing down Williams theres the help from Huntley hfield the turn around yes great footwork by JR kesn in the post hes not only a threepoint shooter he can get inside play off the pivot michah shrewbury does a great job of getting his players to understand how to play up a twoot jump stop that one rims out there its just a Miss dont get discouraged keep playing this game is still up for grabs for either team 10 points is nothing with 13 minutes to go theres Imes who is set to go to Penn State but followed Micah Shrewsberry to Notre Dame over Clark and a Applause foul now this is a point guard sky Clark we shouldnt be looking at you right now sky Clark you should be h in your teammates up keep it on it right now this is what a point guard needs to do dont worry about yourself dont worry about the foul call huddle your team quick look at coach Payne see what he wants and lets go thats what has to change in any point guard but especially for Louisville Tuesday double header for you on accn Clemson hosting pit that game in South Carolina then Wake Forest will take on Notre Dame wake C cly one of Joe lardys last four in or I should say first four out Blake Hinson last time out against Louisville 41 points I should say two games ago he had 10 against wake last time out but over the weekend 41 points against Louisville 9 threes in that game people forget how good Blake Hinson even was at Old Miss I mean he he has always been a shooter a scorer Clark 15 points six of six from the field now I love the way hes shooting the ball hes got a turn it back on the defensive end and Leadership with his teammates this is what you need if youre Lille put some pressure on dont let Notre Dame feel comfortable in this half Music court Booth back in there with the three fouls truberry shot clock in single digits kesn over Williams got it wow great job with the left hand pounded the dribble his feet from year one to year two have really improved hes obviously gotten stronger in his lower body you can see it in his feet when he attacks a red shirted last year after playing sparingly as a freshman hutley Hatfield with a chance at a threepoint play were almost at the point that if were not going to get the drive and kick game going as much with Louisville that Brandon Huntley Hatfield has got to touch the ball at least every two trips down the floor and soon to be every trip down the floor great Drive stop keeps it alive is strong with the ball doesnt L use or lose the ball goes up strong great touch now hes got a chance to cap it with a free throw a ji just picked up his third Music Applause foul I like the pressure when you start attacking the ball in the f Court it just turns everybody else up youre getting a good point of attack I think James getting ready to score hes starting to guard better good defense IMS knocks down the triple too much space he doesnt need much space at all but IMS is a dead eyee shooter whos gotten better off the dribble and going quickly its hutley Hatfield in transition six for the big guy to go along with four rebounds Tay Davis slips one through good Drive thats where Huntley Hatfields got to cut off the dribble hands are a little bit low have the hands ready to go up quicker but theyre starting to find something defensively theyre starting to put the pressure Applause Music on theres James still looking for his first point through traffic offensive rebound follow no knocked out of bounds it belongs to Notre Music Dame of late because they can get him fou and you look at what Louisville puts on the floor Huntley Hatfield is getting a breather so now you got to figure out what to do inside theyve got essentially a four guard look well I like the pressure that you can get with this lineup cuz you can literally switch everything with this lineup for Louisville now you really need to pressure your guards I mean I mean you need to post up your Guards full court pressure Johnson is a terrific on ball Defender foul trouble at times has been an issue good action drops into the Zone this is good theyre sending Cutters through this is good good change of pace here for Louisville now theyve matched man Burton wide open and its good miscommunication got two on the ball at the top of the slot wide open three for Burton communication man Zone press doesnt make a difference you got to talk you got to bump in his Zone largest lead of the game for Notre Dame Glenn not there Burtons got 11 nearly lost it Zona for three in and out knocked out of bounds by Davis the Irish the worst threepoint shooting team in the ACC in League games but 40 tonight 8 for 20 some of that is they just dont have enough outside of Burton to really create two guarding the ball for those kickouts outside of broken plays Mark is perfect from the field seven for seven hes got a game high 17 hes playing fantastic offensively when it comes to his shot he really is looks good tonight lot of game left with his pressure defense make it 18 four for four from three Johnson tipped it heres Burton off balance and theres Clark for the board okay this crew is they are letting them play no doubt about it theyve called it like that from the opening tip Zona turns it over they really have Pat Drisco been outstanding for a long long time Jeff Clark Lamar Simpson these guys have done it uh for long theyre letting it theyre letting it go which is good no ones getting an advantage I know neither coach on the other side may feel that way but theyre not getting Advantage its a very physical game you you have to make some plays in this game Clark over IMS his first Miss now we saw the pressure earlier off the inbounds from Louisville Notre Dame is a team that turns it over on 20 of its possessions in the ACC highest rate in the conference Davis swivels inside blocked by Glenn James got Maul at some point we got to call that Im all for physical play and lets go but we got to call that James hesitated down to Glen nice pass by Mike James timeout by Micah Shrewsberry and that dunk by Glenn is the first field goal from someone name in that game is on the team this year absolutely amazing it really is thats why theyre both trying to build their programs I understand what mic is going through when I went to Indiana in 2008 we had 27 points coming back didnt work out real well for us early on no exact 20 total we got through it but it was not pretty but these team these two coaches are built in their programs and and you know theyre being coached to play better especially with the passing and decision making than they make Here Comes James Johnsons quick top 100 recruit and hell get two shot as IMS picks up the foul now thats whats going to be interesting right fouling the shot which it was but now youve got to keep reading what this game is going to be how are the officials going to call it its a good drive he got by him gets into him Coach Shrewsberry was looking for the leg kick but Im into his body now you havent called the game tight all game lets lets keep letting it be that way Johnson the first Louisville freshman since Reese gains with 90 or more assists in his season didnt play last time out against pit due to concussionlike Applause symptoms hes been a spark plug for Lisle on a number of occasions this season he has right now he can change the game because he likes this matchup with Burton hell stay into him he can match him quickness wise theyre looking for Tay Davis to post it up Huntley Hatfield is doing a great job of being in position and not let him and thats a kickball thats a Brandon Huntley Hatfield stop he got theyre going to get the ball but he did a great job defending that post eightpoint game less than 8 minutes to go 60 Louisville run Bravo you use the Quicksilver side of the KFC Yum Center Louisville in the midst of a 60 run we got about 8 minutes to go what does success look like for both teams over this final 8 Minute stretch well right now for Louisville theyre two away from the bonus theyve only committed two fouls no Dame five you have got to get into the bonus as quick as you can so that you can get to the foul line and then set your defense set your press its an eightpoint game its a three to four possession game theres a lot of time but you cant have empty possessions and you cant give up a three like that beautiful shot from bradden Shrewsberry great call for Micah Shrewsberry out of the timeout five threes for Braden Shrewsberry the coachs kid hes got 17 but still this is look to get theall ball inside get to the foul line heres Johnson not much of a threepoint shooter misses Booth is there to clean Shrewsberry again got it get one you got to you cant lose Braden Shrewsberry you cant lose him in a pickup game you cant lose him at Notre Dame you cant lose him at the Yum Center you cant lose him in Uruguay you he can shoot in any gym hes in youve got to find him how are the gyms in Uruguay by Im not sure but I know he could make a basket in it even if they raised him to 12T and they were and they were uh chain Nets the son of Micah and Molly Shrewsberry his productions been up an ACC play hes been better on the road had that big game on the road against Georgia Tech in the overtime win where he had 25 and 20 points today six of 10 from three and again the threepoint defense for Louisville its coming concerning Notre Dames the worst threepoint shooting team in the ACC 10 for 23 T well the first bra and Shrewsberry three out of the timeout they werent low enough he got a little bit of Separation it wasnt even a great screen they werent low enough they didnt stay attached knowing that hes going to come the last one broken play hes just open thats where the lack of communication comes back and gets you Im not sure Bren shrewbury could make it on a 12T Rim but I know he could hit it on a rim with a chain link fence or in youre oh yeah you you name it brayen Shrewsberry keeps shooting the ball like this hes not going to have to find out what its like to play in Europe hell He hell make it in one of those uh leagues that they play any2 games a year kickball 14point lead for the Irish their largest of the game Johnson the inbound theres James his first points his first field goal good play take it I mean Notre Dame has just made two threes they have not separated themselves execution wise outside of those threes youre still in it Burton the wild pull up got it plus the foul so quick so good coming off screens good lift he gets that ball out low Center at gravity its down low beautiful shot does he remind you of anyone well there is similarities to a guy I coached at Indiana named Yogi faroh theyre a little bit different that is a beautiful shot takes the hit goes straight up I dont like comparing younger players to a guy I had like Yogi phoh is one of the alltime winningest players at at Indiana played years in the NBA won two championships there but low Center gravity guards that are so tough when they get to the basket they may not jump over you and dunk over you but they can finish in the contact hutley Hatfield down low against J no good and well get a foul over the back on Applause James the anticipation that youve got to have to rebound the ball Brandon Huntley Hatfield gets a good look he goes up but again James gets the foul cuz hes late getting to the glass watch him come into the picture all right Huntley Hatfield gets the ball he goes up into it theyre trying to give him space shot goes up be there Li you got the ball you know hes in the shot when hes in the motion of his shot run to the rim lets see if they go to Shrewsberry whos earned a heat check Burton and thats a tra now if heer took a heat check and didnt make it we might see we might see coach Shrewsberry instead of dad Shrewsberry on that Im not sure you want to take heat checks on the road you dont think hes earned one six of 10 no I dont think a player ever earns a heat check no Im a coach I dont I dont see that because heat checks turn into bad long shots that are Music Applause challenged Clark the drive the dish Huntley Hatfield offline with the corner three now get your help position get your help dont let him play a twoman game there it is to Shrewsberry still plenty of time to shoot Burton the quick First Step through the contact hes picked it up in the second half hes got 16 Id like to see any other freshman guard in America that can match up with him when it comes to playing through contact there are seniors 50y or seniors that that cant get through contact like he can he relishes the contact Johnson Miss is you saw Mike James get hit on that last play and officials have let them play through a lot A lot has been not called this evening now Booth over white thats where hes going to be pulling away thats where hes going to be good he can put the ball on the ground he can make threes hes got to get the postup game in the offensive rebounding game but he can put put the ball on the ground and get his shot carry Bos got a real future Huntley Hatfield missed the bunny gets it back stolen away by Burton they averages more than two steals in conference Play Tops in the league out of Music bounds they scrapping beame Music ball I lets see what this looks like loose ball theyre diving both dive for it see theyre still laying out and playing I dont know that looked like off not that ball kicked at the other end uh yes but it looked to me like that one off Notre Dame but Jeff Clark the official was right there to see it you got to trust his opinion he was right there on the call so nobody had a better view than he did though weve got about weve got a group of people up here behind us that think they had a better View wheres your balloon animals think its Applause Music Applause Cloud five to shoot Davis posting up Clark its Shrewsberry again its 73 hes got 23 two off a career high its so quick when he gets it off and be he doesnt fade earlier in the season he was fading on those quick threes now he holds his follow through thats why the percentage has gone up and Huntley Hatfield again missing from close range now this has escalated quickly now a 22point lead for Notre Dame the three braen Shrewsberry 3es son coaching this game which looks like its going to be a potential victory victory for him but to see the grandson have a fantastic game thats very very nice Braden shrewbury 23 points seven of 11 from threepoint range as Trey white has two shots coming and for Louisville weve seen this movie plenty of times where theyre within Striking Distance and then all of a sudden a 60 run turns into a 102 run in this case a 162 run the BC game not long ago Louisville led by 8 the break BC went on a 20 to1 run in the second half they end up winning by 12 youre so right I mean thats the leadership and I feel for the coaching staff I feel for Kenny because you you you you can call timeout but at some point your players have got to say hey we got to get a stop we got to talk if communications at the Forefront of our defense we better make that the Forefront of our focus and it just doesnt happen that way and it and it and it happens across the country but those 10 11 Point deficits can turn into to 20 in a hurry if you dont stay strong and understand youve got to come down and get the right shot Glenn blocked by ji on the other end ji attempted a three just the 12 threepoint attempt of his career he had made two I really wish that Louisville for their sake would have posted more tonight baited that double and see if they could have played out of it especially when You got post up guards like white took it away Jes and now Clark is down remember hes playing with a broken rib yeah hes down theyre going to have they probably getting ready to sub anyways here comes the trainer so hell have to come out of the Applause Music game maybe its a cramp yeah appears to be a cramp college basketball this Saturday big game for

Irish team picked the finish at the bottom of the ACC young team they start three freshman you you can sense a burgeon in confidence about this Notre Dame team I know theyve beat Louisville and its Georgia Tech and not exactly the top of the ACC but there was a win in there against Virginia Tech as well it doesnt matter its still the ACC its still highlevel college basketball and you still got an extremely young team yovanovich ahead of the pack lays it in the Improvement of Notre Dame has been it it has been totally noticeable and and everybody gets better at different times and you want your players that the energy that they get from improving is the energy that they need nobody calls home and says hey Mom hey Dad were running two up so much better all right were were were playing our zone so much better they want to feel like theyre improving and I think the Notre Dame players are certainly some of the Louisville players have notle do you have him on the bingo card by the way
