talking about a rivalry game a game that is much needed for the Hokies and by the way the who say they need it too you know what this is one of those rivalry games its not below the surface its right in your grill all day long so we are set to go Virginia at 173 Virginia Tech 139 PA Clark to run that one down and we are underway and already they are in full throat here at the castle Applause outside shot clock inside 10 down to five over the top and knocked away and a clean step there by Padula nearly gave it right back and a strong defensive stand for the Hokies on the first possession of the game the defense let them down in Miami on Tuesday night Mike young looking to get his team to return back to the defensive favor all right underneath tuck drive but Collins cannot finish it The Freshman out of Clover South Carolina Clark thought about lining up a long one on the Baseline long one Franklin but he kind of air mailed that one and he would hear about it from the castle guard when you think about this rivalry The Hokey faithful dont get up for anything more so than they do this game Lokis 3124 against Virginia here in Blacksburg in fact theyve won the last two theyve been played in this building between the two and much gets him on the board and thats one of the areas of concern for Tony Bennett and his defense points in the paint they gave up 36 points in the paint to Syracuse on Monday and thats something Virginia Tech is absolutely going to try to explore Cavaliers leading the ACC in defense also in threepoint shooting Gartner with a miss and also a sister game most unselfish team in the conference coming into this Saturday the Doula very dangerous beyond the threepoint line when he gets it rolling but the person that knows that most is Kihei Clark is Hanukkah tour lines up a three unable to knock it down Hunter katorsman shooting a hot basketball but Kihei Clark took the match up against Sean Padula personally the first time these two teams got together in January 18th and from the start to this one it looks like it could be the same yeah held up to 10 points medulla had an off night in that one for sure because of Clark and not only that KIA clock with 20 points on the offensive end of that game as well Gardner with a shot that catches a lot of iron but drops down nice friendly Rim Yeah one a better midrange Shooters youre going to find in the ACC Jaden Gardner is automatic when he catches the basketball 18 feet and in pokies have one win over a top 25 this season they beat then number 18 North Carolina back in December of course its Carolina and Duke later on at 6 30 on ESPN bazilly way downtown dont you think hes going to be a big key today that is the matchup when Virginia Tech has had success First Virginia especially in this building a lot of it has been based upon a stretch big Kevin Luma got the best of Virginia backtoback years in this matchup Clark with a triple and a feathery touch shes hitting 40 percent and thats where Kia clock is going to have to be more aggressive in this game offensively we talked about 20 points in the first matchup between these two he can find his buckets against Virginia Tech these are both teams that can get roaring from threepoint line and lets finish that one on a little reverse and thats a nice wrinkle from Mike young in comparison to having Sean Padula having to deal with the pressure of Kihei Clark 94 feet hes allowing him to be more of it off the ball guy and get to easy bucket because of it Gardner wants to get inside that lane A Little Fall away and blocked by Brazilian you see Justin mutts handling the basketball being a playmaker and taking the pressure off of Sean medulla Padula having to deal with kieh Clark Collins the onehander rebounded Away by Virginia Cavaliers got as high as number two in the poll right now number six dont be surprised certainly if they pick this one off today if they keep on surging in the poll founder plus way downtown himself off the back of the iron Applause game one in Charlottesville going to Virginia 7868 good basketball game two weeks ago Couture giving it up Darius Maddox is not in the lineup not with the team once again this is third straight game hes missing because the family concerns medulla drills that one and that time James Garner not there to help so kieh Clark gets hit by the screen and Sean Padula gets probably the easiest look you will ever get in this series Applause turn around Franklin no mom Franklins been playing great basketball as of late so because of that he draws the match up Hunter Couture who defends the best perimeter player normally for the opposing team guarding Franklin as Padulas off the mark on the second threepoint attempt and hes been just a little bit good from threepoint land 33 percent for the year theyd like that to be more like 39 and hell take a lot of Threes downstairs and a quick finish there by Gardner and the nice fine from Vander plaster Gardner on the back screen and the cut Gardner wanting a foul on that possession but regardless still finishes off the bucket Lokis coming off a loss against number 23 Miami this week and Virginia Tech trying to get back into WinCo remember that seven game losing skid at the time they lost Couture for a bunch of time shot clock and a violation never did get to the rim if Virginia Tech is going to be because Virginia at this point is winning this years class five to the Hokies 15 this game is worth a half a point you can see the trophy thats on the line there Im just trying to figure out how we get the bacon costume there that can be something that we can use down the line for Halloween Corey I know youre a big part of this rivalry as well when you were an athlete so just this atmosphere and everything on the line you didnt get the bacon but a win is still Savory Im sure the wind is the most important thing but a very very close second is bacon everyone loves bacon right cant find the ball right now that would be a very cool prank played by someone to actually take the game ball they normally have two so this must be the backup basketball that was over at the scores table Applause McNeely into the contest now for Tony Bennett for Clark so Ryan Dunn the 68 freshman can really make an impact defensively on the spin Beekman denied and a foul on the play that was with five on the shot clock give me a look at Mike young fourth year at the helm for the Hokies his teams do a very good job taking care of the ball both of these teams do an excellent job there only averaging about 10 and a half turnovers a game thats in the top 20 yeah and the Virginia of course nine and a half a game which leads to ACC one of the best ball handling teams in the country actually lead the country and assist a turnover ratio and Virginia Tech a top 20 team as well so a lot of very good guard play between these two squads the Doula with the foul and a onepoint game early okies involved in a ton of close games six of their eight ACC losses have been decided in single digits and this is always interesting to see how teams will prepare for the track thinking popped it right to guitar shot clock gonna be a big factor all day I think both sides Mozilla is going to launch comes right to Mutton hell set up Justin butts in his sixth year being physical with the first year Ryan Dunn winning the offensive rebound battle and the second chance points on that possession averaging a degree every couple of years hes got three of them right now and yes he is toying with the idea of a doctorate but wants to continue to play basketball professionally as Hunter Couture attacks unable to finish met by Ryan Dunn at The Rim but Justin much is holding off on the doctor it wants to hoop for a little while before he makes that happen cant blame him averaging 137 Applause Kihei Clark long one off the front iron and just a small thing but Kihei Clark had the shot when he first came off the screen on that one OB if hes going to take that one that would have been a shot in rhythm in comparison to sitting and watching but it does not change his defensive intensity on Sean Padula which Padula knows all too well from the first encounter back door cut and the paint takes a hit itll be Padula going to the line pokeys moving it very nicely there 11 47 to go here in the first half and Virginia Tech with a threepoint advantage in a rivalry game foreign that can really especially playing at St Marys so thatll be an interesting one tonight similar to the one we have here another rivalry game where regardless of the records regardless of the rankings its always going to be a big time competition when these two teams get together the Duke and Carolina both unranked 11 47 to go here in the first half medulla outstanding at the line 86 percent coming off 20 points in the Miami loss you look at Sean Padula one of the reasons why hes the front runner for ACC most improved player up 10 plus points per game this year the only member of the Hokies the only member of this actual game between both these teams in the top 15 and scoring in the ACC this season confidence starts so far for the Hokies it has been that and again on their home floor Virginia Tech is a problem in this building you knew its going to be difficult for Virginia to come in here and get a win Applause and thats the thing for when youre playing when youre a great team youve got to come in and winning environments like this but Virginia Tech needs this win to try to keep the NCAA tournament chances alive theres an atlarge team John Neely pried that one free Lynn Kidd its 610 into the contest now for the Hokies hell drop that one down sweet shot big 66 percent absolutely and now perfect five for five in his last three games so hes pretty shorthanded when you get the basketball in his hands hes going to take care of business Applause Virginia just a great passing team and as you pointed out really well theyre great when that shot clock is down like inside five seconds theyre so comfortable in that position theyre poised and they follow really the leadership of their coach thats who Tony Bennett is as a person and how he was a basketball player and that Poise theyre always under control much trying to take it a little closer to the goal not there for him Donald a rebound and Virginia has numbers right now will they look to exploit it Isaac McNeely who has the green light oh strong in the cup hanging on the iron theyre gonna wave that off no basket Ted Valentine came sprinting off the Baseline and waved it off even though the bucket doesnt count if Im Isaac McNeely I counted as a highlight but Ted Valentine right on point because McNeely hangs around on the rim and you see the ball possibly coming off spends a little extra time thats going to be offensive goaltending on McNeely so the bucket will not count the highlights still made them so when the Freshman cuts the highlight it ends right there absolutely you just catch him hanging around on the rim thats all but the proper call we tore off to mutts trying to get it downstairs nearly deflected but another two to buying that kid hes making a difference right away to transfer from Clemson he absolutely is and when he comes off the bench Mike young makes sure he gets the basketball in his hands and hes making his coach look like a genius back to back buckets Beekman on the feed and that is going to be a blocking foul crowd howling theres Couture went down for the block got him and a great matchup between these two seniors you think Hunter Couture Armon Franklin both fourth year seniors and you can see Couture moving to his left both feet not on the floor that is the correct call by Justin Porterfield to put the block on Hunter Couture on that possession so Franklin to the line where he makes 74 percent one of the five starters Tony Bennett returned from last years team this is the biggest lead for the Hokies today and you look at Armon Franklin over his last 10 games struggled against Houston struggled at Miami went home for the holiday break and he has been a different player since coming back over 16 points per game and he has really been the guy that Virginia has followed on the offensive end of the floor over that stretch he could light it up at 26 against Baylor mutts the senior on the span way short and Justin must looking for the double team thats one of the things Virginia keeps you off balance whether they go to double team or theyre going to play you straight up that time much trying to be aggressive but bit of menopause sanding his ground Applause Franklin with a catch hell fire got it with a triple and and now Ahmad Franklin continues to stay aggressive this has been really the maturity of him even though he hasnt made shots early in his game he continues to stay aggressive when things arent going well 40 from threepoint land Padula shot clock to 10 hell launch a three he could do that all day when he gets rolling but do you see the difference a comfort level that saw Padula has on this floor you did the game in Charlottesville you saw how uncomfortable kieh Clark made him but he has been very comfortable here in the castle Clark trying to shed everybody but picked off cannon with a bounce the medulla back to months hell lay it in perfectly run break there by the hoagies on top 2315 founder plus no Kidd with another rebound medulla jumping inside back out for months Applause medulla again short feeding up ahead nice quickly run break and laid up and in by McNeely and just thrown off on defensive balance the point guard Sean Padula taking the long three no one else for Virginia Tech getting back defensively allowing McNeely to have the easy bucket McNeely out of West Virginia inside Collins and tied up possession air will keep it on this end of the floor when we come back seven and a half to go on the half Virginia Tech turning defense into offense off the turnover as my God the notorious dob mentioned they perfectly run fast break hurry to Kohls February clearance event celebrities here the Hall of Famer the great Chipper Jones 2018 inductee and Cooper status Angel quitting about great to see him here apparently a Hoops fan absolutely one of the best third baseman to ever play the game multiple World Series Championships and of course you know one of the guys growing up were about the same age so watching him develop into a pro is uh been special to see him again I have the opportunity to say hello to him pregame and meet Tipper Music as Matt Bartley our producer is a vaunted Mets fan will tell you he ate them alive even named one of his kids Shea after Shea Stadium all the damage he did in there but backdoor cut one and run that play perfectly Collins with the slam they have Virginia Tech has been a great cutting team throughout this first half and they know by Virginias basketball ball pressure between Reese Beekman and kieh Clark but they have found a number of angles now another turnover mutts oh the pass does get to Collins and hell draw the foul I mean it barely got there on the long Bomb by mutts after the theft 701 to go in half just as much is showing off his passing ability on a number of possessions the long pass on the last transition play and now in the half court the back door fine Armon Franklin caught ball watching and MJ Collins with the new hairdo cutting back door for the Finish freshman and a nice effort against Syracuse couple of games ago with 11 points because he is getting to start these days we mentioned that Darius Maddox is out the junior the Sharpshooter because of a Family Matter hes missed the last three games thats opening up opportunities for people like John Camden New Hampshire has done just that and you know Darius Maddox actually LED Virginia Tech in scoring in the first matchup between these two teams had 13 points in that game so absolutely missing from this Virginia Tech lineup today pokies with their biggest lead so far Franklin with a catch and the finish and one in that foul too thats going to be the second foul on Hunter Couture thats a big play in a number of different ways one you get Franklin a bucket off a nice back door feed back has done a great job finding his teammates throughout this game Virginia cutting very well also as Iman Franklin unable to complete the threepoint play but the damage is done 2000 now 100 Couture 6 43 remaining in this first half interesting to see how Mike young plays this out Couture coming back very well from that injured elbow but in trouble right now Franklin will attack he tried to finish mccance he did not get the dunk Applause man do the students love that Ola strong move there batted away right to vanderplas a very fastmoving first half here in Blacksburg it has been that very few fouls and a lot of action Mark Neely gave it up outside the three Banner plus will launch that clangs away Applause Virginia only two for seven from Beyond a threepoint Arc lead the ACC in threepoint field goal percentage at 385 as Justin much turns it over a little too much on that pass back door closed there Applause Virginia holding opponents to 60 points a game that does lead the ACC tiptoeing inside no finish there Beekman couldnt get it to go they battled for that and itll go the other way Applause Virginia and Virginia Tech and later on our Saturday showcase number one Purdue is in Bloomington to take on number 21 Indiana and then North Carolina Duke squaring off at Cameron Indoor thats what Dan Jay and Holly on the call later on tonight at 6 30 two great rivalry games coming up I tell you what Purdue is the best team Ive seen live this season but they are walking into a bus all going into Assembly Hall in Bloomington Indiana it is going to be crazy in there today one of my absolute favorite places to call it a game do you wear the Pinstripe red my pants but dont do that no I dont a nice effort there to try and save it by Brazilian couldnt do it heres Clark wide open for three and the followers up and in by Gardner nice finish by Jake Gardner whos LED Virginia scoring the last two games averaging 17 and a half points per game over the last two starting to become much more aggressive on the offensive end than he has been early in the season handing off work Couture can hit that three as well once again the back door theyll swing it mutts bazilly shot clock down to six the doula harass there and they turn it over and that is a individual classic great defensive sequence by Reese beaten now Virginia as a team defensively did the job but Reese Beekman covered so much ground on that one possession alone guarding Hunter Couture early and then also the closeout taking away the three from Grant bazilley and not allowing him to make the extra pass thats when the Reese Beekman can take and cut and put on his Defensive Player of the Year tape when he possibly wins it this season they got it down to four on the shot clock and then turned them over impressive Applause coming up on four minutes to go in the half in Blacksburg gee hey Clark jumping into paints knocks it down once again this is a game where Kia clock is going to have to be aggressive 20 points First Virginia Tech in their first matchup and he has to be a scorer as well as a facilitator throughout this one and look out here come the Cavaliers six nothing run over the last three minutes mutts against vanderplas knocks that one down off the window and that just as much falls into the same category as Kihei Clark oftentimes they can be more aggressive as offensive players looking for their own theyre normally going to spread the basketball around five assists already for much in this game but oftentimes they have to call their own number six seven senior a superb passer Beekman in traffic and catches the iron and drops in speaking of calling your own number Reese Beekman with the nice take on that one in the soft touch on the rim he has six threepoint game I think were going to be saying that all day I do believe that could be the case I think we can see a nip and Tuck Affair in this one Obi the Doula to the Lane got it back found the iron she laid it in do exactly where he was and padola forces to be able to recover that Maurice Beacon got his hands on the basketball but as you mentioned Sean Padula knowing exactly where he was when he recovers to be able to lay it up 30 is 12 points Beekman finds Gardner on the spin but again they will launch a long line and drain it nothing but yet by Isaac McNeely 43 outside the three and McNeely raining from West Virginia so Im sure hes got a few family members making the trip to Blacksburg to come check this one out the thought about it penetration yes all the way to the Cup points in favor of the Hokies they have won that battle thus far as Sean Padula has won the battle 14 points already for him in this first half only 10 in the first game Applause Music bouncing for Beekman no so 141 to go in the first half the Hokies on top 3228 Auburn number six Virginia heres Collins that clanged away Virginia Tech three for ten beyond the three same as Virginia theres Gardner and Gardners shot wont go mutts with the board Gardner got away with a little bit of a chicken wing right there if hed have made that shot Im supporting people here would have gone crazy Smokies would have been howling on that one pounding Hokies huh okay butts pops one up there but shy not something you see often from Justin must he definitely doesnt look for his threepoint shot off the move as often but a two for one possession right there Virginia Tech should get it back here to end the half Beekman trying to penetrate Gardner turns around left it well short comes right back to Hitler to the Baseline leaning in and a blocking foul Music Applause 312 to go in the half were going to take a break here tight one in Blacksburg 3228 the Hokies self comfortable here at home and hes done it off the basketball not facing as much pressure from kieh Clark because hes done the job on the move his teammates have helped him become a more efficient scorer in this game and hes done just that not only from Beyond the threepoint Arc but also attacking the basket five for eight from the field two before from Beyond the threepoint Arc 14 points two assists already for Sean Padula as youve mentioned a very different game for him so far than when they met in Charlottesville 3228 Virginia detective LED throughout the first half and the lead has been as high as nine and OB Sean Padula told Angel and I that he was gassed during that game Kihei Clark pressure to 94 feet he also played all 40 minutes in the game in Charlottesville Mike young has gotten him a couple minutes of a blow here in this first half hes going to be important throughout the remainder of this game but hes playing a completely different basketball game than the one he did in Charlottesville a vitally important for the Hokies of theyre going to make a run at an NCAA tournament bid remember they had that scintillating romp through the ACC tournament to win that tournament and get the automatic bid last year they do not want to be in that same position yeah you see just a simple thing right here the mixup just put the ball in the hands of Justin mutts a luxury to have a guy like that to take the pressure away from Sean Padula allow him to continue to be a playmaker here down the stretch about a second and a half Difference game clock and shot clock shot is down to six got to get a shot in the air spins fires off the iron and that is how the first half will come to an end with the Hokies on top 3230 trying to snap a sevengame winning streak of rival Virginia and Padula was certainly the star for the Hokies in the first 20 minutes for head coach Mike young winding up with those Sports 60 run but now it just comes down to guarding the individuals he said right now Virginia Tech is just tricky we have to make sure that were guarding their secondary plays guarding the back door and not too pleased with how many points that they have in the paint the 20 points in the paint is something that he does not like from a theme at this point gotta get a shot up here just 24 on the shot clock as Clark gets it inbound Franklin launching and its around and out you know Angel mentioned the tricky plays Mike young made it clear that he had a couple wrinkles he was going to throw into the mix just for Virginia in this game because he respects how great they are defensively with their principles so he had a couple things that he would look at and theyve been successful in the first half see if they can continue it in a second Cavaliers by the way missed their last five but they get the turnover and Clark will lead the attack here for Virginia Applause Carter thought about it even can really stick that threes 45 percent Franklin straight on and theyre going to let that roll out back over to the Hokies it goes before Iman Franklin keep going the thing for him has been even if hes not making shots hes got to continue to stay aggressive shooting the basketball because Virginia needs his offense his 23 threepoint field goals a game helps them on the offensive end of the floor Applause with so much attention being paid to the action and moving off the ball for Virginia Tech Virginia forgot to guard the guy with the basketball who was the most dangerous guy on the floor Clark tough pass on the Baseline he makes a lot of tough passes his Gardener he got a big time open look tap back out to Clark second effort hell lay that one up and in it is a quick First Step by key a Clark recognizing it would be difficult for MJ Collins to stay in front of him Kihei Singh no help behind him taking advantage of his opportunity he has seven back to a twopoint game silly has it poked away but thats a reach in foul as well Applause against Kihei Clark everyone for Virginia guarding their God and theres no help on that end and of course Kia Clark saying no help behind MJ Collins he knows he can win the individual match up and get to the rim first foul of the second half there are only six fouls in the entire first half yeah the first half flew by but these two teams dont foul a lot Virginia Tech only took two free throws in the first matchup in Charlottesville so I believe Mike young is happy to see his team going to the line a Little More Much beating his man wanted to find round vanderplas there but OBI no trap because you have to respect just as much as a passer Tony Bennett not sending the double team points five assists from mutts heres Clark on the move kept that foot down the spin by Gardner denied bazilly tough D comes right back to Virginia and Clark thought about a quick shot goes into the lane and an offensive foul Gardner not happy with that at all but a charge well with that left arm comes out thats where youre going to get the foul you watch the left arm of Dayton Gardner and because of that left arm being exposed to the official thats where that call was made so the Hokies by four and the ball just getting out of the way here in the second half its putting it mildly to say the Hokies are in desperate need of a big win they have to have this win time is running out on the Hokies in order to keep the NCAA tournament chances alive for an atlarge bid if they dont win the ACC tournament they have to have this one finding the old IE boy thats the second resounding dunk here in the second half for the Hokies but it comes off of great cutting Virginia Tech has been slicing Virginia up on that end of the floor with their cutting right by his Defender up and in again and Tony Bennett for the time on 1622 to go here in the second half Tony Bennett not happy with the wave Virginia Tech is moving the basketball against his defense Grant bazilli fighting The Cutting Justin mutts who finishes with authority Music need money win every Buck bear in college basketballs greatest rivalry there is nothing better than Duke and Carolina but its as crazy as ever you just have to sit back and enjoy the North Carolina Duke tonight at 6 30 on ESPN Okies by four and the Cavaliers and what a womens basketball triple that we have for you number 11 North Carolina squaring off tomorrow against Louisville thats our first game in noon Eastern and undefeated number three LSU battling Texas A M we capped the afternoon with a Big Ten matchup between number 10 Ohio State and number eight Maryland all coming your way on Sunday Music by the way a tip of the cap to Mike burnoff who for 40 years has been the radio color guy football and basketball for Virginia Tech 40 years Mike is still at it not retiring wants to make it to 80 Mike and I have a saying every time I come to do a Virginia Tech game we always greet each other with its got to be a big game if youre here hes done a lot of them finishing close so under 16 Virginia three for the last 11 shooting the basketball so they need to heat it up in the Lane Gardner yes with the land nice find from Reese Beekman on that play Virginia with two of the top three assist leaders in ACC basketball Kia Clark leading the ACC and assists Rhys Beekman at number three and youve got two great passers in the backcourt for the whos both of these teams can share the sugar cant they they absolutely can but no one can say share the sugar like you my God shot clock down to seven the silly will give it up on the drive Couture harassed and knocked Away Great D there by the Cavaliers Gardner calling for the ball well lay it in and you think about the last two passes from Reese Beekman and from kieh Clark to tie this basketball game and if youre playing for Virginia youre not one of those two guys you got to make sure youre running at all times because they will find you Gardner with a dozen along with three rebounds Applause the tour fighting through the screen and Teddy Valentine whistling a foul with 14 45 remaining here in Blacksburg a 40 run for the hoos off of two beautiful dimes Reese Beekman responding Jade Gardner and Kihei Clark liking that action as Beekman comes up with the block shot Kihei showing some sharing the sugar of his own Applause Music its not like the good old days its not like the good old days Olympics recently joined forces with ESPN at ABC to be a member of the choose kindness Alliance promoting intentional inclusion sparking kindness for young people and their families earlier today athletes and partners from Virginia Techs Unified sports leadership team presented a banner from Special Olympics North America to the university for creating an inclusive campus for people with and without intellectual disabilities now were tied up at 38 Virginia has not LED in this game but they are on a sixnothing run and theyve been able to do it with a couple of timely stops off the switch Justin much going to the post area and finishing and Reese Beekman is a greater Defender as he is he is outmatched when he has to get Switched Off with Justin mutts on the Block Bennett band Applause too slow coming down to try to get the basketball out of much hands just as much has been aggressive on the offensive end of the floor here to start the second half months having a strong day they really need that from him the Hokies they absolutely do just as much came back to Virginia Tech and his sixth year of college to say simply saying that he wanted to win a game in March Madness well theyve got to get them March Madness and in order to do that they got to get this one play no whistle there theyre letting them play a little they absolutely have its been a physical game but not a lot of fouls but consistent for both sides Couture leaning in searching for contact cant hit the shot though yeah searching for contact on that one and really distracted him from making the shot he got a pretty good look Guitar by the way over six from the field today hes head back to back 20 point games for the first time in his career shot clock to seven heres Franklin Franklin nice dish for Gardner and one hell be at the line Jake Garner to shoot now youve made this point better than anybody about Virginia the shot clock was inside four seconds you cant tell they are so comfortable they are poised they are calm theyre cool theyre collected and theyre going to the free throw line with an opportunity to tie this game once again off of the Jayden Gardner finish because they stay poised at the end of the shot clock cant do it though it remains a onepoint game Gardner has scored over 2 000 points has over a thousand rebounds in his career transferred a couple of years ago from East Carolina to Virginia he has 14 I believe hes the only active player in division one basketball with two thousand points 1 000 rebounds Big Time score mutts on the spin hands it off lots of traffic but the Finish continues his Perfection from the field has not missed a shot in his last three games and continues to be aggressive when he gets his opportunities Off the Bench very rarely does he move away from the cop he knows exactly where he makes his living vanderplas downstairs back out for Clark and a three cant argue with the look he got no great looking thats one PA Clark has to take mutts again with it targeting him a lot in this game to the paint slapped Away by matter plus nice hands by Van de Blossom Neville mutts exposing the basketball putting it right into vanderplas area Gardner going strong kind of pulling his way in Ted Valentine says he traveled so thatll be their sixth turnover threepoint lead for the Hokies off the catch Jaden Gardner picks it up and that is a great call by Teddy Valentine who had a great look at him shuffling his feet the quick steps in between not sure if that would have been an offensive or defensive foul but I love the fact that he caught the travel before the contact occurred heres Padilla the big first half for him he had 14 working on Kihei Clark on the span yes boy just backed him down and he made an eight plus spoons Applause Music it is difficult to go past Kihei Clark when youre squaring him up so he used his body Sean Padula put on 10 pounds of muscle in the offseason and he brought it into play on that last possession taking his game to the boxwood why doesnt it pay off in the rest of his game 10 in the off season under 12 Id like to keep it existing Gardner again on the entry lots of contact it wont go down for him 4640 Padula no Clark wants to run hell slam on the brakes and gives it right back thats a rare turnover for Kihei Clark not aware of his surroundings Lots hitting the deck and they will blow the whistle on the Block 4640 saw paduma playing Big Boy basketball going to the block Up and Under DJ Clark to finish the hoof the home foreign Virginia by six points Angel gray with the Hall of Famer the great Chipper Jones Im glad that you said the great Chipper Jones he is just but not just your outstanding performances with the Atlanta Braves you too just being an alumni from Virginia Tech Im going to be speaking to a couple of the people that have been involved in the baseball team at a conference but when youre taking this experience in you said wow this atmosphere theyre second to none this is my first experience here in Blacksburg Ive been telling a buddy of mine who is an alumni here at Virginia Tech that Id come up to go to a football game with him and tailgate and everything had no idea it was going to be Virginia Virginia Tech basketball and me speaking at a baseball banquet tonight so but this this is electric its awesome theyre coming off of their purse Super Regional appearance as well when youre looking at the investment not only in the basketball team but in the baseball team what are you seeing and then well Im seeing uh progress you know I mean how many times do you win conference championships or you win business average so its and you get this close to making it to Omaha like Virginia Tech did last year its got a Its gotta you know give its a lot of motivation when we go home and us work that a little bit extra harder to take that extra step this year I want to talk and come back back to this rivalry a little bit they call it the Smithfield Commonwealth class when youre able to take down another Virginia team whats that experience to you can you walk us through any experiences you had as a player oh no I played in Richmond Virginia and thats about it I didnt go to college so you know anytime I get a chance to soak up the college experience you know you got Virginia top 10 basketball program of Virginia Tech obviously today is not not going to let them lose this ball game hes playing outstanding so while Ive always grown up admiring Virginia and their program and whatnot uh I dont think they let me out of here if I didnt root for the Hokies today for your time they wanted to know what type of basketball player you would be but well let you escape with that spot a threepoint shooter 100 I dont like getting in there with the trees thanks so much for your time congratulations on all your success always took the big swing I had a lot of home run a great player offensively defensively great leader as well for the Atlanta Braves just Sensational yeah and temper a Florida native grew up in Florida and of course happy to see the Florida native for the Virginia Tech Hokies get his first field goal of the Game Hunter Couture knocking down a big three now the time out and Hunters done a great job defensively on Armand Franklin throughout this game offensively you mentioned the backtoback 20point game for him hasnt had the success with that in the floor but Mike young will take what hes getting from his senior shown up in a big way today Justin Mike and Mike ball as you always expect the majesta much can do this on a nightly basis he was a preseason allacc pick this year oftentimes hes not as aggressive offensively as Mike young would like for him to be but he picked the right time to show up for the Hokies its coming off just 103 against Miami they needed him today Beekman will draw the foul and hell be at the line to shoot two 5142 Virginia Tech and our college basketball lineup rolls on all afternoon over on ESPN at four oclock Eastern number one Purdue and Bloomington to take on number 21 Indiana another great rivalry game and a North Carolina Duke they Square it off with Cameron Indoor Dan Schulman J Phillis Holly roll on the call so now if Beekman misses this one everybody gets bacon oh not yet right into the student section well and again one of the better student sections one of the greatest environments to play in the ACC coming into this building is difficult for opponents especially when you have to shoot into that in the second half knocked around and a scrape kid lost it Here Comes Beekman Van Der plas with a hook high off the window and ripped away by Kid and Grant basili hasnt had the offensive impact that we were expecting from him in this game but its done a very good job defending band Applause on that end of the floor neither one of these guys really getting involved in the offensive action hes gonna keep it on this end with 903 to go in a very fast moving game because neither side turns it over very much and they dont foul very much 5143 the Hokies Amanda plus step out Gardner back on now for Tony Bennett whose team again has never LED in this game Hokies used to playing very close games theyve lost too many of them theyre just three and eight and Conference Play heres Padula and hell draw the foul and just a miscommunication defensively for Virginia once again for getting about the guy with the basketball who happens to be the most dangerous man on the floor at the time Sean Padova getting a clean run to the basket forcing Reese Beekman to Fallon number two on Beekman the Doula one of the better foul Shooters in the ACC 86 percent but a Miss on the first one Applause the Doula and mutts have been the big story for the Hokies they absolutely have been and you consider all the guys coming into this game that we talked about who need to step up with Sean Padula was number one for Virginia Tech and hes done that throughout this game but the hokeys gonna need production from Hunter Couture and Grandpas early to continue to keep this lead and be successful coming down the stretch a ways to go yet but for the Hokies its one thing to beat a team thats won seven in a row its one to beat a team as good as Virginia its another to beat Virginia its absolutely especially when you think about Virginia right at the top of the ACC Reese Beekman attacking the basket going off the rim but this Virginia team is it scary defensively they they put fear at you with their offense and right now Virginia Tech on their home floor very comfortable on the offensive end of the floor Beekman with nine knocked Away by Gardner one of the problems for the Hokies has been their inability to finish in so many of these close defeats down the street yeah they can let one go in Miami on Tuesday night a game with a battle back and forth with a very good Miami team but allowed 92 points to the Hurricanes that is unheard of for Mike young and you look at all the close losses that the Hokies have endured this season many coaches will tell you you see the record at three and eight in ACC they could very easily be eight and three guitar way down up around the logo and that is a 10point lead and Hanukkah tour starting to get involved in the offensive end of the floor off balance tough shot there by Parkers brother foul the tour started out oh for six from threepoint land but hes hit his last couple pass Hunter pregame are you ready for this and he looked at me and said you know Im the last person you need to ask if Im ready this could be the last time he plays against Virginia on this floor the Hokies have won two in a row 100 Couture going logo range trying to get win number three block 77 swishing in the first one Music much to the Chagrin of many of the fans in the student section because the rule is youve got to miss two as the opposing team in the second half and then everybody gets bacon Applause eight minutes to go 5547 Music wants to attack again and blocked out of the sky Dunn came over to cover he got his hand on it Applause so a big defensive stop for the Cavs heres Beekman Beekman goal oneonone with Couture gives it up Clark Here Comes got it a triple nice fine for Reese Beekman it would be mcgoing 101 at the top of the key all defensive eyes are on him ka Clark does a great job moving without the basketball finding the open spot to knock down a huge three hes so steady 14 points for him its a tour wants to go on the Baseline heres padola Beekman tearing down the board here come the Cavaliers again medulla went down and he was tripped on the play the offensive player the foul will be on Padula itll be three on him 6 59 to go home look we could be dynamic with an analysis or a breakdown but the reality is at home this Iowa State team is electric theyre tough and Kansas has not had an answer no doubt about it OB CA back to you no doubt we take a look at Joy brackets in the big 12 hes got Kansas as a one Texas a two kstated three Iowa State TCU Baylor all fours Obi you know I am ride or die with my conference Im ACC through and through the Big 12 may be the best basketball conference in the country this season he slid that in a maybe maybe I cant Im not gonna go all in on it but they may be the best conference this season just brutal up and down man trying to get a win at that conference Kihei Clark gave up the dribble Beekman with a quick step leaning in and rolls home such a different player when hes aggressive Reese Beekman just made up his mind Im going to the basket and theres nothing you can do about it when he plays like that it takes his Virginia team to a different dimension I think Run for the Cavaliers to pull it in three months working on a 17point game they want bazilly in close Center reverse he cashes in great execution once again from the Hokies knowing exactly where they want to go one of the things that Mike young has done differently theyre not going to the dribble handoff as much as you normally see with the Hokies using that just to set up other actions pop back out for done under six minutes to play in Blacksburg short by Clark and a whistle 5 53 to go on Gardner of the Cavaliers number three Reese Beekman just deciding I can take MJ Collins I can go wherever I want to go and is able to do that and finish off the bucket and then the execution to get basily the basketball Kia Clark coming over to try to help but not enough to be able to get Brasilia a great look on the interior so thatll put your tour at the line on the other end Erman Franklin check it back in for Tony Bennett 5752 how unusual its been this season for Virginia to look up so late in the game knowing they have yet to have a lead Music short on that one yeah you dont see that often Virginia is normally a team that plays with a lead but have the ability to be able to come back theyve got the threepoint shoot and we mentioned 38 and a half percent from Beyond three point our leads to ACC a very good shooting threepoint team and they had that in their pocket to be able to use it necessary we sold off the ball the 5 40 showing so Virginia to check in on the Baseline MJ Collins picks up number two for the Hokies Applause Clark on Couture a determined drive but block five basily and Brazils done a great job defending the rim throughout this game the Hokies have numbers swings that one from much draws the double Clark pokes it away itll be hokeys basketball great Hustle by KIA Clark getting back to take that away but as Clark attacks the basket Grant bazilli just standing his ground making it difficult for Kihei to finish over the taller players missouli now with his third block stop on the game as you say hes been Stout defensively he gets the ball working on a shorter Clark Couture open yes sir defensively Gardner on bazilly no sir but a foul no basket there and foul came before that shot okay looking ahead to our next games for Virginia and Virginia Tech theyre both over on acc Network on Tuesday night at nine oclock Eastern the Cavaliers hosting NC State and John Paul Jones Arena where Virginia is 101 and then on Wednesday Hokies welcome Boston College here to Blacksburg at seven Music garden with a Miss on the first one hes only 63 percent at that line is there bacon on the way in Blacksburg foreign yes sir man was that dramatic 6052 taken away by Gardner and the slam and Dayton Gardner makes up for the two missed free throws with the steal in the Finish making a sixpoint game and thats won the swings if youre Mike young you hate to see that with momentum everything in your favor opportunity to put points on the board to give up the pick six turnover garden with a solid one 16 points approaching the fourminute Mark its bazilly threw it out almost to Mid Court candle with a drive and knocked away this is going to go the other way it was not touched according to Ted Valentine and its going to be Virginia ball Hokies thought for short had been tipped take a look if you attack the basket and its not an aggressive attack attack of the basket Gardner does get a hand on that basketball though the Hokey faith will have a right to be upset with that call you see Jay Garner tipping it out of bounds Cavaliers can they make hay with that call Applause big a little drive and pop short so the Hokies by half a dozen Virginia now with a smaller lineup Arman Franklin having to guard Justin much Alexander 37 out there he can hit that shot at a timeout having a stretch five on the floor is always dangerous Grant Brazilian taking advantage of the attention paid to Hunter Couture knocking down a huge three Arbys new steakhouse garlic ribeye sandwich on the road to Tennessee Santiago vescovy trying to bounce back at that loss to Florida well as good as Tennessee is its so many things I still think they go as he goes is viscoby plays he did not play great in Florida the other night hes a key because he can score and he moves the ball so well coming up here on ESPN2 in just a few minutes more ACC Hoops Florida State on the road at Louisville who got their first ACC win last game against Georgia Tech looking to make it two in a row L Ellison crew OB CA back to you Dell thanks you very much 6354 Virginia Tech Virginia with the ball however for the Tennessee team best defensive team Ive seen all year Tennessee plays defense like you used to seeing Virginia play in Virginia playing offense like you havent seen since 2019 when they won an actual Championship with Isaac mealy coming off knocking down a three at a crucial point so every time it looks like the Hokie is going to break away Virginia finds a way to stay attached they absolutely do it that threepoint shooting keeps them in games theyre dangerous from Beyond The Arc great call from Tony Bennett coming out of the timeout to get McNeely a little Couture is really heated up right from that spot but not this time its kept alive brazily had a hand on it back up top for medulla hell set it up under two and a half and once again the small lineup on the floor for Virginia Armand Franklin as the fourth guard Applause medulla cant get up a shot now forces one mutts caught it underneath back to the Cavaliers 6357 Beekman going for the dunk and draws the foul hell be to the line to shoot a pair and our college basketball lineup rolling on all afternoon on ESPN at four oclock number one Purdue in Bloomington taking a number 21 Indiana thatll be great theater nothing beats North Carolina Duke as they square off at Cameron Indoor with Dan Sherman J billis and Holly roll on the call thats tonight at 6 30 timeout 209 to play still a close one at Blacksburg in two seconds hi Corey Alexander Angel gray with you and down the stretch become partner absolutely and if youre Virginia right now opportunity to put points on the board at the free throw line Reese Beekman with two shots on the attack and again you you stay silent right now for for Virginia you have to get stops thats going to be the important part to be able to get stops on the other end of the floor and Mike young has told his team exactly what he wants them to do coming out the Huddle offensively most likely you will see just as much getting the basketball on the Block forcing Virginia to have to track and opens something up before the break bazilly with the foul beating it excellent at the line 84 percent and makes the pair and this is where its a benefit to have a guy like Justin mutts who you can give him the basketball and allow him to initiate the offense take pressure off of Sean badula to have to deal with Kihei Clark Applause hes the floor so well on the attack and Jay Collins The Freshman whos been working his way into that starting lineup with a big shot Beekman trying to return the favorite he does its amazing the difference in Reef basement at Beekman is MJ Collins took a shot and uh coming off the floor and they hand him a towel gets to be bleeding there from the lift is this just an accidental elbow he took the brunt of it here take a look yeah nothing worse though than when your own teammate gets you and you see Justin must trying to fight through the screen and accidentally elbows his own teammate MJ Collins is the cleanup crew is going to have to get on the floor Music Tony Bennett actually tried to check on MJ Collins as he was walking off the floor he knows here Music and Tony Bennett checking on MJ cause walking off the floor recognizing the blood kind of step back after he saw it hes got recoiled okay thats somebody elses job make sure hes okay but Im not sure anyone yet has recognized that there needs to be cleanup on the floor thank you as you see much coming through that right elbow hes not making contact with his teammate catching Collins Applause still bleeding from the nose freshman from Clover South Carolina its been a nice developing story from Mike young at this point in the season and then heres the issue Collins has been an important part of the mix he made the gamewinner against Duke on this floor to get another look at him thats a tough shot to take and right now the cleanup on the floor is my guy Ethan salima the head athletic trainer for the University of Virginia is now on the job cleaning up here for Virginia Tech but if the time that is taking is giving Virginia Tech a little more time to try to get MJ Collins back into the game got to stop the bleeding though and right now Camden coming back on the floor and John Camden who had a very good game against Syracuse has not played the minutes that MJ Collins has doesnt have the same experience in you remember Virginia Tech playing without Darius Maddox in this game that came to the 68 freshman hes a guy who can shoot the long bomb too 6561 90 seconds to play Virginia Tech with a basketball is matzai directing traffic would tend to shoot hands off for Couture mutts oh look at the feed here for Brazilian to finish Applause getting it done underneath thats why you want the basketball in the hands of Justin Muntz at this time is going to force Virginia to a half to Double T much perfectly navigate to double team finding Grand basili with the nice cut the finish and the Hokies playing with foreign do you think you have what it takes to make like it never even happen well nothing new in this series all time between the Hokies and the Cavaliers another close one 6761 Virginia Tech to give you a look at the reset here Music inside with one timeout remaining Hokies have the possession arrow and Virginia with the basketball right now on the last after timeout we saw Tony Bennett go to action that taught that what Isaac McNeely off of a stagger screen allowing him to get up a three will probably see similar action but itd be more of a decoy to get someone else in the than it would be coming to bring it across approaching one minute to go McNeely Beekman spinning to the paint guard with a rebound and finishes his own Miss twopoint basket is built by one but important time here in the Camden is the guy you want to foul he hasnt been in this situation as often Couture had it knocked away but a whistle two and a foul ball came free but there was a foul on the play and so itll be Couture to the line Reese big but going to the basket unable to finish but Armand Franklin two offensive rebounds Couture shooting two Applause 49 games in this series all time decided by five points or less forgive me Jake Gardner with the offensive rebound to put back on that last possession and Couture with number two 74 at the line a lot of iron but it falls away right now you dont need a three Virginia can go quickly Beacon man got away with a walk there Clark can hit Couture uh muscling everybody for the rebound medulla is the best foul shooter on the floor mutts Applause 7063 Virginia Tech Clark gets up a long one and thatll rattle in a threepointer and a timeout for Jim four point game with 22 seconds to go 22 seconds an eternity in a basketball game only four points still a lot of time remaining and right now if youre Virginia you want to set up your full court pressure see if you can get the turnover first you dont want to foul early without taking the opportunity to get the turnover and Virginia Tech handled the pressure perfectly on the last possession and attacking and then Kihei Clark knocking down the three ball to make it a fourpoint game and right now if youre Tony Bennett you want to send your pressure after guys and if you can foul anyone let it be John Candy let it be Justin mutts one of the guys who arent there better free throw shooters send them to the line and again Camden hasnt been in this position off so therefore let him be the guy that has to go to the free throw line to try to make this a multiple possession game as you mentioned months does a lot of things well not a great foul shooter hes just 63 percent but on the other side of course Mike young will make sure that he designs something to kind of keep both those guys out of the mix as much as you possibly can wants to get the ball the number three Sean Padula any way he can he makes 86 percent one of the best foul Shooters in the Atlantic Coast Conference and most likely Padula will get the inbounds pass Virginia will trap him force him to give it up youve got enough time to continue to extend the game you dont have to foul him immediately but whoever catches it afterwards you got to have a foul there if you dont get the turnover and for Virginia a sevengame winning streak on the line and number six in the poll Virginia Tech finding their way back off a seven game losing skin one a couple lost their last one now trying to knock off their Rivals here in Blacksburg so itll be mutts to put it in Music and right to Padula Clark will foul him immediately less than a second went off but fedula Clark the best foul shooter on the floor for either team you dont mind that strategy either because you save time you continue to extend the game by doing so the problem is you put Virginia Techs best free throw shooter on the line and the guy whos been in this situation many times before said a really good day first meeting in Charlottesville they held him to 10 points they really locked him up but hes been huge today I thought that was a game that KIA Clark took personal Steph Curry of course in Tai Jerome in the building and I think Sean Padula took this one personally today to get a little bit of Retribution 20 for Padula in this one clock off to Beekman in a three Gardner went for the tip and a big battle there and another whistle with 12 seconds to go and a foul here against the Hokies will put Gardner at the line Gardner makes just 63 percent been a big time scoring a square over two thousand career points Applause encouraging the castle guard to make as much noise as possible to keep Jay Gardner for making this a fourpoint game calmly sinking the first one shooting into the teeth of the student section Applause he makes the pair 7268 its Padula again and the reach in a foul by Franklin with 11 seconds left so the Hokies trying to Salt this one away at the line and again Virginia has never had a lead today and it tied several times the great execution by you know the Hokies to be able to get the basketball in Padulas hands knowing that Virginia is going to pressure him and getting him to be the guy that goes to the freethrow line to try to solve this game away now the Hokies hit the line and the 12 of 18 they were only at the line a couple of times in the first meeting and Mike young said before the game theyve been able to do it yeah perfect two for two in the first meeting between these two Beekman to the paint and the kick out long one coming wont drop Gardner back up and thats it final score of 7460 Virginias sevengame winning streak is history Virginia Tech needed this win and they got it a Grog one win to keep their NCAA tournament chances alive at
