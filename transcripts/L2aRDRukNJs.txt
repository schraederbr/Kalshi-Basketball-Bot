terrific crew the wolf pack win it four straight here at home lets get you to Clemson to Georgia Tech Rodney Howard wins the tap you havent missed a thing here at Little John Coliseum with the number 24 Tigers dressed in regalia tonight Applause out of the corner Tyson a three ball to start tonight grass in Georgia Tech starts in that matchup zone that they play so well and in that zone They defend the three very effectively but great ball Movement by the Tigers gets a wide open you see this is Jalen Moore downstairs Howard misses the turnaround jump hook Ian sheplin the rebound Dylan hunter gets his first career start tonight for Brownells tigers here is Galloway launching and hitting six nothing Clemson and a pair of Threes for the Tigers only the best threepoint defensive team in the ACC West Applause Davon Smith runs the offense for Josh pastners jackets of course mantoman for the Tigers Rodney Howard would tend to shoot gets it to Smith Dylan Hunter stays in front of him heres Jalen Moore against shefflin five to shoot Moore tries to find his way to the Baseline and turns it over well if Georgia Techs going to get something going tonight miles Kellys got to be a big part of this Dan averaging better than 14 a game well you can see hes a really good threepoint shooter West and 62 percent of his baskets are threes so you got to be aware of his presence on the Court Galloway a three and the foul the foul is on Jalen Moore its his first first on Georgia Tech and 25 year old Brevin Galloway an 81 percent freethrow shooter goes to the Line West and the amazing thing about this this is a Clemson team that percentagewise shoots the three very well but they only rely on the three for about 25 percent of their offense and yet every single one of their shots and baskets has been a three ten nothing to start Applause here is Howard just inside the top of the circle shuffling the rebound Wesson this is a different start for Georgia Tech theyve started recently in about their last three or four games very well and they dont hit this slump until later in the game first Miss of the night for the Tigers off the short jump shot from Galloway heres Smith trying to get Georgia Tech on the board two minutes in well youd like to get down the court quickly and get a basket or get an opportunity before Clemson can set this defense Coleman heres Howard this is Kelly who we spoke of earlier and a three ball by Coleman Off the Mark Hall runs down the rebound Galloway and the Tigers right to shefflin and Ian shefflin cant buy one it got knocked around and Coleman races through and heres Georgia Tech in transition Coleman all the way through threw it up under the basket Tyson there to scoop it up for Clemson Chris I dont know how they got that ball to Chef the last pass I dont think Ian knows either all of a sudden it just appeared right he was in the middle of a crowd heres Hall skip for Tyson now Galloway Dylan Hunter on the drive and fouled going to the basket and the foul is going to be on Rodney Howard itll be the 611 senior transfers first and the second on Georgia Tech so far west Clemson is doing a great job moving the basketball from side to side and once you move that defense around then that creates driving opportunities Dylan Hunter not a threat from three but he can get it to the goal just the eighth freethrow attempt of the year for Hunter and it is good Dylan is the younger brother of Chase Hunter one of 300 boys playing division one sports Jaden is the oldest he is a linebacker at Western Kentucky part of a New Orleans Bowl championship team and there is Chase Hunter who averages 14 points and better than four assists the game missing tonight his third straight game of the ankle injury Dylans on the board in his first career start and it is a 12nothing tiger lead well again Georgia Tech has had to weather these storms but later in the game usually they build a 10point lead and then get stuck but now they cant get off the schneid ER Davon Smith off the screen of Jordan Mecca whos checked in the game and Smith puts Georgia Tech on the board 1642 to go in this first half and Davon Smith who had nine points and seven assists in Saturdays home loss to Syracuse gets pastors teams a mark and Smith wheelie is not loaded for his jump shooting West hes a guy who attacks the basket Id say thats what he did Saturday in the first half for sure Paul threw it away turned over by the Tigers there first heres Smith and a three ball from the trailing Coleman Off the Mark and PJ Hall has the rebound from in front of Jordan Mecca quickly Tyson in the front Court got to keep the ball moving against this defense now heres Chef mantoman Wes yep and that ball got deflected by Kelly Pat Driscoll Awards it to Georgia Tower at the wards it to Clemson Josh pastners pretty hot about it he thought it was last touched by the Titans well but Pat Driscolls a hard guy to get under his skin hes just gonna he rolls with the punches doesnt he yeah he does heres Hall rolling on Mecca got to the basket scores and draws the foul Mecca draws the foul the Junior from yawande in Cameroon his first third on the jackets except the Smith jump shot its been all Clemson early you deserve a better credit score and averaging just less than eight threes a game and they got three of them right from the jump West they dont rely heavily on as I said about 25 of their points in conference play comes from Beyond The Arc but their first three attempts in make were threes and now theyre gone inside and how about those numbers for PJ Hall Wes Im telling you when he is right when he is healthy hes among the best five players in this league yep and it feels like hes starting to round into form and thats without looking at just the scoring two Dan I think youve got to look at what is and and boy Brad Brownell today with us talking about the combination leadership that he and Hunter Tyson are giving to the success of this basketball program Applause Music Jayvon Franklin into the lineup during the timeout for pastner so he plays with Mecca inside and then three guards if you will Kelly Coleman and Smith and heres Kelly trying to size up shefflin gets it to Smith for a three and its good Davon Smith got all five of Georgia Tech points and thats his ninth three of the year to draw the jackets to within 10 Wesson conference play he shoots under 30 percent from out there but theyre not getting it from anywhere else heres sheplin bounce pass for Hall with Mecca defending PJ out of a double team turns and cant finish too strong on the soft jumper from in the middle thats pretty good defense by Georgia Tech they covered up all his options I dont think he really wanted to shoot the ball hes worried about being in there three seconds and he hurried a little bit five minutes gone in the first half heres Franklin Music trying to square sheflin poked away from behind a nice Dig Down by Dylan Hunter Josh pastner is in season number seven in Atlanta native of Kingwood Texas 80 wins in Atlanta 247 in his career and of course the 21 ACC tournament title that the jackets won in Greensboro with Michael Devoe capturing the MVP honors three ball out of the corner and thats Miles Kelly somehow he shot that from the Clemson bench he shot that and then disappeared in the Clemson bench it is Rule a two but I saw Brett Hampton say theyre going to check it at the next break middle Brooks has checked into the ball game he wears number 10 for the Tigers Applause putter shefflin now Galloway firing into the lane Bremen all the way got it scooped and blocked out of bounds with nine to shoot Georgia Techs really picked up the intensity in the mantoman defense and of course Brad Brownell is Clemsons alltime leader and wins with 234 and captured career win 400 10 days ago roughly when the Tigers beat Duke here in this building in front of a sellout house Galloway inside Brevin Galloway Dan has got nine for Clemson Wes he is one of those guys whos always hes always a threat to explode he hasnt shot the three particularly well percentagewise so far this year but he is very capable and you saw hes got some strength on the interior heres Smith against Galloway twoparter from the elbow rolled off the front rim Tyson the rebound heres Dylan Hunter running the offense tonight for Clemson Galloway bounce pass Middlebrook strong to the basket off the left side for his first points Clemson really moving the ball well West whether its against the mantoman or his own moving the ball well moving their personnel around this is a really efficient tiger offense so far almost knocked out of there by Tyson back for Kelly and another three that spins out thats a great defensive sequence right there because Tyson and Middlebrooks really helped one another Galloway tried to slip it dead through traffic and Middlebrooks couldnt finish the layup whoa what a pass Galloway to Middlebrooks well I I dont know how that pass got through Wes he threw that into trouble and somehow Middlebrooks missed that I dont know how it got through and I dont know how Middlebrooks didnt put it in the basket Davon Smith has got seven of Georgia Techs nine here early theyre glad they brought him today Music but a tough start for the jackets Clemson was blitzing from the start well West Clemson went out 10 to nothing and Georgia Tech has played him even since then and Dylan Hunter gonna be ticking for an offensive foul thatll be the first on the Tigers in the First on Hunter he hooked him on the drive yep and this is something West that you could probably get away with unless you do it right in front of the referee and Pat Driscolls right there and he can see what he sees is the back of Davon Smith and he sees that arm of Hunter come around and thats an easy call substitutions All Around the Horn Wiggins and Godfrey along with Beadle on the floor for the first time for Clemson meanwhile Kyle Sturtevant wearing number one for Georgia Tech is on the deck for the first time for coach pastner and Wiggins and got for here a couple of guys who have really helped Clemson here in recent games Coleman a runner left it short Godfrey gets the rebound quick Outlet here is beetle and Beatles the guy who likes to go Wes yep Applause Music heres Tyson Sturdivant on him quick bounce pass and now Godfrey to work against Rodney Howard with a right hand RJ Godfrey from Suwanee Georgia north of Atlanta puts Clemson up a dozen thats some power right there Wes Applause Smith trying to use the Howard screen Music now Sturdivant against Tyson Hunter slipped down out of the corner heres Smith another three and Howard will be called for the foul here as Godfrey pulls away the rebound second on Rodney Howard fourth on the jackets Clemson by a dozen at Tiger Town here on acc Network and always on the ESPN you may notice that the score changed it was 219 when we went away they ruled this at two by Miles Kelly but clearly that was a three he was behind the line so they corrected that so the score is now 2110 and Wes Kelly now becomes only the second yellow jacket to score in this game on Smith Miles Kelly doing a lot of the damage and Josh Beetle got all the way through and then lost it over the inline out of bounds second turnover for the Tigers who lead by 11 now after we had the math adjustment during the break Jay Bond Franklin Josh pastner sizing down taking Howard off the floor who now has got two fouls by the way that may be part of it as well hes looking for some offense Mecca oh Davon Smith went for the hammer and PJ Hall fought back with the nail wow now Davon Smith hes had some impressive dunks so far this year no no top 10 for you tonight Davon no this is the wrong guy to challenge we talked about the skill set of PJ Hall and one of his skills is excellent timing on those block shots attempt wow that was some play my goodness Kelly with five to shoot thrown away to Godfrey and a foul in the backcourt on Smith his first five on the jackets now in the first half with nine minutes gone okay we wonder where PJ Hall is as a in terms of 100 Dan Im beginning to believe were close but he does a great job here Wes because he steps away from Davon Smith Smith is going on the Baseline and Hall takes one step to the middle of the court so he doesnt hit him with his body thats great body control really smart play and he gets the shot block three ball Galloway front rim miss here is Davon Smith he is some kind of springy athlete isnt he left side Colemans triple rebounded Jalen Moore now Sturtevant will try one from the tiger Paul and Hall the rebound for Clemson Clemson had a couple looks Wes or excuse me Georgia Tech did Wiggins along two Chauncey Wiggins just his 10th field goal of the Year Dan so the Freshman from Grayson Georgia yeah West but hes playing with a lot of confidence he had that big game against Wake Forest nice back door cut and pass Sturdivant to Debo Coleman for his first points but Wesson you mentioned Georgia Tech playing small and thats because theyre worried about their offense Jordan Mecca would give him more size out there but Mecca is no threat on the offensive end all trying to set the screen Godfrey attacking off the dribble now Beetle skips it for Hall three ball in the corner and the rebound pulled away by the jackets Well Done by Jalen Moore on the box out heres Davon Smith back for more and that bounces around and drops in third three of the year for Jalen Moore out of Birmingham and thats what you call Friendly bounce Wes you hear the term soft rims Dan particularly for a guy whos shooting 22 percent in conference play from out there Godfrey after a miserable start the foul will be ticketed on Coleman itll be his first sixth on Georgia Tech and wholesale changes here with shefflin Tyson and Dylan Hunter coming back heres the soft rim for Jalen Moore again hes two for nine from three in ACC play and that hits about every spot on the rim that can hit before it goes in the basket Hunter to put it in Play heres shefflin Applause bounce pass for Hall turns on Franklin with a right hand left it on the front of the rim in shefflin loses the rebound battle to more Applause good defense now can the yellow jackets climb back in the game with some points yeah heres Sturtevant working all the way through heres Franklin left to the Lane Javon Franklins first points and all of a sudden its back to six Georgia Tech has recovered from the Dismal start here yeah that great circle route Sturdivant took through the lane drew the defense and Franklin hes a pretty good midrange jump shooter yep 70 run by the jackets to get it to within six shuffling inside heres Hall over Franklin got the roll with the right hand thats five for PJ Hall on his second field goal Hall is so strong in there its just hard to move him out Franklins not big enough to keep him from shooting over Smith against Dylan Hunter Clemson stays in the mantoman Music Applause heres Jayvon Franklin spinning on Hall tries to get to the basket misses the rebound for Tyson thats a pretty good matchup with Franklin and Hall it is but you saw again the skill set of PJ Hall hes able to move his feet and stay in front theres Hall going for the dunk rubbed out of there no foul and all of a sudden heres Smith and Georgia Tech looking for an alley and thats an offensive foul on more I believe though itll be a block on shefflin Brad Brownell not happy at all with Brent Hamptons whistle itll be the first on shefflin its the second on Clemson PJ Hall a block at one end Applause and that one on Davon Smith Clemson by eight meeting all time between Clemson and Georgia Tech tigers by eight and 2517 here West but the Tigers really started out quickly they ran off 10 points almost before you Georgia Tech got settled in they made three Threes And Yellow Jackets have done a really nice job battling back Georgia Tech who shoots 66 percent from the line in conference play goes to the stripe for the first time tonight Jalen Moore out of Birmingham will get two shots here and the first one no good reminder to you we got a full Saturday of ACC basketball one oclock we get you going from WinstonSalem with the pack and the Deeks and then Duke is in Atlanta to meet Georgia Tech presented by Food Lion in three Subway brings you Clemson and Florida State at five and then Dan and Ill be in the New River Valley for Syracuse and the Hokies who beat Duke last night at the castle well the Hokies lost those seven games in a row West but they are a much much better team than that boy sure are and that that NC State Wake Forest game thats one of the classic ACC rivalries West Tyson have missed three and then Hall reaches in to draw the foul itll be his third engine hole Music so one on PJ Hall and Ben Middlebrooks will check in to replace Hall and middle Brooks and sheflin and Hall have really created a nice combination inside for Brad Brown Allen now Godfrey is added to that group and were going to get a foul here I think Tyson looks under Tyson yep itll be his first its four on Clemson he grabbed a hold of whoever that was going by 7 20 to go in this first half Hunters got a three to start the game and thats all weve heard from the grad student from Monroe North Carolina here in the first half so far Music of it Music Works off the screen of Franklin into the corner heres Moore attacking on the dribble stripped out of there middle Brooks comes up with the Georgia Tech turnover really nice job by Middlebrooks West to not try to push anything right there heres Tyson trying to get by Debo Coleman offensive foul called by Pat Driscoll thatll be two on Tyson five on Clemson here in the first half but WESH you mentioned that we havent really heard much from Tyson theyre defending him with a smaller guy a little bit harder for Hunter tryson to drive by nice job by Debo Coleman to move his feet Brad Brownell with the word for the accs number six score in conference play its 17 a game Music Sturdivant against Wiggins whos back on the floor for Coach Brownell Franklin to catch and dunk second basket for Jayvon Franklin that A Little Rock Arkansas Georgia Tech to within five Georgia Tech sort of flipping the script from their last games West usually they start quickly and fall off here its going to be on Franklin thatll be his first at seven on Georgia Tech with 6 22 to go in the first half and Josh passengers guys tonight they got behind 10 to nothing and now theyre really making a run here they just lose Franklin thats Wiggins hes in the game because Tyson went out with foul trouble so heres Galloway front end of the one and one left it on the rim and Brevin tried to get his own rebound and lost it to more Georgia Techs made four out of their last five field goal attempts yep Davon Smith clutched on a deep one spots up for the long two and the jackets two within three nine for Smith on his fourth field goal thats a really nice job recognizing that hes got a bigger guy against him creating some room and knocking down a jump shot 122 run has got him to within three Wiggins a three got it from way out on the left his sixth of the year Music a layup attempt no good and the rebound for Sturtevant a West three of those six came in that Wake Forest game thats right yeah he had 10 in WinstonSalem and the Tigers conference lost last Tuesday night Sturdivant thought about it on the drive follow away nope and Hunter will run it down in the corner Dillon trying to attack out front heres shuffling Applause gotta find somebody heres Hunter five minutes to go in his first half Galloway three at the top got it Galloway rings the bell Dan hes got a dozen to lead Clemson in the first half well she is a very confident shooter a good screen by Middlebrooks again Galloway is one of those guys who didnt go off yep ninepoint lead again for the Tigers after Georgia Tech had cut it to five Smith off the Franklin screen Hunter doing a nice job trying to stay in front eight to shoot heres Sturtevant bounce pass Baseline in traffic Franklin had it lost at Middlebrooks with the Georgia Tech turnover number four on pastors team here in the first half Weston the last three have come bang bang and thats been a problem for Georgia Tech they sometimes put themselves in trouble because they turned the ball over heres Wiggins again on the drive Chauncey off the glass wow seven in the first half for Wiggins Josh Pastor a timeout back to an 11 point Clemson lead with 403 to go and the man from Anderson is driving it Brevin Galloway knocking down threes back after this Subways up in their subs tigers by 11 here at Little John Coliseum I read in the preseason where Chauncey Wiggins was a longrange Prospect I dont think they were talking about his shooting though Dan well no and he has certainly the long range isnt quite as long as they thought because he has particularly over the last few games has made a substantial contribution Wes he is the second leading scorer tonight for Clemson right he came off the bench and has played extremely well yeah Wiggins at 610 hes part of a uh Gwinnett County influence thats a County right adjacent to Atlanta north of the city if you will Ian shefflin Chauncey Wiggins RJ Godfrey all the uh the guys you can look at now Chase Hunter of course and Dylan hunter from Westlake which is more metropolitan Atlanta but Wiggins shefflin and uh certainly Godfrey all contributing here in the first half for Brad Brownells team whos back up 11 now what a great job by Wiggins to move his feet start of it and it fell off and Godfrey the rebound but that whole play was keyed by Wiggins preventing Devin Davon Smith from getting Bob look at Wiggins all the way in the basket cant finish on the layup and Davon Smith who averages better than five rebounds a game trying to do the oneman fast break and gets it to Franklin for the dunk third field goal for Jayvon Franklin hes got six Smiths got nine thats 15 to Georgia Techs 24 nice job by Franklin to get great position so all he had to do was catch it and dunk it Coleman will commit the foul as shefflin made the catch this is just a great job by Franklin running to a spot West sometimes you see a big guy run to his spot so when he catches the ball hes got to take a dribble to get to the basket and that allows the defense to get there but Franklin does a great job finding the spot where he can just catch it and dunk it shefflin is 77 percent Applause first one from Ian Clemson has now missed two consecutive front ends of the one and one and theyre a really good freethrow shooting team yeah theyre uh number one in conference play at 86 percent and theres Davon Smith I think theyre number five in the country west yep yeah theyre better than 86 percent in conference play Georgia Tech to within seven all four in a row here heres Godfrey with Coleman defending offensive foul RJ Godfrey picks up the personal itll be his first it is six on the Tigers well this is a situation where Godfrey he catches the ball Wesson if youre a guy like Godfrey at his size you have to be able to take and do a little turnaround jump shot or a little hook shot from there I mean hes close to the basket you dont need to get another foot or two closer and pick up that foul PJ Hall came onto the floor Godfrey thought he was coming out instead at shefflin who checks out for Coach Brownell so Hall Godfrey Wiggins Dylan Hunter and Brevin Galloway out there for Clemson Wes Ill tell you and thrown away by Georgia Tech theres another turnover heres Hunter into the front Court to the trailing Galloway on the drive lost the handle theyll go to the deck look at Hall roll around Davon Smith had a crack at it Godfrey makes the save Baseline heres Hall PJ through traffic and are they going to call a offensive foul they step across a block Josh pastner just lost his pin fired up about the call Music it is going to be a block on Davon Smith its his second its the ninth once you establish an initial guarding position West youre allowed to move to maintain it but I in that particular play it didnt look like Smith ever established guarding position so heres PJ Hall 81 percent free throw good dont forget if youre a fan and youre at an ACC sporting event wed love to see it capture it tag it and post it on your social media use the hashtag all the devotion and look for it at ACC Network and all our social media platforms six for Hall make it seven Applause and the lead to nine with 210 to play first half Applause start of it heres Franklin good screen by Franklin Sturdivant left open 17 feet knocks it down 99th career game tonight for Kyle Sturtevant he had 18 in the overtime loss at Notre Dame and on the board here tonight at Clemson hes a pretty good midrange Jump Street Godfrey heres Dylan Hunter back for RJ Godfrey now Hunter trying to attack on the dribble Applause Paul tried to get the entry pass Smith stepped out of bounds itll stay with Clemson but only eight to shoot and 132 to play in the first half Applause this just situation where God Wiggins there gets caught up on the screen and PJ Hall drops off a little too far and cant get back they try to get at the hall Franklin tried to make the save and Franklin threw it off a hall PJ Hall was asking Justin Porterfield about something there and litigating on behalf of Clemson but nonetheless it goes to Georgia Tech Applause Sturdivant Music foreign heres Kelly now step back long too and Godfrey will run down the rebound really good block out by Galloway yep heres Galloway Godfrey left open momentarily hutter skips it in the corner Wiggins lines it up spins out on another three heres Kyle Sturdivant leaves it for Davon Smith and Galloway alone for the rebound again threepoint shooting is not daylight Savon Smith on the year 24 and theres a tiger time out for Brad Brownell his teams gone three minutes without a field goal but still leading by seven here at home Ill wait hes up in the game up here after a very tough start Dan they rallied back had his many as close as five here in this first half they Trail by seven at 3528 jackets played tonight without Lance Terry averaging better than nine against the league and Tristan Maxwell whos got a hip pointer he didnt even make the trip here tonight well and of course Clemson still playing without Alex Hemingway who hadnt played since December with that foot problem and theyre playing without Chase Hunter yeah so the ball will belong to Clemson theres Hunter and Hemingway on the bench well the guys look good in the grit after dark tshirts but I mean I think Brad Brownell yeah what the regalia is that what you said that color was thats what the color is its tiger orange and regalia okay all right and the corner Galloway Coleman there quickly to cover the Clemson Sharpshooter Im an old guy that looks like purple uhhuh got news for you here is Galloway left open three balls spins off Chauncey Wiggins Wow have a half hes got nine Western Clemson is not a great offensive rebounding team boy they had everybody around the basket that time and Wiggins what a bouncy guy heres Davon Smith with six seconds jackets will take the last shot of the half Smith thought about it step back three Off the Mark and Clemson is going to take a 3728 lead to the locker room here at halftime Dan all right Clemson started really well and then withstood a Clemson run and Wiggins how about Wiggins knocking points off the bench for the Tigers yep well Clemson shoots 50 size that one up tonight you follow basketball huh well you see the shooting numbers in this half Clemson at 50 Georgia Tech at 39 the turnover number surprising to see Clemson with more than Georgia Tech down at the break wow but I thought the turnovers hurt Georgia Tech worse than they heard Clemson three ball from the front front rim Miss for Kelly and the Tigers with Dylan hunter in his first career start tonight of course his older brother Chase on the Shelf as is Alex Hemingway for Brownells Club heres Tyson inside Hall the catch in school nine for PJ Hall on his third field goal Wesson unless he shoots that as quickly as he did hes double teamed and in trouble what a great job to get rid of it heres Kelly out front High post to Howard who picked up 2000 had to go the bench I thought that really hurt Georgia Tech they rely on Howard pass that ball out from the top Coleman trying to back down Galloway leans in and off the iron and Hall will pull it away in the hell ball well go to the Tigers West PJ Hall we talked about the number of skills that he has that he can apply but here he just gets rid of the ball he feels the double team coming nothing fancy about that no fancy hook shot no lefthanded play just get rid of it knock it in the basket Howard tried to help on the screen they quickly get it left corner shefflin and a little long with the three some traps by Georgia Tech that time in the half court yep heres Kelly against Hunter Hunters done a really nice job against Kelly tonight sure has miles Kellys got just a threepoint goal for his scoring now hell rub off the Howard screen up top 10 to shoot Davon Smith will put a charge in it from three and the rebound for Howards second chance for the jackets Kelly heres Coleman Georgia Tech actually a pretty good offensive rebounding team yep four of them tonight at the offensive end Coleman good on the jumper second field goal for the sophomore Debo Coleman of course thats a tough shot to Clemson now of course the defense doesnt stop till you have the ball and they didnt get the defensive rebound but otherwise their defense was pretty solid foreign heres Hall catch and shoot three front rim Smith battle heal he was over the top of Jalen Moore its amazing how many rebounds he gets from that guard spot and theres a turnover Davon dragged the foot sixth turnover for Georgia Tech Debo Coleman is coming off a uh season high on Saturday against Syracuse thats just a really good move he backed Galloway down and then was able to step back and were talking about Davon Smith nominally hes the point guard and in ACC play he leads the yellow jackets and rebound yep sure does heres Hall again Rodney Howard there TJ scores and draws the foul hey when youre playing like Hall is you count your own bucket too this is an entirely different sequence on the inside he cant get rid of it quickly he goes right tall he feels the pressure the double team runs bad AJ awarded himself to free throw yeah and Howard picks up the foul and thats his third foul my goodness really good job by Hall to attack in that situation and be alert enough to avoid that double team third on Rodney Howard hell come out of the lineup for Coach passner Jayvon Franklin has reported in for the first time here in the second half and Georgia Tech one with that smaller more athletic lineup yep so heres Hall to the line hes got 11 make a 12 12 point lead for the Tigers Applause almost three minutes gone here second half at Little John Coliseum Music start of it tried to get it to Franklin threw it away and Jalen Moore quickly Off the Bench to replace Kyle Sturdivant and the seventh Georgia Tech turnover and Brent Hampton wants uh Dylan Hunter to tuck in the regalia Applause Tyson its been a quiet night for Hunter Tyson Hall working around Franklin hell draw the foul thats two on Jayvon Franklin now heres the other thing he knew when I noted this when we were here for the Duke game PJ Halls the kind of player he can get you in foul trouble Wes you saw one of the reasons right there that time he caught the ball he wasnt close to the low post but hes able to turn and drive it into that low post area Music Hunter one dribble in the lane to shefflin and Ian finally lost the handle on it turned over by the Tigers the hall actually excuse me Hunter actually threw that ball into trouble yep Chef was surrounded in there didnt really help him to get that ball cant get through heres Smith for Franklin with Dylan Hunter on him thats a win for Georgia Tech Franklin went back to the basket Moore gonna follow on the weak side off the Miss for the hoop six now for Jalen Moore had 17 against NC State to go with eight rebounds and a home loss as soon as shefflin went to help Moore went right to the basket nice play Hunter skip for shefflin Baseline back for hunter in the corner heres Tyson Coleman there they whip it back around the front heres Galloway three bounds away to Smith Tysons been very quiet tonight West hes only attempted Two Shots Georgia Techs done a pretty good job finding him whether it be in the man that weve seen briefly or the Zone package but Debo Coleman has been basically the guy Garden in mantoman and hes got enough size that he can stay with it fraud heres Kelly catching shoot Hall another rebound and thats a shot that Georgia Tech has to make Kellys got to make a pretty good percentage of those shots if theyre going to get back in this one Tyson will cut one loose and it bounds away I think he was just trying to get something going there Dan yeah I do but maybe try to get something going in the midrange West hes got a couple inches on Debo Coleman he doesnt want to be trying to drive past him to get in the midrange and get the you know catch the ball with his back to the basket a little turnaround jumper 10point lead both teams kind of trying to find their way offensively heres sheplin inside against Moore and had it blocked he and got it back heres Hunter left open three ball got it Dylan Hunter finally knocks it home from three for the first time this year and a timeout taken by Georgia Tech Josh pastners team Trails by 13 after the Freshman from West Lake High School in Atlanta strikes from behind the line Music the way we start second half its been trouble in fact he said we may stay in the locker room and just come out and play not even come out and shoot shots before the second half starts you see the last five games from the start of the half to the under 16 timeout there were eight of 36 in their last five tonight Dan theyre two of eight thats a disturbing thing and when youre coaching and it struggles is on it drives you crazy doesnt it well and what do you do about that right you know I dont know and I dont think Josh is taking much comfort in the fact that there are three percentage points better tonight than they have been right but here they go to the locker room at halftime down 3728 and here they come back and immediately now theyre down by 13 and they struggled to score anyway so its hard for them to come back Chauncey Wiggins on the floor man we spoke of him coming into the second half after a nine point first half back door cut Franklin the dunk Trayvon Franklins got eight tonight and I think all of them are around the rim at least three of them are he set a screen Galloway fell down he recognized that Galloway was down and so his man had to go cover the ball and he just goes right to the basket quick cut heres Hunter inside Dillon trying to go up strong does against Franklin and scores Dylan Hunter now with five in a row thats a pretty impressive play by Hunter because he didnt catch the ball cleanly and I didnt think hed be able to get that one off Music Hunters been solid tonight Wes theres Wiggins trying to stay in front of the cap quick Davon Smith and doing a nice job staying in front of them Kelly rounding over to the Top Shot off Mark and rebounded by Smith he stepped out of bounds for an Hampton awarded to to Clemson well Jayvon Franklin has got eight three of them on dunks but Stan said just a nice move here Clemson in front 13 at Littlejohn Gatorade well Dan heres todays version of Bracketology with our Buddy Joe Leonardi hes got seven ACC teams in the field and wake in Virginia Tech kind of in the neighborhood if you will well Wesson one of the things that Joe is looking at everybodys looking about whats whats your record against the various quads everybody here quad one wins quad one wins where theres Clemson theyre two and two in Quad one they have two quad one wins the problem for the Tigers is down there at the bottom theyve got those two quad four losses theyre lost to South Carolina theyre lost to Loyola Chicago and thats one of the reasons why Brad brownells team even though theyve been very impressive this year they cant afford to stumble against a team like Georgia Tech got a 13point lead with 13 and a half to go jackets back to that zone here is Hunter sneaking Baseline and scores wow he has a little play Dylan Hunters got seven in a row the three ball let the pilot fight heres Franklin in traffic blocked out of there by Middlebrooks itll stay with the jackets can I tell you something I learned about Ben Middlebrooks last week you may tell me Ben middlebrooks been hiding out on us do you know who his uncle is who Danny Connell the former Florida State quarterback I knew who had to hear it from Danny Cannell Jayvon Franklin another dump 10 for Franklin who was in double figures at Notre Dame with a dozen points and a dozen rebounds a week ago Frankel just keeps grinding away out there well shes only six seven a little bit undersized Tyson a runner and hell get free throws foul I Believe on Jalen Moore itll be his second Ive got Clemson or Georgia Tech now for three here in the second half Wes were talking about Hunter Tyson and what he needs to do to get going and one of the ways he can get going is taking the ball and driving it to the basket and getting to the freethrow lot here is Tyson fifth best free throw shooter in the ACC at 84 percent first trip to the line tonight Music and the first of two is good dont forget womens basketball and a quadruple header teed up for you this weekend starts at noon with Louisville and Syracuse then a top 24 matchup Duke visits Tallahassee for Florida State and Carolina Clemson here at Little John at four and Virginia Tech Virginia presented by Food Lion caps off the quadruple header on acc Network always available on the ESPN app Tyson hit him both hes got five and the lead is 15 but its a lead West thats really been created by Clemsons defense Applause more Kelly on the drive and scores Miles Kelly just his second field goal comes in as Georgia Techs leading scorer better than 14 a game in League Play and thats the first time Wes hes really been able to get loose and an offensive foul on Dylan Hunter Music well they whistled it on five its on Hunter Tyson I thought it was on Dylan Hunter so nonetheless its on Tyson his third thats just the first of the second half on Clemson I apologize to Dylan Hunter here an illegal screen thats Hunter Tyson right in the middle of your screen I saw it there so Tyson is out on his third foul that was some screen though there it was Music Franklin bounce pass inside more to work turns with a left hand and the foul will be ticketed to Chauncey Wiggins or RJ gotford second on Godfrey second on Clemson free throws for Georgia Tech when we come back on a Tuesday night first start Dan wow hes played he played very solidly in the first half West with a couple of assists pretty good job defensively but hes got it going here offensively in the second half driving to the basket scoring inside and hitting his first career threepoint basket and of course all these numbers here career highs throw out a foul going to the break on Godfrey so Dylan Hunter back out with Brevin Galloway Wiggins Hall and the aforementioned Godfrey seven of those nine points for Dylan Hunter West have come here in this little stretch in the second half Jayla Moore will be at the line hes one for two tonight has six points Music Applause and the first one good dont forget we got a full weekend of basketball for you on acc Network State and wake from WinstonSalem get you going at one and then Duke and George attacking Atlanta presented by Food Lion follows that and then Subway brings you Clemsons visit to Florida State and then Dan and Ill be with you from Blacksburg for the Hokies in Orange to put a cap on it all on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app Wesson among the problems the yellow jackets have had tonight they simply havent been able to get to the free throw line that was only free throws number three and four for Georgia Tech on the drive Hunter tried to get it to hall went right through PJs hands over the inline so its an 11 point lead for Brad Brownells team thats her ninth turnover tonight well West its their ninth turnover but Georgia Tech has only been able to convert those turnovers into four points so thats what were talking about before Clemson they have forced eight turnovers and theyve converted to 13 points so Georgia Tech hadnt really taken advantage of the turnovers jelly against Hunter tried to use a screen from Franklin now Smith with Wiggins there three to shoot heres Jalen Moore and the rebound for Hall you know its hard to get past Wiggins and its impossible to shoot over him if youre if youre Dave on Smith Music Galloway back door PJ Hall sets it down 14 for Paul on his fifth field goal pretty basketball from the Tigers absolutely nice pass and really good onehanded catch Franklin Applause now Smith hell back out against Wiggins start about with seven to shoot takes his own initiative and scores second field goal for Kyle Sturdivant Applause Music heres Hall again Galloway PJ a three from the front Applause West when hes rolling this team is really tough hes got 17 now thats his 17th three of the year and a whistling foul called and its on PJ Hall itll be his second and the third on Clemson uh PJ Hall West he sets a good screen two people go with Galloway because theyre worried about his threepoint shooting nobody around the basket thats not a good way to defend BJ Hall and now Pat Driscoll theres Jalen Moore checks out Depot Coleman has come in holmens been quiet offensively done a pretty good good job defensively Smith a two ball and sheplin the rebound he checked in during that break for the Tigers what Smith is six feet one and its hard to shoot it over the 610 Wiggins yeah Chelsea Wiggins is he really sparked Clemson at the end of the first half I thought Chef a nice pass and Galloway thatll be a goaltend on Franklin and Brevin Galloways now got 14 on his fifth field goal first basket of the second half Georgia Tech trying to be aggressive in the mantoman defense and this is just a nice little bounce pass into traffic but he found an opening did shefflin it hit the glass right yep once the ball hits the board you cant touch it Applause 16 point Clemson lead Applause start of it trying to get past his motion offense going theres more at the foul line Howard the rebound and he couldnt hang on to it so he couldnt hang on to it because Dylan Hunter was there knocking it away how about that heres Wiggins look out hell roll look at this shot nope Off the Mark shuffling had a crack at it Coleman out of there Georgia Tech trying to get in transition Kelly a quick three more of the backside rebound another three ball and that goes off the iron and Hull the rebound from in front of Howard West Kelly was the guy we featured before the game and we talked about how Georgia Tech to be successful Kelly had to have a big night and he simply has it heres Hall entry for shefflin and hes fouled by Jalen Moore thatll be the third on Moore fourth on Georgia Tech here in the second half that last shot that Wiggins just took thats called a buzzer shot Wes you take that and the buzzer sounds and somebody comes in the game now wait a second and Chelseas had a pretty good night I understand that but he still took a buzzer shot and Hunter Tyson is back in the game here is Hell cutter put it in play to PJ and he got it right back and I could surprise Dylan heres Tyson trying to get on track and Bounds off the rim points surprised Hunter because he was trying to get inbound yeah start of it gets it to Coleman Applause shefflin trying to stop the turn of Moore did and Tyson collects the air ball tigers are a lot better than you think at the defensive end Dan well West they contest everything they can test every pass they contest every dribble they can test every Drive and the boss poked Away by Coleman thatll get us to a timeout under eight to play tigers by 16 Music on behind can learn some things Rock Clemson obviously theyve had a great season west of 164 this is their remaining schedule and look all the way in the right hand column what youre looking for if youre the Tigers you want to get as many quad one wins as you can and you see here they dont have that many opportunities left just three and of course theyd be very tough games at North Carolina at NC State at Virginia you want to avoid at all costs a quad 3 or a quad four loss and so thats what the tigers are looking at they only have one game thats not in you know thats in the second quad and thats Miami and thatll be a heck of a game anymore tell me on February 4th but what youre hunting is quad one wins and what youre trying to avoid is quad three and four losses Tyson the Hunters night is it it is not under eight to go 16 point lead for Clemson heres Kelly jackets trying to make a run here Wesson that says something about this Clemson team Chase Hunter is not playing at all and Hunter Tyson is having an off kick and yet theyre still ahead by 16 points start of it heres Franklin tend to shoot for the jackets Music squeezing into traffic and flipping it up is a tough shot rewarded for Miles Kelly Wesson thats thats been the issue for Georgia Tech when they get get shots for the most part theyve been tough sharks its hard to score a lot of points when youre limited to tough shots heres Dylan Hunter now shuffling Applause heres Hall in the corner Tyson a three well hes awake just a second field goal to the Ball Game and that wasnt bad defense you know against the Zone Clemson moves the ball pretty well but Franklin was out there contesting the shot thats just good offense by Hunter 17point game 6144 Debo Coleman squares and Tyson the rebound boy thats some rebound it is and you know what when hes not having a great shooting night it doesnt detract from the rest I dont know he guards he rebounds he does everything he needs to do heres sheplin strong move and a layup good first basket of the night for Ian shefflin and a timeout taken Georgia Tech trailing by 19 with six minutes to play Music has this ever happened to you how is 6344 Dan better than six minutes to play and uh again maybe not having a great scoring Night Hunter Tyson keeps chasing man well he does Wes and he hit that was a tough shot and this is just a great job Howard has inside position but hunter Tyson has shown you he is a really good rebounder and the numbers a little low tonight West but I think hes done a good job defensively hes also been in some foul trouble so that has limited his minutes but Wiggins Has Come Off the Bench and played very well Georgia Tech was Sturdivant the senior from Norcross jackets have only hit one of their last seven from the floor six minutes to go and tigers by 19 but theres just nowhere to go yep shefflin trying to keep Sturtevant at Bay three ball Tyson the rebound heres Hall Applause back door cut and Galloway tried to fire it through to shuffling got deflected out of there turned over by the Tigers heres Sturtevant out of the corner for three and Sheffield will collect that Miss Wesson again Georgia Tech with a turnover and opportunity and theyre not able to convert over Georgia Tech has been relentlessly working this ball inside Hall had it fall off the front he hadnt missed many nope and Sterling gets it to Coleman pass Coleman of three nope theyve missed 10 threes here in the second half and 11 now how about a third drop Josh pastner with 14 to shoot Henry sets the offense hes out on the court theyre going to have to defend him soon and that ball got deflected by Dylan Hunter with eight on the shot clock and here comes Jalen Moore into the lineup with Jayvon Franklin Applause Georgia Tech is not scoring from Beyond The Arc theyre going to struggle because in conference play they get 37 percent of their scoring from behind the threepoint line so its a big part of their offense Music six to shoot heres start of it Applause and he traveled Yep this is what were talking about with the defense Wes they just make it really tough Sturdivant has a big guy on him and figures okay I can drive by but hes not able to get by because middle Brooks moves his feet and forces a turnover yep Applause putter tried to go to Middlebrooks taken by Franklin and jaybon will lay it in hes got 12 in the ball game middle Brooks needs to step toward that ball Wes and nice job by Franklin to anticipate the pass but if he steps toward the ball then Franklin runs into him its a foul Galloway trying to weave on The Pick of Middlebrooks shefflin heres Tyson working on Debo Coleman Fall Away spins in unless Coleman does a nice job cutting him off Tyson cant get all the way but thats we were talking about earlier get the ball into the lane hit the turnaround jump shot Hunter Tyson just three for seven tonight two of five from behind the line but is in double figures with 10 well listen hes got eight rebounds so he could finish the game with a double double yep Moore slips it to Kelly and through traffic Miles Kelly scores thats nine for Kelly six here in the second half but its a 17point Clemson lead with 320 to play now the hill may be a little too big for Georgia Tech to climb here s Hunter Galloway standing in the Paul finds middle Brooks a little shot fake and layup Ben Middlebrook second field goal The Zone had started to shift over for an open Tyson in the corner and they just left middle Brooks on the inside nice job to find it Applause heres Smith using the Franklin screen spot up off the elbow and the rebound Tyson Georgia Tech is now nine of 29 from the floor in the second half 31 percent heres Hunter Galloway nice pass Middlebrook skip for shefflins three and Smith the backside rebound and Georgia Tech on the Run into the corner for Coleman thats a three ball thats good for Debo Coleman and a timeout for Josh pastner Colemans got seven in the game and well step aside too 213 to play at Little John Clemson trying to get their ninth ACC win Gatorade fit Solomon poured in 41 heres John Babel trying to get up off the ground Solomon poured in 41 and Clemson lost to Georgia Tech 111 to 108 Solomon would finish as the number 15 scorer in Clemson history thats where he is tonight I should say terrific terrific basketball terrific basketball player Wesson he was one of those guys he could explode anytime yep and when you think of the Clemson Georgia Tech series 21 years ago tonight will Solomon poured in 41 and Paul Hewitts first team ever to play at Little John Coliseum jackets ended up winning Alvin Jones had 26 by the way jackets hit a School record 17 threes and theres Tyson adding to Clemsons total Hunter Tysons got 11 tonight Dan well West and he hit the three and hes made a couple of those midrange jump shots thank you foreign hes got 12 now and eight rebounds officially jump shot by Kelly bounds away into the hands of Ian sheffler well Brad brownells team is getting ready to win their 15th straight game at home Applause but West are going to go to nine and one in the ACC Wes its been a heck of a year for Brad Brown on his guys but if you look at the net rankings theyre what 54 today and so that thats an indication that theres not an awful lot of respect out there for the Clemson Tigers dont forget tomorrow night nothing but netcaps are two nights from now I should say Thursday night 10 oclock Kelsey Riggs post with highlights analysis a breakdown of all the ball games including a look ahead to the quadruple header on Sunday on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app and thats why Wes its so important for the Tigers to hold serve in these quad 3 and quad 4 games and then take advantage of opportunities when they have them in their quad one opportunities Dylan Hunter had it blocked by Smith and then Tyson stole the outlet pass heres Hunter timeout and now Brad Brownell all hes going to do is get Devin Foster Jack and Daniel Nassif and Matt Kelly into the ball game to finish out here these guys have not played in the last eight games and they will uh check in I thought Matt Kelly was checking in is he in the ball game no hes not Matt Kellys not in so its Jack and Daniel Nasi and Devin Foster from Canton Mass into the lineup with uh Chauncey Wiggins inside here is Daniel skip out for Wiggins three sure wow that is a seasonhigh 12 now for Wiggins and uh Justin Porterfield is saying there should be 285 seconds on the clock 7251 why not huh why not Clemson is headed to Florida State on Saturday where they have lost their last seven times at the Tucker Center Sturdivant the Miss here is Coleman Applause and Franklin will bounce it for more the tigers are going to be 174 Dan 91 in the ACC and Georgia Tech is going to take a sixth straight loss and eight of their last nine and they get Duke on Saturday at home in Atlanta best 10 game start in ACC history for the Clemson Tigers an 82 and 8687 have been the other Mark and this is a charter member of the Atlantic Coast Conference West so really an impressive season for the Clemson Tigers
