CC history to achieve that pretty good company Tim Duncan and Ralph Samson yeah thats a pretty good list to be on here we go third game of the year for North Carolina the fourth for the visiting Highlanders North Carolina in their Carolina blue inside the dean Dome that does not happen often you see Riverside in those whites more on that a few moments very veteran roster that has helped North Carolina get out to a two and0 start heres Harris in England one of the first year heels with a sweet little turn around right you see Riverside starts in the manto man and thats going to be hard to defend as Carolina has pretty good size at every position the starring lineup for a UC Riverside team that won 22 games a year ago most in their division one history which is about a couple decades old now some new players in the rotation they lost their top three scores so Mike magio trying to figure things out early on at the line this is Ben brisy so UC see Riverside D we just mentioned it theyre wearing their home white uniforms they ordered new uniforms this year as a program the road ones havent come in yet so UNC was gracious enough to say yes hey well wear our Carolina blue tonight theres nothing wrong with Carolina blue fans around here like that color so hat tip to the Sid extraordinaire Steve Ker says Hey the last time that North Carolina won uh uh wore those Carolina blue uniforms at home against an opponent 10 years ago it was part of a New Years Eve game blue Years Eve was the theme so go figure here they are wearing them once again 10 years later but no marketing genius was involved in this one so its just because poor guys from Riverside their uniforms havent shown up yet well so far than one win and two losses with those white Unis theres the big man who can stretch it the 611 junor from Australia Ben gisy who was just at the line so hes got a 42 lead over UNC but this is what UC Riverside does they shoot the three almost half their field goal attempts come from Beyond the AR engram watches that one ran down and out and there they took 36 last time they played on Sunday at Portland well they played three games and theyve launched 997 of them now they havent shot it particularly well so far this is gristy kicks it back out to barington hardress hes going to run the point at to along with this man Isaiah Moses into the paint out to bristy only two to shoot so Aris has to hoist from way out there its going to be hard for them to penetrate inside that North Carolina Applause defense cor M Ryan finds the big man easy Deuce for Bak but its tough because youre taught to go and help but its really hard to leave onov he catches the ball so well inside and you getting the ball that close to the basket just forget it that was an easy look for him in that game against Lehigh last weekend lot single coverage didnt face too many double doubles and he tore up the D went for 22 and secured 20 rebounds theres another three from Deep this one long will tatter saww couldnt get it to go and New 2 for Riverside coming in Riverside is shooting 28 from Beyond The Arc so they shoot him a lot but they dont make a very high percentage two losses at Utah and at Portland away from home its a long possession that North Carolina has at the point defense They Come Away with a stop this is the very versatile Ingram ran a Baseline Drive look whos open heres RJ Davis no thats great ball movement its exactly what you want to get just like the ball to go in the basket North Carolina in its first two games they scored 90 against Lehigh last week and then 86 in the opener against Radford were still early things looking pretty good and smoother in the offensive end offensive foul on Kyle Owens Owens at 68 has a couple inches and a few pounds on Paxton woic on the side and while you will see its very hard for a help Defender to draw a charge if you maintain your guarding position and youre the primary Defender referees are still calling charges that was a good call especially with that offensive player they just dip the shoulder try to drive it into the defender heres Ingram left that one a little short on the runner down the right Applause alley Moses slipped look like his fo caught the endline hes out of Music bounds so Riverside just one of five from the field to start they really havent gotten good opportunities uh youre getting a look there at Isaac Moses and he is he was a junior college AllAmerican last year but hes still adjusting to the college game hes only 6 feet tall Mark Mago told us that hes used to having bigger guards than that and so that size might be a factor tonight now making a foul underneath looks like Washington drew the personal on Ben grisy our first timeout four up inside the dean doome a dream is a Wish Your Heart Makes Music reloaded roster you see the number 20 ranking next to the name you not just due to what they brought back but also some of the impactful transfers that Hubert Davis and this staff signed out of the portal there you go Cormac Bryan Arison Ingram Jaylen Withers and Paxon woic some of the key transfers that joined this roster Ryan wji and Withers are all graduate students and Ingram he comes in as a junior so a lot of experience those guys have played a lot of minutes in college basketball they know what needs to be done to work hard to win games and hum Davis has been very candid about its not just the experience and versatility that is going to help this team this year boy he loves the death and a lot of that veteran death as well jayen Washington buries the first triple for USC thats his first attempt and first make of the year and he came in with the reputation of somebody who could shoot him from out there hadnt had a lot of opportunities so far everybody knows the value of RJ Davis Alondo Bok Washington one of those freshman turn sophomores this season aiming to take a step forward Washington number 13 in the Carolina blue heres Davis off the screen attacks and L it Music in thats just a great job by North Carolina they rushed the ball up the court never allowed the defense to get set theres not a lot of shot blocking out there for the Highlanders at the moment tallest player on the floor is this man right here Ben grisy 611 not really a rim protector more of a stretch five yeah but so far after that first three North Carolina has done a great job getting out on him limiting his ability to shoot it arz the hesitation move to get close range and did that one even hit the rim if if it didnt it is a shot clock violation Mike magpayo is suggesting yeah Mike magpayo is suggesting that the ball did hit the rim and the officials are saying no it didnt and thats not one where you have to go and review it uh you if the officials are sure and they are then they dont need to go look so therefore shot clock violation North Carolina coming back the other way heres Music Ingram Ryan into the paint a wide opening free him up for the lay couple of clean looks at The Rim so far for North Carolina and the heels are on a 9 nothing run jallon Martinez puts a stop to that well hes got a little more bulk Martinez does than gristy and so with Martinez in the game you can expect to see the Highlanders try to throw it inside a little bit Elliot kadoo attacks off the window and in theres the Freshman five star hes turned a lot of heads Applause yeah he and Davis the primary ball handlers early on for Music UNC a Pickins what you got to shoot that kick out hardress 4 three okay well three is better than two Applause but thats a tough one to pass up salar say had her right next to the basket so theres the first triple to go down for UC Riverside you mentioned theyre going to take a ton that is Mike magos philosophy space the floor let them go theres Bott posted up on Martinez finds Ingram and he sticks it North Carolina doesnt take as many but they can really shoot the ball when they have openings like that you give Harrison Ingram that much time thats a pretty easy shot and were only five of 17 from Deep against Lehi they have connected several times early on now Ingram with five had 14 in that game on Sunday Ingram is in very short order earned the trust of his staff now for mention transfer from Stanford hargress thats a tough one off balance thats going back the other way great defensive job by Armond bacock I mean he moved his feet very well Nate Pickins was trying to drive the ball to the basket pickings is a guard he just couldnt get past Applause bacock just how do you put into words the value of a player like Bott returning using that extra year to come back one more season season on this roster Im not sure that you can adequately describe it in words having him changes everything what a pass What A Catch and hes going to the line for a Applause pair North Carolina with a sevenpoint advantage and one of the first year heels Harrison Ingram give him that much space hell knock it down Good Music Start Auto Owners protects your Music home first ever meeting between North Carolina and UC Riverside UCR coming from California the campus is about 60 Mi east of downtown Los Angeles their head coach now in his fourth season Mike mag paio hes the reigning big West coach of the year you do that when he guide this program to 22 wins their most in their short division one era and the story about how he became a basketball coach much a head coach a guy who runs a successful mortgage R mortgage lending company in Southern California gives it all up to become a basketball coach it was always in his DNA Hoops his love for basketball he didnt go to college to play what the UC Santa Barbara gets a degree in economics he was telling us but while he was running this multimillion dollar real estate company in Southern California he was always coaching on the side he was coaching Rec Leagues AA yo and whatnot he was always emailing coaching staffs in the area asking if there were any open positions what value can I bring to the table so yeah d the story goes after the housing crash the late 2000s he says Im going to go get my masters in real estate at at NYU and he decides let me send some emails out to some coaches in the New York area only one person got back that was Kyle Smith the head coach at Columbia and he said yeah come on down for an interview and he almost tried to talk Mike out of becoming a college basketball coach he said I dont know why youre going to do this but after some convincing Mike got a job as a director of basketball offs and 10 years later he becomes a head coach and improbable Story one that he says hey Im the luckiest man on Earth but one that he is very fortunate for and grateful for and Bop just did what Bop does so that is an offensive rebound at a Applause baset with that basket Armando B now into the top 10 and UNC program history all time in scoring is only a matter of time before he got there but salar doing some nice work some hard to his work down to the block and draws the foul and he ties the late great Walter Davis now for 10th all time and program history in scoring well obviously his name is all over the record books here in North Carolina hes just so relentless more than 1800 points he just saw more than a th000 rebounds and the stats continue to pile up he challenges that gristy three and we got another whistle underneath so on the heels of the Trimble foul Jaylen Withers Just got whistled for his personal and the interesting thing about it is you see Riverside is not going to stop shooting those threes theyre not going in there and the guy whos creating all the problems inside right now is salar they cant block him out yeah hes number 13 in the white the Junior from Georgia and not like Georgia Atlanta Georgia Tei George Jordan capital of the country chrisy one power dribble into Trimble they CAU down with another rebound Trimble on the Move Hanah Ste lays it up and in nice transition work by set turno and UC see Riverside calls the timeout North Carolina stretching its lead only halfway through the first theyre up Applause 13 Auto Owners insures your car Sunday remember to catch a womman tubs double header 25th rank Oklahoma goes to Virginia that one at two Eastern Bucknell at number 19 Louisville tips off right afterward at 4 both on the ACC Network also streaming live on the ESPN app a 9 nothing North Carolina run has the tar Hills up by 13 very quickly in this one first half first meeting between UC Riverside and UNC the Highlanders theyve only played one of ACC team in their division one era that was Boston College oh wow vicious rejection at The Rim lead feed oh oh its a first half exclamation point the block on one end and the wicked throw down on the other block on one end and outstanding pass and then the dunp ands see if Pax and loic can match it trying to lay it up with the left he goes tumbling he slipped and fell down was off balance UCR the other way Owens wants three Withers snatches it boy Seth Trimble the sophomore from Wisconsin very reliable reserve a year ago tring to take a big step forward this season Bok just too strong in the paint draws the Music whistle North Carolinas defense has been extremely aggressive its been hard for UC Riverside to get inside Withers with the block and a onehanded 34 Court bounce pass that results in a fabulous dunk salar is 67 and trible just went right up over top of him you know you saw it playing out that Split Second ahead of time Davis with a brilliant one arm bounce pass lead feed credit salar for trying to challenge him but my goodness that is one thats going to be on the SE Trimble highlight reel at the at the start I think of the Highlight Reel at the end of this season trimbles not small hes 63 and hes very athletic but hes not 6 7 and salar thought okay I might be able to get them salar had no chance really highly cter recruit and at 22 class he in Washington again the Lo and sophomores that remain in this Ro bot just took it away from Moses bot con it and the throw down this is getting out at hand really quickly UNC has just busted It Wide Music Open wow Armando bot jumps out on Moses and remember what Mike mpo told us earlier today hes used to having big guards and his starting guards now are six each six feet feet tall and theres just nothing you can do Bott just swallowed him up and itll definitely be a work in progress for these UCR guards you mentioned it Moses a junior college allam a year ago all Amer but hes got to make the leap to this division one level hargress red shirted a season ago this in essences first year on the court and theyre getting pressed early on its a 30 to nine lead thanks to a 17 nothing North Carolina run in this first half so here is the out for Rich hargress takes it in wow and puts it up and down now that was that was a short shot but it was a very tough shot he might not be the tallest hes pretty wide broad shoulders for hargress again just a red Shir freshman from Anglewood California this is Ryan on the Baseline kicks out to Davis Washington treding to track it down and he got shoved out of bounds tatter saww is going to be whistled for the push North Carolina of course with tremendous size and tattersol just not able to keep up with Washington and normally you would say okay for UC Riverside to come back in the game they have to tighten up the defense but remember last year even despite their success they had the worst shooting defense in the big West so this is not a team that is built on defense its a team thats built on threepoint shooting havent been able to make it Ryan way off from Deep hes taken a couple from Beyond the yard is not connected yet Zay and high winds up about two rows up into the stands behind the basket a recent 17 nothing run as you he has just dominated on the interior they they really have no nobody who can defend him and thats not a like a surprise very few people can defend Bott effective but there he shows you his athleticism he jumps out on the point guard and steals the ball its an impressive start hes got the 12 points yeah the North Carolina size physicality obviously going to be problematic at times for this big West foe here the updated numbers though hes now top 10 in program history in scoring only needed was seven tonight to pass the late Walter Davis and then more than 1300 rebounds as well the work the abilities the talent thats been on display for so many years now this his fifth final season in Chaple Hill utilizing that additional year of Eligibility theres a triple knocked out to the corner by Will tattersol and UC Riverside needed it North Carolina went on a 17 nothing run a few moments ago UCR answering with a couple of baskets just Jaylen Washington Fresh Off hitting his first career three tries a little more suitable turnaround Jay could get that one to go North Carolina has done a nice job getting back on defense as well very few easy opportunities in transition for UC Riverside so far a team thatll likely be very competitive in its League the big West they lost a whole bunch of their top players year ago matter of fact theyre top three scores so while they bring back nine still have a lot of key roles that they need to replace and fill and determine who are going to be those players to step into those roles this season Washington on the Baseline his first career three couple of minutes ago now he gets a two Sparks the confidence a bit the sophomore from Gary Indiana hes got five of the early minutes this ones going back to North Carolina giv it away on the Baseline that time now Moses really trying to force it right there North Carolina hasnt turned it over theyve had seven different guys score theyve been able to get out in transition and Hubert Davis has used the word Poise very often in the early goings of the season to describe his team theyve taken care of business against Radford and Lehigh a couple times in that Sunday win against Lehigh their opponent that night pushed them Clos the Gap Clos the deficit a bit uh only to watch North Carolina really fly by and blow him out Washington gets hacked in the paint jayon Martinez whistled for his second and so it it seems at least in the early goings as if North Carolina has a not just experienced and Veteran team theyre pretty poised and connected on the floor Washington pretty easy to be poison connected when youre playing like this yeah Washington now six of seven at the line this year tomorrow week 12 action were coming down the home stretch right here in the ACC Network things get get things get started with Louisville at Miami at noon NC State is in blackburg to take on Virginia Tech and in The Prime Time Battle of the weekend features Syracuse Georgia Tech in Atlanta you catch it anywhere on the ESPN app theres the Freshman Elliot CAD Hammer pass Ingram Offline that Music time so were com coming up on the 5minute mark in the first half North Carolina built a double digit lead very quickly as a 16point Advantage aiming to get to three and0 to start this season before things get a little tougher next week shot clock draining gristy sets the feet Ingram Rises High good glimpse of his physicality and athleticism at The Rim right there Ingram to Kido shot fake Drive got it and the foul thats really impressive by kadoo now kadoo hes the guy who can shoot the three hadnt made any this year yet but you dont want to go for that pump fake out at the threepoint line making sure it show you he can shoot it from out there but Pickins bought the pump fake and then kadoo is just too quick once you buy that pump fake youre not getting back to him the expectations are very high for this freshman from West Orange Five Star highly regranted Prospect so the media says hes the ACC preseason Rookie of the Year coming in with perhaps the most hype but he steps into a situation where he doesnt have to do everything you know you got RJ Davis there you got cormack Ryan you got Paxton woic you set Trimble youve got some guys who have some experience you dont need to carry the burden yourself miss that depth shining once again Riverside 26 shooting from the floor theyre four of 11 from Deep looking for something to go right instead a turnover three on two Davis unselfish gets it to Ingram couldnt convert with the right hand and salar Reed secures the Music ball argis one of the new Highlanders he was with this team a year ago but red shirted so first year on the floor running the offense this is really tough for grisy cuz hes trying to shoot over Bott Bo when botts l in there Washington and thats tough to do there a a handful of Highlanders sworn Bott that time he lost the hand on the way up literally they had everybody around wasnt quite the double team triple team appear gisy this time he connects well that time he had a little bit more time Bott went to help out and grisy was ready to shoot that one final minutes of the first Rivers side has hit five threes theres Davis step back triple he tumbles angram saves it and flings it to Canó so a new 20 botts open and mismatch there shorter Defender bacot draws the foul with 302 to go in the first as Feast week gets going North Carolina has the lead here in the first we go to the park and then we come back and its still Disney themed it never stop fine start for North Carolina in this first half facing a team that where they are beating up in the paint one point D they went on a 26 to5 run over the stretch of about a a 9minute span and they have the 15point lead over visiting UC Riverside Armando bacon Leading The Way with 12 points they just smothered UC Riverside and this is a situation you see Riverside a little bit undersized North Carolina more talented at each position bigger at each position this was a game where UC Riverside was going to have to make threes and they started very slowly theyve made some Music recently but theyre theyre now five from 13 from Beyond The Arc and they they need to make 15 threes today to even have a chance right A Team thatll definitely be competitive in its league is just overmatched when it comes to the physicality of the game right now in this first half theres Mike paio the head man well and keep in mind that Mike mag paio he understands what his team is going through but hes trying to use the nonconference portion of his schedule to build toward conference player and one of the biggest stories of the season so far Armando bot is now 17 for 18 from the free throw line thats his first Miss tonight hes now five out of six but hes a career 66 free throw shoo and Im telling you as much as he goes to the line if he can make free throws at that kind of a clip hes going to score a lot of points this year yeah hes acquitted himself quite nicely in the first two and a half games of the Season went for 22 and 20 in Sundays win against Lehigh its a nice over the shoulder pass to grisy cutting on the Baseline and 23 and 15 in the opener against Radford and Dannys going right back to the line putting himself in position either draw contact get to the line or score it right underneath the basket and thats probably the biggest feature of bots game he knows how to get in position whether its posting somebody up down low or just running to the open spot or following the dribbler to the basket Bott is a guy who knows how to get position inside 134th career game now for bot the ultimate veteran start at all but one of them in his four plus years in Chapel Hill we showed you that lineup tomorrow the ACC Network on the grid iron remember the ACC huddle crew are going to get things started at 1100 am they will kick off the day in Atlanta at Bobby DOD Stadium Kelsey Eric Eddie EJ and coach get you set for all the action theyre back again at 630 and then to wrap things up at 11 Eastern live from Atlanta also on the app coming up on a final 2 minutes of the first half North Carolina has led by double digits for the majority of this one oh theres a stuff Withers talk about smothered right there to reject the Martinez shot stays with it though and shows the first resiliency underneath and thats part of this been part of the problem for the Highlanders is everything has been contested not many clean looks at all 32 shooting from the field the way you shoot a high percentage is you shoot easy shots and just there havent been any for UC Riverside tonight salar whistled for the Applause offensive so cant be a high percentage look when the there is a no percentage look of driving the ball to B and again Paxon woic is his primary Defender he moves his feet he gets position and when every time that arm goes flying out there thats an automatic thats the second time woic has drawn the offensive foul thats the first North Carolina turnover of the game salar is this one lined up in the corner Martinez got his hands on it and trible secures the board so now numbers for North Carolina Tribble eyes up bounce pass down to wh oh spins his man around cant finish aress picks it up and slows things down to the minute to go in the first that was some quickness right there RS is going to be kicking himself that he missed that one I think hes going to be a great addition to this North Carolina team he is so talented in athletic really Dynamic player former starter in Louisville spending his Fifth and final season here at North Carolina arges goes up with the right hand and showing his confidence around the rim thats seven points for him now and they have all been hes made a three but his two field goals has have been in traffic and again hes 6 feet tall hes a broad shouldered 6 feet tall but he doesnt mind getting in there mixing it up heward Davis uses his time out with just 22 seconds to go in the first well step aside of Chapel Hill theyre up 30 to n of one point but they missed their last six shots and so UC Riverside has shrunk the deficit a bit 11point game 223 to go we talked about the fact that this is a UC Riverside team thats used to success and theyre UC Riverside team with they had nine guys who played last year who are back theyre not going to roll over and you know theyve theyve been able to make some shots and North Carolina has missed some shots and thats how you get back in the game a second second and a half differential between shot and game clock Davis shadowed by hardress last possession youd think for the tar Hills on this side Davis on the attack misses it off the left side up ahead to salar Reed the heave as the clock expires thats all and its an 11point lead for North Carolina and very numbers oriented hes got this program going in the right trajectory although this season had a couple of early tests lost at Utah this is their second game against a power five opponent North Carolina up double digits for the majority of this one now theyre coming out with a trap Pax and loic left them wide open thats offline Ingram on the floor squeezes it a no look to wen bounced it to him and he earns a couple of free throws wji is a guy who can shoot that shot and I thought he hurried a little bit when he didnt have to but he did a really nice job following it up and this is just a great play by Ingram getting down there getting the ball and from his backside how did he see wji but he did it was a no the sit the sitting down no look pass from Harrison Ingram and so woic at the free throw line one of those transfers we talked about he grew up in Charleston spent most of his childhood there I should say spent the last couple years at Brown started at lyola Chicago he is an experienced veteran that knows his role knows who he is in this rotation it appears early on hes not here to be the leading scorer the leading rebounder the leading assist guy hes here to guard hes here to facilitate hes here to make open shots and he can score he averaged about 15 a game last year was an all ivy league performer at Brown now wearing the tar heel blue so where does UCR go to generate a little more of the offense gristy hit a few threes we see big man wearing the number one white wearing the white jersey number one he just got fouled there oh s that b right tied up yeah he got the ball inside too much dribbling he brought it all the way down and Ingram was able to tie him up gry you can just look at him hes not a a great big muscle guy hes the guy who wants to stand out there and shoot threes Ryan and looking to knock down his first three from Deep hes missed a couple now and he doesnt really look comfortable shooting the three tonight and hes generally a guy who shoots the three very well yeah hes 0 of four from Beyond the yard Moses missed fires from Deep Ryans got it here the ball here comes the double that ones knocked away tannera got a piece of it grisy retrieves it for UCR so the Highlanders come back this way that whole thing started Bott is wide open inside they didnt get it to him early and then by the time they did get it to him he was surrounded Aris cross over attacks blocked Ryan knocks that one out of bounds Ryan is really a good Defender he moves his feet very well and remember what we said with hargress he is 6 feet tall and Ryan just stays right with him and corn ma Ryan at 65 Ryans an ACC vener and he spent the last three years at Notre Dame hes got hes checked off a lot of boxes if you will he started at Stanford three years at Notre Dame finishes at North Carolina academically nice Trio of schools Ryan has played at first foul on the sixth year senior from Music Manhattan same starting five out there for North Carolina see bot switched out on Moses and Moses really has to do a better job taking advantage when the big guys trying to guard him out beyond the top of the key instead leads to a possession this this side for North Carolina it has missed its last nine field goals on this side of the floor stretching back to the first half was a kick and so shot clock will reset to 20 for UNC theres not a lot of ball and player Movement by the tar Hills at the Music moment meile Christie takes a gristy pardon me takes a seat gristy and Martinez appear to be the guys who are going to share that Five Spot sometimes in their previous games you see Riverside has gone small and Owens has played that five spot but thats little too dangerous tonight with the size of the tar here only 8 minutes for Owens foul on the floor and thats another one that Bott draws Martinez got impatient and fouled Bott because Owens was coming over for a double team and thats the strategy that weve seen you see Riverside apply here when bot gets the ball they attack him and Owens just and Martinez just got a little bit impatient there or did they call the foul on Owens okay called the foul no well youre right though they have sworn every chance they get Davis off balance jumper on the Baseline got it and the foul hes got one more coming one of the advantages that thear heels have is they have guys who can make individual plays this is just a catch and shoot play and harder sticks his arm in there and RJ Davis can be instant offense in a blink of an eye one for 22 against Lehigh only hit one basket in the first first half and completes a threepoint play poised leader now of this North Carolina team in his senior season well he had some big games going back to that national title game run a year and a half ago theres no question about his ability salar is fires comes sco crit UCR for just hanging around as long as they can Ingram very easy attack slip past his man and laid it in of course now the Highlanders havent scored here in the second half got a timeout so thats a timeout North Carolina 70 run to start the Applause second not that into saving are you who is wearing their Carolina blue uniforms normally what they wear on the road at home the last time this happened a decade ago against UNCC Wilmington it was part of the app named Blue Years Eve evening so of course the what with the Carolina blue that now you saw Marcus paage in one of those photos so he was not only wearing the uniform the last time Carolina wore these at home but now hes back on the bench first year in an assistant role hes on the support staff of hbert Daviss staff so man The Story Goes UC Riverside they get new uniforms this year only the home uniforms have showed up theyre still waiting on the road Blues so they very gently reached out to North Carolina and ask do you mind if we wear our home White North Carolina graciously obliged and so here we go for the first time in a decade the Carolina blue is being worn inside this building at home for a of course in 2020 they had a 100year throwback thing Su so they wore blue uniforms but they werent the traditional uniform the time before that it was in 1990 in the get this the Big East ACC challenge with insurance from Auto Owners you can relax knowing we got you covered thats simple human Music sense 18 early in the second half Elliot kadoo the fivestar freshman at the line in a moment twoman class but not about quantity it was about quality with these two kdo and Zaden High form the 23 freshman class and you know both come in with a lot of upside Elliot kdo earning quite a bit of minutes in the early goings of this season a a pass first rhythmic sort of guard likes to pass doesnt necessarily need to take a whole bunch of shots has seemingly fitted nicely in these first few games in rotation remember our next all access the ACC life Premiere Sunday highlighted by the Notre Dame womens soccer program NC State men soccer and Louisville Field Hockey youre going to get unprecedented access the lives these players coaches administrators Etc thats on acc Network UNC forces that turnover kadoo is right there thats up 12 Music Applause turnovers Mike m Applause not not really happy with that no not quite pleased 12 to3 is the turn turnover differential Min 9 for the visiting Highlanders and Mike Mago didnt come in here expecting this to be easy you know what what happened was UC Riverside had such a great year last year that they couldnt find people to play him and so he told his Ops director he said look just sent an email out to everybody and uh whoever play us at such and such an amount of money the first PE person that first school that responds will play and so the Ops guy came in a week later and said we found somebody he said who and he he said North Carolina he said the North Carolina North Carolina in Chapel Hill so theyre very excited so so mag paio back at a state where he coached as an assistant he was down the road of Campbell for a few years late shot clock attempt there was offline Ingram finds B cot that pass though hit him in the knees pinballs to Davis well it didnt hit him in the KNE it hit him in the ankles you cant throw back Bott the ball there now Music what I think they got gristy tangling up with Bott on the inside Bott yeah thats the foul on Christie Bott has now been fouled seven times he just draws so much attention but the interesting thing today is North Carolina has actually struggled playing off that attention a lot of times the tardos can really take advantage of all the attention being devoted to bot they can get Other Guys open but they have struggled at times with that this evening so it was an 11point UNC lead at the break its nearly doubled the Highlanders havt scored yet its nine zip North Carolina after halftime kdo had it poked for free Moses good slight of hand up ahead to Luke Turner we havent seen too much of Turner tonight and he missfires from Deep couldnt hit the corner three and thats the kind of shot that the Highlanders are going to have to make to have success this year open three in transition and now when you miss a three like that that allows your opponent to get out and go and very easy opportunity for Ingram Hubert Davis loves the versatility and just the dynamic abilities of Ingram one quick quick dribble you saw how close range he got that look from the paint now has nine points four of eight from the field oo Martin the big man now missed everything though Davis coming back the other way its an 11 nothing UNC run to start the second half Davis wants this one lines it up and knocks it down its the largest lead of the game by far from North Carolina 14 nothing run to start the second Applause half hes got a double team down on Ingram and when Moses leaves I mean if you leave RJ Davis that wide open yeah you want to get down on Ingram and double team but somebodys got to rotate over you cant just leave Davis alone so hes three of 10 from thats his first Triple Three of 10 from the field I should say he keeps shooting and eventually hes going to make you pay he does so there coming off to 22point Performance against Lehi you know its actually fairly interesting the tar Hills overall theyre only shooting about 42 so they have and particularly from threepoint range they have not shot the ball well and this is a team that has guys who are good threepoint Shooters Ingram can shoot the three cormack Ryan can shoot to three wji can shoot the three Davis can obviously shoot the three kdo has made a three tonight although hes that was his first one of the season and of his career wrong uniform tonight thats going to check the the shooting percentages 10 years ago against Applause UNC a lot of capable to your point though Shooters veterans in this Music rotation and thats why it just feels like while last years team certainly didnt quite reach its potential it still feels like a very nicely constructed roster you know I dont know that not reaching their potential is the right phrase they certainly didnt meet expectations but the expectations were ridiculous very high when youre the preseason number one sure Moses from Deep couldnt hit the step back and Dan they still win 20 games end up going 11 and9 in the ACC however missed the NCAA tournament and what was maybe missing last year was just that signature win or or several of those on the resume a season ago well it was tough uh the Atlantic Coast Conference based on the the metric the net metric it was hard to play in the ACC and get a quad one win theyre very sh teams that had a net good enough to produce a quad one win in fact last year in the conference its easier to win a game at home than on the road yeah and the only team you could play at home last year and get a quad one win under that net system was Music Duke so North Carolina they didnt play up to expectations but you know it was it was hard the conference according to the net had a down year but again the conference produced another final four team so so thats why this is a point you brought up this week its its very important to see how a conference fares this time of year in the nonconference in those Premier out of conference battles league has fared pretty well so so far Washington oh now hes got two triples two triples in his career and Washington is a guy who comes in hes not a back to the basket five guy in the same M as B hes a guy that wants to face and shoot hes going to get more opportunities if he shoots it like that its still a shut out the second half from up 11 to now up 28 Christie trying to turn on Trimble that one was too strong and then a foul on the floor thatll keep things here we talked about Washington you know hes not a guy whos going to set up inside and but hes just wide open from three and Christie you know reluctant to get out you know the report on him he hadnt made a three in his career hes made two tonight is wondering what the heck yeah those nine points second only the Bott among UNCC scores triple was to trying to tie up bristy fights away from the double te on a couple of the pesky guards right up in him mes behind the back throws another whistle so that takes us to a timeout but consecutive fouls heres the Highlanders possession on the other side facing a big hole with insurance from Auto Owners some significant games that the ACC has been in this week if you will the signature one Duke over Michigan State earlier this week couple of wins tonight ACC over other power Conference teams so D lets lets crunch the numbers if you will this season the accs out of conference win percentages 81 theres the record 38 and9 and you know compared to the last couple of Seasons much better absolutely and and thats key because the NCA evaluation tool the net the way they figure things out theyre trying to make all these games important theyve actually done a pretty good job of that but you know I think maybe theyve gone overboard a little bit but if you dont if your conference doesnt play well in the nonconference portion of the schedule then the teams you when you go into conference play youre going to have a bunch of teams with low net ranking yes and therefore its going to be hard for you to recover oh my gosh Withers Just erases that one thats the second time that he has a vicious Block its been tough to get it in there but last year for example the Big 12 which only had 10 teams last year they started conference call based on their nonconference team performance with no Conference Team having a net higher than 60 and so what that means is youre playing a lot of quad One games within the conference the ACC didnt have that here hargress drives to the basket and finds Withers and again Withers at 69 very he missed some time with a concussion but I think hes going to be a very valuable player for this Tar Hill team yeah slowly building and increasing the minutes over the course of these first three games three blocks Moses off balance Runner no chance there Ryan down on the board but Dan your point is is a really really important one Withers now in the basket hes got two free throws coming because the better the conference does leading up to conference play you were starting to say it just more opportunities for League wins to be valuable as opposed to you you said it before what last year Duke was only the only opportunity for a quad one win well its a quad one win at home obviously its easier to win a game at home than on the road but the ACC had a lot of teams with fairly bad net rankings last year and once you get into conference play you saw it many times the team would play heres what were talking about this is a quad one game and these are the gold for the NCA at large selection PR process if you play a team at home and that your opponent is 1 through 30 and you win thats a quad one win on a neutral quarter 1 through 50 if you play a team on the road of course its harder to win on the road and its 1 through 75 so there were some opportunities for quads on the road in the ACC last year but just not as many as the confence needed to have North Carolina forces a steal on the back court although Come Away with nothing there salar picks up the blose basketball after Kau lost it there were times last year when an ACC team that was fighting for an at large bid would play a team in the lower part of the standings and they theyd win the game and their net would actually go down right would negatively impact that number salar winds up wide open underneath and so there you go UC Riverside with its first basket after halftime it took 9 and 12 minutes wow but a couple of important wins for the conference tonight Miami beats Georgia down in the Bahamas of turn gam in the Bahamas these days well why wouldnt you want to play in the B exactly theyll play in the championship of of that tournament in two days Notre Dame beat Oklahoma State in overtime earlier this evening as Nate Pickins way off on the three pble to track it down Trimble steps into the midrange salar secures the rebound and fully on display a few days ago the bounceback win by Duke over Michigan State on Tuesday in Chicago undoubtedly the signature win for any team of the conference just yet but those opportunities are coming especially for a team like North Carolina as it heads to the Bahamas next week to faced its first big exams of the year its going to open up against Northern Iowa but then it would face the winner of either Villanova or Texas Tech other teams in that tournament field B next week Arkansas Michigan Memphis Stanford as well possibility for some good tests right there yeah no doubt about it well and in the tournament setting as well when they are down in the Bahamas for the battle for Atlantis tournament itll played three games in three days patter saws three is offline and that threepoint number starts to look a bit more dubious for UC Riverside at five of 22 from Deep Brian couldnt convert at The Rim this is hardress the red Shir freshman tarhill switching everything on defense and that has really presented problems for the Highlanders you know speaking of the Highlanders North Carolina has this is their third game and this is the second time theyve played the Highlanders theres only two D1 schools who are known as that Highlanders and the Radford Highlanders and Mike Mike pios Highlanders now why is UC Riverside the Highlanders well right at the campus or the box spring mountains which are also known as the highlands thats right and UC Riverside in addition to that they camp has the highest elevation of every any campus in the University of California system thats quite a distinction and so I dont think theres a lot of Scotsman out there maybe there is maybe thats why youre so three games in twice would see his spaced Highlanders one from Radford other of course from Southern California hope everybody on the west coast enjoying tonights presentation we are uh starting the ACC Network California Market penetration a year early tonight good ball movement on this side of the floor Ingram with the three that ones Off the Mark and the foul is going to keep things here and weve seen a lot of fouls like this called against UC Riverside trying to battle that North Carolina size and its just very difficult that time I think it was Moses that got wrapped up or was it uh is harrus who got wrapped up with Jaden Music High thats the first foul on harus and thats the s7th foul for UC Music Riverside I think UC Riverside a player on the UCR side was just assess a Applause technical well maybe not yeah cuz it looks like Zaden high is going to head to the free throw line for the one and one theres another five and theyre starting to pile up now so that is eight fouls get nine team fouls on UC R Ingram just too quick to the ball Martinez couldnt get a block Music Applause out its Caleb Smith number two in white just in the game played a couple minutes in the first half so youc now 15 for 20 at the line tonight so there was a double technical that was the call so two offenders yeah high and Le cancels out so just move on like offsetting penalties in the football thats it and so you send UNC to the line they missed the free throw got it back and now were going to have a one andone on this end of the floor now unlike offsetting penalties in football the technical foul counts as a toward the personal foul total for both of those players it was Zaden High and salar who were called for the technicals thats the second foul on Ingram and this is the afor mentioned Caleb Smith a lot of recent trips to the line and neither team has cashed in on many of them Ingram trying to back down the young freshman Ingram using the size turns cant hit it bounces back out to Trimble Bott squares and hits he he doesnt shoot three but know he showed you he can shoot from the free throw line in that 12 to 15t range you give him that much time hes going to be able to convert that hes now got 16 points 16 for bot to lead the way leading all scores and UCR needs another minute timeout in Chapel Hill this is the all electric pollar 2 back in 2019 also Stanford Arkansas Texas Tech UNC against Northern Iowa now one of the problems you saw that picture of Michigan that was Hunter Dickinson hes not there anymore hes in Kansas Applause Music so thats a good field and toos have played a lot of guys tonight and thats what they would like to do throughout the season yeah North Carolina has quite a bit of depth and thats going to help of course in a threeday tournament coaches is though they love playing in tournaments like that it stimulates having to prepare for teams like in the NCAA tournament on such short notice if you will Michigan with a signature win earlier this year against St Johns Villanova is going to have to rebound from that upset against Penn just a few days ago and turnover is going to give it back to UCR North Carolina has outscored the visiting Highlanders 246 Memphis meanwhile with a win over missou on the road at Missouri its signature win thus Music far and some big big names and some excellent teams on display next week in the Bahamas that three is down for hardress though appears like he could very well will be most prolific scorer for this UCR team this season he averaging 12 a game hes in double figures now theres the steel and the flush Nate pickets its backto back baskets for the Highlanders lot like in the first half the tar Hills little sloppy on the offensive Applause end and so its actually an 8 nothing Highlanders run right after North Carolina built its largest lead of the e Z High takes the follow SL gets his crowd back up everybody is surrounding Bott when the ball got kicked back out they didnt have time to get back to their own men nice job by high just go right to the basket sa High hes an ESPN 100 recruit in his past 23 class it seems like hes got quite a bit of upside in potential hardress high off the glass couldnt get it to go offensive rebound down of the Highlanders or got his hand on that one Bott secures the loose ball really well done defensively by Bott you even though the guard got by him the guard didnt really have any room uhoh oh B for three just a second of his Applause career thats 19 for Bott thats why you come back for one more season he realized I only had one from Deep now hes got two foul the entry pass pattera draws the whistle when were talking about Zaden high and bacock kicks the ball out then bops trying to get to the basket draws a lot of attention nobody pays any attention to Zaden high and he just runs was running into your pitchure nobody blocks him out give a guy that size a clean run at the basket youre asking for trouble from right outside of Dallas Rockwell Texas is where hes from had a good high school career outside of the Metroplex spent last year at Arizona Compass where he lost to the goo Nationals Finals to Elliot kadoo Elliot Kad part in link Academy Squad so those two faced off last April in the Geico Nationals now here they are both the same roster they stop quick move to the bucket well if hes going to catch the ball there theres just nothing you can do no chance thats the lead balloons back to 30 second biggest lead of the night for North Carolina a game that it has had control over since the opening minutes they built the double digit lead very quickly and they have maintained a double digit advantage since about six seven minutes in aress show his confidence he cant get by B yep had to kick back out to grisy and grisy is taking a number of shots from Beyond The Arc hes three of six from Deep make it three of seven after the latest miss another reloads no cant get it to go that time well the first one was okay I dont know about the second one you dont want to get carried away sometimes those are a little more tempting in a 30point game yes and theres a Block B got timed that one up nicely and S the picking layup into the first row behind the basket so bov thats couple of block shots hes not going to get his double double tonight M takes a seat with 21 points seven rebounds and yeah that unit that just took a seat woic Davis Ingram bot again a couple of Veteran All Conference returners couple of just very impactful transfers again trying to blend together in the early portion of the Applause schedule one to shoot not sure if picking w recognizes it finally does lets a go shot clock violation and so we step aside One Last Time 358 to go with North Carolina leading by 30 Danny only had one of these until tonight Armondo Bott let it fly from Deep why not UNC up Music 30 AR Bott proved to be too much again to tonight different opponent different day same story thats another 20point game for Bott so 20 plus at all three 217 tonight against UC Music Riverside we update the numbers pretty impressive resume yeah approaching 100 points nearly 1400 rebounds again thats most in program history passed Tyler hansboro last season the 70th double double on Sunday hes going to fall short of number 71 but he you his size and his IQ and positioning around the basket proved to be too much tonight but his strength and his Mobility are really problems for just about anybody that play interestingly enough cor M Ryan has had a tough game only one for six has a couple of Applause assists at 13 against Lehigh on Sunday but yeah tonight just couldnt find anything and couldnt find a stroke from d 0 of four from Beyond the AR nice pass inside and Riverside the latest bucket goes to Ben gisy Junior from Adela Australia he got a pretty decent shot Arsenal this is hardress from three Withers tried to save it could not well you run a risk when you sit right down there on the Baseline somebody got a high five out of Applause it Withers of the first year transfers there are many of them in the rotation Ryan Music woic Withers as well along with Harrison Music Ingram so Ryan stays out on the floor Washington and Trimble have come in and the final minutes of this one and its a game in which North Carolina like went up double digits very quickly at one point built a 22point Advantage around the Midway Mark of the first half UCR got it back to 11 at halftime only to watch North Carolina go on a 17 nothing run to begin the second half and so UNC has had a large lead for the majority of this second half and this is a Riverside program that they they lost a whole bunch of scoring from that 22 win team from a year ago so integrating a lot of fresh faces into its rotation as well this year but you would expect that this is a team is very well going to compete once again for a big West Title now Mike m told us that in the last three years he had the same guard Tamp yep and so with veteran guards that really helps you and he does not have veteran guards right now and thats in this nonconference portion of the schedule the guards that he has are going to develop and Im telling you they expect to compete in the big way they aint gotten a reputation in recent years of knocking off some power Conference teams remember they beat Arizona State at the horn half court buzzer beater sunk the Sun Devils a couple of years ago Mike magpayo he does reference one signature out of conference win his first season as head coach he was hired was shortly after the pandemic set in it was that pandemic affected season the 20 to 21 year and they beat Washington right out of the gate a game in which he said was something that just totally invigorated not just the fan base it was something the university could rally around as well and since then he has helped change the trajectory of this basketball program which really hasnt had too many winning seasons oh nice feed theres the young point guard Isaiah Moses sophomore from Anchorage Alaska Trimble right around his mans it up and in North Carolina theyve been very effective on the defensive end theyve been very effective in transition at times they got a little bit sloppy on the offensive end not with turnovers just not getting very good shots but for the most part theyve played very well this season that three is down knee oh laade buries the triple its a junior from California just scored his first career point so what a place to do it inside Dean Smith Center L than a minute to go North Carolina is going to prove to three and0 again before its Trimble from Deep so Seth Trimble with 11 on five of seven shooting B can interfer and score the Applause goal do moic sit down in comes kraton Lebo and James a Conor transfer from West Virginia this of Dewey Ferris Leo high off the glass A cono triying to tip it back in and Riverside back the other way so awaiting North Carolina in the Bahamas a whole bunch of difficult opponents heres zanen High picks the pocket of Moses only to lose it at the rib Hardis into the corner ol with two threes but North Carolina improves to 3 and0 tonight 7752 the final and Hubert Daviss team 3 and0 heading to the Bahamas next week well the level of competition
