underway Tell you one thing Dave I didnt know this I was telling Jay before the game Sean Miller has produced the second most NBA players of active coaches Number one is Caliparia but hes got 27 guys that went to the NBA Its modern coaching He accepted the job to come to Texas on a Zoom call 5 days after he beat Texas he got a job there Texas with the first possession Swain kicks it up top and he get away and stolen away by the Duke Blue Devils trying to get to the other end quickly in transition Nick Cody the sophomore for Texas starting out on Cameron Boozer and Boozer plays out at the top Theyll screen him into the post where hes going to be a really difficult challenge Isaiah Evans lifting the first long distance shot tonight and off target He led Duke in threepoint accuracy a year ago Hes going to be a key man for John Sh all season long Jay talked about the big guards He talked about the fact when you look at Mark and look at Pope veterans 24 and 22 years of age and theyre going to have to for them to have a chance here tonight I really believe Jay they got to really excel on that perimeter No question Gunbo will pick up the first foul as you get a look at John Sher number four A new look Blue Devils team Theyve already passed one very stiff test with flying colors an exhibition game but it was against number 18 Tennessee on the road in front of 22000 Well that game usually went for 24 and 23 That was a night like Jay had when he played back in the 80s high Mark will lift and take the hit as he hits the shot from the 65 graduate 24 years old in his sixth year of college basketball Well Mark played for Eric Muscleman he played for Kelvin Samson so hes been around the block I mean he has got a lot of experience J Hes a lefty that had played the point guard position toward the end of last year for Texas Good handler and really good in the midrange as he just proved by making that bucket and gets fouled Hes got size length and hes also an excellent defender Also has 1500 career points on his resume Boozer up top but you really have to have active hands on Cameron Boozer because he can just whistle it over the top of you Excellent passer on the move Little bump to the left tip No the tip that wont drop in Hes right there Ill tell you what he attacks off the bounce and then he attacks the rim really quickly to go to the offensive glass Yeah hes really good Dick with that second jump And he gets a lot of his own misses He doesnt miss very often What he does he gets it often times Now Duke with six players returning from a Final Four team to combine with the nations number one recruiting class led by this man Loser inside the paint over the top The tip wont go Tried to get Gungba down low at 611 and Whistle with five on the shot clock You know Gungba is a guy that got better and better as the season progressed last year Jay hes got excellent feet very skilled and a very good rebounder Another guy that can really pass it especially out top Go So again five on the shot clock here for Duke and Caleb Foster 65 junior Expectations high for him to bounce back Boozer cant connect So far Texas has done a good job early with their guards getting down to rebound Kendall Weaver and then Mark grabbing the defensive boards The guards really have to help the big guys on the glass 63 senior another returning guard for Texas Shot clock down to 10 here for the Longhorns Mark went up against a big man and a traveling violation as he went body to body up against Boozer They actually got four good guards coming off the bench We havent seen him yet Played for St Johns and Rick Patino whos by the way got a great team this year But Simeon Wiltshire a very experienced player Yeah Simeon Wiltshire started 25 games last year for a team that won over 30 games in St Johns and won the Big East finding the open shooter Gun but cant hit it 611 sophomore off the mark and Duke with a chilly start here in Charlotte tonight They are 0 for five The drive will be tipped up and a miss there by Cody right on top of the iron Poke Titus underneath Its tipped away from him on a run Sar will lay it up and draw the foul Maybe they like Sar He told me before the game Jay he said John told me that uh hes very versatile to Allen Hes skilled offensively but what a defensive potential Well re really athletic and a really high IQ Played really well in the Nike Hoop Summit He had 17 points in that game But hes experienced Hes played professional basketball Hes from Italy but played in the ACB league in Spain for FC Barcelona Played about 15 games with their top team Tell you one thing if you can play theyre going to find you I dont care where you are today man Theyre going to find you if you can play Especially Duke Duke has had unbelievable success recruiting over the years and its continued with John Shung to the bench and Mesar the freshman played 17 minutes against Tennessee So got a good long look out of for the Duke Blue Devils from Shy getting them into that laughter game for a nice stretch Mark gives it up Heres Weaver Okatitus on the dribble where you really have to protect the ball against Malik Brown Gets a lot of deflections 7footer Nice move in close That is going to go the other way though Got him with a hook cheering So no basket And Boat Titus a sevenfooter from Lithuania with the foul just use that off arm to sort of knock Malik Brown away applause He played at Florida Atlantic did he not He did He was freshman of the year in the American Athletic Conference They like him He got strong hands Really a competitor and loves basketball Sean was telling him Yeah hes got good feet Foster will penetrate Nice pass underneath and a sweet kick for Sar Hell shift that in from the corner with the triple What a great pass from Malik Brown It was a tough catch but the fine Sar in the corner That was a big time pass Yeah it really was Good offensive efficiency right there Sar knocks it down Duke these big guys are the best passers Nick Yeah Sh wanted a foul there And there will be one now against Duke on the reach by Malik Brown who picks up his first I watch the pass that Jay was talking about right there What a great pass Open look the corner Jay usually has a high percentage shot Boy guys can shoot the ball today But just great recognition that Dalen Swain had come in from the corner and you really cant leave a corner shooter I know that Swain wanted to help out thought he could get a steal but that leads to a wide open three for an outstanding passer like Brown Sean Miller really high on Swain You met him at Xavier He said hes really multidimensional Well nice touch from downtown by Dalon Swain 6A Jr the transfer came from Xavier with Shawn Miller So he knows him very well Really good defender too And thats a if he can knock that shot down He only shot about 25 26 last year from three A little too strong And Treyori with the rebound Hes another big at 69 for Shawn Miller Well one thing you know Sean Millers club rush year was like fourth in the nation shooting the three Right now hes trying to find some threepoint shooters in this club Jordan P lift and a twopointer wont drop Rebound batted around and it comes back to the Longhorns in his second effort in heavy traffic That wont fall for Mark and a big battle for the rebound Still scrapping for it comes out high and pucked away by Sar going up against Pope and a blocking foul here against Texas with 1514 to go here in the first half and Texas off to a decent start They have taken a 53 lead on a night we celebrate an icon City of Charlotte and all of college basketball does It is Dicky Vs night And theres been no more beloved figure in basketball nor in in our job uh that that you can think of Hes hes one of one and one of the one of the alltime greats and one of the alltime great people The voice of college ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Belulk in the game since 1888 and by Subaru love Its what makes Subaru Subaru Dicky B over the years all the way back to 1979 Well before that when he was coaching you liked a kid that you you werent a very good basketball coach You were a terrific basketball coach And you know I know more than anything your gala and the money you raised for pediatric music cancer That means more to you than anything else you have ever done Coaching broadcasting tickets available right now The event will be held on May 1st All music proceeds benefiting cancer research For more information go to vorg dick vitalgala music Well Ill tell you one thing I showed a car raffle A lot of you guys would look great in that car BMW will raffle it off and 100 a chance And all you got to do to go get a chance you better hurry up Were going to sell out vorgvital raffle And youre right Dave I told you before the game one of the reasons Im doing TV is to keep alive in terms of helping me raise money because Im obsessed with doing it to help kids battling that disease No child should have to go through what I went through Sar trying to make a move on the baseline Hell draw the foul and that will go against Mark the 65 grad picks up his first but Texas did a really nice job on that out of bounds underneath of switching all of the screens and exchanges that Duke threw at him Im impressed the way they defend and Im not shocked because Sean Miller is a great tactician and hes really a very motivating kind of player and he really concentrates on the defensive end and they play so aggressive They play hard and they play team defense and very well organized Duke moving the ball exceptionally well but the shots really not dropping here early on where the guard rebounding for Texas has been a big factor Both teams are struggling to shoot it I think theyre three of 16 combined but the Texas guards have really dropped down to help the big guys Troy had poked away Look at the Harris cheering and its going to stay on this set 1435 to go Thats great hustle right there Thats how you earn some play time K like Harris didnt play a whole lot last year but hes they really like some of the versatility he brings to the game to shoot the three And theyre going to love that Jay Theyre going to love that Thats a football play I mean are you kidding Its the difference between diving and bending at the waist So far Duke one of eight from the floor but not lacking for hustle plays as the Blue Devils take over possession Boozer directing traffic Being guarded by Cam Heidi transferred in from Purdue Hes an excellent athlete Shoot the ball too He gives him a shooter Went to the bank came up empty Theyve got to bring containing moves early in the game I mean its certainly early Wilshire fires and thats in and out You guys were talking about Simeon Wiltshire out of Planefield New Jersey playing for Rick Patino last year trying to fit in in Texas and Ja just lost it 68 FRESHMAN GAVE IT UP Heres Pope a determined drive and defended by the Blue Devils They have turned it over six times now in transition again and in and outs Amena the freshman cant hit Brown will kick it out high and Boozer with a backourt violation Youre really high on Jame Tell us a little bit about him Jay Well hes from Los Angeles A really good connector out on the floor Hes a former point guard Really competitive really good basketball IQ but his versatility his toughness and John Shy will tell you hes a winner Won state championships in high school as did Cameron and Kaden Boozer out of Miami All those three guys all they did was win in high school And you like to get those kind of players because they become contagious to everybody on the team By the way when you think about how many he went to a great high school Harvard West Harvard Wesley one backtoback state championships there And a whistle here as Tony Padilla has a whistle Stops the clock with 1340 to go in the first half And Texas up by two Theyre going to reset the shot clock Texas 19 wins last year Duke with 35 And Texas did reach the NCAA first four They eventually lost to Shawn Millers Xavier team Miller was hired to replace Rodney Terry at Texas just a couple of days later I thought Jerry in a way got a war Hes 43 and 20 Goes the NCA tournament two years in a row You lose your job Swain airborne in the teard drop No he follows the miss and knocks it down Stayed right with it Dalen Swain averaged about 11 points almost six rebounds and a couple of steals per game at Xavier last year A twoway player and another really good guard rebounder Yeah he really statistically he was like leading in almost every area Line driver and switched in by Isaiah Evans Had 22 in that exhibition win against Tennessee Really lit it up in that second half Well hes so good coming off those fade screens Dick you get picked off he shoots it so quickly Hes got great range Ill never forget the game last year I watch you I think you did it He had six threes in the first half against Auburn Against Auburn Yeah Hey he won that game for them But Patrick Gunga set a great fade screen Just threw right over the top You really better get pressure on the passer Theyre going to pick you apart on those actions Well feeling like a first game Teams combining for eight turnovers Only five baskets to this point Its been really physical to start and nothing but net and sweet touch there by Swain The 6A junior knocks it down He has eight and he put up 27 last year in the NCAA tournament against Illinois Pope could shoot We havent seen it yet but hes a good shooter as well And the feed here for Guna and the stuff for the 611 big I think Guna is going to have a real good year I really do I like his strength I like his play around the basket And a really good cut off that double team You get a double and he cut right to the rim Got to the front of it A nice save deep in the corner there by Heidi junior out of Minnesota who can really shoot it Transfer from Purdue and wriggling inside for two more Is Swain outside and inside already with 10 points One thing Sean Miller now I can understand when I talked to him on the phone the other day he went on and on about Swain that Swain is such an important part of his team Evans again Oh man did that hang on the iron Isaiah Evans it was up there all night and it rolls in Tell you what hes capable of going off for four or five quick threes Well he can go off in a hurry And if he continues to move without the ball hes going to be extraordinarily difficult to guard especially if he starts driving closeouts especially if he adds a little drive to his game Fake jab step go to the goal cuz people are going to really attack him to try to take three away from him Evans last music year about 42 from three He was best on the team for Duke and off to a good start here in the first half music In a physical contest where music buckets have been tough to come by Texas has done a great job of limiting Duke to one shot And music thats largely because of the great blockouts and the physical play but also because the guards have come down to rebound They are helping the big guys limit Duke to just one look And that was key in this game for Shawn Miller and his staff that all five guys on the defensive glass have to rebound You cant run before you get the ball And thus far Texas is beating Duke on the glass And Dukes got to do a better job of protecting the paint because Jaylen Swain has done a good job of punching the paint and getting to the rim Jay in that last time out thats what Sean Miller was emphasizing on the defensive end We have to be better communicating We cant let ourselves get beat in coverage So if its a switch I need you guys to be vocal and yell out switch Otherwise were just going to get beat if we dont know what were doing Chris Ill tell you one thing communication is vital You talk about any great team I know you played for Coach K and he talked about that all the time We got to communicate We got to let people know where we are on the floor got help etc And a lot of teams dont do that Jay well the best defenses are the loudest That that as an offensive team playing against them you can hear them And your talk has to be early loud and continuous And thats something that I know Texas is trying to build into the culture Youre not going to find many better defensive coaches than Shawn Miller That that hire that Texas made in Shawn Miller I put it right up there with Will Wade at NC State Darien Debris at Indiana Just a great hire Oat Titus into the paint Now back out Wilcher trying to get involved on the offensive end Nearly lost it and tipped out by Kaden Boozer the 64 freshman The shot clock down to three Kaden a very good passer Will he backs up for usually at the point guard left but hes a really good passer Understands the game Good basketball IQ Both quickly off the inbounds and in and outs He hasnt got known yet Hes had a big game this year Last year rather Got a game I think 40 plus Think Dukes got to run something to get Cameron Boozer a touch Boy another touch by Evans and Bottoms again as he buries another He has nine Hes going to be a big scorer this year J Hes going to be a 20 point scorer Really He should be Hes one of those guys that once he sees it go through once hes going to keep firing Heres what put Duke in front Teard drop No for pulp Hes not bashful Ill tell you that Hes not bashful And the Blue Devils will take possession Just another fade screen and then ghosted out of it And off those fades he really does a great job of getting his feet set Got a high release point But if he doesnt get that initial action they can come back and just rescreen on it That one they slipped So three out of four shooting it with nine points Everybody else a combined five Spain action Try to get Gunga into the low post Evans Oh what a nice dish underneath there to Gungby Found him They found him open in the inside It was the penetration that created an opportunity Draw some help Give it off Yeah the penetration forces the help to come up Once you help up its over Eight nothing run here for Duke Pope with the feed Cody trying to make a move Spins and nicely done for two He was a terrific high school player Hes one of the best in the state of Texas and he got an in injured and that really set him back But hes really uh Sean told me today hes really making great strides Just music a beautiful drop step He knew he had a size advantage over Sar And once Sar got his body into him he was able to spin off it music Just this baseline drop step gets the arm bar gives you the distance Once he gets into your body hes its over then I tell UB Brown would love that UB Brown used to lecture on that at the fivestar camp the drop step post it up I mean I heard UB the other day I was telling Jay previous play is under review for a timing issue Were taking a look at the last play Mens basketball set to look a little bit different ruleswise this year Several rule changes The addition of a coachs challenge system to update how officials call continuous motion fouls as well Challenge system the first in mens basketball Challenge can be used at any point during the game provided that team has a timeout available Thats out of bounds calls basket interference or strict The game clock will be reset to 10 minutes 8 seconds new ball And were also going to see Jay continuation in the game Yeah All the way to the gather I think its a really good rule change because often times you get a call on the floor when it should be an end one And so I think both those rule changes especially the coachs challenge its going to speed games up and were not going to see the officials having to go to its not the officials fault but its the rules fault having to go to the monitor and every play is like the Zruder film Yeah I like that rule I love the idea they can challenge like that because as Jay said its going to make the game a lot quicker Not going to have going in a monitor seven eight times a game Exactly Game getting a little long longish at times Yeah Humps you miss miss your flights Cant get out Well Im glad you said that but I mean that thats been known to happen on the drive Sar as he slams on the brakes back out for the hot hand and again Evans just buries a long threepointer Somebody better find him J theyre going to find him You cant give him that kind of room You know when he gets on the streak forget about it Hes one of those players that you just cant help off but did a really good job of backing up to the threepoint line Doug has really stepped it up Now you know in their first two exhibition games youre going to watch your Evans wide open shoots that three He gets it off so quick But in the exhibition games Duke really in the first half against Johnny Dawkins team former great player played with Jay turned Duke around when he got there and had 85 86 But the bottom line is the bottom line in the second half Look at deciding why pass it The lane opened up for him and this is a 132 run for the Duke Blue Devils Theyre going to be a great spurtability team as Clark Kellogg would say Theyre going to be a team that goes on big spurts Another loose ball scooped up by Sar Back door cut SWOOPING INSIDE ITS EVANS for the layin Tell you one thing their efficiency right now cheering their offensive efficiency moving out the ball Really great job of really moving out the ball Jay and it started with their defense but with Isaiah Evans knocking down a couple of shots early then his movement has taken over He backed out to the threepoint line off that penetration Got the pass out knocked down the three and then the terrific basket cut for the layup If hes continuous motion hes going to be really hard to guard He has 14 to lead all scorers The last couple of buckets by Duke theyre on a heck of a run Weve seen this before Cameron Boozer was along the baseline drew a lot of defensive attention That opened up the lane for Gungba And then off that little fade screen up top the continuous motion to get all the way to the rim No pressure on the passer and just pick you apart Tell you one thing I mentioned a little bit earlier You know he Jay played on a great team Obviously was a terrific team 85 86 37 and three second to second I think best record ever at Duke You know Jay and that team you guys really two years earlier turned it all around when you arrived with Dawkins I believe Allerie was on it Mark Ally Yeah The bottom line is then the first two years you got them to start winning They won 20 games cuz coach lost his first three years at losing seasons and all of a sudden uh you guys came in and away they went and coach goes for 122 wins and just an incredible achievement that he I I cant get over what hes achieved and three gold medals I mean what more could the guy do and he may be up for an Emmy for the read on the tease into the broadcast tonight That was tremendous Yeah he did a great job Duke another outlet here for Evans and lost the handle on it Should have beat up Yeah he was trying to get it to Sar up ahead of the pack Inside swing Wont get that one to go Second ever Triori had that one sent back Duke really playing suffocating D Weieber and too strong with a long jumper Rebound will roll right to Texas again Weaver will drive it and lay it in and takes a hit The Longhorns desperately needed that basket Kendall Weaver right there showed his eye So that was a terrific play hanging in the air making that deuce Boy Weaver is just a warrior Always around the ball and a terrific cut as the ball was coralled along the baseline He saw the lane to the basket and Swain with a spectacular pass to get the and one Now we talk about this year I had a little talk with Paul Via Cardi our guru for recruiting in high school He told me he said this years class of freshman is way better than last year When you think about he said for example newser and then you got the kid at BYU is unbelievable and the kid at Kansas Peterson and what about last night that freshman unbelievable shot the nation I mean he goes for 30 30 without a three 30 without a three and beating Florida Arizona I see your passion is really waning for the game Dick staying up till like midnight 100 in the morning watching these games are trying to battle his way inside Hes tied up Possession arrow will keep it here Hey talk about passion about your game in baseball I stayed up this Gods honest truth 7 and 12 hours And watch that World Series game the three in the morning I know Dan Schuming up there in Canada He quality is a great story Better be exhausted son Ben whos also playbyplay announcer for the Toronto Blue Jays Seven to get off a shot Boozers been ice cold Harris will lift and nails it as he knocks down a three I think hes going to get some minutes this year Jay I really do Hes bigger and stronger Has worked on his body and his conditioning Just terrific discipline to go against that close out Little shot fake one dribble pull up He makes the three and hustles like you did diamond on the floor for a loose ball Thats going to catch the attention of the coach staff Well Dukes just got so much positional size Their guards are big Dalon Swain harassed with 8 seconds on the shot clock Knocked out of play by Duke This man has been cooking Isaiah Evans put up some numbers music last season but this year hes going to be relied upon in a big way FOR Im serious Three Signage is on the floor And you know what theyve done Theyve been done a really cool thing here We noticed this at shootarounds all around the outside of the court are your sayings going back to 1979 when you started inventing inventing all these amazing sayings that have been copied so many times Tell one thing I was shocked when I came in They came a little bit early They wanted me to see the floor I said Ive seen basketball floors No you havent seen one like this They said You havent seen one I cant believe what they did The time and the money and all that And I just cant thank I said all the ESPN people start with a boss to my left here in the front row No shes got a great seat Hes got a great seat Jay I mean laughter I think he gets any seat he wants Well the only the floor says you know awesome baby and PT Pier and all that The only thing it doesnt say is Lorraine laughter J Im constantly calling Lorraine Let me tell you this I would have never made it out of the cancer battles without that lady She was right behind me everywhere every treatment She and my daughter shes talking to my agent there which is Sandy Montana Sue Lipton And thats my granddaughter She goes to Duke Shes a sophomore with all her friends there at Duke Theyre down here She plays tennis at Duke Thats what John Shy saying you know I get texts from Dick Half of them are about basketball The other half are about tennis Well he plays tennis My granddaughter says I see coach Shire sitting next to me on the court Leaves that gets rid of that stress Coaching has so much stress today Its tough man With the NIL with the transfer portal things have changed drastically for coaches I think the check they get takes away some of the stress Yeah Hope the live stream especially when youre coaching football and you get fired and they say Well I wont fire you but you get 59 million Thats the thing Theyre complaining about what the players are making Theyre paying over 200 million in buyouts Its not even November 50th Cushions the blow just a little bit Up top Heres Cameron Boozer again trying to get started Hes had a couple of spectacular exhibition games and hell draw the foul with 711 to go in the first half in Charlotte Well the Tennessee game against a really fun Tennessee team on the road in front of 20000 people He goes for 24 and 23 24 points 23 off the glass I mean he was just electrifying going to fire from the corner but no again the rebound kept alive by the youngster Amen Dukes answer to Keniple well find out that is a tall task and that one simply thrown out of play by Malik Brown whos something special and he and James by the way are starting up here in uh in Charlotte with the Hornets yeah Seion James who transferred to Duke from two lane and took over the point guard position last year on the team that went 35 and four and went to the final four The Duke drafties and quite a team right there alone as Texas strikes on the other end that three second area manage area to get in there Triori with the basket hes 69 from Ivory Coast transfer from Xavier Didnt start playing basketball till 16 downstairs Its Brown for the basket and one And Malik Brown fully recovered from last years shoulder injury but hes had a sore knee hampering him Hes been music out of the exhibition but playing tonight Great defensive player Played at Syracuse was all big East as a defender and he had injuries last year but hes vital at key times Jay his defensive ability rubs off to everybody else Well you can switch him on He can switch one through five And hes got amazing hands not only gets steals but gets a ton of deflections But how about Nick Kmenya with that you know shot fake and drive drawing the defender Trayori Thats what opened it up for Brown I think those wing players really going to be such contributor to Xi You mentioned Amin and also the kids sar I think theyre going to be great assets and the size you mentioned it earlier Jay the size of Lind especially defensively is going to frustrate a lot of opponents No question Thats where they have to set themselves apart Last year was a great defensive team cheering and this year thats got to be a signature Sort of on quue Gungbo with the rejection for the Blue Devils Theyre up 2922 on the outside Dukes running a lot of five out offense The middle is wide open Harris and hes going to get nailed for a traveling violation He slipped a bit and thatll be five turnovers for Duke Really good defense by Kendall Weaver of Texas This is back to the block moments ago Good timing by Patrick Young He had some injury music issues last year especially early but came on late Yeah he was a factor late No doubt about it And played really well in the ACC tournament after Cooper Flag was injured in the first game against Georgia Tech He also shared the post a little bit with Malawatch And uh right now you know not playing a whole lot down there with Phoenix but hes got a great future Hes a young kid and its a matter of time And Cooper Coopers going to be a star I dont care what what stats he has early And no doubt in my mind he will be a star now Hes 18 years old Jay no question A little flex action Weaver gets a look and cash in Rebound right to Brown That was Brick City USA man Looked like your shot Dave Thank you Thanks for remembering Thank you coach Swoop shot and a block as Texas got back quickly Two of the 68 freshman involved in the play They like him a lot He was born in Munich Germany They ran the ball off the floor quickly here And Sean Miller said I like to play at a cheering fast tempo I believe so much in spacing and also movement We got movement spacing and run the ball Well be okay Gungas second foul as he tried to shut down Vocat Titus Beautiful open side pick and roll The nice little pocket pass and there are the hands Swain just threaded the needle with the right hand and terrific hands by Vocatitis Yeah they really love his hands Youre right They they were that first thing they told me Hes got very strong hands and he was only a freshman last year Was as you mentioned earlier freshman of the year in the conference of Florida Atlantic They average over 10 points a game almost six rebounds and shot close to 70 from the field Sounds like the keeper Yeah Sean Miller said hes got great hands Start with that with a big man Huge plus there He cuts it to 2925 Well if you got no hands you cant catch the ball Why You got to be effective You got to have hands Dave You got to have good hands Why do you say Dave for a big man Are you one of those laughter Youre an anti big guy I think I might I laughter think I might be 2925 506 to go in the half But but Dave you are pretty good for a little guy Thank you That for a little guy Hes a talent with that microphone He really is The best Its Boozer trying to feed it downstairs and kicked away Boy Boozer has really struggled in this game But you know what Thats going to happen for players Young players start pressing a little bit ball not going in Plus its only one half And he didnt he didnt process that double team as quickly as I think he normally does But one of the great things about Cam Boozer hes really emerged in a short period of time after they started playing exhibition games as a a vocal leader Tell one thing his daddy was a pretty good player I tell you that Talk about hands Well NBA uh three times champion at Duke of course in his own right Swain putting a shoulder down A scoop on drop though and Boozer collects it And onto his brother Cadence dominated Knocked away They dominated it out in Miami Columbus High School They just crushed people He has four consecutive state championships His dad looks on what a great player he was And think how many points Carlos Boozer could have scored to Duke if Jay Williams had passed the ball once in a while which of course wont get back He played with too right He did Badier Williams and Boozley Pretty good club Chris Duhan Mike Dunlevy They Dunle on that team as well Yeah Incredible team with the national title 2001 is it 21 20 2001 2001 Right Thats one Yeah they beat Arizona in the final with Richard Jefferson Gilbert Arenas Jason Gardner that whole crew Foul on the hold with 424 to go You know I think of all those great Duke teams and I think what I hear in my mind is your voice that I mean calling those spectacular unforgettable moments Youre so connected to all of those teams all of those great moments I used to love those moments Those moments were special especially in the 80s and 90s When you got down there doing games with you know Jordan against Samson and doing Big East and Monday was just special Ewing in company and Derek Coleman and it was just a special time really Basketball you had stability in the lineups Right now the best free agency in sports is college basketball They got the best free agency Forget about NBA any of places Well theres not a a player over the last 40 plus years that Dick Vital is not connected to I mean Dick youve been the soundtrack of the game Talk about somebody whos embedded in the fabric of the game I remember calling you the glue guy for the Duke team You were the guy the glue guy You called me a lot of stuff laughter Titus at the line Brown with the foul and he will drop down number one And Friday night Blue Bloods at Chapel Hill number 19 Kansas taking on number 25 North Carolina Coverage beginning at 700 pm Eastern on ESPN and the all new ESPN app Do me a favor Repeat that name again I work like crazy in front of the mirror with that name I have my wife trying to help me laughter on it Tell me that name for Modest Vocatitis Vocatitis Yes I said 20 times in a row My wife said Shut up I dont want to hear it anymore Vocat Titus Well if she hears you say Vocatitis she probably thinks they should call a doctor laughter Youre right Transfer from FAU He was as Dicky mentioned AAC freshman of the year And they think they might have something with him Five points so far in the first half for the big man Cameron Boozer on the bounce feed It didnt quite get there but a whistle as well Just under four minutes in the half now So far Swain and Evans have been the goto men for Texas and the Duke Blue Devils tonight Going downtown Thats Swain right there Nothing but nylon baby Nothing but nylon Perfect baby Its time for your tshirt Are you ready cheering screaming screaming I hope I can hear her Heat Heat Well thank you Seth Ill tell you one thing Seth thats helped me big time raise money Thank you for the recent checks that you sent in did from your breakfast with the coaches That was really terrific Like about 60000 man The kids battling cancer Thank you sir Damar the freshman from Italy at the line for Duke Played in Barcelona Played on a good team out in Barcelona Now both of these head coaches were stars in high school and they were outstanding college players today Both of them recounting the absolute thrill of hearing their names for the first time on ESPN when Dick Bell called them out John Sh was said he got a big kick and he called him a diaper dandy He said Was Sean Miller and Diaper Dandy I said Was he He was one of the freshman of the year in the Big East at the time when they had the great players Can a diaper dandy wear a mustache though Thats what I want to know You made sure you pointed that out the first time You remembered that typing daddy I tell you one thing I know youre not a type of daddy Youre a PGT You and laughter Jerry prime time performance There it is again A freshman who is simply awesome baby Where Texas has really fought back in this game after that barrage from Isaiah Evans And theyve done it on the glass Theyve limited for the most part limited Duke to one shot and theyve got Texas has 10 offensive rebounds and nine points off those offensive boards Thats all coaching That really is thats a reflection of your leader Teaching them to play hard on every possession And thats what he does He teaches them to play hard on every possession Its a violation against Duke and against Sar took a big step forward while Pope missed the foul shot So hes going to get to repeat it and a good foul shooter too 88 that made all the difference I tell you what Pope and Mark loads of experience plus age wise Ones 24 and the other one I believe is 22 So this that experience is a big plus for Texas So Pope gets the second end of the oneonone He has five points and as Jay pointed out Texas hanging right in this thing 3129 They were on the verge of maybe getting blown out about seven or eight minutes ago worried about that man I said I dont want to blow out right now Nothing to do by John Thats a travel cheering A really nice job by Traman Mark to stick with Isaiah Evans off those actions Curling off the ball He just blew that up completely Got skinny got through music it and then Trayori put pressure on and a high hand from Truman Mark to discourage that pass You have to have really active hands when youre playing against Duke because their big guys do a really good job passing over the top Tell you one thing I think Fosters got to shoot a little bit more Hes 0 for O right now Thats a good first shot He didnt build for a shot against Tennessee either I remember his freshman year he was pretty good offensively Yeah he got 18 had 18 points against Michigan State in the champions class Car lost the hand line Out it goes and back over to Duke with 310 left in half number one Thats the 10th turnover for Texas in this first half This a big three minutes right now Especially when you look at Texas You cant let them go on a spurt here 70 spur You got to go in there with confidence We got a chance to beat this team You got to believe it You got to feel it and believe it If you dont feel it and believe it you cant win Duke led by nine 2617 Since then the Longhorns have outshored him 12 to five Kendall Weaver guarding Isaiah Evans Tip back out for Sar and a second effort now for Duke Evans again on the spin Lost it there But before the basket no basket there There was a foul against Texas See they would like that one Sh He wants to see him more a little diversified He wants to see him more than just shooting a jump shot Wants to lose a little bit of attack in the rim Get to the foul line a little bit Cena Tayori with his second personal foul And thatll put Evans at the line An 81 shooter last year at the foul line Preseason all ACC second team And coming up Sunday right here in Charlotte a great womens matchup in the Alli tip off Number 18 USC squaring off against number nine NC State 3 pm Eastern on ESPN and the allnew ESPN app And Evans connects on the second 3229 the Blue Devils They give him 15 in the first half And Texas has to continue to get a piece of the paint Theyve been able to get to the free throw line in this first half both on the bounce to the big Okatitus banging here against Gungba A lot of contact there and thatll go the other way and offensive foul number two on the sevenfooter Well hes been like definitely made contact with his shoulder but you know what I like I like he likes to be a little active in that post and hes showing some strength in that post I know hes Yeah theres no doubt about that call Yeah hes physical but thats where you just drop staff and go to the rim You know Gungba had good position there And theyll let you get away with a bump or two but when you really lower that shoulder on that third bump theyre going to call that every time Even the blind guy like me with one eye can see that baby Nice block shot right there by Titus And hell draw the foul as well This will go against the Blue Devils with 216 left Im impressed with him potential Im impressed with his potential Only being a sophomore I think this kid has got a future Cant teach that size baby Cant teach that size Fosters second personal and Boat Titus to the other end to shoots And this will be a one and one Boatitis fluent in Lithuanian Russian and English Hes been out with an ankle injury He only just the last couple days that decided that he could play So hes missed a lot of practice recently Yeah he and Triori have both missed considerable time in practice for Shawn Miller So Shawn Mill really wasnt sure what he was going to get tonight because he has not been able to practice you know some of his post guys but they have shown up in a big way Well Triayor is on a a minutes restriction Hes only going to play 16 maybe 20 minutes but yeah he had some serious injuries Yeah Bokeatitis doesnt have a restriction and the way hes playing hes going to play a lot of minutes Oh onepoint game Juke of the ball Boozer bulling his way inside He has just been ice cold here in the first half And the help by Voca Titus really helped there right there defensively And the guards again getting down to rebound Nobodys watching Theyre sticking their nose in there and their rebounding has been a big deal Back to the big guy in a traveling violation Well hes lucky he got called for the traveler before the charge So 142 to go before the break and Duke clinging to a onepoint lead Once he takes this move into the middle hes got to drop step and go to the baseline side He just ran over Gunga He got called for the travel So he didnt pick up another foul But thats another turnover for Texas without getting a shot up We havent seen the drop step from him yet So I think thats one thing theyre going to start working with him on in practice to make sure he utilizes that because thatll be a big plus for him Yeah this is a good experience for Modest Vocatitis Miller takes him out cheering with about 90 seconds to go before halftime in Charlotte Evans fires That one wont drop He had a triple that was on the rim for half an hour earlier in the game that fell There was that fade and rescreen action Thats going to be really good for Duke and for Isaiah Evans Heres Cody open Wide open It tips right back to him I could have made that little wide open jump at 15 foot That was my range Pope gives up the dribble Back for Mark Shot clock a factor now down to five Long range jumper and that missed ugly by Swain But the second effort is up and in by Cody Well the glass has been a huge factor in this game And Texas is winning the battle of the glass You cant allow that second opportunity I mean nobody near the ball for Duke Nobody blocked out Foster inside That wont drop He wanted a foul Texas has the lead for the first time since it was 1211 I think the kid Cody is going to be a good player for them I really do Oh he is going to be good He was a talented kid before his big injury Now you mentioned he was the number one ranked player in the state of Texas a couple years ago I can tell you listen to me Thanks Do my best Mark with the hand off for Cody for to get off a shot Triori sees it launches He cant hit it 10 seconds before halftime cheering and Duke with a timeout with 68 seconds to go Now in both exhibition games Duke has been sensational in the second half They came out and they were really in a battle with Johnny Dawkins and suddenly his team UCF and then they were I think they were down seven against Tennessee Were they not down Jay Yeah it was closer at halftime but they really they were 20 of 20 from the free throw line in the second half It was still close at the end but but two really good second half performances music 68 Well lets go back to last night and an awful lot happened in college basketball music yesterday Auburn surviving Cookman in overtime music Steven Pearls head coaching debut surviving indeed And how about Arizona and Florida Arizona with the upset of the reigning national champs Ill tell you one thing and he he did it against a really strong front court One of the great front courts certainly as Florida Look at BYU man Be Villanova This kid is they were raving about him today music AJ Deanza they say he is absolutely going to be right in the hunt to be the number one player in the NBA draft Boozer on the drive trying to finish strong and thatll roll off the iron with 6 to GO AND this ones going to have to be thrown up by the rim A little surprised that Cameron Boozer couldnt finish that He was going against Traman Mark off a switch and had the size and strength advantage What is Boozer right now Did you get the stats there He has not hit a shot 0 for seven 0 for seven right now the inbound and that wont drop the jumper by Gungba So we are at halftime Texas with a great comeback They were getting less stagnant more ball movement finish plays and finish through contact So underway in the second half in Charlotte at Spectrum Center and Texas opening up with a basketball Swain over the top to the big but cant finish that Okatitus had an opportunity to slam it but couldnt get there Boy beautiful Spain action just didnt finish it Well executed up until the end Duke missing their last eight field goals to end the first half Just went ice cold They have won 25 consecutive season openers Look at Titus with the rejection but a foul first in the opening half minute You know you mentioned lose winning 25 On the other side Texas has lost nine in a row in matchups against teams in the top 10 So somethings going to give tonight Cody with the foul Texas has never beaten Duke 0 and5 against the Blue Devils Their last meeting way back in November of 2017 They cant feel too bad about that A lot of teams havent beat Duke Trying to put an end to that tonight And finally Cameron Boozer is on the scoreboard His first point John Shy ran a little diagonal upcreen to get him isolated in the post but still Texas did a really good job of forcing him baseline underneath the bucket And then you know Cameron Ger probably got away with a hook there Hes an excellent Hes an excellent free throw shooter I think hes going to break out here in the second half I wouldnt be surprised he put like 1415 on the board Preseason ACC Rookie of the Year Weaver straight on Got an excellent look Boozer up for the rebound And here he comes Gives this up for Sar He launches but short Should have got that ball back right to Boozer Give it up He post up inside get the ball and score Weaver won the fight for the loose ball Duke by one just underway second half Swain with a curl pass for the big Titus jump on Gumba Lays it up It wont drop Had that layup Had that layup with the left hand Caleb Foster Well see if he starts to get rolling here in the second half Hell drive it Boozer and the slam for two Just a matter of time Matter of time You got to hold back greatness Jay Greatness always usually comes back on top But it was just great recognition by Caleb Foster Had Vocat Titus on him and just drove him baseline played off two feet to find Cameron Boozer I want to see look for a shot a little more Mark off the dribble Shot clock down to 10 for Texas Cody will launch off the back of the iron right back to him Mark with his second effort Okatitus banging away here with Gumba Got to get more movement Wriggling under side though The follow wont drop but the whistle Cody on the foul and a foul goes against the Blue Devils here Im seeing some good things out of Focus Tigers I know hes turned the ball over I know hes charged and all that but theres certain things hes doing that tells me the potentials unlimited No hes a really good player and as he gets his post moves down hes going to be really difficult to beat Dad likes it Cody at the line Foul number two on Isaiah Evans by the way conference so tough though when youre in that league there Dave and Jay you talk about the SEC and it is really tough also very tough the Big 12 Jay I saw it today and I couldnt believe it I dont think Ive ever seen Kansas preseason in the conference pick number six I dont bet I dont bet I dont like to lose money I dont like to I just dont like it however I would bet I would bet that Kansas doesnt finish sixth in that conference I tend to think that was uh ranked based off a last year not so much this year because Kansas is going to be a lot better now Oh Peterson was unbelievable Dan Peterson spectacular against Louisville in the next edition but had 24 in the first half Yeah he said he played a perfect first half Bill Self and a foul here against Texas Maybe sensing that Boozer is about to cut loose Thatll go against Jordan Pope his second So well give you a look at the NCAA tournament bids by conference SEC setting a record There were only 16 teams in the conference 14 Unbelievable An alltime record ACC went to a uh two less games did they not In a conference play The ACC did Yeah They went down to 18 Yeah First time in six years going to play that number of games 18 conference games I get a couple more uh games independent games And then I was telling Jay during the halftime were talking you know Duke has got an ambitious ambitious preconference schedule playing Arkansas nice pass inside by Gunbo Well if you bring cheering that double over lateer an excellent passer found Gumbbo right under the bucket Yeah too easy Wilshire little step back Hope trying to get free Cant do it He can be dangerous from the three PICKED OFF SAR AND CANT CONNECT NO NO NO NO HAD A CHANCE for a spectacular dunk but they cant believe it He cant believe it Tell one thing He did a great job playing the passing lane to get that steel Anticipate really well There he is Anticipating Take it home big fella Oh no No Bricks did you ever do that Jay I couldnt get up that high And youre honest Drive A battle for that That comes away to Boozer Boston wants to press the tempo on the spin Will lay it up and in Hes got to be a little bit more assertive offensively He was really good offensively as a freshman Thats the kind of easy basket cheering you can get off good defense Duke doing a better job of guarding the ball in this second half Sean Miller getting a timeout because Duke starts the second half fast Texas has not scored in the second half and they are down 4033 You know Dave they have done that in the first two exhibition games They have been brilliant in this second half Take a look right here Oh nice drive Great drive by Foster Count it Count it He music looks terrific right there music Why dont you get a classic How much basketball excitement Well the iconic Dicky V has had so many big moments at the microphone but he can get really silly and get inside get inside the crowd where theyll pass him down from one section to another from the student sections Guys great seeing Mike Patrick there He passed away recently Mike was terrific at the ACC Phenomenal He really was great His voice he was amazing Enthusiasm John Maderie sitting down to your left John doing a great job on stats And this is what youve done calling the very first major college basketball game Do you remember this game December 5 of 79 I really do cuz I was really depressed I got fired by the Pistons and I didnt want to go out of the house And if it wasnt my wife Scott called me up I ended up three times on a phone First two I said No I want to get back coaching in college I know nothing about TV I still dont know nothing about TV laughter but thats been a plus But anyway the third time my wife practically threw me out of the house and I said Oh Ill do the game I didnt know what the heck I was doing to be honest And uh but it was Mark Maguire They had a great team They were number one in the country Cummings and a gang And they played against a good Wisconsin team coached by Bill Koffield Lost his life too early Lot of fun Great for Joe Bole Scoop shot wont go but a foul I knew youd remember the details of that thing You dont you dont forget anything Well and by the way all nine Duke players who appeared in this game have at least one assist music Big reason they lead it by seven music Okay fans So behind me is getting real Its time for our dress like Tubby Greenlay race So heres how it works George and DeMarco have to get suited up just like Tubby So were talking from top to bottom Okay Then once they are fully suited up the first person that hits the basket wins and we got a prize with their name on it It is four tickets to the Duke Mayo Mall January 2nd at Bank of America That sounds like a sweet deal to me All right so let me check in with our real quick George and Dear are we all set Want to make sure we look good In the meantime fans make some noise for them This is going to be good All right getting excited in three two one go George come on somebody Okay ready All right here we go snorts Garfield But what are we looking at here Richard 196364 Garfield High School You coached these guys all those years ago and they came to say hi They were here yesterday Look at these guys I look at those guys That was my team I was there one year My wife got such a kick here in store I mean they got memories The stories they were sharing I said I really did that They said Yeah you did Hey if you think I had energy now you should have seen me at 20 at that time man I was 23 24 years old a head coach in high school Then I went to East Strutter and things got pretty good We won two state championships and had one great great player Broke my heart lost his life It was publicized to drugs And probably my biggest disappointment ever because I thought he was going to be a special NBA player And from there did did you go to Ruckers as an assistant Then I went to Ruckers from uh after winning the championships there I was at Michigan to want to get ahead in coaching and I got a lucky opportunity to Howard Garfield a fivestar fan Oh yeah He uh he he said to me You belong in college I said Really I said Im getting more rejections than that Harvard gives out I said I keep writing letters and where am I going to go He said Im going to get your job I didnt you know you think a guy just tells you that And sure enough two weeks later he calls me I got you an interview at Ruckers And I told him If he interviews you hes gonna hire you And Sir Dick Lloyd hired me Yeah And I loved every moment of it And youre a brilliant recruiter And you recruited enough talent to take them to the final four Well Mike Dabby and Phil Cers were special players Texas with the ball here Very cold start second half of the Longhorns Wilter trying to end it That one missed ugly Four to get off another shot Heres Swain straight on He cant bury it And theres a lid on that basket And thats going to go the other way with 1525 to go in the contest Its all Duke at the moment Theyve been doing this this year Ill tell you Im not really surprised by this And the thing is theyre defending a lot better right now Duke Yeah theyve ratcheted up their ball pressure and doing a good job of guarding the ball so theyre not put in helpside situations Texas 0 for nine since the second half Looking for Boozer again on the bank but hell be headed to the line to shoot two Boy better get used to that action where a guard sets an up screen to get Cam Boozer into the low post You might have to switch that Gives him a mismatch This guy knows basketball man He really does I tell you you can break it down technically really with the best Jay Buzzu shooting two Heidi with the foul Heidi can shoot the three and I play and Purdues team wanted to have great players expecting another great year this year despite they got really blown out by Kentucky and Jay told me today which I did not know Georgetown had beaten Kentucky So who knows in basketball every day you dont know whats going to happen Well the beauty is those are just exhibition games They dont count Yeah right applause 4233 on a 10 nothing run Heres Heidi as you mentioned 39 for Purdue from threepoint land last year Swain slamming on the brakes and drops in two Hes a good player Now this kid is really solid He can score He defends well Hes a twoway player 12 points Boozer with the drive and again takes the hit and hell return to the line Very determined here since halftime Hes going to start asserting himself big time I told you theyll put like 1415 in that booking by halftime He caught that ball on the run and hes hard When he gets downhill whos getting in front of him And when he gets downhill even when he misses Sean J hes right there for the offensive rebound So thatll make it 4335 ACC mens basketball coming your way on Friday the 14th Indiana State taking on this Duke team at seven Larry Birds not coming is he No Indiana State though the seminals right back in the day of Larry Burton in NC Central and North Carolina at 900 pm ACC Network You know we showed John Shy sitting there You know what a tough job replacing a guy like Mike and he has done an amazing job He has won 89 games in three years Now you dont have to go to Harvard to figure out I cant even figure out thats like 299 unbelievable per year and he only needs 29 wins which is not only but has a big three He needs 29 to catch in four years to winning this coach in a fouryear period is Brad Stevens Mueller 1425 to go here in the second half and every time it appears that Duke is about to really gain some separation Texas does something like that Pope with the step back three Well the three will change the complexion of a game quickly Well Pope had 42 in a game last year against New Orleans Went eight of 12 from three in that game And hes a 38 career threepoint shooter Had a terrific career at Oregon State before transferring to Texas I think thats a record down Yeah it sat on the rim and the big guy Pocotitis couldnt corral it that threepointer on the money and then you the 68 freshman absolutely buried it His first points of this game Well he needed that Hes hes such a good player Went four of 17 in Dukes two exhibition games Did so many other things well though Hes going to be a really good player Yeah excellent wing player John Sh really high on him And a whistle on that side right in front of Texas And thatll go against Malik Brown on his third Mark trying to help out and thats just too far a distance to close out when you was ready to shoot it So 1347 to go and Texas the inbound I think two diaper and also Zar are very important to this team You know their goals are certainly not just being in the tournament Their goal is to win it all Thats it Basically came very close last year Sixpoint lead with a minute to go Get you great Houston Very painful defeat for the Blue Devils Duru trying to pull his way inside Tied up on the play The possession arrow will take it to the other end Itll be Duke Ball Yeah By the way congratulations Kelvin Samson on his 800th game He belongs in the Hall of Fame No question I mean so I think him I also think Rick Barnes and close certainly Buck F I think all three guys have done such an amazing job for years Boy that last possession you can see the defensive impact of Malik Brown Switched off and then right there and helped side to force that turnover Went for the three Hman with the save He takes pride You watch him play He takes pride defensively He really does Oh nice screen right there Evans Not this time Hes sizzled in the first half Texas has to figure out a way to get some easy baskets Theyre having to grind it out against Dukes half court defense They havent gotten anything in transition No And they want to play a running game Im surprised they have not got zero in transition P fires again and swishes in another triple Hey one thing hes hes a shooter He can score Give him 11 Catch and fire to pull Texas to within six Brown on the high post The hand off for Evans with the contact Little bump there by Mark and a foul on the block shot Thatll be his second foul on Truman Mark the grad Josh Shs going to love that Hes going to love that watching him go to the basket creating contact Well Jordan Pope will shot fake another step back to the threepoint line Thats two step backs in this second half Hes got an excellent midrange game And Sean Miller at shootaround today said hes hes probably our best player at the moment because hes the most consistent Yet he was coming off the bench in this ball game to provide a little bench firepower for the Longhorns Boy Sean was one heck of a player He didnt know there Brother Archer was a heck of a player as well Hes up in Rhode Island Little tough up there when you talk about Sean you know they dont have the NIL money and all to do the things Sean Miller was a great passer at Pittsburgh Hes from Beaver Falls Pennsylvania Same place Joe Nameoth is from Oh yeah you beat me to the punch I was going to I was going to tell you a little bit earlier And guys I want to know from you What great quarterback came from Beaver Falls and Jay Beach at a parch Yeah Joe will name it How about that stash by the way Yeah its a classic He probably wanted to look tougher in college Yes undoubtedly Mark with the kick here for Swain The guy just want to post Wants it again to the paint Off balance That wont drop Rebound comes to Harris Well defense was tough on him That was a that was not a good shot Kayen Boozer and a whistle on the deck with 1150 to play in Charlotte at the very first Dick by Tal Invitational presented by Belk Duke trying to break away Texas making it tough 4941 the Blue Devils music would like to thank our coaptains music for their support of the day by mission of positively impacting the city of Charlotte where co captain support plays a vital role in the success of the high and we cannot Fans of go anywhere every game himself will present the Dick by Tal Prime Time Player Award presented by Bel Join us as we recognize tonights stand out performer the player who brought the energy passion and prime time play to the court Stick around to see who takes home the honor right after the game Well Cameron Boozer had a tough first half but much more active in the second half Caleb Foster has a music matchup he can drive And Cameron Boozer with that 45° cut to get to the front of the rim and gets the score when the double team music is too slow getting to him Hes got the vision to throw over the top to Patrick Gungba got to the front of the rim and when he catches the ball on the run This in transition with the left hand drive Cam Heidi had no choice but to foul him And in this ball game Cam Boozer has drawn seven fouls off his Texas defenders Hes got eight points in the second half Most of them coming from free throws Yeah hes one for eight offensively shooting but hes got those free throws Six for seven And his twin brother Kaden at the line Freshman from Miami drops in the first one Hes going to be a very important player there No question as he gives them that third guard He gives him a guy that could replace Foster at the cheering point Good IQ understands and really a very creative passer cheering Sean Miller in that last huddle challenged his team In this next four minutes I want every time the ball goes up all five of you to go after the ball You guys are acting like the only time that we can get the ball is off a Duke bucket We have to be able to get out in front offensively I tell you Chris thats the motivational ability of Shawn Miller He will never accept mediocrity A very determined move there by Dalon Swain whos had a really fine game 14 points Yeah he shown a lot of versatility Scores from the perimeter drives Hes a tough hard nose player Oh theres a bump Yeah thats not a thats not a steal that Bokeatitis is going to get You just have to extend that catch and put pressure on Gun But once he catches it but you force him out by the threepoint line youve done your job Hes going to learn a lot in this game because he was telling me before the game Sean he hasnt played this kind of caliber competition at Florida Atlantic and this a great learning Youre going to see Shawn is going to really work with this kid and this kid by the middle of the year is going to be a real major contributor That was his third foul in and out by Gunba Roger Ayes did a nice job during the foul shooting action moments ago talking to both Pocatitus and Gungba whove really been going toetotoe A lot of physical play between the two of them You know whats really great Roger the guys on the game We havent seen anybody go to the sideline in terms of monitor I mean thats great No basket foul before that 1109 showing on the clock Good crew here along with Doug Shia and Tony Padilla along with Roger at the helm shooting back Texas getting a little better movement with that ball screen motion and especially when they can go over the top of that middle screen they can get some good action going out of the middle of the middle third of the floor Another whistle here and the foul will go against Darren Harris number one for the Duke sophomore You know Jay thats exactly what Charbella talked about He said We got to get movement cheering We got to get movement and we got to play a better game at tempo than what theyre playing tonight Getting up against some easy baskets Not as you said earlier everythings a grind Theres that zoom action Shot clock down to seven Both ball weight and he cashes in a triple HE He was sizing that up You have to be on him on the catch You cant recover to Jordan Pope especially after hes knocked down a few shots Yeah Nothing like confidence baby You knock one down you say I can do it again I can do it again Now you both mentioned how hot he can get 42point game against New Orleans last season cheering He couldnt miss He has 14 in this one Turn around spin shot thatll roll off the iron by Harris Another fight for the rebound and another tie up The possession error will take it the other way here with just about 10 minutes to go And again Texas ball trailing by five Tell one thing every twice in this game now theyve been down like 9 10 and then they made a real real tough comeback I think Dex is going to love Shawn Miller as a coach I really do I think they got a guy thats a winner He did a great job when he was suddenly at Xavier two times and also Arizona Now Pope gets another touch Draws the double Priori into the paint looking to make a spin and hes going to travel with it He gives it right back to Duke and thatll be applause and cheering 15 Texas turnovers Priori was at Xavier last year but really didnt play because of injury But when he was at Long Beach State playing for Dan Mson he had a couple years where he averaged a double double They called him a double double machine Off the mark Boozer Quick shot there by the freshman Theres Swain whos been a major factor knifing into the lane again And two more rattle home Yeah one thing if they come back and win the game he could be the MVP Isaiah Evans had to go under that screen by Trayori and that allowed Swain to turn the corner He did a great job to create space 7 nothing run for Texas to cut it to three and Duke takes a timeout and Swain Gayen Swain the junior from Columbus Ohio has been cooking Went underneath and he just hesitated Got right into the body of Isaiah Evans and just that little midrange shot These are difficult shots but he created the contact and then was able to score through it And you look at last season averaging a solid 11 a game but tonight stepping up in Charlotte against the number six team in the country Well you know he averaged 11 a game but he also was right up there and rebounded He was also up in steals I mean he had a complete game for Sav who by the way finished I believe fourth I think he had last year when you music looked at the uh conference St Johns winning it followed by Kraton and then Marquette was up there as well This year Connecticut and St Johns are going to be the class of the conference Again Texas never beating Duke in their history 0 and5 Well Sean Millers 20 against him Or not two and0 hes won two games I think hes two and two Two and two Foster trying to get in tight right over the top of THE IRON Rebounded away Sar comes out of there with it and a second chance Shot clock to six Foster again with a pull up pop Nails it Got to shoot the ball Hes got to shoot the ball Hes got scoring ability Theres no doubt about it Well that pick and roll with Cameron Boozer you have to give so much attention to Boozer that just opens it up It makes it a oneonone move over there Pope with the bounce Cody with an open look Cant cash in Yeah he was pushing off Not going to get away with that man I saw him not Well it happened to be my good eye to the right so I could see that But that a push off There was no way They got a guy right under the board I mean how are you going to get away with that His third personal Its an open side pick and roll And you got Jordan Pope trailing Codys got to block out Cameron Boozer They took away that foul under a terrific job by Foster on the pullup Theyre looking at the last foul to see if it had something extra possible flagrant with 845 to go Yeah Jay blocking out is really a lost art I dont know You guys did a great job I know you did a great job blocking out key part of that 35 and three team lost that one game to never nervous pervas Ellis They got a little contact up on the head of Patrick Gumba It wasnt a ton but this this could be upgraded Cena Trey there with the hand in the face on the push and lets see what Roger Ayes and Doug Sha and Tony Padilla come away from the monitor with had many stoppages to go to the reviews so far tonight Thats certainly been welcome Hes the first one isnt it First one Usually when they have a threeman pow afterwards its an upgrade music Triori the big from Ivory Coast at 69 Hes battled some real serious injuries music right now been fighting a left foot injury So two of the officials heading at the review the ruin on the floor has been upgraded to a flagrant one foul on red 23 Duke will be shooting two shots Theyll retain the ball on the baseline down here with 30 seconds after the free throws Thats big boy Two two free throws The basketball as wellpoint game music So a flagrant one on Lina Trayori Transfer from Xavier I think it was a good call I really do I really do Contact to the head So a flagrant one Doug Shas a further explanation And Gungba sinks that one 73 at the line a year ago Well have another one coming and the ball Hes from Virginia Played the ball at six high school Hes going to have a good year right Hes going to be very strong in that post He really be a solid contributor on daily basis offensively Well he had a lingering foot injury really slowed him down last season but that exhibition against Tennessee went off for 15 and nine If they get that kind of performance out of Gunga this season theyre going to be absolutely delighted He also had three blocks and three assists in that Tennessee exhibition You know in this game we havent seen a lot of transition either too Both clubs doing a pretty good job defensively in transition Evan short Second effort Guna and Weaver got a little over aggressive there and he commits the foul but Weaver just plays so hard He did a great contest on that shot by Evans But Duke is living at the free throw line in this second half Got to the one and one early and that means you can be aggressive Youre going to the line on every common foul and they can shoot free throws They were 20 and 20 at halftime 20 for 20 against Tennessee on the free throw line Well into this free throw by Evans They are 12 for 13 at the line in the second half to Jays point And Evans adds to that Well Ill tell you one thing When you shoot like that on the free throw line thats a major major plus So many teams Brick City USA on that free throw line Evans had a terrific game against Tennessee He had 22 Yeah he went to the free throw line eight times which really got John Sher excited when talking and he wants to get him to the foul line a lot Really drive downhill get to the basket Hes been doing that tonight but hes also been redhot outside cheering Weaver going around to back on Foster Nothing there Heres Mark up high cheering Seven to shoot it Weaver again to drive and that wont fall cheering And Duke pulls away the rebound You got a high percentage shot out of the lane Running one end It just did not go down Cam Boozer did a really good job at denial defense early on in that possession Kept Texas to one side of the floor Good pass Great pass wide open end for two Hes one of their best passers man He had six assists against Tennessee What a great look right there Pretty good when you got a big guy cheering on the perimeter who has that kind of passing skill Biggest lead tonight for Duke on an 8 nothing run as they lead it now by 1159 to 48 Take a look right here man Look at this Look right over the top of the defense Great size And its the Welo kind of pass the overhead music

like Sean Miller I mean guy just lived for basketball and was a great fundamentalist and a great skilled teacher Well Duke in this second half has really shut down not only Texas in their half court offense but theyve shut down Texas on the offensive glass And Duke has done a much better job on the glass in the second half Eight second chance points for Duke None for Texas Go to left hand That one denied Nice block by Cody Theyve also done a great job taking away the running game Theyve taken away one of the things that was emphasized a point of emphasis by Shawn Miller was we want to get up and down the floor Well theyre not getting up and down to get layups here Tough basket there by Tyson sure did How about sevenfooter with a euro step to get the contact off and finish it with the left hand What a pretty play Hes going to be special He really is I mean people are looking at him now He makes some mistakes Michael Moore on the drop step down to the post Hes going to be a special player for them Threepoint play We just saw Gungba stepping off with four fouls And the stop here with exactly seven minutes to go again Every time it looks like Duke is going to open this thing up Here come the Longhorns again with a big shot Here come the Longhorns baby Had a big one the other day in football Arch Manning showed why he was getting all that PR The last two games hes went for over 600 yards All that PR and all that money Yeah moneys no problem for that Manning family 5951 Foster with a pull off and sinks it A triple Just a mis miscommunication by Texas They just ran away from the ball Left Caleb Foster wide open Kill him has come up big here in the second half offensively Duke with a touch on that to poke it out of play So itll be Texas ball back to that miscommunication Just a little run out ball screen They thought it was a switch Everybody runs away from the ball That just gives Foster a step in three Wide open three Thought hes going to make it and he makes it Wait a minute Hope will swing it Wiltshire 6 and 12 minutes to go Theyre deciding whether they want to challenge that Looking at a replay over on the side and theyre going to Yeah they would like to do that Thats one challenge applause If he wins the challenge they give him another one dont they I keep it Yeah thats correct Thats the new rule this year brand new to mens college basketball and its going to keep a lot in terms of those guys players being challenged by Duke The out of balance call is being challenged by Duke I think theyre going to win that one Well you just cant cross over right in front of Malik Brown Hes just his hands are too good Hes too good a defensive player really He loves those oneonone moments Hes like saying Come on try and play me oneonone Come on Come on Try and play me All right Hes the king of the deflection Win this one You know who started the deflection charting them statistically to show aggressiveness UB Brown UB Brown was the guy that started using deflections and everybody started to follow Patino told me that Yubie Brown is the best clinician thats ever lived Ever lived Ever I agree with you there Jerry He did a clinic one time and theyre talking about you know going against junk defenses And he he starts talking about the Brazilian womens team and a a great player named Cortensia and what teams did against her and how they attacked it and it was masterful Well Ill tell you this a lot of people dont know this Yubie Brown coached at Duke Yubie Brown and then next to him as review the challenge is unsuccessful The ball is off of Duke Itll be Texas ball on the baseline with 15 seconds Texas loses their challenge and the 30 second timeout Yeah At one time UB Brown and Chuck Daly were assisting coaches to I guess at that time the head coach was uh Oh my god Vick Bubis Yeah No I dont think it was Vicas Vicas Just one correction there Its Duke that loses the challenge there not Texas Thats surprising So six and a half to go You see it Pope heats up here down the stretch The scoop wont roll in and Duke comes away Boozer with the rebound Texas right there for another offensive rebound opportunity They havent had many of those in the second half if at all Im surprised they havent had any transition easy layups A team thats really Oh yeah Theyll get Foster for that one Or was it actually Malik Brown for that one Thats going to be four on Brown who has three points has made a number of great defensive plays tonight but in foul trouble And those are the cheap ones Dave you dont want to pick up because thats basically it It counts as a turnover in addition to a foul And when you do that you dont get a shot up which you dont get a chance to get fouled or a chance at an offensive rebound Swain with a misfire Second chance for the Longhorns They have to have a score here Foster chasing down Pope He pulls up and fires No another rebound And into double figures in rebounding once again is Boozer Hes done that in the two exhibitions And now tonight in his very first regular season college game he has 10 Hes struggling offensively but it hasnt stopped him at all from working hard on the glass Hell get a touch to the paint and banks it up and in on a foul two Hell head to the line And zero He had zero Didnt score for the half And then hes double digits now right He is indeed Hes just so strong takes Cody into the middle and then spins right into his chest to create that space and to get to that right hand over the left shoulder Yeah he really can score in traffic with contact Hes a really good free throw shooter So the fifth Duke freshman with a double double in his debut in the last 30 seasons Thats despite an 0 for7 start in the first half Greatness always rises to the occasion cheering Wiltshire trying to dump it downstairs TRIAYORI WITH THE FOUL TOO Hell head to the line as well That was a terrific look by Wiltshire He fed the right hand He got the ball a bounce inside Just a great play and a terrific seal by Trayori to create that passing lane I think Rick Patinos watching on TV He sent me a text I think Ricks saying He learned that from me He learned that from me when he played for me Lee Brown fouling out with his personal Well that was really well done by Trayori A little bit of a continuation there which is exactly the right call and the right play but creating that space to be able to get that pass He got low and got right into the body of Malik Brown That was terrific Passionate Weve been talking about the coaching ability right here of John Sh and Sean Miller Rick Patino to me is in another world Oh yeah As a teacher motivator a whole recruiter Hes got the full package What hes done at St Johns has been unbelievably magical Ill bet Ill bet his assistants at St Johns are glad hes older now because he doesnt make the assistants wake up to play pickup in the morning Those stories were legendary Like Tubby Smith said he had to sleep in his jock one night just to get a little extra rest Also the fact that he makes them all have to be a certain weight out there work out all the time Hes a workout freak Trayori by the way with his fourth foul and Rick Patino and the Redtorm 31 wins Big East title last year Duke back to the line Boozer to shoot Hes going to like I think hes missed one free throw tonight Duke has been outstanding Well you probably done that a few times in your career No question No question Hey the time for me you know I met you Brown one of his good friends former assistant I want to send this out there A buddy of mine really close friend grew up in Jersey together and our prayers are for him Hes going through a tough tough time Richie Adamo uh Richie a basketball lifer loves the game is really in a battle Now Texas trying to cut in here with about four and a half minutes to play in Charlotte Swains had a hot hand Okatitus over the top looking for the quick strike No Treyori couldnt finish it They tried to go high low Titus inside to Treori Yeah Sean Millers staff wanted a goalend there for slapping the backboard when the ball was on the rim Can he challenge that Not if its not called It has to be called Thats perfect Under four minutes from the corner Sar swishes it in and cheering a big shot by the freshman from Italy Duke in great shape right now Up 14 Great shape Well a whistle in the paint 343 on the clock here Jake can they be as good as last years team You watch the potential of this team Thats a tall order Last years team won 35 games and five five draft picks ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by Belulk in the game since 1888 music Well Cameron Boozer has been much more active in this second half Side pick and roll open side sets a really good screen that frees up Caleb Foster for the pullup jumper And then with his vision off the little fade curl by Isaiah Evans Not enough pressure on him He can see over the top And then getting a matchup that he can drive from the right side Gets right into the body of Nick Cody for the end one 11 points in this second half 11 rebounds for the game 10 of them on the defensive end Two assists three steals and a block shot for Cameron Boozer in addition to drawing nine Texas fouls in this game Yeah bit of a matchup problem in a big way Chris you can add John Tire coming out of halftime You could feel the excitement to get on the court and for everyone to see what Cam Boozer was about to do They have this unwavering confidence in him that despite how the first half went he has the maturity to not let that linger And it was interesting watching Sh and listening to him talk about what this would do for his confidence going forward that on this big of a stage even when you dont play your best to go out and prove something in the second half Well one thing Chris that John Shier knows about Camboozer is that hes a competitor You know thats a great point and you know sometimes you have to teach a player to compete at this level but thats not something that Duke has had to teach Camboozer He brought that in A lot of freshman come in their very first year looking babyfaced He is not fitting that description Thats special when you got competitive players man Thats big time Oh yes Oh yeah I said 15 I told you 15 You did Yeah You might want to take the over on that right now 13 Huge second half The major reason that Duke leaves it 7D to 54 This is their biggest lead and the long jumper on the way That will be well short off the mark by Duru Largest lead tonight for Duke And not to forget Isaiah Evans with 21 points to lead all scorers Yeah he had 22 against Tennessee I think Foster coming out alive a little bit offensively helped them second half looking inside and a whistle 238 on the clock here in Charlotte Youre going to see Duke run a lot of offense through Cam Boozer When he touches the ball he draws attention and then hes able to find his cutting teammates because hes such a good passer Tell you what a member of the staff when I I was at a big event I had spoken at he was there Chris Carowwell very impressive And Ill tell you one thing he deserves the head coaching job But you know you got to be a little I think sometimes guys jump too quickly especially when youre at a school like Duke I mean you got to be patient and find a job thats not a deadend job where you go and you have no chance of if you want to be a head coach Well after the game Sports Center coming your way Top 10 teams in action It is that time of the year College basketball getting into full force and also a breakdown on the CFP rankings cheering as Texas comes away with the basketball Swain to the paint off the window No and a foul and a rebounding Frey against Duke And Vocatitis gets hit with 228 left Vocatitis should just grab that ball and dunked it instead He tried to tap it in Hes going to learn a lot playing for Shawn Miller He really is And hes going to get better and better and better Three on Evans He goes Miller shots coming Sean Millers had some really good success with international players as well He had Lowry Markin at Arizona Zulus Tibvelis applause Markin has turned out to a heck of an NBA player A heck of a college player too Declan Du is from Munich Germany Triayori from Ivory Coast is mentioned Okatite is from Lithuania on this unit And he mentioned early SEC had 14 teams last year So I was talking to Rick Morris He said keep an eye He really firmly believes firmly believes Arkansas is going to be terrific this year He thinks that Arkansas is going to really really be good John Calipers got a veteran team and brought a couple of good players along with him I got to tell you its been an absolute delight being with you Jay and I both consider this a great honor to be able to be here tonight for your very first Dick Vital invitational You were very emotional as we came on the air and once the game begins youre all business about the game But I love it when you get emotional I think people love to see you be the human being that you are the big heart that youve got Well I appreciate that So nice Both of you guys have treated me so well here today and and you know its nervous time for me really I come here I really dont know you know is my voice going to be strong enough Am I going to be able to do the job And it really wears on you Cancer does that to you Cancer is a vicious You go to bed at night and you think every time I was telling Jay earlier they do all these scans and youre always worried when that doctor calls In other words hes going to call you two things are going to happen One hes going to say youre cancer free Or two hes going to say cancers back and that means chemo and radiation So my heart goes out to every cancer patient out there that goes through that But just remember this my one thought I have for you Always think positive and always have faith and dont quit Dont ever give up As Jimmy V said dont give up Dont ever give up 7156 advantage Theyll run a little bit of clock here as we approach the twominute mark And Duke since 1950 has gone 68 and seven in season openers 26 straight right 26 in a row And for Xavier unfortunately I mean Xavier Im thinking of Xavier with Shawn Miller for right now Texas theyre like 10 in a row Theyve lost the top 10 teams in matchups Now Duke at the line has been so good in the second half They made 16 out of 20 as Boozer gets back to the strike You know thats deceiving Noel I say that they lost 10 in a row to top 10 teams Ill bet in all those games or most of them they were the underdog Boozer with another one coming Give you a look at the top diaper dandies Yeah these guys are special Paul was telling me all about them today man Theyre really special You might add another name on there certainly after last night Co from Arizona Mike El Brown from Louisville I mean theres so many great freshman this year Its as deep and versatile a crop of newcomers that as weve seen in a long time maybe decades Another whistle you believe even more so than last year Yeah last year was ultra strong at the top but theres more depth of outstanding talent this year Jay I want to ask you this What are your thoughts about Tom Mizo went off How hes really upset about it guys signing back into college and playing that uh and the G League Well I think what was one of the things that people are missing was was the player hes talking about thats going to Louisville was playing for the G League Ignite You know that he didnt go through the draft process He didnt declare to be a pro It was basically that thats a thats a team thats essentially like a a prep school team thats playing GLeague competition So they dont make any money It certainly cant be an age thing cuz heck theyre 26 year olds playing in college basketball Hes only 21 Its not like youre seeing GLeague guys that have gone in the draft and then coming back to college Thats not happening Yeah See I did not know that Thats a great explanation But you know what I think is going to happen Jay I really believe were going to see this happen a player going to the NBA and he finds out life in the NBA is not going the way hed like and he has eligibility in college and hes going to apply and because in the NIL because in the NIL declared eligible happened I know its happened in tennis girl made a lot of money playing but she applied want to come back to college she want to stay in the in the pro scene and she was declared eligible I mean it may happen I doubt it but it may happen but if it does You know somebodys coming back to go to college and play ball Its not the worst thing in the world Swain scooping it up That wont fall And another whistle with less than a minute to go and Duke putting this one on ice and really doing it at the foul line and on the back of Cameron Boozer in the second half I was going to ask you what does Boozer have Look at that Get those stats up Hes got 15 points 15 Oh hes making another two and get fouled But really Dukes defense in the second half was outstanding Yeah I think the big thing is I do not remember and I maybe could be wrong I do not remember a transition layup for Texas I dont think they really had one No And didnt have many offensive rebound opportunities in the second half Well guys its been great working with you I want to thank you so much Great to be with you partner And we hope for more to come as the college basketball season which is Christmas time for you is underway Yeah Id like to do at least two more games I like to do the Jimmy V classic God allows me and also do one of the ACC uh SEC challenge The slam here by Evans whos really had a tremendous night Hes going to be a big scorer for them all year He really is with the combination of giving help to play Booer Hes got some good looks on the perimeter 23 points for him 19 seconds to go Just his movement without the ball has been so good Everybody knows he can really shoot it but its not that hes a standstill shooter Hes really shown some great movement and cutting He saw an ability to drive with the ball a little bit as well and that is a big plus that will add to his game and other dimensions Now Boat Titus with the layin to give him 15 cuz as a shooter hes going to get a lot of attention But the first Dick by Tal Invitational into the books and the Duke Blue Devils with their 26th consecutive win in a season opener
