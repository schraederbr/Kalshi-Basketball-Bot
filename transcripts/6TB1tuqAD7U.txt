anyway after what he did on Wednesday night with Hall as well and no Jack Clark today for NC State hes out Kevin Keats did not seem overly concerned Mike but thats still sore not going to play today I thought that was a big lift getting him back from injuries unfortunately took a really hard spill on that shoulder I think theyre just going to be cautious with him make sure that hes healthy going in the tournament theyre going to have a little bit of a break too going into the tournament farewell regular season finale on Tuesday down the road in Durham Tyson picks went up where he left off at Little John in December and interesting with him they went a little small had more cell on him defensively Tyson was just shot right over the top some guys just have a good vibe against certain teams you like these throwback State jerseys Mike yeah I mean senior day is always you know it brings back a lot of great memories for me you know I think a lot of guys over the years have missed out on you know on that but um great great day darkell Joyner honor before the game along with three other members of the wolf pack three others have eligibility jarkel Joyner playing his last game at PNC Arena PJ Hall straight away three five zip Clemson and hed been struggling a little bit over the last two hed not been seeing a big basket for three but as hes expanded his game and that is a terrific matchup inside of him and outside with all and burns double team comes entry feed knocked Away by PJ Hall I will say too Burns probably the best passing big man out of a double team that Ive seen darkell Joyner best player in the league in the last couple weeks for sure having uh 29 Points his last two games and a good start here theres his 50th threepointer of the season Applause Paul and burns Jay with a Nifty Fade Away move yeah you know Ill say during the course of the season the teams get off to a sluggish start at noon but both of these teams warmed up very well charkels been the best player in the ACC if not for the injury when you think about PJ Hall over the past month hes been as good as anybody too and DJ Burns has been scoring 18 points a game no good for Marcel and his first outside shot today here comes Chase Hunter Tyson to the corner Galloway sticks the three and the Clemson Tigers are in front 103 early this is the thing Brad Brownell was you know he talked about we dont really want to control the pace but we want to try to get up selectively run get some early shots in the shot clock turquavion Smith hes over two Packers meanwhile oh uh four for four two for two from Deep Im looking to add to the lead DJ this match with Marcel kicks it to Hunter wide open and the first Clemson Miss had a good look you talked about the mismatch there was the double team and uh Hunter was wide open it was only a matter of time before he and sheflin got his hands on another offensive rebound tie up goes to NC State but shefflin gave the Tigers such a jolt of energy early in that game think about the first possession against the orange they got four chances missed three shots finally hit a three and it was a story of the night against the orange well the thing for him yeah 10 points eight rebounds six assists hes a terrific passing frontline player doesnt turn the ball over either Smith to Marcel you know Casey Marcel wants to you know although the crowd was Channing one more year when he came out for his senior award but uh he hes a huge part when hes knocking down three hes a big weapon speaking of knocking down threes Chase Hunter has six points two triples for Chase in the games first four minutes last three seven of 14 from behind the arc Joyner off the front rim rebound tip by Burns controlled by Hunter oh look Clemson hit shots early against Syracuse and theyre hitting shots early again today in Raleigh technical foul on Kevin Keats to add to the possible fourpoint play for Brevin Galloway and theyre gonna you know usually you make your point with the technical Kevin Keats still drawing at the referee and hes having to be assisted back to the bench heres the look I mean Clemson is just on fire Applause David Smith is trying to calm his coach down this is getting close to a second technical which I havent seen in a long time Evan especially four minutes into the ball game yeah I mean Applause Applause so Tyson will be able to build on this lead a little bit wow just an explicit exceptional start for the Tigers Applause this team hit a little right I mean I mean they were they were the class of the league in the first 10 games of the season a question Jeff Anderson Jeb Hartness Lamar Simpson three officials presiding this afternoon Tyson knocks down the two now Hunter already hit a three Applause and now our bigger partner was Galloway who hit the three and now Galloway has a chance to make this a six point play Applause six Applause nine straight for the Tigers well you know you were you were asking and you thought how this game was officiated its going to play a big role in this game especially with a guy like DJ Burns inside yeah lets see how the whistle goes after that technical I thought really the key was Burns and Hall whichever one could not get in foul trouble shot clock winding down Smith beats the buzzer right and they found these great swing Clemson is coming with a late double team on burns theyre coming big NC State did a nice job of playing out of the double team and getting a look at the three second straight game that the wolf pack had had to deal with their opponent making shots early as they get the reachin foul on the wall pack think about it on Wednesday Wake Forest started 10 of 11 right now the tigers are six of seven and the visitors from South Carolina with an early 10point lead on and they built it and from behind the threepoint line four of five in the game so far three different guys have hit threes and you know against Syracuse half of their field goal attempts were threes but against that zone it makes sense but theyre getting pretty good looks against Statesman Reverend Galloway is losing count its been so hot early Tigers four for five from Beyond The Arc overall of course they got 28 assists on Wednesday against the orange the most assists in an ACC game since 1987 you know also you watch Clemson in their pregame warmup they work on passing more than any team that Ive ever seen and it certainly shows up in how they protect the ball both of these teams do a great job of taking care of the ball reaching foul before the break was on NC States Greg gants first play off the bench for RJ Godfrey he lost it but then the Tigers recover inside and BJ hall now has seven first half points Applause uh PJ Hall hes just playing a different level really was slowed by injury early on in the season in Rhythm terrion Smith halfway down but popped out and I think I think settles for long threes two are too easy especially in this game you want to try to get something going to the rim like this no foul no points thats a big thing for burns too hes has trouble staying on the floor with foul trouble heres what you want to see from T yeah no I mean you know youre not seeing a big basket get through the rim he threat for a guy like him he does not get to the freethrow line that much and uh Nancy State lost that battle against Clemson in the in the first game last six games in particular only nine total free throws for Smith averaged about five free throw temps per game before that Paul misses the freethrow jumper and here comes Joyner the Ole Miss transfer electric speed sets up Burns fouls going on Clemson they got Galloway on the blockout before we go too much further lets get you a look at our Ford keys to the game what you got today Gmail Brian Brownell talked about they really want to dominate the paint to outscore NC State their state two and five when theyre outscored inside and for the wolf pack scoring transition they did not have a fast break point in the loss down a little Drive season low the fast break department is one of the best Pace teams in the ACC DJ Burns for two but hes so good on that right block when he can come to his left hand in the lane its just you know youre not going to block that shot he keeps you off balance with that body contact fall takes it takes it makes it lets see hes making Burns play pay on the uh on that match up down the other end Hall trying to force him outside and the more shots he makes out there and burns is going to have to commit to guarding him PJ Hall and double figures already 14th time in the last 15 games in and out for Joyner from the corner well you know Ill tell you whatever weve weve seen some explosive backcourts all around the conference this year there have been some terrific matchups but uh Smith and Joyner right up there at the top Paul just working DJ Burns at this end of the floor inside in outside hes also got the quickness Advantage he faced up that time that puts a lot of pressure on the defender 26 points and seven and a half minutes for Clemson on the road here at NC State now wake had a big first half on Wednesday two and the Wolf Pack still won relatively comfortably 9074 on the final buzzer blue Braden Smith got a little antsy that time can be a very high volume shooter to get his numbers two of six to start the game Galloway oh Zips it inside tough catch and Godfrey finishes at The Rim timeout NC State largest lead yet for the Clemson Tigers PJ has got a dozen in the first eight minutes tigers in control ACC basketball is brought to you by Toyota Lets Go Places and by CPI Security CPI home security that protects what matters most Wednesday night was incredibly special here at PNC Arena as the 1983 national champions were honored here in Raleigh the Valvano Legend Continues to grow it was an incredible night and just an incredible run that started in the ACC tournament that they half wind to get into the tournament and then that whole run and then you know this such Houston was such a prohibitive favorite to win that game and it had to be in the 50s and it was and uh just an incredible last sequence think about that run they beat Ralph Sampson twice they beat obviously Hakeem Olajuwon I mean all the great players that Sydney Lowe and Derek Wittenberg thurl Bailey Lorenzo Charles Terry Gannon Kozel McQueen whos sitting right behind us here today how did we get a better seat than him right as well they gave us microphones turquion Smith off the class no good battling in the traffic still loose Dylan Hunter got both hands on the ball first and he got it to Godfrey Here Comes Clemson with numbers Ill tell you Clemson right now running their offense to Perfection getting just about anything they want that was the first sloppy play theyve had right on qg man and they take it right back Galloway picks the pocket down missing out his first turnover of the game for Clemson and NC State turns you over more than anybody else oh my goodness Griffin Galloway hes three for three from Deep hes got 10 in the game and its a 10nothing run 3113 are you kidding me DJ Burns a chance to carve into the deficit going the line and uh actually Clemson has changed the way theyre guarding him theyre not sending a double team especially on that side good recognition theyre you know we saw that we thought wed see middle Brooks a lot in this game its five extra fouls and a big body they can put out there but Burns in that isolation is really tough but uh Clemson edelbrooks picks up his first DJ Burns fouled out struggled just uh 19 minutes in that first game he was called for a couple charges in that game no hes been called for four charges in NC States 18 ACC games two of them were that day little John but hes in much better shape at this point in the season second Tigers turnover theres Jack Clark who was injured back in December against Clemson and then uh had the scary fall off the rim against Wake Forest the second half on Wednesday but he came back and really didnt miss a beat and I just for uh for NC State I hope he gets healthy and gets ready for the ACC tournament because hes going to give this team a big lift hes a good player he could swing a game in March big you know good on the refund on the glass score of the basketball Joyner thought about it for a while comes up short rebounded by middle Brooks who had 107 rebounds in the game against NC State late December Galloway to Middle Brooks foul is going on Ernest Ross talk about guys who gave in Middlebrooks a nice contribution in the first game they have an 18 only 18 minutes on the floor but 10 points for him in that game seven rebounds you look at his last five games Mike his last five games for Clemson hes got 17 points 15 rebounds 16 fouls and thats in 50 minutes well he would have fouled out three times in one game but you know hey and thats thats his role and you know you dont you dont he doesnt want to go to the bench with four fouls remaining Applause part of this Clemsons team Clemsons personality a grit The Pride with which they play 3315 after the middle Brooks Two at the line Music tigers 1115 from the floor six of seven from three theyre out rebounding NC State 123 and I think really good balance in their shot selection too inside and outside Smith and keep him in the half court its what you want and misses two shots in that possession the first offensive rebound of the game for the wolf pack but the NC State Long Range shots not falling right now Packer three of ten from Beyond The Arc getting terrible but when the other team six for seven Beetle into traffic finds Godfrey shot clock winding down four to shoot Galloway takes it Here Comes Smith that was late recognition of the shot clock Applause chin going on Galloway Ill be number one on Brevin Applause third team foul on the Tigers shefflin and Chase Hunter coming back in class since Im theyre on Pace for about 130 points right now Applause I dont think theyre gonna get there but it would sure be fun if they did and this you know they can they can put points up in the board for sure but they are a more explosive team in Little John than they have been on the road we heard Brad Brown out talking about how hard NC State is to play against defensively Applause Beetle went down and Clemson gets a stop anyway Dylan Hunter diving on the floor for the loose ball not a lot of offense inside now with burns out of the game Clemson can really lock in on the perimeter players that ball is just hanging around much like it was on Wednesday against Syracuse missed three but last touchdown of bounds off NC State yeah but as you know in different theyre still getting a ton of Threes but uh you know against that Syracuse Zone they got some nice looks out of the perimeter especially uh Chase Hunter is 12 612 in the game Tigers never trailed on Wednesday led by as many as 25 Hunter Tyson right back to work Off the Bench its just too easy that time that was underneath out of bounds one pass to a relatively open jump shot think of the lead as the Tigers have had yet charquel Joyner with his second field goal now gets it back to a 17 game but you know what Evan so far in this game everything has been in the half court for NC State theyve gotten nothing out in the Run Applause discrepancy right now between the Stadium scoreboard and the official stat broadcast whether its 3417 or 3517 oh Greg Gantt slams it in I just you know I just Craig Grants season has been so impressive to me 10 dnps early in the year that has started the last 14 games kept himself ready because the injury the horse and Clark both out that opened up time for him yeah hes been a great piece but what about PJ Hall 14 now for BJ here in the half well pack cant answer shefflin grabs his first rebound of the day Beetle bursting down the floor no whistle wont pack the other way Joyner pulls up puts it in its a big swing right there Mike yeah and uh no foul called on the other end and then she stayed turns him in points but Brad Barnell walks a little timeout right now all NC State have trailed by as many as 19 but big plays like this from Greg Gann helping to bring the wolf back back I gotta figure out a way to slow down PJ Hall missing an outstanding game already in this half theyre having 14 points six of eight shooting hes hit a couple of Threes as well playing inside and outside when hes knocking down threes he is a very tough cover Tigers leading scorer in ACC play at 17 and a half points per game hes had at least nine in every game since scoring just four against NC State on December 30th these are zMAX Max performance six of eight from the floor they finally did get this scoring discrepancy sorted out it is 3722 so you said 12 point game its a 15point lead for the Tigers and uh yeah it feels like NC state has the momentum for PJ Hall you know by averaging over 20 points a game in his last five so hes rounding into shape and in a you know at a good time for them I just said you know I cant overstate what shefflin has meant to this group as well too and then how he plays his role a good passer really thats his whatever offense he gets come to him he plays well the team plays well yeah interesting too NC State is really committed and uh wow another foul and a three yeah and Kevin Keats his facial expression tells you how he feels he had to turn around that time and of course he got that early technical but uh you see right here and this is a guy you know yeah you see the touch right there you just have to go up and challenge the shot not bail Galloway out number two on turquion Smith both on Clemson threepointers you know heres a guy in Galloway shooting 30 percent from three but 85 from the line so its really a gift putting them there I was talking about how NC State is defending um Tyson theyre going small on him they really want to take away his outside game Whats going to be left for him or some postups opportunities three more at the line for Galloway the Elder Statesman of the current ACC 25 years old one of nine players across division one basketball start of the Season hes 25 well celebrate a win by going to rent a car well and uh for Craven Smith trying to find some Rhythm but hes doing it from Way Beyond the threepoint line not having some success two of 10 now Hunter Tyson well contested on the three by Thomas Applause foreign ER has a couple buckets as does DJ Burns they didnt really feel like theyve gotten Burns going yet but you know I mean the guy who normally would be Smith to get you going but um I think the way that joyners been playing hes the one thats going to have to be the catalyst Applause burns down two for four Chaplin gives it a hunter over to Galloway Australian Smith playing with the two fouls and Galloway just bolted right past him Kevin Keith wants another timeout 20point lead for Clemson always got 15 PJ Halls caught 14 those two combined outscore in the wolf pack by seven no help behind defensively Greg Gantt took a wave at the ball but that just that was an easy straight line drive in the half court this feels a little bit like what NC State did to Duke on this court but obviously the other way around and that that game was very much a catalyst for NC State to this point in the season they were one in three you know we talked to Kevin Keats before the game theyre one and three going into that game had already lost at home to Pitt and he phrased that as a must win early in the year Music when you remember that game against Pittsburgh I mean no one at that time knew exactly what Jeff capels team was going to be 52 left in the first half when we get to the Toyota halftime report well break down the entire ACC tournament by situation well hear from Kevin Keats first half highlights and stats on a huge day of ACC basketball all four of the big four are at home today yeah and thats um the bottom six is pretty much decided for the tournament and theres Burns and what he does and that when hes on that side of the floor more times than not hes going to turn back to the Baseline is getting a little testy another Temple or two yeah it might have been they might have called offsetting technicals that time you know Evan I you know I was Ive seen more technical fouls this year especially against players then I can remember in recent memory and see no double team Burns is a load down there turning inside PJ Hall not much he could do Applause Gant and Tyson who are chirping back and forth and then DJ is like let me be a peacekeeper you know I was watching that last time out that Kevin keeps called Burns was really upset and animated in that trying to get his team offsetting technicals that time so no no free throws as a result the thing is its a personal foul and Hunter Tyson and a personal foul on Greg pants thats two on Gant one on Tyson checkers DJ over the last eight games nearly 19 points per game has hit leading the ACC and field goal percentage in conference play this thing is just staying on the floor staying out of foul trouble hes gotten in better shape as the seasons going along hes a terrific passer Id like to see his rebounding numbers a little bit better than they are but offensively he is really solid Middlebrooks picked up the personal foul before the double technicals so Middlebrook now with two hes back on the bench tough shot Hunter cant finish here comes state Casey Marcel traveled before the shot and again I mean that was an opportunity for state to get something out on the floor on the Run Marcel decided to rise up for the three but didnt have his feet set Applause three back into the game Watch a hunter Landing awkwardly here well and there was there was contact too when he was coming down not a foul but it caused him to land awkwardly he looks okay though sure does although he turns it over Ross intercepts the kickout pass thank you Joiner three for five from the floor Burns also three of five so far kind of back down hall Lefty fade away rebounded for PJ Hall so when he goes to that lefthanded hook on that side of the floors to the Baseline and its usually farther out than when hes working on the other side into the lane how much tougher of a shot is that very tough for you you know youve got to be almost perfect great Hustle by Casey Marcel shot clock didnt reset Clemson has it with four Chase Hunter nope Burns has the rebound with a chance for NC State here to claw their way back in Clemsons gone cold from the floor feels like were just kind of waiting for the wolf pack to hit a big shot and reenergize this capacity crowd four minutes left in the half Joyner puts it up connect Ross on the glass for NC State back outside Burns has not made a three in his college career passes up the attempts Applause Music Applause that burns has been called against the tigers for this year and what happened there the reason that happens Hall pushed him out he received way outside the lane he had to take extra dribbles to get inside well here it is Evan and you can see it right there and the little pushup with the left hand easy call man still like it place its the only time in 69 years in the ACC that Clemson has finished first and look they are just a game out of first place in the Lost column right now behind Miami Virginia and Pitt uh you know my Miami sir theyve got their Destiny in their own hands theyve been theyre undefeated at home theyve got two home games left Applause whistle it was before the shot on Miami 144 still a lot there to be decided especially with Duke you know North Carolina has got a huge game tonight against Virginia coming up um they uh they won on Wednesday in South Bend but they didnt look great doing it Applause how about uh Clemson and NC State picked 10th and 11th in the preseason poll they sit here fourth and fifth early February well I you know I I really dont have much use for those preseason polls and uh you know who had picked up in that top four before the season Ill answer that question nobody Applause I had a couple of lean years but theyve bounced back in a big way the last two and theyre good deep different excellent but one of the better backboards you know I really think that Clemson now looks like theyre going to live with Burns playing twopoint basketball theyre going to stay at home at everybody else and theyll theyre going to let PJ Hall just kind of operate oneonone down there for the pack arent shooting the ball great today 286 from three Hunter Tyson finds his spot and rattles into three well you know what and you know you talk to the Clemson people and and uh you know I watched Hunter Tyson he doesnt create his own shot really well but that was nice use of the punt fade and referees had enough with this PJ Hall is going to get the get the foul Music heres the look you got to stay down theyre guarding him small theres no way more cells going to block that shot but he went flying by and that gave Tyson a great look look when Clemsons been good this year they just look so in control and so purposeful with the offensive end and you think back to last Saturday sorry the Clemson fans were bringing it up but you know Brad Brownell says they looked a little panicky on offensive times when things werent going well okay well hey you know to get the get things turned around right now at this time the last week only in the last week fans want more of this matchup DJ over PJ hes going to score but you know I and he has had he had a big game at Wake Forest had 31 points in that ball game he was Unstoppable and he had a few big assists when the Deeks did double down on him at the Joel but you know I dont think that Brad Barnell will change defensively Brandon Callaway knocks down the eighth three of the half for the Clemson Tigers when theyre knocking down threes on that end theyre going to live with burns on the other end and until they cut into the lead theyre gonna theyll keep the same defense on fur back to the matchup not this time for burns as Hall gets the rebound Applause Reverend Galloway Mike has 20 points on six field goal attempts in this straight line drives although a really nice man on man defensive play by Thomas Dylan Hunter committed the foul after it was stolen away so Ill tell you what older brother comes in again this is one of the better games offensively on the road that Ive seen this year and then lets not take away also from Clemsons defense holding the wolf back to 29 Points right now racking my brain to think about other great scoring performances I mean Wake Forest is pretty good in the first half here on Wednesday didnt last the front end of the one and one and Clemson has it back and I think back to December NC State lost down at Miami didnt you have that game they were great in the first half too yeah I know so you can get it back Courts going at one another yes indeed poked Away by Thomas from behind well as a big man how have you felt about the historic Trope that guards win in March well as a big man when I played there were other big men and the game was completely different you know now with the threepoint line of course you know we didnt there was no threepoint shot back then so theres a whole different Dynamic and mindset to offenses DJ Hall does it again look right at 11 AM well you were asking about oldfashioned basketball we just saw it right there throw it into the post pump fake little jump hook oldfashioned threepoint play theyve had a couple of instances Ive been worth first pass in and underneath out of bounds has resulted in a basket first Miss free throw for Clemson although was it a lane violation Applause officials are going to converse for the moment Clemsons 10 of 11 from the line I think it was an inadvertent whistle get out Mike I I pulled up to PNC Arena this morning around 9 45 am there were already several hundred fans lined up at the gates more than two hours before the game and then when the students were LED in the building around 11 AM they were charging in heckling the Tigers trying to get in their heads I say Clemson has weathered the storm well and but also too to your point I mean NC state has earned the support of their fan base this year having a terrific season yeah dont dont make any mistake I admire the passion of these wolf pack fans the only yeah the only home game they lost was that game to pit right right out of the shoot and the ACC regular season early December 151 at home this year theyve won eight straight ACC home games you can hit there down by 23 against the Clemson Tigers who somehow lost at the Yum Center last Saturday still hard to believe thats college basketball for you clock winding down Beatles puts it in Applause 54 in the half for the Tigers Joyner to beat the buzzer no sir and the highest scoring first half of the season for Clemson comes on the road and a sold out PNC Arena in Raleigh that is as dominant at halftime as Ive seen by a team I mean if Clemson was just running with it at will and then breaking guys down off the dribble beat up Duke hes had a game already in the first 20 Mike who do you thinks more likely to get to 30 Galloway whos got 20 now or Hall whos got 16 oh my big little haul and uh this is what in Clemson starting off with the miscue and cant unable to capitalize initially fights to get it back surrounded by Tiger tiger he lost the ball even with that turnover it was out front that NC state has not been able to capitalize on in this game and uh like you know we talked to him talked about it halftime NC State trying to pressure the ball up the floor a little bit get Clemson out of some rhythm in the half court DJ Halls comfortable take it himself backing down burns with a left hand off the glass wow he gave to TJ Burns a left hand back at him from the same side of the floor really nothing happened on that play other than giving him the ball and letting him go to Work Burns ask DJ passed over 1500 points in his career earlier today PJs closing in on a thousand meanwhile burns his turn and with a left hand 13 for DJ Applause say it was fun watching DJ Burns walk out of the tunnel when the fans were in the building Applause his word lightly he strutted onto the court with getting the fan support Chef Lynn oh somehow gets it to go they said offense from him is a bonus but uh this its just two clear outs that Clemson has had in the first two possessions this is like the AllStar Game Tatum and brown going oneonone its a blocking foul this time on Hall PJs got a grin on his face PJ Hall trying to buy another offensive foul right there there you see right there theyre going to let Hall do his thing and that was a terrific move with his off hand this is a little throwback basketball here throwing the ball into the post and then Ian shefflin talked about him hes been such a big part great passer this is what basketball looks like when you dont double team dont switch well thats a big transaction to get to get PJ Hall out of the game right now just a second foul Middlebrooks had two in the first half hes gone burns down yeah but as much as theyve been going to Burns he wanted to get PJ Hall a rest Middlebrooks are going to get called for the hands on the back but thats you know thats fine I mean thats middle Brooks has got fouls to burn out there hes going to give him some time for PJ Hall on the bench hes running out of those fouls to bird Mike hes got three personals and two three five minutes of game time two left brother two left Applause can you make it real simple for me I mean whats the key for NCs date getting back into this game they got to get out and theyve got to score off uh off of turnovers and transition I mean theyre theyve shown in this game they will let Burns do that in the half court they want to keep trevian Smith under control and try to limit uh Joiner as well Galloway fouled by Smith I think its the third personal foul on turquian two in the first half were on threepoint Shooters and you know when and Galloway thats a smart thing hey just go right at him hes been able to get to the rim off the bounce Ill tell you as good as turquavion Smith has been at times and I dont think theres any doubt hes a little bit of a rut right now NC state has played some really good basketball this year at times when Smith has been on the bench with foul trouble well and you know having Joyner out there really and you know Marcel has been able to step up in that situation but you know for for Smith you know again he has to maybe worry about the offensive foul but he needs to attack the basket now hes just hes not seeing a big rim from the outside 27point lead for Clemson TJ Burns has scored the last 11 points for the NC State Wolfpack Applause El Joyner no ball movement no player movement that time is this the really disjointed possession one shot done Middlebrook strapped the pivot foot Galloway gets to the spot again and scores right now 24 points for Brethren Galloway his season high was 17 against Duke hes closing in on his career high but she has a member of college at Charleston Applause two and a half years ago Applause the thing you know again for NC State to stop the clock into the freethrow line but theyve had no answer for Galloway defensively fourth foul on middle Brooks told you hes running out and the thing too you know with with Smith with the three fouls now theyre you know its going to put pressure on Joyner to try to defend Galloway so theyre going to go at him but you know this is the way for for at least the foreseeable future NC State needs to score at the freethrow line you see the numbers that uh jarpel Joyner had in the first game against Clemson two of 11 Music thats the thing he said he he hasnt really gotten into this game hes only got seven in field goal the temps so far Applause NC state has not attempted a three the first three minutes of the second half but theyll get the ball back here the sixth tiger turnover offensive foul on that play on Galloway number two on Revan Applause you know theres 17 minutes to go the crowd a little uneasy right now though Evan down 27 yeah senior day when theyve won eight straight ACC home games and its going to be very tough for them to get back in this game in the half court although that helps that does another chance for a threepoint play for DJ Burns well now this is the third guy theyve thrown at Burns theyve got shefflin now guarding him and just so we talked about it so tough and I you know I dont know if if things will change in uh going down and double teaming him and trying to keep him calm down Applause get it wolf pack havent had many free throw attempts but theyve missed half of their six tries Applause a lot of dribbling here from Chase Hunter working on jarkel Joyner number one versus number one and Hunter paints it in and I dont know you know thats not Clemsons game per se but uh you know I think with Galloway you got to give him a little latitude this afternoon Evan wow wow wow yes sir Applause birds outside for Joyner sharkell now two of six from Deep out of bounds to Clemson and well get ourselves a timeout its a 25point lead at the half Tigers stretch it out to 29 its now 27 Applause League entering today pits the two seed theyve got the tiebreaker courtesy of their win against Virginia early in the season the first real full court pressure that NC state has put on or the chance to try to steal the ball shorten the shot clock pretty cool day of Hoops on Tobacco Road you know tonight Carolina plays in Chapel Hill at six wake plays at Winston at seven Duke plays at Cameron at eight Chase Hunter will get two more free throws here for the Tigers foreign trying to get to 135 today theyve got Virginia and Notre Dame in the final week of their regular season foul was caught on DJ burns his seconds a two on DJ as we pause for this message from Coyote Tractor from our experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you gotta have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo you know its funny youve talked about Hunter Tyson and being the you know right in there with Player of the Year honors and he has been almost an afterthought today and they does have seven rebounds but nine points hasnt taken many shots Applause its key to get back into this game and theyre going to need to make some threes theyve got five of them already thats the first here in the second half you know for Clemson they just have to lock in from behind the arc and limit those shots theyll theyll take twopoint baskets Galloway 24 points already sets up Chase Hunter bottoms you know normally there might be a drop off and shooting eclipse and its perfect so far in this app theyre five for five they begin the first half six for seven and before the shot Lin picks up a second nine of 15 from Beyond The Arc now the Clemson Tigers that dark Hill Joyner just a little late getting out in the hand right now and at the hot shooting contagious right up and down the lineup and look there theyve won 12 ACC games already that uh is a program record they previously won 11 games twice a win today would improve the Tigers to five and four and ACC Road games yeah no guarantee them at least 500 away from home which is where you want to start with Applause loose ball still Marcel comes up with it rejected but a foul wow big block from Hunter that was a that was great reaction for him in uh Marcel gets this because he attacks the rim goodness that was just two guys meeting right at the top of the mountain two little guys yeah right six three versus six three and a half Chase Hunters listed at six three and a half you know right now if youre NC State you cant look at the at the score per se you got to take this game in four minute increments at this point if you cant get a stop does it matter no and try to you just try to win each of those each of those battles and make this sort of manageable in the last four minutes of the game two points now for Casey Marcel full court pressure and the head of the Zone press and Clemson gets it across the 21 of the timer Beetle Hunter Tyson Galloway and shefflin three uh three guards out there with this pressure to help break that Applause number one on Casey good thing though its only the third team foul and for NC State theyre in the bonus right now so theyre going to be shooting free throws for the rest of the this half true looking back door hunter lost him recovered and will take some more time off the clock there was nobody there on that layup Applause EJ Hall standing up on the Tigers bench a hunter missed the three another offensive rebound for shefflin you heard Brad Brownell say bring it out and he would want to do some clock management at this point Beetle slithers through the crowd lost it just like Hunter did and this time its NC State basketball two layup opportunities that they let go by so an opportunity to get something missed there for NC State lets see if they can capitalize at Brown House in their 20th win of the year on Wednesday the third time in the past six years with 20 wins for Clemson mens basketball thank you legal out there for defensive purposes to match up against Marcel and hes quick so is this guy dark Cal Joyner but you know what theyre doing a good job keeping them in front Smith theres no driving lane NC State needs some more of that huge huge shot his body language changed immediately when the ball went in oh foul called pass was intercepted Kevin Keats disapproves I think its going to be his fourth foul foreignette was right after he makes a big jump shot and hes going to have to come out of the game thank you heres the look I mean that was deep he looked fired up after that play and then he picks up his fourth foul they call this one on Ross for 15 foul Applause shot clock will go back to 30 a bigger card and Ill keep it at 22 no but they put it back Applause youre Kevin Keats you know that game up almost to the Carrier Dome up at the TMA Wireless Dome was one that they felt like they had taken away from him obviously the officiating is not the story of the day the Clemson Tigers are but any missed calls are frustrating especially when youre trying to build a comeback in shocks like that are going in for Hunter Tyson are you kidding me I said hes been the third option in this game but thats a pretty good option to look back on and that was a tough three under duress 127 rebounds for Tyson who comes to help and burns just sneaks by him for two DJs nine for 14 19 points Chase Hunter missed it slam follow PJ Hall another 20point game for the Junior from Spartanburg you know NC State was looking at the driver nobody put a body on Hall here we go again and two hands on the back of DJ Burns PJ picks up his third third DJ will shoot one bad shooting from the Clemson Tigers Mike they are 10 for 17 from Deep yeah and it was eight of 14 first half two of three second half so they picked right up there and the thing is you know a team if youre heavy if theyre half their physical attempts or threes normally not getting to the line but theyre 1315 at the freethrow line as well so just balance all over the place from this teams offense four different tigers have multiple threes in the game Galloway with four two a piece for Hunter Tyson and Hall the ninth time this season 29 games that Clemsons made at least 10 threes in season high is 14 they hit 14 against Towson and a big win over a strong CAA team in December and they had 14 threes on Wednesday night against the orange and its been its been the four guys who basically have all their points in Hunter and Tyson Galloway and PJ Hall the rest of the teams got eight points Applause Burns missed the front end of a one and one and Ernest Ross fouls Hunter Tyson in the rebound action thats the sixth NC State team foul boy just uh two empty free throws that can ill afford at this point you know Barnes not great at the freethrow line at 64 percent surprising with the with the good touch that he has on his shot but now its got to be an allout Blitz for NC State try to get some turnovers on the jailbreak Blitz and you dont get there you can give up some open layups heres Tyson missed the three burns the block out on shefflin Applause Smith on the bench with four fouls which means darkell Joyner has the offensive car keys and you can really lock in on him which that means you know they play off of each other really well but uh you know with Smith out of the game you can focus on Joyner Music Applause shefflin straight away if he made that one just call again he was four of 19 on the year going in turns now with 21 his third 20point game of the season all in ACC play Galloway to the basket he missed it wow his easiest shot all afternoon great point too easy and its its still way early for this Clemson team to go into their Victory Trot good Dig Down defense there from Chase Hunter numbers for Clemson all the way goes Dylan Hunter theyre playing NC State basketball here and theyre breaking that pressure and then instead of just being satisfied with that theyre attacking the rim Applause fourth quarter of this basketball game even these possessions were you know Burns right there they missed the shot its taking a lot of time off the clock you know throwing the ball in to him and all alone and shefflin timeout state Kevin Keats may not want to watch the rest of this game Applause Im not sure anybody anywhere this coming presented by Defender full court pressure for NC State leading to some breakout opportunities for the Tigers and I like that Evan you know just be aggressive attacking the rim we talked about not settling for just breaking the front part of it has been wide open on the other side of it a little signature on this game Applause Clemson won by 14 over NC State on December 30th theyre up by 28 right now Smith backed in the game with four fouls as what are you saving him for no its all hits on Deck Joyner in and out Marcel tracks the rebound s have three of 13 excuse me hes three of eleven Smith three of 13 theres the eighth NC State turnover and when you when you hold that backcourt to six and 24 combined youre going to win a lot of games against North Carolina state it goes in for Hunter putting him in double figures the fourth tiger of the day in double digits as the lead grows to 30 for the first time well you know Smith had to get out of the way there were if people bottled up inside there was no help behind on that Mike this the only ACC game in the noon window today we thought wed have a thrilling battle down to the wire between two teams battling for that fourth place position which is so key and it has been all tigers from the start they LED 103 219 3413 7949 ooh shefflin thought he had all ball instead Joyner will get to the line number three on Chaplin 8 48 to play and we encourage you to stick around for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer it is coming up in just a bit here in the second half you know a lot of times on the road too you know a team will get out to a great start Clemson really was warmed up exploded out of the gate and you know teams will take a standing eight count and kind of fight back in but Clemson really grabbed a hold of this game and theyve never let go yeah Im with you I I certainly felt through the middle ladder portions of the first half that we would see a counter punch from NC State theyd have a you know 6090 120 run at some point to get back into the game and the question would be could they get over the hump but with nine minutes to go I dont really feel that coming especially you know with Joyner with backtoback 29 point games for him uh you know as explosive as his team can be and uh how many friendly bounces have they got yeah and Ill tell you this Clemson team is a tough one to press too and they take really good care of the basketball they had good ball handlers out on the floor one of the reasons theyll be dangerous both in Greensboro and in the big dance if they can get there and theyve theyve expanded their game their lead with Hall on the on the sideline you know hes been their second best scorer in this game and has not been a part of this 30point lead Clemson was number 76 in the net rankings coming into today three and three verse quad one but the bad losses are what really stings the Tigers resume now you look at NC State theyre 36th and then theyre three and four against quad one teams but the wolf pack 150 against quads three and four whereas Clemsons 144 against quads three and four and look that the net has received plenty of deserved scrutiny and its not a perfect metric by any means listening to Steve Forbes vent about it after the game here on Wednesday night yeah hes like they dont pay me to win by 10 they pay me to win by one yeah and also winning against the team can make you drop yeah in the net depending on who you beat Music a metrics and its a trick and generally you went on the road you go up you went on the road against a good team by a big number you go up do you know what this does for the Tigers today to me I think the more metrics you bring in the muddier it gets and you know if you have basketball people making those decisions you can get the 68 teams right and I you know this Clemson team is is a tournament team and this NC State team this this performance notwithstanding this in NCAA tournament team and yet the narrative exists that the accs not getting what it wants the conference certainly has much talented teams including these two Clemson looking worthy today its now time for todays fast break presented by your local Ford dealer lets quickly talk about the second game of our doubleheader GMan rematch between the Louisville Cardinals and the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets earlier this month it was Kenny Paynes first ACC win at home and today Josh fastner looks for revenge in the yellow jackets in Atlanta yeah I was at that game and a huge exhale after that was over with uh but Louisville played really well in that game and theyve got a very explosive backcourt LL Ellis has been fabulous all year long Mike James I think is really going to be a great player for this team going forward L Ellis actually leads the ACC in 20 Matthew well hes actually been quiet only four points but pretty good 20 in the first half and just I mean youre talking about those numbers six of eight from the field four or five and three eight of eight from the line scoring on all levels really has been able to get to a rim when hes wanted to uh just the terrific individual performance by him is 127th college game Charleston to BC now homecoming the Anderson South Carolina native playing his final year for the Tigers stepped out of bounds in that kind of day for Kevin Keats his club and not you know that being said it was only the ninth turnover of the game so not terrible from that standpoint you know they have as many they actually have more field goal attempts than Clemson does in this game and now youll see like that time you know the Galloway could have been aggressive and they could have attacked the rim but theyre going to try to burn some clock at this point Applause Chaplin to Dylan Hunter foul from Greg Gantt but a clean common foul and two free throws coming for Hunter and thats what shefflin brings to the floor when they get the ball to him in the middle he makes great decisions I mean Evan hes almost got a two to one assist to turn over ratio and thats good for your point guard to have a frontline player have that is fabulous theyre gonna take a look here see if there was a you know if its going to rise to a flagrant one thats just frustration coming out just you see everybody converged in the middle Gan has a lot of room to make up if anything it was it was the first it was the left arm that kind of came through it in the head his right arm really didnt hit anything Applause I just you know dont get it anymore because sometimes thats a flagrant foul sometimes its not well and this uh this game got chippy early and uh you know Kevin Keiths getting hit with that Technical and he was he was more upset after that call was made Applause take a look at our Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina upcoming schedule especially if they dont show any fight in the final seven minutes today or not enough fight to get back in the game this is a huge well they really him or Duke here you know for a great win to turn their season around itll be different Cameron well and yeah and maybe two the the Jack Clark gets some extra time to get healthy before the ACC tournament after Tuesday obviously the wolf pack will have seven eight nine days off depending on where they fall Clemson at Virginia on Tuesday and then Notre Dame whos in WinstonSalem today hosts the tigers or I should say the Tigers host them on March 4th again they did upgrade that foul to a flagrant one and thats just pure frustration by Greg Gantt Kevin Keats in disbelief said hes asking a question been a frustrating day for Keith Im with you Kevin Im with you on this particular call Applause this call is not to be the difference in the game uh situations like this I think back to the well theres free chicken on the line hang on they got bacon in Blacksburg earlier this week whether it be Chicken in Raleigh sorry folks pay for your chicken nothing going well for the home crowd this afternoon Applause but uh wow 82 points on the road with seven minutes to go Clemson shooting 62 percent from the floor theyre 10 of 19 from three and now you got the New York both Tyson and Paul out of the ball game at this point good defense by Ernest Ross Ross the block Joyner out of bounds off shefflin wolf pack ball 6 41 to play NC State second in the league in Block shots despite not having anyone on the top 15 in that list yeah I mean theyve got guys up and down the you know roster its our CPI Security protecting the paint yeah Ross is hes got some good length and hes got some blocks on the years Juana is the guy whos going to block some shots Gantt um DJ Burns not a huge shot blocker but gets one every now and then yep almost won a game Applause this is a very streaky player thats not crazy news 27 down with 41 to goes a tough ask but maybe Smith can get hot and make this interesting who knows just uh playing with those four personal fouls Holloway picked up his third on that defensive possession Applause RJ Godfrey spins into the chest of burns Chaplin gets a loose ball shot clock winding down its hit three Chase Hunter veteran leadership realizes tip shefflin no tip again no loose ball controlled by Joyner numbers for the pack Marcel three that is one of the few rushes up the floor that NC state has had in this game and knocked down a three you know their their issue too is Kevin McKees didnt have a lot of timeouts left in his in the bag to stop action going down the stretch only one timeout remaining for the wolf pack Burns just picked up his third foul theyre from the 19th and 20th freethrow attempts of the game for Clemson all right Tyson back in Applause the most points allowed by NC State all season Galloway now at 26 sheplin goes down good no call and a flop warning has been assessed and this will be one free throw yeah can be Technical and uh you know I think right now the last few calls the you know they havent called Burns for an offensive foul you know thats thats a cleaner right there that was close I dont know if its a charge but I dont know if its a flop well and Ill Ill say to me you know against PJ hall or a starter that might be a different whistle I think it was probably a good no whistle right there chaplains like Ive been a starter for the last couple months coming on strong 8461 as close as it has been in quite a while dribbling violation call it on Hunter a little bit of lapse of concentration by Clemson in the last minute ninth turnover but a dead ball turnover so NC State cant capitalize immediately and look lets not kid ourselves they like to say that margin of Victory doesnt matter but a 30point win on the road on the road looks a whole lot different than a 1213 point win well against the tournament team as well creeping closer 23 for DJ Chase Hunter rushed it missed it followed by Godfrey and thats a killer for NC State he missed the layup and you let Godfrey sneak in for the slam and when youre on a team shooting 56 against you and youre giving up Second Chance opportunities Applause puts a lot of pressure on things foreign everybody you know theyre just locked in and you see four white jerseys standing around the rim and he beat everybody off the floor Applause shefflin just picked up his fourth Burns back to the line where hes actually struggled today Applause is now one for five Godfrey has been solid Off the Bench six points four rebounds 17 minutes minutes yeah Burns and you know despite the free throw issues hes been the one bright spot offensively for this team theyve given him a lot of touches yes inside but hes hes responded Applause you know I think you know with NC State I mean they can suffer through one of their backboard having an off night but they cant have both of them off and thats a good point Hunter finds the range there hes got 13 now along with Tysons 12 calls 20 and Galloways 26 problems Corner three good timeout taken by Kevin Keats itll be his final timeout darkell Joyner now with 16 points 21point game 4 11 a play game and they were in a very very good frame of mind I would imagine Applause Tom wormy and Brian Oliver Courtside in Atlanta for the call when were finished here in Raleigh I actually I got to do one game on Bos Turf this year down in Georgia Tech he owns their broadcast went inside for two speaking of uh parents of ACC players how about uh Ralph Hitlers reaction to his daughter Lizs buzzer beater Carmichael the other night to give Virginia Tech a thrilling win that was one proud papa Music wild finish to the womens basketball schedule coming down the stretch as well the regular season finales are tomorrow you could throw that regular season all the teams theyve had ranked in the top 25 this year all year long Duke UNC and Cameron at noon tomorrow in your Regional Sports networks Duke going for a regular season title Galloway bumps Ross Applause every time theres been kind of an ounce of uplifting optimism today for NC State its been squashed quickly either within 21 now is 25 so even the more aggressive theyve been on this full court pressure Clemson really has had not very much trouble with it and theyve theyve scored on the other end its packed up and in by Ross hes got four e269 Music so what does this mean for Clemson I mean theyve got Virginia Notre Dame coming up theyre going to be 218 135 in the league remember last year Notre Dame went 155 in the league still had to go to Dayton for the playing game yeah and uh yeah you know I think Clemsons a tournament team obviously that doesnt look good on the resume losing the Louisville however um if they can if they can back this game up with the winner Virginia that will be massive for them sure would Tross just picked up his fifth you know I think its going to be important though for them if youre Clemson if you you take care of business and you get in and get the double by not to lose that game on Thursday if he could get a win there hes into the semifinals youre in really really good shape I mean its pretty simple when you put it like that you just just keep winning yeah and thats thats the way I you know I look at most things I mean look at Miami all right you go through all these gymnastics and they say oh man hes going all right lets well win out and lets just take care of business give us the number one seed and Greensboro here we come and if Miami does get that number one seed I think they go into Greensboro as the favorite but not overwhelming by any means its a wide open tournament yeah and you know a lot of teams have short benches uh Miami being one of them so the double by really helps them cut it down to three games in three days you know weve Ive seen over the years you know at least one team in that on that Thursday double by gets gets beaten down its not usually by a team from Tuesday but its a team from Wednesday thats had one game under their belt youre talking about the perception I think right or wrongly up the league in general when Duke and Carolina are perceived to be having a down here it affects the whole conference sure does affects how the rest of the country looks at this conference gets a bucket and look theres reasons for the perception the bottom of the league being ranked where they are but I think catapult League I mean if you just take the top six seven eight teams theyre all teams that could play in the second weekend of the big game no no question about it oh yeah and even you know I I dont know theres a coach in the league that wants to play BC at this point you know the way that since Clinton post has come back the way that theyre playing foreign lost his footing turned it over Clemson ball 66 seconds to play Chase Graham gets a minute of action on senior day for NC State unfortunately hes played 35 games in his career wolfpacker 332 when he usually plays in mopup time gonna be 333 after today see if he can get a bucket hes got 19 points in his career what a performance today from the Clemson Tigers from the opening tip LJ Thomas not looking for the walkon takes it himself and yikes scant hard landing on his tailbone after the Mist follow dunk after the whistle you know you mean you touched on it earlier you know I was right with you I said boy this is this is going to be a really really great game and uh you know probably decided in the last minute but this was as good a road performance as Ive seen this year that has to count for something Applause a trip to Charlottesville on Tuesday if they can go up to Charlottesville and put up 95 points then Ill really be impressed it could be a heck of a what that would be that would be historic that would be Iowa the Tony benedira I think its a 68 that would be something that doesnt happen in Charlottesville too often in fact I dont think anyone scored 60 at jtj and regulation in a long time who you got tonight in Chapel Hill the heels of the Cavs well its going to come down I think the shooting is going to come down to the backboard with Davis and love a halfhearted a next exclamation point to close it out what impressive performance from the Clemson Tigers Graham with a chance no Music Clemson comes to PNC Arena and destroys NC State 9671 and it didnt feel that close no and you know for for Brad Brownell I mean if you could
