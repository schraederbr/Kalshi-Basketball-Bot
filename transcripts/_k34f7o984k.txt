his roster back to the athleticism and the length he likes to have with his teams his defense is there hes trying to get his offense to kind of accelerate they had flashes of it this weekend in Connecticut and theyre hoping to build on that going through this break this weekend three ball launched oh another one missed by a mile couple of them early thats not going to make Tim Craft happy the tallah hasy native you and aggressive another finish inside the paint maliku and the energy hes bringing early for Florida State its been incredible you can and the way he was carrying himself in warmups and the way he was at shoot around a day hes just got another air about him after having such success the last four games in double figures set a career high three straight games and here we got another deflection right out of bounds that defense doing what theyre worked on all summer theres a bio Blast for Leonard Hamilton in his 23rd season the threetime ACC coach of the year he said look this groups having fun theyre playing unselfishly and he pointed out to over 280 passes completed against UMass he said thats how you know our offense is working unselfish move the ball side to side and allow for an execution 25 assist on the 33 made baskets thats an impressive stat leag leading for the ACC the best all year so far block shot there Taylor B itll be another chance though for the catamounts of Western Carolina Morgan launches that ones good Brandon Morgan the junior transfer from junior college ranks Caldwell Community College hes average just shy of five points per game thats what Western Carolina wants to do they value the three of them oh and you values the jam you better move your feet on defense Catamount CU Yan can put it on the floor he played like a point forward position initiating the offense in junior college thats really been part of his slow process adjusting is that hes not used to going to the block stanbury tries his hand out of hand out of a three Hs feeling pretty good aggressive throws it up and it is a blocking foul youan will go to the line you just puts it on the blows right by the defense and says thank you very much get out of the way Jacob what do you make of his athleticism his handles and his vision as a big man you know its not an everyday thing you kind of see with a 611 guy who can got such soft touch and got a sweet little jump shot you dont expect him to be able to drive right by you hes got explosiv First Step its hard to adjust to youre talking about a team here West Carolina that they dont have a seven foot downall team much less a guy that can dribble and shoot it Mass substitutions for the catamounts and for Tim crafts group Tim Craft back in his hometown of Tallahasse with the highlight of yous weekend he shot 70 up there 7even to 10 in both games like thats impressive rebounded the ball well heres the tally native crafts wenton North Florida Christian and Florida High here in Tallahassee another turnover and with the Florida high was on C right around the corner right across from the uh there like a medical school there now isnt it believe youre correct there said he was back in Tallahassee with Garder web a few years ago when he coached there said this place continues to change every time I come back ns up 10 three what a feed gr mans flush from nice floater pass right up there where you need to throw it put it Above the Rim up and high for the big fell to throw it down how about these NOS theyve shot out of a cannon up 12 to three ball movement stanbury the transfer from Pepperdine swarming defense and ball pressure by Florida State shot clocked under 10 on the turn block shot Jamir Watkins into transition Watkins has it taken away a late foul called is it on Western Carolina I believe it Music is and the are hyped up early here in three ACC wins when hes at Gardner web with Georgia Tech Wake Forest in Clemson he also beat Purdue Nebraska Georgia lot of success hes a great coach great J Co he joked he went to a coffee shop this morning and someone recognized him from 20 years ago and said Tim he goes yeah he said he was struggling he was like I know that guy oh another alley and I think Chandler Jackson knows that guy too Taylor Bol row High Above the Rim Florida State leads by 11 some questions of Florida states third game in five days how would they respond with the legs be tired so far doing exactly what you want to do right get downhill get to the rim the elevator still going to the top floor I can tell you that right now they forced their third turnover defensively how about this Rim attack Chandler Jackson really good L the lobs up high a lot of time guards want to bounce it to the big fella throwing it up there for chello and just to throw it down 610 sophomore from Jero Vermont Taylor Bol Bowen Energizer Bunny coach Hamilton talking to practice about Chandler Jackson and people saying why is he not making shots and Coach hams like hes Distributing the ball hes rebounding right theres a perfect example that lob assist right there is what you need c and steady presence of a Chandler Jackson here in this early portion of the Season what a feed dang he can fire away he can shoot it he misses the mark long rebound pushed into the front Court heres Livingston the simal will switch one through five theyve got some wrinkles recently some variations of the switching game another turnover Davis the outstanding freshman enters the game no look pass inside deflected taken away and now the catamounts will try and push in transition Livingston three ball at rims out and the rebound on the right side of the Iron by Chandler Jackson Watkins three launched rims out rebound there to number one Chase mcke mcks dad Derek mcke big time NBA player played at Alabama all NBA rookie team no doubt some with the Pacers the Seattle SuperSonics and the 76ers Florida State theyve created turnovers early what a feed and a rim assault for Jerry d so inish by jir Watkins instead of getting his own he gave it right there to the newcomer Jerry Dan not only can he shoot it from deep but he can throw it down aler maluk the sevenfooter with the steel interior feed malos got the mismatch oh he made the mistake of bringing the ball down its slapped out of bounds itll stay with Florida State look at that unselfish kick Jerry Dan not only can he shoot it he can throw it down speaking of maluk you nailed it right there Arya he brought it down the biggest thing you har with these big guys dont take that little dribble dont take the crab dribble keep it up high the guards can get it from you down low and thats exactly what happened who are some guys that were the best of that that youve seen during your working coaching career Solomon olivy was really good at it you know here at Florida State and it was and and Michael Ojo uh Chris kamaji but going back to my time at at Auburn Chris Porter was the greatest he would take that thing and just straight up explode through you and bring it all down mamadu eni another sevenfooter back in the day those guys but its a process to learn as a freshman you dont just do it as a freshman you got to get it harped in practice cuz in high school you know you kind of put it on the floor adjust to the shot clock Florida state will get 20 on it inbounds Baseline out of bounds play Swinton couple of freshman passing the ball and Davis dragged his feet switching in pivot feet thats easy to do and you dont even realize it Florida State team 9259 over UMass on Sunday two days before that they beat Temple oh bad pass SES turn it over get the turnover kick out three ball in the air it is no good multiple sevenfooters can shoot the threes around here crazy look for Leonard Hamilton I caught my breath alir Malo launching it from Beyond The Arc how about that move a nice little finish there for number two CJ Island took it in there kind of surprised everybody finished with the inside hand you would think he would have switched to his outside hand he used his left hand heres D pump didnt shoot it Thomas maluk turns faces fires oh thats sweet he is so comfortable he still as coach Hamilton said in Frank is growing into his body but heck he can shoot it already alier Malo from baldwi Pennsylvania parents are south sudanes on the attack shot off the glass no tipped around itll go out of bounds itll stay with the catamounts wcu Western Carolina from col North Carolina the school with a little over 7500 in attendance in enrollment founded in 1889 three ball straight away back iron the catamounts havent shot it well early here in tally itll keep the basketball they didnt play for a whole week their last opponent was at Wake Forest one week ago they lose 8269 theyve only played two division one teams so far exactly they played Queens out out of Charlotte and both those teams they lost to they were right there in those games in the second half they were down six at Wake Forest but they made shots and uh its hard to shoot shots when the guys are longer that are flying towards you Tim CRA is really worried about it feed inside kick out Swit can shoot the three that ones not going to go offensive rebound Mal Swit attacks the rim hes going to the line a smile on swts face ays like a group effort l a block party but uh but hes got that athleticism this year the last couple years its been a little dicey on the uh the defense but they turned a corner last year going into the Georgia teag game at Christmas at that holiday break and it was like a whole new team showed up from Florida State and as AJ Swinton The Freshman from Cabin John Maryland knocks down the free throw Leonard Hamilton talked about how he felt like this teams depth there was a quality 6 through 10 6 through 12 that he could bring off his bench that models lot of the teams that have been successful in the past for him and Jacob that allows Florida State to stay fresh to continue that defensive intensity and that pressure for a full 40 minutes in a game and thats exactly whats going to be a major problem for Western Carolina tonight is that depth where he can bring his second team in where Leonard thinks his second teams defensively better than his first team and theyre out on the floor now so and youre going against some of the starter steal for Western Carolina its just a tough matchup for the catamounts Brandon Morgan controls the rock for the catamounts feed to fiser Brown who can really shoot the three Morgan launches from the parking Applause lot thats what you want right if youre the Catamount thats more your game plan got to make the threes and and and Tim loves it coach crap loves the fact this guys can shoot the ball and he wants from shooting clean looks they will fire over 30 of them tonight from Beyond The Arc the key for them will be can they make 10 to 15 of them and stay in the game dang Davis steps into with three of his own that ones back iron KN to fighting for it hes got the ball what a feed its ripped away active Hands by the catamounts great offense by Florida State even though they didnt get a basket the ball movement and good hands there good good defense by the catamounts jumping into passing Lane Wing rotation p with the jam Over N to put it on a poster oh my goodness get a picture of that one thats going on the in the program the poster the wall you name it Bernard P hello one power dribble Baseline you better seal that Baseline off or he about to sit on you fellas look at this the defense kind of there but he just went right by the young freshman listen if youre going to go up as a Defender you got to get a hand on it or foul the guy right rules get but you know need two who didnt play last year due to a a bad growing injury set out hes still getting it getting it back in Rhythm you know give him two more months and lets see if he can get that dunk on me too the young freshman from Canada yeah you dont want to be on that image otherwise right ask Jordan War how he feels about being on the same image as Trent Forest another barking lock Bank open Tuesday night from my favorite name ice Emory from Deep hes got ice water in his Vein from Deep ice Emory who has a cooler actual name chabet right he said it was his dads name his dads nickname was ice so he kind of carried it over three ball outstanding freshman J Davis dayquan from the corner pocket noes back in the lead by double digits hes only shooting 22 from deep but hey you better count it if hes back there hes got a sweet little stroke the response not there offensive foul pushing off was Vernon Collins the threes are starting to fall here in Tallahassee over the last couple of moments and the bank still open to not just are the threes falling the bank the ATM you name it and Davis deep in the corner the young freshman from overtime Elite Atlanta its a nice little spark plug leading assist man for Florida State also you ask I samur hell tell you he called it said you didnt hear me but I said it he acted like it Yan back in the game fouls tough break for Marcus kale he saw it coming he saw the lob and just kind of backs into him to take his space yous already in the air its a foul every time you got to let the big man land that is the fifth team foul on Western Carolina and Marcus k no zero fouls that aggression its its its a tough break for guys the aggressive team usually doesnt get caught as many fouls as the team thats playing a little less aggressive a good point so far Florida state has used defense to propel it to a 10point lead and call a moving screen yes almost like a makeup call but um you and right there turned into his man to walk him down and Coach crash right there giving it to him and Teddy V nailed him they heard you say no fouls on Florida State thats they look up they look up youre right about that are you they keep a look at that scoreboard heres ice Sam going against Bobo and crosscourt pass Morgan hes got six early points corner feed Marcus Kell now Morgan working against Thomas a great on ball Defender perad associate coach Stan Jones stsb oh thats crafty got Jamir Watkins in the air thats clever hell go to the line for three he didnt lose his headband thats the key but good clever move right there to give him a little ball fake and got jir in the air and just went right into him get those three free throws but Kell we were looking at Marcus Kell a minute ago got the foul and then just the play down here in the basket hes a fourman whos having to play to five for Coach craft as he was telling us that practice and he can really stretch the floor he can shoot it a little bit but but its harder for him defensively and they they try to hide him at the five because hes not a five and uh itll work in the socon but it wont work in the ACC cour Stanberry other than having great hair like my broadcast partner Jacob ridenhower averaging almost 11 points per game he hits the second I Ive tried to talk myself into the headband but I I just cant especially like when Im like I I hoop a little but Im Im more pickle ball which Speaking of pickle ball I want to talk with CJ over here CJ highing see coach craps said the best pickle ball player was stanbury knocks down to the three rocking the headband Jacob I feel like you would look good in a headband next game we do together Im starting off in a head Im going to hold you to it AR Missi Jacob Ry now our entire crew you we go to the line for a pair Tuesday night basketball here in Tallahasse right before the Thanksgiving break and Stan Jones flid sts associate head coach was wondering he said how mature can we handle this right its our third game in five days you got holidays coming up what kind of effort will you bring early to this one against Western Carolina well on paper you should have no issues right its a team that youre favored to beat I think Vegas had Florida State over 20 points as the favorite but you got to play the game on the court exactly you dont know how the guys are going to resp F you have a young team your your your leader is Chandler Jacksons a junior and you dont know what youre going to get from all the newcomers and whether theyre going to be focused and and its a testament to a good practice which was really a walkr Im sure playing on Sunday but theyve come to play here start of the Applause game 255 stanbury against Yuan a bad pass into the back court did they say there was a deflection they do itll stay with Western Carolina Florida State they got it off the leg Teddy Vs over there talking to uh assistant coach Kevin nickelberry telling me it touched it how about the staff for Florida State Stan Jones Kevin nickelberry Jake Morton veteran crew veteran bench over there helping coach Hamilton on the drive are they going to give that two points oh its just completely unnecessary from youan b b and flew at it to give it a block and didnt get a hold of it but then Yan came from the weak side hes like Im getting this bad boy he thought he was about to put one in bleachers right there he pins it up against the glasses the ball hits the glass first all night long its a b Brandon Morgans got eight Western Carolina has trimmed the deficit to eight Watkin its quiet first half for Florida States leading scorer he hasnt scored he has zero points Jackson flows it rattles around kind iron NOS back up by Ted hes a big body guard Jackson and he loved to kind of get that contact to get his shot off and right there but you talk about jir Watkins not scoring thats a testament to Testament to his maturity to not be forcing shots mck and maybe that time Yan did get a deflection that ones going to be clean Watkins head of steam hes fouled and I believe hes headed to the line for the 0 on and one its a tough blow for the catamounts the quickness of Florida State they can blow right by on the perimeter NOS up by 10 Watkins at the line when we return test hes been AOW to handle inside for the cats yes coming off back to back career highs 17 was his showing on Sunday here he is hes already already got 12 I would say hes well on his way to setting another career high of night but well let that play out in court so to speak but um Western Carolina has settled their defense has kind of slowed some of that penetration Florida state did not have a point in the paint in that last 4minute stretch where they had gotten all but two of their points in the paint prior his seminal team Jamir Watkins looking for his first points this is a one and one its just the bonus and that one B out and Watkins early season charity stripe struggles continue hasnt been so charitable for him no last year he was all over 80 for the season and this year hes struggling to stay above 60 Cal three ball rattles out rebound battled around one by bbo and Coach craft was talking about that for an ability he has to drill that shot 44 for the season Watkins knocks down the Trey Ball top of the gy his first points of the night and his 100th career threepoint field goal made congrats to jir O yes sir he cant make his free throws right now but he can still drain that ball from Deep he been continuing to work on that to try and improve his NBA draft prospects throws to come around thats just a matter of timing little too much mustard on that hot dog nice feed inside you and couldnt finish couldnt wrap it around round the rim tough angle Kel on the attack block shot bbo hes got a couple of them now tonight Watkins to Chandler Jackson and he lays it in good ball movement thats that was a good movement the last couple shots have been forced in traffic when there mishandled passes thats a good offensive possession for Florida State even though its basically a secondary break 7 on H the steel angles his body and he lays it in time out Western Carolina Tim crafts has seen enough he wants to talk it over yeah slow him down and the best way to slow him down right now is to call a time out but hes going to try to get his guys resettled and see where they are and then see what they can get coming out of here to get the defense a little different 3417 well be right back Music Music a FL sts outstanding cheer squad Im sure those students are ready to go home for the holidays absolutely and you got the looks like we got the pep B still got a little showing over there tonight turkey day coming up everybody wants to get some of Moms cooking here in this hurricane Helen relief game general admission ticket sold it was not on the schedule originally it was supposed to be played in Cherokee North Carolina at the haris casino Florida State going to donate all proceeds to Hurricane Relief thats a good three ball right corner and is that fisher Brown it is he was five of seven from Beyond The Arc coming into tonight get ready to say that hes shooting 67 he hadnt got enough to really count in the statistics Florida States been a good zone offense this season good ball movement Leonard Hamiltons team has been passing the heck out of the ball and Watkins speaking of another three speaking of a shooter a guy thats worked on his shot all summer turnover two points Boston Hulk flips it in hes clipping off some points tonight Boston hul showing his his size and his body taking those passes right away from the catamounts he brought Boston Holton to be an experienced steady player a veteran voice over 100 career games and multiple Collegiate stops on the the kick out turnover thats the 11th of the half heres Hol he can shoot it knocks it down another three ball its reigning triples for Florida State another timeout taken by the tally native Tim Applause crafts another timeout well step aside once more Florida States cruising Music Music well Florida state was over for its first four from Beyond The Arc theyre four for their last five Leon Hamilton says were a much better threepoint shooting team than weve shown 100 Boston Holt right there shooting 50 from three not a lot of shots so it doesnt really count the stat stat book but the the Portland native can shoot the ball from way downtown and hes really selective on when he pulls the trigger so Leonard Hamilton said the best shooting teams are also the best passing teams Jacob what does he mean by that well he means to get easy shots thats why they make their shots guys that are forcing shots with a defense in their face or somebody flying in them those are guys that arent moving the ball very much you move the ball you break the defense down your third fourth fifth pass is when you get a wide open look m key nearly traveled crosscourt pass triple in the air off the left side oh how about dang onehanded rip down to the board using that full length to pull that bad boy down look like Odell Beckham Jr going for a pass trying to rip one down huh yes you needs to settle down hes not playing like he did this weekend hes like looking right e e e its Isani Florida State cruising theyre getting their feast on before they get their feast on on Thursday the 69 a really 70 shooting for Florida State to the 32 shooting for the catamounts kind of sums up the uh 42 to 20 score its a simal team who has shot the basketball well from Beyond the Arc over the last four games and again tonight four of nine here in this first half over 40 and it goes back to that ball movement where theyre getting good looks the catamounts have had trouble against Florida States length and athleticism Tim Craft saying you just cant simulate it in practice Brown kick out Morgan three weve seen a couple of air balls here from Western Carolina FSU is swarming on that side of the ball and you said the same thing that Adam fiser said from Temple after their game on Friday he said its hard to simulate what youre going to see against Florida State and practice due to their length and size and thats exactly whats happening to Kim C in the Catamount the simal team looking to move to seven and one for the first time since that 2019 2020 season Watkins had made his last two triples not that time the save attempt there from Den into the hands of a purple jersey three minutes to play in this opening stanza heres ice Amar swings it across P look at the hand for the big fell how about it three ball off rattles in and out Rim spit it out how about maluk sticking with the guard as Jackson will go to the line for a pair of free throws yes maluk got got quick feet and and he is growing into his body really as the season moves along hes getting more acquainted to the offense and the defense and where he supposed to be on the floor he can shoot it too thre minute scoring drought here Arya for the catamounts that defense has been able to stifle Western Carolina when the NOS are switching like that Jacob what kind of challenges does that present to an opposing offense well one theyve never seen it so theyre theyre probably still adjusting to this switching ball pressure you know front your man in the post its just not what youre accustomed to but it also is um its just hard to get a pass off you can see when a guy picks his ball up just a moment ago where CJ Highland had the ball picked up he had nowhere to go with the ball cuz everyone was covered and he was he couldnt score the man on him was 67 and and CJ Highlands coming in at 61 aggressively Taylor Jackson thats a sweet sound good work from our audio not te stole my thought like good we must brother I was like that is sweet I need that for my ringtone there are a few better sounds maybe the Ping of a baseball bat when someone catches one right for a home run Ill give you that one but man net splashing I mean its string music string musics hard to beat though sbur trying to create the angle look at the NS good extra pass Collins cant finish b b and another rebounds St through three or four ball fakes nowhere to go with the big athletes waiting on him Ball B calls his Zone number three ball Ratt out the big man offensive rebound he hangs cant finish another chance two Music out he was not going to let that one get away from him I love the aggressive rebounding and trying to just head hunt for that rim to get it in the cousin of bbo of the Phoenix Suns from a long lineage of great basketball players from Sudan stanbury pum fake pull up doesnt shoot it ball movement Morgan into the lane he cant finish through the contact Davis smallest player on the court comes away with the ball NOS want to run in transition three on three good look and a shot blocked whoa that was a vicious block the Princeton transfer jumped right with him and just slapped it away Emory cant finish the big man hitting the floor and his teammates love it oh my goodness look at Vernon Collins running with him and says not today Taylor bbo and this is my paint right now started to think about LeBron James and Andre Iguodala from the the finals all those years ago the chase down block by LBJ and again we talked about it if youre going to attack if youre going to meet him at The Rim you either fou him or you better block him you better come to the party prepared cuz if you dont youre going to go home from the party very disappointed and he blocked the bad boy with that block Applause party look at the help defense its impressive how quick the secondary helps coming big basket by Stanberry Stanberry from way downtown off the catch and Applause shoot Swit through some contact noes cant get anything out of it itll go out of bounds to the catam burning Collins right there again tall and up big strong physical body you know he won the ivy league title last year at Princeton he was the team that went to the Sweet 16 that beat Missouri and Dennis Gates the former Florida State assistant hes got a lot of leadership skills but hes originally from North Carolina one to get back to the home state transferred to Western Carolina and here he is having a heck of a game right there against some bigs that are hes a quality siiz big guy he can play against these Farid State bigs hes got some big experience right as you mentioned I mean he played at Princeton went to a sweet 16 backtoback Ivy League champions last season they win the ivy league I mean a high clip shooting the ball at Princeton he brings winning experience ice ice ice that was cold deep from the one they call ICE hes your lead score back to back 20po games its a quick 30 second timeout but Western Carolina 29 shots attempted we talked about they want to shoot the three ball 18 of those have been launched from Beyond The Arc theyre starting to heat up a little bit after a cold start now six of 18 in the half now Florida State probably would take that right 33 you live with that if youre Leonard Hamilton right and its a simal team by the way its been one of the best 3point percentage defenses in the country to start the year yes theyve come out of the gates and done a phenomenal job closing out on Shooters and the way theyre closing out flying right by you theyre help defense as we talked about and here you got Florida State taking their use it or lose it timeout here with 127 seconds left try to get the young guys execute a play and come down and not just kind of Jack a three or or look for a simple lob youre going to run a play and let kind of get some practice in you know get a game type setting situation for these guys to be able to execute later in the year but the games not over these guys make some threes Fara State goes cold its a 10point game and then all of a sudden everybodys worried totally shot clock off NOS will have the final attempt here of the first half 6 seconds Davis got to get going 4 seconds now the Freshman to Thomas 2 seconds Thomas got to get one up at the he he baked it in its going to count all three of those Justin Thomas and Florida State a perfect way to end the half twice in one game a bank shot from Bowen and jir Watkins same five they began the game with oh Jackson had nasty intentions on that drive he handful of purple jerseys in the area he saw the Promise Land and was trying to get there came up short had to jump a little quicker because the defense help Jacob what do you want to see early on adjustment Wise from Western Carolina well theyve just got to get open looks theyve got to be able to get ready the clean line to the basket and PLO right there good look thats what Im talking about puts it on the floor dribbles short corner and Exel just elevates up over the defense you got to get good looks you cant have to force it late in the shot clock which is what happened early confident looking stroke there from poot you and confident as well hes fouled are they going to count it now they say no basket that as a coach is one of those controversial situations where your guys got to bump into him because the offensive guys backing you down and Tim Craft used one of my favorite phrases in practice today he said theyre going to Barkley you to the rim referring to Charles Barkley where he would just back you down a couple years ago it was against the rules to Back a guy down with the bumps but now you can bump them down fou called on Florida State excuse me on Western Carolina Bernard palot picking one up there good eyes partner couldnt catch a number well thats a tough one for them cuz you know he they need him on the floor hes their second big really uh besides Veron Collins and they took Veron Collins out and and put kale back in Marcus kale Applause Watkins at six first half points averaging nearly 18 a game coming into the contest heres in Holtz ball fake Watkins three ball lets it Fly connects Jamir Watkins and the improved deep ball they suck the defense in with the penetration and pitched it out for jir Watkins just to drill that open three thats his third triple thats all his points nine points on three threes for jir who really lives in the paint and inside 10t hes worked on it and you can tell by watching the way he shoots it by hes got total confidence from beat theres a foul as Emory was on the drive jir Watkins towards Illustrated had him in a mock draft as an NBA second round projection to the Nets at number 43 overall now that could go northwards he could sneak his way into the back half of the first rounds thats going to come with hitting more of those threes absolutely just showing what you can do on offense and more than showing what he can do on offense knocking down his third three of the game hes been the bright spot here for the catam outs hes got 11 first cam out into double figures the Junior from calwell Community College he dropped 27 in junior college Watkins first two of the game assault Watkins sitting there dropping his two from the Baseline baby s in that thing young fella that was the hammer stanbury three ball yes three for two baby stanbury is not afraid to pull the trigger 34 and the catamounts are now eight of 20 for 40 from threepoint line oh on the carum from Up the Rim is foul just youan unselfish kicks it look at that leaves it to see his cutting teammate Jamir Watkins B with the official assist but that hockey assist by you got it started Florida States got 11 assists on 20 made baskets with the 50 Watkins Rises midrange thats his spot it was well contested though its his first fourth shot of the game in my book another three there that was Emme no offensive rebound Kell kick out mcke Morgan hes been hot from three launches that one back iron and ripped out of the sky by b b the close out by Watkins kind of made that one more difficult than the last couple threes H Caught no mans land taken away heres ice Amar on the attack reverse land thats sweet IIM the little man going up in the trees not even afraid of the contact use that rim to prot protect it threw it up on the other side Western Carolina outscoring Florida State 10 to five here in the second half a little spurt now for the catamounts it was a big hill to climb Bowen rims out Yan fighting for it Holtz saves it to a teammate bbo and crosscourt pass extra pass Jackson three ball lets it fly off to the right unselfish possession by Florida State everyone sharing the ball but Jackson should have shot that thing in Rhythm instead of the pump fake lice Emory the Junior from Appleton Wisconsin how about this jacob splits the trees bulbo and swatting at it kind of halfway and he just goes right under jir Watkins using that rim to protect it the young fella man he he can play and and not only can he play he has got one of the coolest names Ive heard all season long with ice em and we score the junior college level prior to going to Dodge City he was at marac they won the NEC conference the last two games hes shooting 47 and averaging 20 points a game stallen away Watkins into the Open Court alyuk Jackson R it down hes not going to miss that dunk folks great pass by Jamir Watkins but the young fella running withing the two veterans on the Florida State team working together Highland the kick out stand B three ball rims out offensive rebound sck back not there great effort by Kel Marcus Kell getting long for the rebound no look p b Bowen hes fouled great call Conor pin right there good Young official on top of it Emy tried to run him out to not him the ability to get that lob right here Jamir Walkin says Im not going to let you run out on me penetrates it pitches it boom baby Chandler Jack Florida stayed up by a 20 Leonard Hamilton talked about in the early going in this season how he felt like his team who was off to a cold start from Beyond The Arc you can see those numbers there in the first five and the last two he said weve got a number of guys who can shoot he said really I only got one guy who cant shoot and the numbers didnt reflect that until their trip to Connecticut to the mohagen summer Florida State rip down the Nets they were making it rain 43 in two games the second game against UMass Jacob nine of 18 for 50 and then tonight 43 b b and fouled thats going to count as well on that percentage and tonight 6 of 14 theyre right there on top of with the 43 carrying out but we talked to coach at practice today shoot around officially and he talked about the key thats really loosening up their their ability to shoot the ball better is the ball movement and getting the offens is clicking and sharing the ball and its giv them the opportunity to get cleaner looks and better shots without the defense in their face its showing by their Music percentages moo and now at Five Points three rebounds couple of blocks couple of steals Taylor b b and almost a Swiss army knife type and thats the type of player he is AR his ability to jump and run so long and just explosive aete stands bar Rising Fire nope B and long rebound flashes into the open cord you and a little out of control yeah he needs to wrap that thing up ARA youre right about that dont just run around there and flick it Tempo picking up Stansbury around Yan nice pass Kell that was going to be difficult see what they call jump ball I think the possession arrow though is going to stay with the Catamount he got bailed out with the Big Fellas cing the ball when he was trying to release it because he was about to walk both Mari and I both were sitting there waiting on the walk call but they they got him on the stuff but Kels is just not as strong as those post players from Florida State and its hard for him to kind of go through them Livingston that three off to the right U grabs the rebound and then air mails it over hold head into our court side seting the guys are earning their money over there they better pay attention theyre going to stay Nike up across their Applause forehead Livingston excuse me this is CJ Highland The Freshman from Loganville onto the deck lost control Jackson will earn the tie up and this time possession arrow Florida State its its almost a little comical to watch Florida State because everyones trying to get that deflection and when they get that deflection you can see the bodies react where everyones ready to break out and take off uh to get that transition running they on neison Jerry D will also enter as does alier maluk Western Carolina couple Subs as well Marcus Kells given some good minutes Chas mcke coming into to match up with maluk Western Carolina team thats amongst the most inexperienced teams in the country is dank misses the Trey Ball only 10 teams have less experience than the Adam mounts who last year were amongst the nations leaders in D1 experience Highland no good on the three welcome to the transfer portal Alo too much there for dang from Davis if you have a good team at the bid major level your your guys are trying to transfer up instantly and thats kind of what happened to Western Carolina along with their coach leaving um they transfer and go get a new setting so to speak and we were talking about the nli money and how it works at Western Carolina and the socon today and its its effective there too you better have some money if you want to keep your players on campus no doubt you lose a player like vus wbite or Trey Jackson Russell Jones nice little bucket there inside that one by sinq Lem its not easy to replace that Talent couple of guys went with Justin grer Coastal Carolina he had one player transfer for to Cal and Swit he flashes the athleticism in the youngster the freshmans headed to the line but it goes back to Thomas who was stayed with the deflection right here he stays with it and just sees his cutting teammate and gives it to switon to get it up through the defense and the bench is fired up AJ swind a unique player for Florida St right 66 200lb freshman was the first commit of the 2024 class still growing into his body talking to some folks around Florida States program as that free throw rims out long arms active defensively great on ball Defender but over the weekends in Connecticut he showed he can shoot the three ball too connected on a few of those and as all Leonard Hamilton recruits the athleticism Above the Rim always stands out yes and thats every time hes going to have a guy on his team and he wants it at every position really who has the ability to elevate when necess even Davis one of the smallest guys on his roster he will go up and throw it down on your head quickly from the point guard position well number 19 there right on your screen good work from our director Kirby kander Leonard Hamilton saying he reminds me of a little bit of like a young rayquan gray or Terren man didnt compare him to him completely but said Young when they came in it was all tools and body and we developed it into a player that became an NBA caliber player absolutely and it takes time to develop T man signing an extension with the Los Angeles Clippers earlier this off season thats a rich man yeah hes a rich man playing in the newest arena in the NBA and and and if theres any a player that deserves it that guy was the heart and soul of Leonard Hamiltons crew that had it rolling here at Florida State you completely missed what I did there didnt you I did thats okay well continue to work on this chemistry on the attack oh I think that might be a travel no theyre going to call a foul Al maluk one up for the rebound came down so yeah there is a foul there was a nudge lets look at it again stay with the rebound but got to land on your feet they knocked his feet out from under the ceiling of alier maluk in the early going averaging nearly four points per game two rebounds but its the vast skill set in the athleticism as he cant make the free throw the energy levels though he always brings 110 yes and I did want to jinx him he was shooting 71 from the free throw line prior to that so he can shoot the ball as hes evident from his outside jump shot Bou on the floor going to go against Florida State the men in stripes are are tighten it up on that perimeter defense which is probably necessary adding down the hatches so to speak but maluk should still be in High School 17 years old when he arrived at Florida State with a top 40 recruit in the 2026 class he reclassified still a four start by all the outlets but you see what NBA Scouts are salivating at 7 foot with that kind of athleticism versatility hes staying in front but how about the move there from Brandon Morgan got him on the pump fake going right by him got the big fella to bite but Malo did stay with him in ability hes so long he come from behind his still contest 61 40 Under 12 media timeout coming nolles on top of the catamounts always Music Music they Music well the coach is nothing without his staff and Kevin nickelberry has done an excellent job since arriving here in Tallahassee for Leonard Hamilton the former head coach at Hampton University worked at LSU worked at Georgetown hes hes kind of well traveled as aist a highly respected guy hes done a great job getting these bigs in here for Florida State and and looking at like you and how hes coming along and right there with him that you can see thats thats his prot to J and then Mal air maluk its just getting the bigs in here that kind of checked up boxes for Leonard Hamilton and even jir Watkins I think nickelberry was was very involved in in keeping him out of the transfer portal or getting him to come back out of the transfer portal return to Florida State the seminal near steal here as the NS had turned up the pressure in the full court to a full court press of sorts to the catamounts break at least they survive it and now Morgan interior feed couple of long arm seals in there free ball launched back iron off the glass no rebounds Swinton he pushes the break Thomas to dang whos got a three in every game this season but does not have one here tonight bad pass turnover on the attack and a duunk fiser brown Coast to Coast Fisher Brown the Montana native with the flush jumping his own passing Lane for that Breakaway steal Thomas dang ball on the deck high off the glass oh a sweet kiss used his body absorbed that contact from Collins and just laid it up soft the sevenfooter The Freshman hitting the deck NOS want to run Davis through contact showing you the strength in that small package can you tell hes a former football player Arya the way he just goes in there with that contact and explodes up to get that shot Applause 6542 Davis Five Points now to go along with three rebounds deflection ball loose Thomas fighting for it hes got it Nolls have numbers Davis oh punched out of his arms out of bounds itll stay with Florida State Dan just puts it on the floor goes through Collins cant get the dunk and then Davis into emers chest goes right through him and looks like Hey wheres my foul dayquon Davis has come in for Florida State and hes provided a natural ball handler a kid whos played point guard his entire life 6ot tall and that might be generous might be one of those roster helpings on the height but he plays like a man who 65 yes he does and and Leonard Hamilton was telling us today at shoot around even Davis as good as hes playing for Florida State and what youre seeing on the floor hes a lead and assist man hes learning the point guard position for Florida State as he said hes used to grabbing the ball and bring it up the floor every time but at Florida State you got to run to Wing sometimes for example Thomas got that board pushed it up the floor and Davis ran the wing versus trying to get the ball to then bring it up himself yeah fourstar recruit was Davis out of overtime Elite the Baltimore native and they hoop in Baltimore yes that is a tenacious brand is that three no documentaries on that Hoops up there in Baltimore totally heres Davis his created for his teammates well has been Fearless early on Thomas three no offensive rebound Swinson shot blocks but foul on poot you see the smile on AJ swintons face he has brought good energy and a good demeanor here to this Florida State team in his rookie campaign AJ wenton going through two Defenders absorbing that contact hes just wishing he could have finished all these youngsters getting a lot of good minutes here with 10 minutes 946 to go here in the second half they know they got a lot of burn down the stretch a Florida State team who knew they were playing three games in five days rested a lot of guys against UMass once that game got out of hand no one playing over 24 minutes in that game and Coach ham feels as confident as ever as hes there with coach nickelberry in the depth of this team and the nolles one of the best teams in the country at relying on using their bench oh hes going to rotate them out and its uh its a kind of flashback to what hes had a few years back how he can almost bring in a whole new posi so to speak and a whole new crew when he Subs swin approaching his young career high hes now got six that number eight SN a new play at detha and at Oak Hill a couple of basketball powerhouses prior to coming to tahi he suited up with some really good historical players a foul called on Western Carolina those were in the break had three gold jerseys really with no purple in front and fiser brown who was on the floor trying to wrap it up clipped his feet is he as s was trying to take off everyone gets excited on the offensive side of a Music Applause break that Miss there from Florida State just their fourth 76 tonight which is a massive step in the right direction from where theyve been early on this season L amilton goes its mental these free throws Ive got kids who I know are good free throw shooters and in practice they all knock him down as Swinton goes oh for two there its only a half an ouncers Jinx because he had already missed the first one just want to put that out there I only take 50 of the blame Collins kick out Amry Brown three ball B out and the ns got a little handsy there yeah Collins trying to get that rebound and they wouldnt let him get his hands up but the fans are still loving it she was singing something maybe just the tune in her own head yes I concur could have been the airpods N minutes to BL stallen away another turnover Ds got to be careful oh he got pickpocketed sneak attack from Ice little man came right behind him the trail three that rattles out Swinton fighting for it couple catamounts timeout was called but Florida State okay it was Florida State who called the timeout at bright moments here but with that schedule you going to Marquette they got their hands full and then that that game of Tennessee coming off their their tournament Victory down there in the Bahamas last week and and a unbelievable defensive Squad up there in Knoxville Tennessee but uh its its a team thats going to get better with their youth and as the season goes on Tim CRA will get the guys learning his system as he told us today its like were all learning they dont know anything about how we coach and we dont know anything about how they play Highland One V one against dang the glass the third time tonight weve got banked in shot some Windex to wipe that thing down Davis he responds with a three back to back theyre raining the 10th three of the night for the NOS Thomas looking for need to over the top whistle and a foul called good call my man from Montana fiser Brown was had him kind of hooked holding KN to down not every day Montana you think of like fly fishing elk moose Yellowstone you know and here we got fiser brown a 66 threepoint shooter 71 from the field on the young season shot 93 free throws in Prep School thats some good free throw Music shooter former NCAA free throw percentage leader with an assistant coach here Arya 77 46 that would have been Andy in now theu head ah trivia not my strong suit I noticed no yeah Rich Man Andy Enfield back here in Tallahassee against Florida State in SMU big block from Neu he wants a second hes got a second wants a third third time not a sharp hey the young Canadian look at him hes hyped he get in there loving it big energy burst playing with the contact look he goes up on him nope not today come on Marcus KS come back at me hes sweating at them all get those shots out of here its like a human floss water down there are Music you B knocks down the first free throw your catch phrases are coming along Im relaxing Im relaxing dont make my sheet out yeah Kell knocks them both down 77 48 final game for Florida State and Western Carolina before they break for the Thanksgiving holiday need to oh thats a beautiful Zone break Florida State executes to Perfection and Thomas on the dunk a ball movement Arya theyve been talking about it since Connecticut teamwork moving the ball this Leonard amilton team has done a good job at least in The Limited sample set of breaking opposing team zones and need to it doesnt matter if the whistle is gone my dudes F hes coming at the mouth just dying the block look at that just quick catch didnt even hold it in his hand KN to just toss it right to Thomas and took off running down the court like a looking like Steph Curry shooting the three but you know they got a really excited about KN to here in Tallahassee its another big man who can really spread the floor and get things done in Leonards system hes 611 210 lb from Whitby Ontario the top 40 power forward Illinois kraton pit Utah a lot of big schools recruited him Davis that could have been goal tending two different ways I think Teddy Valentine will have to look at it it looked like it was initially goal tending on Western Carolina and then goal tending on Florida State in the cylinder baby right in the cylinder NE threw it down but you can see the way nes walking around the court Leonard Leonards lob for it like talking about it but Teddy going to go check it out with Don Music Applause Daly a nice little layup off the glass theyre right there thats goal tending CU it hits the glass first and then the cylinder violation from the wiy anterior native sink 11 off the glass they will count the basket for Florida State so it was go tending first before the cylinder violation like a basketball expert over there are you I dont even believe what I said sometimes you just Babble and hope it makes sense 8148 5 and a half to go Stanbery Inside Out dribble pull up midrange thats pretty you practice that in the gym before and after every practice dang three ball oh off to the right guyss not seing an open look he doesnt like his streak is at seven right now every game this season of making at least one threepoint shot thats in Jeopardy over the next 518 the course Danbury the Pepperdine transfer which not a lot of folks would turn down Malibu for kwi North Carolina but theyre both beautiful places and a lot of fun things to do but man hes got a sweet little jumper when he gets a clean look at it Mass substitutions for Florida State got the starting lineup back in one more little quick rep I would assume going into the media timeout at four minutes and then probably see some more Fresh Faces we were trying to give CJ Highland some love earlier feel like this will allow you to expound on that as being the best pickle ball player on the team and he knocks down the first free throw to give you a chance to talk about hey well we asked we asked coach craft what he did to bond his team with the new staff and he said we did a lot of coaches versus player competitions whether it be volleyball whether it softball they did some hiking and he said they played pickleball and I said hey lets get to the real question whos the best pickle ball player on the team he said hands down CJ Highland played tennis in high school and he dominates the rest of the crew hows your pickle ball pretty solid man lets go turnover on Florida state that is their 14th turnover here of the game they forced 17 of them on the defensive side the next five minutes for Florida State just trying to ice this game away Sansbury Livingston someone may look at this AR and go why do he got those guys back in the game but those other kids cant play 10 minutes they have to come out of the game to get a break you know they you know they got to regroup and and then come come back in Collins sticks the two and its 8154 not sure what euan was trying not on the same page as B Bowen who didnt cut so backto back turnovers now for Florida State and Coach Hamilton I dont think he cares if hes up big were up by one timeout taken by the no veteran head coach wants to finish this game cleanly yeah its like you youre going to be out here you just will get better no matter what the score is you want to execute your offense you want to execute your defense and not kind of like learn bad habits you know and thats thats what hes talking about you can see the passion in his face hes excited about it and a new wrinkle when the NCAA committee decided to Value the net rankings margin of Victory now matters for your net ranking and so for Florida State and again I mean this with the best purehearted intention for Western Carolina fans at home the NS would like to win by as many points as possible because it helps those ratings potentially come March theres some coaches suffered that last year with like w for suffered it last year didnt get in you can look over to the SEC where Texas AM suffered the same thing where they had great games great teams were right on The Fringe and they didnt get in because of some metrics that dont really always calculate out the way you think makes Music sense you got to go with the float literally and let the points float 81 54 with your Tim crafts you played better in the second half its 3228 Florida state in the second half alone you moved the ball a little bit better protected it turned them over turned Florida State over no job something to build on for a young team thats only played now this is their third game against D1 opponent of the year out of five total games and a shot clock violation vintage Leonard Hamilton defense strikes again and thats what happens when it turns into a little bit of reactionary hter Skelter defense the offense kind of loses track of where they are with the clock especially when theres like a deflection which is exactly what happened on that possession but but you said that about Coach craft into catamounts you know theyve got a murderers row so to speak playing four high major division ones with weight Florida State Marquette and Tennessee but those nondivision one games help him to like help his young team not get beat up how about that no look pass by the way and J with the knockout punch from the corner yeah another three ball hes got four of them tonight approaching a career highight 14 for the NS outstanding Junior Jackson to HT saying get in the weight room big fella Ive been in there what have you liked about the nlls here tonight you know the defense honestly and theres been some great possessions theres been some bad possessions but as a whole the ball movement and sharing the ball just like they did this past weekend up in Connecticut and the defense hasnt fallen asleep even against even though theyre against somewhat of an inferior opponent and kenpom gave Florida State an 80 chance to win this game tonight Ken palom Roys ratings a 19point projected win Vegas right there with him when the line was at 20 and a half but the catamounts theyve played hard and theyve got the makings of a solid team with this FSU team the length and athleticism and the unselfishness here look at that pass and Watkins right there deep showing you hes ready the pride of Ky North Carolina the Western Carolina catamounts the connection with Florida state is actually Todd Raleigh coached baseball at Western Carolina that is hilarious what is a catamount you might be curious a wild cat is such as a cougar a bobcat or a Lynx its a good photo there which animal is that Jacob Im tossing that to your expert analysis oh is that a cougar thats a cougar that was

the story so Im going to tell it to you folks the Catamount selected by Western Carolina in the early 1930s they were looking for a mascot and it was down to the catamounts or to the mountain Boomers so whats a Mountain boomer that was my natural question everybody moved to the mountains its a wild squirrel oh so you could be a squirrel or a cat and Coach Pondexter at Western Carolina in the early 30s for football said he wanted his team to be a quick attacking Lightning Fast sneak attacking yeah Ty youre going to be way more impressive if youre a cat versus a squirrel thats thats thats the story I hope you liked it 215 left to play in this game stand anbury why not thats going to go out of bounds to Florida state but I was saying Todd Ro Jacob varar goes thats our Catamount also known as shimmeron I dont think a horse is in the same family on the cat in any shape no not even ones got hes ones got PS they do both have to clip their feet whether its a hoof you have to trim a hoof
