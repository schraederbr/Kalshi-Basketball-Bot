second alltime matchup between these two teams and the first music time theyve gotten together in 15 years The tip is won back by the UCA Bears and UCA under head coach John Schulman with a five and seven start to the year but 0 and6 away from home Well 0 and six though but going to North Carolina Vanderbilt Arkansas Tough opening schedule Like we said Cameron Hunter is going to be their goto guy in this one And rising over Bofy Miller comes up short Deron Pierre Jr in the starting lineup again for SMU Their second leading scoreer along with BJ Edwards Bofy Miller Washington and Yigolu Washington lofts a three It comes off but the rebound by Gigu tipped down to Edwards Heat gets a second crack at it and tips it home Great job by the Mustangs on the offensive glass early The Bears have to control that phase of SMUs attack for the Bears of UCA This has been their starting lineup for most of the year Hunter at one of the guard spots along with Robinson and Moore and the forwards McCormack and Marble the freshman and really the only true post player The freshman point guard Luke Moore has called for the travel inside as he spun in on Boopy Miller and a giveaway by the Bears Well you saw the Bears spreading the floor early They have what is called the old Princeton offense High post four outside lots of cutting to the basket SU will have to be sharp on D today Mustangs at home for the first time in a month They were seven and0 to start the season and then played fourth straight against SEC opponents away from home Great job by Yigulu out of the double to find Edwards cutting to the bucket Yeah you dont see very many 72s that can pass like IU Great start for SMU Yiku this year 14 assists versus 17 turnovers Lets take a look at the keys to the game coach Well certainly for Central Arkansas they got to have better interior defense than theyve shown so far And theyve got to hit some threes SMU handle changing defenses of Central Arkansas and theyve got to dominate the boards which they have started out doing Another nice find by Yiglu over the top TO PIERRE WHO DROPS in the dribble backto back huge assist one better than the other by some Yigu Giron Pierre had that fantastic game against Texas AM a couple of weeks ago He has carried on from that He went back to New Orleans and played against LSU last time out did not a week ago have the kind of game he wanted to with 16 points trying to resurrect back here at home 19 points a game slashing to the bucket Cameron Hunter who started his career at UCA went to Wisconsin for a year and now hes back in Conway Well that was great penetration by Hunter SMU did not have help coming Goofy Miller settles on the three Hes been good from outside this season but off to the right Luke Moore pulls down the rebound And hes got kind of an old man game at the point guard spot as coach says Well hes under control shows lots of poise especially for a freshman Swiped away by Washington The rebound to Yigolu SMU likes to get out in transition One of the best teams in the nation when it comes to fast break points but UCA back defensively PIERRE RISES AND FIRES AGAIN AND ITS Bottoms once more Backtoback threes by Veron Pierre Jr Well great spacing early by SMU Terrific passing in the basketball Sharp start for the Mustangs Bears want to take away the inside stuff Theyll give you the three as Ty Robinson slips to the cup Theres the Princeton offense Absolutely All about cutting hard to the basket Central Arkansas did it well right there McCormack with the bounce pass on a dime It is better to give than receive And out front McCormack is called for the foul although he may have taken the worst of it as he went headtohead quite literally with PJ Edwards Jr Central Arkansas starting two freshman here this afternoon The guy hitting the hardwood right there and then Cole McCormack is a 66 sophomore Marble 66 freshman Moore the point guard 62 SMU one of the elder teams in the nation but UCA quite the opposite John Schmans team one of the younger teams in the nation well certainly they have a roster full of youngsters and the coaching staff for central Arkansas expects this team to really be good by the end of the season when they competing in the sun conference and again the changing defenses this time his own goofy miller into the lane gives it up to Edwards cranks the three and hits it Nothing but twine for DJ Edwards Boy what a dynamic duo SMU has out front Not many teams can match Miller and Edwards on the perimeter Edwards was just one of 20 over his last five games If hes hitting threes watch out Washington knocks it away Steps to the hoop and scores Great speed by Washington right there Good concentration to get the finish How about that Heads up play by MOOSEY MILLER Boopy with the cookies and the milk this time of year Boopy Miller with his first two And its a quick seven first for SMU thanks to the defense Luke Moore getting downhill Wild out of control Edwards tears away the carum He had a triple double earlier this season against another Arkansas school Arkansas State HERE COMES EDWARDS SLASHING INSIDE takes the feed from Pierre and makes it go SMU putting on a passing to basketball show so far Great teamwork for the Mustangs continues Five assists on eight made baskets for SMU Less than 5 minutes in and its a 9 run Can the Bears steady themselves Yeah UCAs road schedule has been tough Oh dear another theft EDWARDS UP THE FLOOR PIERRE WINDING IN TRANSITION rushing it around on the reverse HIGHLIGHT REAL STUFF Welcome back to Moody for the SMU Mustangs It is showtime and Moody Magic early on 610 freshman Jaden Tombs back in this lineup The freshman missed the start of the season with a wrist injury and today marks his first home game back after four straight games on the road Tombs was ranked as high as number 38 by ESPN in high school and had a fantastic last game against LSU with 16 points and shooting eight for 10 So Tomb said hes excited to be playing in his first college home game after many DMs asking when hed be back Coach Enfield said hes made his way as their goto sixman and has really big expectations for him this season Hes definitely happy to see him back on this floor right now Seven points three rebounds a game through his first four appearances as a freshman He has been very impactful coach Well his very acclaimed high school player way out in Amarella Texas Certainly meeting all expectations so far And SMU expectations exceeded it maybe with an 110 run into the break Five to shoot it now for UCA trying to get things going Harrison Beum the Australian out front for a leaning three by Javon Guy King A bailout triple for the leading threepoint shooter for the Bears Yeah Guy King came into the game having hit 16 out of 42 threes That was a tough tough defended effort Mustangs defense looked good Just a great shot by Guy King that snaps an 110 scoring drought Meanwhile SMU had hit their last six field goals until a Pierre missed from the corner The tie ball possession arrow will stay right here as SMU claims their third offensive rebound of the game Its tough to keep big cement Gigu at 72 off the O glass Well Igotulu has really impressed me today especially with his passing And thats a big improvement from his skills as a freshman to what he is now as a sophomore You sealing up keeping it high double teamed underneath and a foul is called as Truman Burn another Australian for UCA reaches in and a guy that John Schman calls the nicest guy alive commits the foul Now this is just what Brie was talking about Central Arkansas wants to double down on the post Got the foul in the effort Threepointer off the MARK BY EDWARDS MILLER STRIPPING IT AWAY Fantastic hands by Boopy Miller and he lays it home Quick hands quick feet quick reactions Boopy Miller does it all Guy King who just had that three for UCA running the offense Big dude 66 Hand off for a fade away three by Ty Robinson Hes a great shooter Has had a tough start to the season but that is a good look for Ty Robinson Well we said one of the keys they have to hit some threes today How about the last two for the Bears Edwards nearly dislodged Good defensive work by Guy King and its knocked out Last touch by Edwards And the Bears getting after it defensively music and forcing the first turnover by SMU And John Scholman second season as UCA head coach back in the division 1 game after 5 years at Division 2 Alabama Hudsville taking them to the national tournament He also had success at Chattanooga about a 500 record over a decade at Chattanooga Something else that sets him apart he has one son an assistant coach and another son playing for him Interesting man Coach Schilman Hes big on family And if he was not going to move his family out to Conway unless it made sense that logo triple right at the base of the S for Javon Guy King Well three straight three balls by Central Arkansas THE KEY FOR THEM KEEP MAKING THEM Poopy Miller wraps it around finds BJ Davis Ray another freshman in the corner ONeal Jr is out there too A third freshman in this alignment Tombs going to work from the baseline Stripped from behind out of nowhere Ty Robinson makes the defensive play And UCA on a 60 run looking for more Spot up three by fires it short Grabs his own miss Beat him for three Thats long Another offensive rebound Ty Robinson after the miss Well what great effort by Ty Robinson The coach called him a great competitor How about that cut to the basket Beautiful work by Tyler Lee reading the Mustang defense and hurting the Mustangs defensive effort Ty Robinson with the rebound and the beautiful assist to make it an 80 run over the last minute 18 Central Arkansas the nation according to Ken Pal Meanwhile SMU has a ton of experience on their side The second most experienced team in the nation Well certainly miss started the game having that kind of experience pay off but Central Arkansas has come back quickly in this game by hitting three straight threes Yeah it was an 110 run for SMU Then an 112 run right back the other way And its a sixpoint game This offense for SMU trying to get creative with Poopy Miller backing his way in Seven to shoot inside Gigatou hook shot with the left hand Kisses it home Nice job by Igotulu reading the defense Looked over that right shoulder Why not continue Got the good bank for the bucket Four points three rebounds two assists Offensive foul the other way as big Javon Guy King leans on Booby Miller John weve played almost nine minutes in this ball game We still have not had a trip to the free throw line Great defense by SMU right there causing that foul SMU 70 at home this season coming off a two and two trip Some of it on the road some of it neutral sights All against SEC teams Yiku again holding it high looking finding middle and the lemur kisses it down by BJ Davis Ray for his first two Well thats good coaching keeping Yatulu to keep that ball up high where he can see his cutters Hes making great passes today against the Princeton style offense where the center is normally the point guard You know Yugatu doing his best impersonation Hes got three assists already Big size mismatch but the miss inside by Guy King Ricochet ball last touch by the white shirts of SMU Nice job by Guy King reading the SMU defense He basically had the whole right side of the floor cleared for him where he could operate to the basket Here we go Looks like a hockey match A whole We got five out five in Both these ball clubs a lot of depth for the Bears on the baseline grinding his way back in Guy kick or rather Hunter getting it back and trying to go to work against Germaine ONeal Jr dribbling it music off his foot and out of bounds Its giveaway number six for UCA Great footwork by that freshman ONeal defensively right there Stayed down low Slid those feet well Those chartreuse colored shoes or whatever Moving well for the freshman Washington gets doubled and its either going to be a foul or an over and back And theyre going to get the freshman Marble I believe Yeah Number 25 with the foul The Central Arkansas team as you can easily see theyre very aggressive Theyre not going to let SMU get the best of them in effort Playing hard 14th foul on Central Arkansas None so far for SMU playing at home SMU has two games left in nonconference at home before hitting conference play They will host North Carolina on the 4th of January LOB his head ABOVE THE RIM AS HE DUMPS IT HARD WELL Buffy Miller now showing not only is he a great scorer but how about the Mustangs leading assist maker getting it done right there Miller has three double doubles this season including a couple of 10 or more assist PICK made by BJ Davis Ray slice it to the basket Another live ball turnover means a live ball basket Well Davis Ray he is another outstanding freshman for the Mustangs showing us why they had the number four recruiting class in the country this year Hes already marked his career high Four points Hes done it twice Cameron with an aggressive move but no dice Yiglu hands to Boopy Miller SMU best and they get out in transition Miller diving ONeal from straight out front Gigolu just too much size at 72 Miller fires it UP AND IN AND SMU continues to rock and roll from deep Hunter had great blockout position on Igatulu Nothing he can do about it is 63 against the 72 Egulu Another 110 run for SFU AND YATULU SAYS ABSOLUTELY NO And it also to make matters worse goes off of Luke Moore out of bounds as he was laying there An emphatic block Terrific drive to the bucket right there for the Central Arkansas Bears SMUs defense just better for SMU Sam Walters is on for the first time Hes missed his last six with an ankle issue Offensive rebound claimed by Mitchell Holmes after the Boopy Miller miss And another foul coming against UCA team foul number five Its the second on Cole McCormack the starting guard SMU doing a fantastic job on the offensive glass Every front line player going hard to the offensive rebounding areas for SMU McCormick second Poopy Miller takes a seat for SMU Game of run so far in the truest sense as SMUs doubling up the Bears so far ONeal shows and goes Short corner handoff Holmes Oh the advantage inside Works his way around Marble Pursuit Great job by SMU attacking the two3 zone that time by Central Arkansas Get it to the baseline Big man cut to the bucket You get good results They did 11 assists on 16 made baskets How about the sharing by SMU great teamwork so far Guy King has made a couple threes Instead its Hunter out front with Davis Ray slapping at it Hunter step back three and a statement A beautiful execution by Hunter right there Of course he transferred to Wisconsin last year back to Central Arkansas this year Their leading score at 16 a game Does it right there Nice to have a guy who has done it at the highest level and feels like he belongs WOW WHAT A PASS DOWN TO WALTERS on the move But star and circle that pass by BJ Davis Ray threading the needle SMU is putting on a clinic on find the open man They find him they make the perfect pass so many times so far today First bucket bucket for Walters since returning to the lineup Guy King lofts it Keep point another loco triple Central Arkansas doing the best they can Outsized outstrength out quick but they are making it happen from the perimeter Edwards Jr in rhythm in and out on the three and on the rebound The foul is going to go against UCA as we head to a timeout 744 music left in the first quarter Coliseum And we all know that coach Enfield is quite the college basketball resume but some may not know he actually got his start music coaching in the NBA And thats how he got his style of play on offense In the NBA they dont call a lot of plays They trust their music players to play based on the situation to make the right pass or shot We saw that insanely fast style of play with a few first minutes of this game The Mustangs have 14 points off turnovers and 12 assists Quite the track meet by the Mustangs Jim Yeah just the third turnover for the Mustangs right there coming out of that timeout Great shooting game so far SMU hitting 68 Central Arkansas 50 And SMU one of the higher paced teams in the nation averaging just 15 seconds per possession at his top 25 in the country Cameron Hunter gets the body from Sam Walters and earns a trip to the line for the first time in the game Free throws for either team Hunter will tow it Yeah thats amazing Go 12 and a half g minutes into this game as physical as it is without a free throw Camden Hunter showing his versatility right there Beautiful job by the 63 leader of this music Central Arkansas Bears team And the Walters foul is the first on SMU in the first half So Cam Hunter been in double figures each of the last 11 games Has a careerhigh 33 accomplished that against Queens back in 2022 2023 for UCA And this lefty plays with a lot of poise Definitely the heart and soul of the Central Arkansas ball club And the one guy on our team thats probably gone through puberty says John Filman Nine points so far for Cameron Hunter SMU still controlling play though Central Arkansas continuing to change defenses Back manto man now Wing three by Pierre Hes in rhythm but unable to hit Robinson blocks out for the board and pushes Well a great block out by Robinson that time This teams very fundamentally sound Sometimes you just cant block out against a 72 even if youre in position Definitely a team that has gotten better compared to last year Robinson on the three unable to hit and SMU will be called for the foul Stays right here A second on Walters Yeah going to get Giron Pierre that time coming over the back Mustangs music and they changed it to Walters So thatll be the second on Walters as Yatollah comes music back in and Mitchell Holmes is out Now both ball clubs continuing to tack very aggressively on the glass SMU out rebounding right now Oh look at those quick hands right there There you go Cory Washington good example of this feisty SMU defense music SMU eight and a half steals per game Thats fourth in the ACC They have four already So many times right before Christmas break be a little unfocused That does not appear to be the case for either team Well be going to the break after this one Guy King offbalance three doesnt call but Hunter Brownsby rebound swift away for a moment but the Bears grab it back No look feed Guy King underneath and he powerfully takes it inside and earns foul shots Javon Guy King who has a season high 13 already up to nine and looking for more And I believe hes tied his career record Hes already made three threes in one game Great pass Tell you John this ball music game right here is a great example of terrific teamwork by both teams The passing is just extraordinary Its a shame that two teams have to take a week off after this but got to get a little time off John Schman said he loved the fact that they were near a major airport to let their guys get away at screaming the end of the day Guy King double figures already and he will be going after his career high today Hes already at 11 and again his careerhigh 13 Hes done it twice this year 11 is the lead for SMU with Jim Hower Brie Sorenson and the whole crew Im John Little Rookie Miller at point guard right now So its Edwards feeding it inside Tombs unable to handle the high pass Jon Guy King with the steel Scoops it up to Robinson Takes it baseline Nice extra to Hunter LINES UP THE THREE AND DROPS IT IN CAMERON Hunter up as well How about that spacing by Central Arkansas Great ball movement The passing fantastic a game of sports Its a 100 run for UCA Pierre able to hold it away from Hunter over the top Tombs has the rebound and kisses at home Everybody thats played has scored All 10 for SMU How about the great hands by Tombs right there Tough ball handle but he made it happen SMU back up by 10 stops the run but Ty Robinson starts one of his own dropping through at D3 But as Central Arkansas came into the game known AS A POOR OUTSIDE shooting team only 30 from threepoint land changing that opinion quickly They needed to hit threes to stay in this one as Robinson sneaks in from the backside and forces the turnover A great effort on the part of both ball clubs so far A lot of depth being shown here John SMU has played 10 Central Arkansas has played nine Andy Enfield the secondyear head coach at SMU 33 and 13 15th year overall Hes closing in on 300 wins for his career just six shy Well pick that up in the new semester Robinson back door Nobodys there Reverses it home Its a fivepoint game Yeah another good example of what we call the Princeton offense Get it to the high post Other players right to the bucket Already the third pair with at least 10 points Wraparound feed to Edwards Three lined up Stick back jam The second of the first HALF BY TERMAINE ONEAL JR SNU continuing their assault ON THE OFFENSIVE GLASS GREAT JOB once again for the Mustangs I thought he mistimed it because it kept bouncing around but he seemed to just hang there Offensive foul on UCA Now Coach Schulman still fussing Thought that was offensive goalending here Well take a look again Couldnt tell from that angle if the ball was off the orange Oh that was close but uh we play on What a great game so far One of the very few things that you can possibly review on the mens side this year but it is not something that John Schman is going to choose to review at this point SMU by seven It led by as many as 15 Poopy Miller thought about the three and a hand in his face takes it toward the glass sets up ONeal Junior drops in the three sinking the defense Miller two feet in the paint and he hits ONeal for the triple Now the SMU freshman continue to shine here this afternoon at Moody Coliseum Mustangs back up by 10 John Poopy Miller on the double double pace with seven points five assists Foul called against SMU as Ty Robinson skips toward the glass Well both ball clubs driving hard to the bucket here drawing another foul on SMU We didnt have many free throws in the first 12 minutes but catching up quickly in that category now Mustangs have not been to the line as of yet but UCA will go there for the fifth and sixth time music John Schulmans team one of the four free throw shooting teams overall this season just 61 when theyre playing division one opponents You know thats a very good point John because coming into this game as a team Central Arkansass 63 to SMU 77 Thats a huge disparity Five for five to start with Bears Well its just like their threepoint shooting Robinson a great start competitive screaming guy His coach says he could go 0 for 12 or he could go six of eight from three Still going to get the same effort Hes got a dozen UCA back to within a sevenpoint spread Miller ripping around the screen Robinson called for the blocking foul First free throws of the game coming up for SMUs Boopy Miller Itll be a oneonone on the other side An athletic competitive game UCA making the bus trip to Dallas and holding right with the Mustangs music on But this uh orange ball just music keeps getting passed around by SMU Well every player thats touched the ball for SMU makes it happen with great passes Floors music facing perfect hitting a lot of outside shots How about Miller Great assist music right there He already has five assists in the ball game He and Egatulu have combined for nine assists Great move inside that time by Sam Walters Loopy Miller as you see the combined nine from Miller and Yiku And Yiku already has a careerhigh in assists with four And were only in the first half if you havent noticed Hoopy Miller leads the ACC in made free throws coming in with 77 Hes a 92 foul shooter in the front end of his one and one money Yeah What I like about Goofy Miller he does it on both ends of the floor Fourth in the Atlantic Coast Conference in steals this year Of course Edwards second in steals in the ACC Very ball secure point guard as well as he continues to refine that part of his game Second all time in SMU He has three assists to turnover ratio Miller nine first half points He leads all SMU scorers And then UCA has three different players in double figures 10point lead for SMU Breaking the press UCA Robinson quickly into the lane Bears cycle through the possession with the point guard Luke Moore Back out there the freshman from Little Rock Interesting SMU in that zone defense trying to slow down that Princeton attack that Central Arkansas has worked so efficiently Little indecisive for the Bears So Moore goes to work High floater kisses it No And ONeal whos had a big first half Pulls down the car Miller finds Edwards in the corner Checks his feet Rotates it to ONeal Ball fake back to Edwards Still 17 to shoot Sees the layers it underneath The int finish Another terrific pass that time Credit Edwards for the terrific assist for the Mustangs Good job by Igatulu positioning himself for the easy basket 14 helpers on 21 made baskets for SMU in this one And theyre right back into the zone defense In the middle Tyler Lee No look feed A little inaccurate Out to Cameron Hunter Hunter on the full twirl Short corner No offensive rebound falls to the freshman Marble Yeah how about Marble right there Beautiful job coming from that offside getting the air ball and putting it right back in for the Bears Ruby triple comes up and along and the rebound for Tyler Lee UCA keeping it a 10point game and just will not let SMU fully run away SMUs led by as many as 17 Robinson flips to the cup 14 in the first half alone What a great effort by Robinson I am so impressed with that young man He is tenacious At one time committed to Florida Atlantic and Dusty May but when Dusty May took the Michigan job UCA got Robinson services Its worked out really well especially this year Threepointer strong and on the rebound Marab disquing Yigolu and Cemet will go to the line for a one and one A gas A gas I tell you The batch for Central Arkansas Yeah Igotulo just continuing to impress in all phases of the game Moving well great use of his hands good passing music I mentioned earlier John this coaching staff has done a great job developing his hands So much better and stronger than last year I like the way theyve got him keeping the ball high where he can see his cutting teammates going to the bucket Theres a big reason why hes already got four assists in this game A one and one for Yigatu Place where his game could expand is the free throw line where hes 55 Tom Robinson pulls away another car Its his third to go along with a game leading 14 points Central Arkansas 2 minutes left in the first half Theyre definitely within spitting distance I like the way Central Arkansas is trying to get that ball to the free throw line area against this zone defense Moore steps in finds Robinson AND FIRST HALF HIGHLIGHT AFTER highlight for Ty Robinson HES UP TO 17 How about that performance A red shirt freshman coming in here and tearing SMU up in the first half TROCK JUST A POINT shy of his careerhigh And were only 19 minutes in Pull up down for Geron Pierre Jr Hes got double picks in the first half Now hes so consistent And if you leave him open hes going to drain it He is four of seven from the floor for SMU coming off that 35point game last time he was in the Metroplex in Arlington playing against Texas AM SMU back in that zone defense for the fourth consecutive time Robinson says WHY STOP NOW HIS TEAMMATES KNOW TO GET THE BALL IN THE HANDS OF THE HOTTEST MAN ON THE FLOOR Like Freddy Mercury dont stop me now 20 points and a careerhigh for Ty Robinson John this has been a fantastic offensive game so far by both teams We are lucky to be here man I got nowhere else to be Eatu touch Washington couldnt stop it I toldu looking for that fifth dime of the first half Central Arkansas has nailed their last four shots A negligible difference game clock to shot clock about 167 seconds has some use going back to mantoman defense as they should Central Arkansas got very calm confident against that zone Bird got downhill takes the bump backhand lay in No still time for SMU PIERRE GOOD AND IT GOES on by long and Central Arkansas brought their a game offensively in the first half Theyve been able to stay with the Mustangs hoping to at least get it them to 20 additional more threes for this second half Yeah like we were saying 32 points in the paint for SMU UCA prides themselves on not giving up those paint points See how the second half goes but the Bears are right there despite being down by 19 at one point in the first half Moore outside picked up by Gigatou Still 10 to shoot Well as coach Infield said he was not happy with their first half defense Looks very solid here on the first possession by the Bears but Hunter gets the good shot nonetheless SMU in smooth transition to Ron Pierre Jr A naturalb born score Steps back and sticks a three Well how about that strength right there Just lean forward pull back and drilled it That young man has got a bevy of offensive talent Hes done it at every level St A Gustin High School South Southern Miss I should say Witchah State Jacksonville State and now here at SMU Yeah Averaged right at 22 points a game last year at Jacksonville State in Conference USA And have a take a look right here Look at Geron Pierre just bumping his defender bouncing back using that strength and drilling it Good start for SMU in the second 20 minutes Getting downhill Luke Moore fires it out for an open three Way over the top go by McCormick and a chance for Boofy Miller to run outside Washington fills the gap Comes up short on the three SMU willing to take the good quick shot if youre open Andy Infield says Make it man Make it They had a good look right there Love taking that shot within 8 seconds Hunter off the mark but an offensive rebound by Ty Robinson The dudes everywhere Well as coach Schulman said Robinson is a great great competitor Bofy Miller comes from behind Cookies taking it away from the breast and scooping to the hoop Showing us why hes number four in the Atlantic Coast Conference in steals Boopy Miller literally does it all Great assist great shot maker good on D Hes in double figures with 11 And heres the second leading steels guy in the conference Edwards nearly thieving Robinson steps into it Thats a deep two I think if I was wearing a purple shirt Id make sure Robinson touched it every time down the floor The man is literally on fire Ty Robinson 25 from outside to start the season But John Schulman says hes just not a 25 guy Hes got to get it turned around And it looks like today is the day Loopy Miller the ball fake pulling it back Rocking the baby on the baseline feeds Iu quick Well great job by Yigulu reading that defense Just looked over that left shoulder dropped that left leg and got it the kiss off the glass Nice job by the big fella Turkish Thunder Four for four from the field Rumbling to the hole Marble may have gotten away with a walk Youre going to see right here partner Theres no maybe about that He did get away with the walk right there Everybody in the crowd is seeing it laughter Truman Burn comes on His girlfriend flying in from Australia Hasnt seen her in 4 months And John Schulman said I mean were going to get like absolute superstar Truman Burn or hes going to have a horrible game Theres going to be no in between Well hes a 610 freshman Him with the ball right there One of two Australians on this Central Arkansas ball club Coach Schman said we had to start recruiting them sight unseen because they played in a recruiting effort and theres going to be a technical foul here I think called against UCA I believe music Lets see Well double check So a foul on McCormick and its a double technical on music two 24s Thats why I was so confused I was like 24 which one Cole McCormack and for SMU cement Yiglu They pick up the double tax Yeah both continuing play very very aggressively here this afternoon Underneath Hunter going to work on Pierre and taking him to school Cameron Hunter at 63 Well how about that quick release Just found a crack in the SMU long arms and laid it in Nice job by Hunter Loopy Miller repenetrates Head fake ROBINSON SENDS IT AWAY PIERRE FLYING IN AND THE FOUL YOU TALK ABOUT great body control John Little this man right here is exhibiting it to us What a great job by Pierre Watch this right here Great concentration getting bumped from two sides Gets the finish for the Mustangs Putting SMU back up by nine Burn with those feet firmly planted inside the restricted area and nowhere to go as Giron Pierre Jr blew in like an eagle from the top of the key Well this young man is a great addition to this Mustang ball club He is an offensive machine At 1800 points coming into the matchup in 129 career games SMU back up by 10 and led by four at the break Heres the Princeton offense It lens through the center The handoff out front to Robinson Leaning a little on the three Yeah good defense that time on Robinson Forced him to be a little off balance on the release Edwards drifts baseline wraps it around to Miller trying to attack the zone stepping through bumping Miller a magic Well you talk about creative Thats what that move was all about He thought about it as he started He said I think Ill change direction He did it quite well Its kind of a slalom like were going to see in the Olympics next month Step back by Guy King Not able to make it go over Yigolu and a reach in loose ball called against Truman Burn His second foul Well what Central Arkansas needs to watch right now is not to get threepoint shot happy Just because they knocked down nine of 14 in the first half doesnt mean every one of them is going to go in Well thats true on the one hand On the other hand they music average 33point attempts per game anyway So thats kind of what they do music Thats ninth in the nation SMU much more aware of that statistic it seems this half out there pressuring the threepoint ball a little bit more efficiently 0 for four from the threepoint line in the second half for Central Arkansas with a nine of 14 start in the first half Here you see the changing defense again for Central Arkansas in a two3 zone this time Sam Walters out there Extra pass to Ron PIERRE JR LEFT ALONE IN THE CORNER ALL BY his lo No surprise there That man is automatic when he is left open I just love his poise He is always so calm cool and collected 19 to lead SMU scores Loose underneath was Moore but Yigulu runs him back out to the threepoint line 10 to shoot it SMU now up by 15 Their largest lead of the second half Moore slicing baseline Rejected underneath Yikatulu comes out with IT IN FOR TWOON ONE LAV UP HIGH THROW IT DOWN HARD SMU out and RUNNING WITH A 10 RUN AND A TIMEOUT CALLED BY UCA Great teamwork by SMU Good job by Edward Mustang family Please join us in welcoming Colise from Dallas Texas cheering applause Andy Enfields SMU Mustangs back up by 17 A big 100 burst over the last minute and a half Coach Hower there were a couple big leads like this for SMU in the first half but UCA came back every time So whats the defensive mentality right now for the Mustang Well I can already tell SMU much much more intensive on the perimeter defense to start this second half Thats why theyre run of 174 They scored 17 points in the first four minutes and 50 seconds of this second half SMU trying to keep the defensive intensity up but the Bears very capable of scoring Deum underneath hits the cutting Robinson his big day continues with 24 What a beautiful job by Robinson moving without the basketball Read read the SMU defense perfectly Very nice job Miller sails it over the top of Pierre and takes us to a timeout music The SMU Mustangs up by 15 cement eu filling the stat music sheet along with the rest of his buddies trying to hold off John Schmans team back into Dallas David B Miller court at Moody Coliseum the SMU Mustangs by 15 reclaiming a double digit lead thanks to Booby Boopy Miller and company here in the second half along Bree Sorenson and coach Jim Hower and the whole crew Im John Little But the UCA Bears have been there at every turn John Schulman trying to get this team turned around A school that has only had one winning season in the last 19 Underneath a creative finish for JBon Guy King despite Yikatu at 72 towering over him Guy Kings having a terrific game up to 13 points now for the Bears That was a terrific strong move under the hoop that ties his season high He did it against Vandy and he did it against Samford as well EDWARDS CORNER THREE REAR UP BJ Edwards big slumpbuster today Im telling you that young man is so impressive in all phases of the game He just plays the game the way its supposed to be Let it come to him When he needed he makes it happen Another 12 point score in this balanced attack Guy King shoulders off Miller feeds it inside with a mouse in the house Marville feeds it over the top of the air Yeah that 69 freshmans got a bright future in this Central Arkansas program Goofy Miller forced into the turnover as he was doubled perfectly right across midcourt OPEN THREE GUY KING RINGS IT IN HIS FOURTH OF THE DAY THAT was the first time we had seen Central Arkansas with that midcourt trap paid dividends immediately Three points as a result 11point game Theyre creeping Pierre in the middle calls his own number 21 for Jeron Pierre Well great job by Priierre Just looked at hey theres nobody here Im taking it all the way He did it And Japier Jr 20 point game number 36 of his career as Yikatu snaps it out of play Yikulo is playing so disciplined this afternoon in all phases of the game Right there on that block kept his arm straight up Didnt reach and draw the foul That young man is so much more mature offensively and defensively than he was last year McCormack in Kai King out a little bit tired And Yukatu with two blocks to go along with his eight rebounds in this one Playing well at both ends Hunter facing up Fires it out to the corner Robinson working on his career day Out to the corner Rim three byum and SMU makes sure its a one and done I TOLDU SLIPS UNDERNEATH WALTERS FOR THE JAM How about that great passing day continuing for Igotulu Great job of turning and finding his teammate breaking down the baseline So make it a careerhigh five helpers A handful for the big man from Turkey in the spin cycle Hunter out to beat him Hunter again now facing up on Yiglu moving his feet right with him and forcing the Theres Hunter kicks it out Theres that defensive discipline again for Igotulu slide leading his feet not reaching just playing the game the way it is supposed to be Great job by the SMU coaching staff developing that young man Its 72 He continues to improve BJ Edwards who leads the ACC in minutes at 35 a game comes out So does Yigatollu The capable freshman are on Germaine ONeal Jr along with Jaden Tombs playing in his first home game of his career What a find out to Pierre Offensive rebound Tombs after the missed three And hell go to the line to shoot two as Boo beat Miller drifted baseline and started that impressive offensive possession music SMU offensively trying to run Central Arkansas off the floor and leading by 15 Its hard being a student athlete and balancing basketball and studies So congratulations to both Boopy and Trey Man Trey hes obviously been studying a lot Hes so tired Big laughter yawns there But uh congratulations clears throat to Trey giving us the side eye Hes been trained He knows when the red lightss on hes on too Tombs with that last free throw for SMU coming off a terrific game last weekend against LSU when he went off for 16 points Playing well here again today He is Meanwhile Central Arkansas trying to hang around This could be a foul on Miller Luke Moore Hes just a freshman out of Little Rock Central High School But again his coach says hes kind of got this old man game that he refuses to get sped up and its just really crafty Yeah I like his poise out there Always under control Does a good job of reading the defense Really doesnt look to score very often He is a terrific leader on the floor Almost a 2 to1 assist to turnover ratio this season for him Yeah very impressive for anybody especially a freshman SMU in case youre wondering why theyre pulling away after that fourpoint lead at the half how about holding to Central Arkansas to only one of six on threepoint attempts after they went for nine for 14 in the first half Yeah UCA you said it in your keys to the game and well revisit as we go That knocking down the three was essential for Central Arkansas to hang around today Yeah SMU just too big and strong inside is evidenced by the fact Listen to this SMU 4620 in points in the paint Good job by Tyler Lee up to front Knock it away Come up with the steel on the other end Threepointer by Morris Wide open and its down Now just when I say he does not look to score whats he do Bounces out to that left wing finds the opening against the SMUD and drills it Joe M told us his shooting splits dont look very good this year and theyre intentionally trying to keep them down so nobody notices him uh you know and and doesnt try to poach him of course hes very much kidding but they really like the kid here in and out on the three and Burn pulls down the carum essential for UCA to come up with those defensive boards collects in the corner against Walters McCormack and more out there Great spacing continuing for Central Arkansas Drifting inside Lee loses his footing Leaning in Pierre comes out with the rebound Hes hot to trot Threepointer out of the corner Walters on the line drive Little long Yeah that that last possession by SMU started by a terrific defensive rebound by Pierre getting a long outside pass Can UCA come up with another long run to get back into this thing Well we asked starts with a foul We asked that same question back in the middle of the first half And did we see it once No we saw him come back twice in the first 20 minutes after I think you said they were down by what 19 at one time or 17 Thats exactly right Deficit Wow 191 17 another time Second half it was 15 Now its down to 12 This Central Arkansas team has a lot of fight a lot of determination You got a standup comedian for a head coach as well That was Im still laughing by that conversation we had with him the other morning He is just his his descriptive ability is over the top Wish we could play part of that tape It was just hilarious Absolutely People in Conway have a good one Going to make some noise in the Aon this year but right now theyre trying to make some noise in Dallas And coming into the game Parker Applegate for the first time the junior from Murphysboro Tennessee the D2 transfer hits the turnaround and UCA makes it a 10point game Yeah I hadnt seen much of him today but hes played in all 12 games for Central Arkansas so hes seen some good minutes Washington looks for Tombs against Applegate Tombs shoves him off Washington in rhythm comes up short and hits Tombs in the shoulder Offensive rebound for SMU Boy great hands by Tombs getting that retrieval Miller picked up on the switch dives kicks Washington ball fake inside Bully ball foul I like the way Washington just made up his mind He saw a split in the purple shirted defenders and said Im going to take it all the way Get him back to the charity strike for the Mustangs Thats the fourth on Truman Burn the Australian big man officially in foul trouble now trouble now with 925 left and they had Maraveel ready to check in Yeah you mentioned Truman Burn one of two Australians on this Central Arkansas team Washington a quiet day for the 13point a game scoreer but he has three Starting big man Marble back in for Burn One more for Washington Just a one of five day from the floor But keep going back to that guy Hes a great defender Yeah War consistent Came to SMU after stints at Witchah State and St Peters MILLER TAKING IT AWAY from Beichum and blistering to the right for two Normally Id say quick hands made that possible That time it was all about the quick feet Boopy Miller slid around before they knew what was happening Bip just gave it up Miller 157 Several steals as well in this one Robinson on the step through tie ball and its going back to SMU on the steel Yeah good help defensively for SMU Closing that driving lane quickly Look at Bofy Miller right here Quick feet quick hands The leading scoreer for the Mustangs adding to his total here this afternoon Now up to 15 for the game to go along with seven assists Came into this contest averaging six and a half assists per game Thats his third steel Got a chance at his fourth double double of the season MILLER A DEEP ONE A 30 40 AND HE ROLLS IT DOWN A HEAD SHAKER FROM BOOBY WELL now you talk about a threepoint shot That should have been a fourpointer He was so far out that time Way past the threepoint line And theres another 17point lead for SMU Every time UCA has fought back can they do it again Robinson been the head of the snake today finds more in the corner Ring up A RIM RATTLING THREE AND A TIMEOUT called by UCA to seize the momentum How about that Two threes out of the last four possessions for that freshman point guard for UCA Very impressive Just when you think UCA is out of it the Bears make a music big shot 14point lead for SMU Off the bat North Carolina coming to Moody on January 3rd Well how much is that to look forward to You mentioned it The blue blood indeed Thatll be a great great start for conference play especially since the Mustangs have them here at home at Clemson at Duke Virginia Tech at home You can find those games on either the CW or the ESPN family of networks with Jim Hower and Bree Sorenson and the whole crew Im John Little 14point lead for SMU Central Arkansas has hung around thanks to an excellent offensive day Can they continue to do so And the freshman Termaine ONeal Jr misses on the three However on the rebound the Bears Marble pushes away Jaden Tombs for a foul Meanwhile Central Arkansas straight into the AON and its Florida GF Coast coming to Conway the former team of Andy Enfield of course Well certainly that ASON in case youre wondering Stson Florida GF Coast Jacksonville Austin P Eastern Kentucky thats some of the teams in this Central Arkansas Conference Edwards twisting down to the elbow leaves it for Washington Only five to shoot and its picked off Luke Moore in the passing lane taking it away out of the zone defense Yeah Central Arkansas continuing to change their defenses very effectively Guy King on the fadeaway literally hes on the ground misses Pierre noer down low Nice follow through ONeal Pierre threepointer by Edwards in and out A terrific ball movement by the Mustangs They got the shot they wanted just couldnt get it to fall 7 minutes left Still time for this pesky Bear team thats been playing better and better as the season is going on You think about that game against Vanderbilt They were down by double digits at the half and you know came back to make it an even tighter game A really good team Thats a tough place to play at Vanderbilt who theyre still undefeated I believe and they only beat this Central Arkansas team by 11 But this Bears ball club theyve been at North Carolina at Arkansas at Vanderbilt now at SMU What a tough schedule Probably the toughest in the nation Really One of them for sure Look what I found Hoopy cheering looking for the dump I I think I saw rim I I saw Grim Well thats his fourth steal of the game his season high He had seven against Arkansas State earlier in the season Threepointer lofted and it falls right down to Robins and a rare miss Yeah that was too easy for him It was Here comes Miller Sets up Walters Floating three in the corner Its short Rebound kept alive by Yigu but right down to Luke Moore Moore up the floor Robinson flicks it in for the first transition points for UCA today Robinson continued to be effective in many ways that time out sprinting everybody for the easy two His 26th point of the game his careerhigh by far 14point lead still for SMU Yiku Good post position Little shoulder work displacing Marble and hitting the hook A perfect day for some Yiko Yeah use that elbow Use that shoulder Reading the defense perfectly John King had some big game shifting threes in the first half See where the Bears go for offense How about Cameron Hunter their senior leader Hunter takes Pierre down into the post twists against his dominant hand and misses but he goes to the line to shoot two Now as mentioned earlier Hunter plays much bigger than his 63 height Hes very effective inside or out I really like this young man and he is uh he is certainly a a smart smart basketball player Willing to go to the off hand there for the lefty wing You know a guy that John Schulman says kind of proves the grass isnt always greener as he starts his career at UCL He goes to Wisconsin doesnt work out hes back with the Bears And those are guys at the mid major level that you can you know lean upon to help the youngsters know its not always about the brighter lights 0 for two trip this time though And a double double for See Yikatu 10 points 10 rebounds by the six Yeah Movie Miller slowing it down now Trying to make sure they read this ar central Arkansas defense correctly in the zone got it to that open man on the baseline Robinson crashing in for the rebound Thats his seventh goal with 26 points Good delay Tough shot Doesnt fall Boy he gets that ball at the height of his release Beautiful job continuing by Robinson this afternoon A joy to watch Hes been putting in the work Theres no doubt about that PJ Davis Ray throws it into traffic Long lead pass Hunter underneath Double teamed and Bofy Miller makes it tough That booping that never lets up that time Sprinting hard to cover that long pass and then used the quick hands to get the deflection as Hunter tried to get the shot off Look at Buffy Miller come in here quick quick quick The extra effort a big part of the reason SMU is leading in fast break points 142 as Luke Moore gets musly against a bigger Sam Walters Boy the freshman continues to impress He is developing as this game goes on This is probably I dont have their statistics in front of me but this is probably his high game of the year against a major opponent for sure Hes had a terrific second half Great point by Luke Moore His season high 13 but it came against ETSU as you mentioned Well hes just made some big big plays here to keep Central Arkansas in this contest music Three really outstanding freshman starters for this team Coach Schulman and his staff have a lot to look forward to in this program Didnt get freaked out when they went to North Carolina Didnt get creeped out when they went to Vanderbilt And one for Cameron Hunter Hes just getting freaky Well no excuse for that now Hunters got great ability music and good strength but youve got to block out right there Only 63 He should not be getting an offensive rebound off of a missed free throw Not a good job by the Mustangs in music that situation Got to block out every time Up to 11 second chance points Second foul on Yugato music Cameron Hunter 16 on six of 11 shooting 31 minutes work Keeping the door a jar for UCA Yeah nice threepoint play that time by Hunter Up to 17 points now Ruth Miller pounding the rock with 20 points and seven assists Back against this 32 zone And as SMU go for offense Miller fires up the three Bangs it down THATS A KILL SHOT by Goofy Oh great quick release by Boofy Miller I just cannot believe Central Arkansas did not have him covered up They knew where he was going against that two3 zone Good job by SMU Miller having a career year from deep 42 coming in Nice move by Moore Sinks the defense Finds Applegate Extends the range In and out on the three now Beautiful release by Applegate Nice job of spacing the floor to get the open shot Pierre in transition Thats short I know SMU likes to shoot it quick but that was probably a little too quick with a 14point advantage And with 350 its not just that guy who stands at 7 foot2 but the SMU Mustangs music with a big lead in large part to the points in the paint advantage Coach Holler Well thats just phenomenal 52 to 24 and a lot of those made possible by the great passing of Yigulu Hes got the double double but hes made a lot of points in the paint possible Also SMU out rebounding Central Arkansas 3323 on the boards So dominant there Also big reason continuing for this breakaway in the second half after only lead by four at halftime as SMU has held them to only three of 10 from the threepoint line after nine of 14 in the first 20 minutes And UCA as you get a look there at under Enfield the points in the paint for SMU UCA is a team that forces teams to settle for the three but SMU didnt do that today Theyve been able to get their points in the paint They have done a great job of attacking Good behind the back slip Hunter gets it back into Yiglu Threepoint turn Make it a fourpoint Misses inside Yiku keeps it alive Great moves again by Hunter I love his creativity in the paint against a much bigger SMU ball club Edwards drops it over and Yigu finishes Yeah IO adding to his double double 12 points now to go with 11 rebounds and a six for six day from the field Robinson keeping his options open Finds the freshman point guard more Three minutes left SMU by 16 The comeback needs to start now but just limping it in and out Guy King from triple land Well that was a good shot Guy King was balanced up Hes hit three from out there today Good shot Good possession by Central Arkansas Egan Tulu in the island of misfit toys He lays it home Well he continues to keep that ball up high at 72 Their 65 defender cannot stop that Wow Seven of seven shooting 14 points And now its getting away from Central Arkansas after playing so well Davis Ray off the mark Offensive rebound BJ Edwards and hes got SMU using their depth very well here late in this ball game SMU has played 10 Theyve all been very effective And John heres whats really really good SMU played 10 All 10 have scored Thats very very unusual Very unusual And they did it in the first half too coach They had done it by the time they had put up 40 points Thats how spread out the scoring was early in this one Well Buffy Miller and Giron Pierre have combined for 44 of SMUs 90 almost half of their points by those two What else would you expect right Theyre two of the leading scorers in the conference right now Both in the top seven Of course the games leading scoreer continues to be Ty Robinson from Central Arkansas who has 28 Four out of six threes 11 of 15 from the field Heres to you Tyler Robinson Still a 20point advantage for SMU Its their largest lead And therell be a foul on Davis Ray the freshman caught grasping music on Cameron Hunter who earns a one and one You know Davis Ray was moving his feet early during that defensive effort but then started reaching and pulling and pushing and obviously you cannot do that Hunter is tough to defend when he gets in that paint area at only 63 he makes a lot of things happen Hes that guy on the UCA team thats like All right follow me guys Were going into battle and Im going to lead you Yeah hes so consistent I think we saw early in the in the telecast this is his 12th consecutive double figure scoring effort He averages 16 on the year and here he is already with 18 this afternoon 12 of those in the first half 78 foul shooter knocks down both Mustangs have had a propensity to go over 100 at home Theyve done it three times this year Theyre on the cusp today Tombs the big man inside not able to hit the hook shot over the freshman Yeah that was a good entry pass from Goofy Miller inside there Good effort Good possession by SMU being up by 18 late in the game Take their time work for the best shot available Robinsons been a great option THE BACK DOOR FEED OH BUT EDWARD STAYS RIGHT with him to knock it away Good team defense by SMU Great team defense Another good cut by Robinson But look at this defense coming from behind Edwards stealing the nice swat for the Mustangs What a great competitive game this has been by both ball clubs This is going to get Central Arkansas ready for a sun play Theyre not going to see anything like this Only eight to shoot it for UCA HIGH OFF THE GLASS IT GOES IN THE FOUL What a finish What great body control by Moore And he actually kissed that ball off the glass Above the square Lets look again This may be one of the highest off the glass efforts Ive seen in a while Yeah Way above the way above the square Great job by Moore He just continues to really really impress me Have a chance to go into double figures as he makes this one Young man from Central High and Little Rock earning his keep for sure Miller backs it up About a minute to go in Dallas Edwards for a kill shot Bye buddies Hope you find your dad How about that Edwards He has been so effective in all phases of the game today Three triples for BJ Edwards after hes won for his previous 20 Robinsons been huge Not able to knock that one down Are we going for 100 Are we going for 100 Germaine ONeal Jr says Oh no Well that was a good effort right there with the long pass down the floor If SMU hits that century mark it would be the ninth time in the N and the infield era at SMU to break the 100point barrier They have done it a lot over Think about this Infield is only less than a season and a half through his career at SMU The alltime most 100point games in the history of SMU basketball by a single coach is 12 by Doc Hayes back from 1947 to 67 And infield infield if he hits it today would have nine 100 point games Were talking about 20 years versus 47 games Yeah Of course we all remember Sunny Allen here and he played that run and shoot bow and he had 11 games that went over 100 So thats pretty impressive if youre a offensive fan SMU gets Chance Purer the red shirt freshman in Miller coming on out Nice game to wrap up before Christmas play Hes got one more noncon game before hitting ACC action Moore looking for double digits Slips it underneath and coming down the baseline Applegate somehow finding that pass and getting fouled in the process Well another terrific job by Moore the point guard for Central Arkansas I love the way that man creates penetrates and finds his open teammates cheering Now hes just getting started You can tell Well very cerebral Well and hes strong and he has great poise I going to look forward to keeping up with that young man Couple free throws for Parker Applegate Shot clocks off still running the offense 8 seconds left and now Edwards backs it off to the finish with 99 today And the SMU Mustang stay unbeat home 8 and0 on the year Coming back to Moody for the first time in a
