third season as the head coach of the Irish and Hubert Davis just his second season as the head coach here but of course many years as an assistant to Roy Williams played here in North Carolina as well a little bit early there have been earlier starts Carolina played a 10 oclock start out in Portland earlier this year hopefully everybody is wide awake and ready to go as the Tar Heels control the tip Notre Dame starting the game in mantoman lacheski guarding fake hot an immediate double team from the Baseline side and a corner three for Caleb love to give the heels the early lead well handled by North Carolina the double team comes baycott passes out of it and those are the kind of shots that Caleb loves is hitting theyre better shots because theyre in Rhythm what a pass leaky black finds Armando bacon and what a start for Carolina leaky black made a little pass fake and almost a look away and got the ball to bake out underneath that was beautiful both teams are down a player today Pete Nance we do not believe he is going to play hes been dealing with a back issue that punched him almost the entire game Wednesday against Wake Forest and Notre Dame is without a key guy off the bench and Ben Allen Lubin a freshman from Orlando so Notre Dame which now now they go Zone they are a small team this is really a perimeteroriented team and this is a 23 Zone the wings will come up a bit from the Baseline but they need to keep North Carolina out of the paint and have coverage around Armando baycot RJ Davis the step in two around and out in the rebound down to Dane Goodwin Notre Dame runs a lot of ball screen continuity they do run some set plays but theyre going to spread the floor try to draw Armando baycott away from the basket and then attack from there Goodwin inside slips between a couple of Defenders and lays it in I think Notre Dame is going to be able to score in this game because they can spread the floor if they knock some shots down and I think attacking the paint was smart off the top but the question is can they stop North Carolina The Freshman Seth Trimble getting the start as Carolina goes small the Trimble coming off a really good after Wednesday against the Demon Deacons and Caleb wobbus off to a good start here today well you can see that North Carolina when the Tar Heels get a ball reversal get it from one side of the floor to the other they can really attack it wont stay down for cormack Ryan and back comes leaky black the fifth year senior out of black with a careerhigh 18 points Wednesday against wake including three threes bacon rebound lasheski one of the better rebounders in the conference averages about eight rebounds a game but the overwhelming majority of his rebounds are on the defensive end Notre Dame is not an offensive rebounding team and Jay a change in the starting lineup for the Irish as lachevski lays it in and an and one opportunity Trey wurtz whos now going to check into the game he had started every game this season but Demarcus Hammond is getting the start for the Irish today watch luccheski here he just slips this screen doesnt get all the way to it because bacock was on his outside shoulder and youre going to see Notre Dame try to do this a lot in this game weak side help a little bit late getting there because the floor is so spread because Notre Dame shoots it so well from every spot on the floor averaging a careerhigh 134 points per game hes a very good first pro shooter but he left that one well short he was item number one you would have to believe on the Carolina scattered report he made six threes against him last year and seven in a game in this building two years ago Carolina is moving the ball really effectively early on in this game all their shots have been good shots because the ball is moving and players are moving against those two three Zone and RJ Davis coming off a seasonhigh 27 Wednesday against wake knocks down the three leaky black guarding Dane Goodwin thats a key matchup for Notre Dame black one of the best defenders in the country with his length and athleticism and Goodwin shooting 46 from Beyond the arc on the season the drive here left hand too strong black steps into the elbow kept Alive by bacock and wave it off its an offensive foul on Armando baycow businesses Applause Dane Goodwin taking it just outside the restricted Arc for the First on bake out heres JJ Starlin The Freshman from Baldwinsville New York his last couple of years a high school in Indiana top 20 Prospect coming in this season JJ starling is one of the most consistent scores terrific pass with the screening and movement thats putting North Carolina in some positions especially Armando baycott positions hes not usually in Trey wurtz the assist hes the team leader with three and a half per game Mike Grays teams always known for being good passing teams trying to get high percentage looks bacon fouled anytime Armando baycott gets the ball inside you can expect Notre Dame to come with the double team here its Cormac Ryan coming from the Baseline side intelligently baycott dribbles out of it and makes the skip pass across and those are great shots for North Carolina the ball movement the ball fake the pass fake and then an easy shot for RJ for time in that stretch they beat Michigan they played well in the second half beat Wake Forest 8879 on Wednesday but Huber Davis would be the first to tell you Jay this team has obviously had its ups and downs the court with the exception of manic Fernandez and again Nance after an injury today the core is basically the same as a year ago so you dont want to say they cant get back to the kind of hikes they reached last year because they did it last year and I think if you compared last year to this this team has performed better to this point in the season than last years team did against the schedule but North Carolina has all the pieces to be a national championship Contender and Armando baycott switching off on JJ Starling blocking that he averages just under one and a half blocks per game but took that out of the sky with his left hand boy Chuck Baseline jumper off the inbounds for Dane Goodwin his second bucket of the game always ready to shoot when the ball arrives his last three games shooting 52 percent from the field was Prior four he shot 25 percent so hes on an upward Trend played through a sinus infection and the Irish has lost to BC on Tuesday a game that Notre Dame LED for the first 37 minutes but then couldnt close it the Eagles closed it on a 174 run boy what a steal by leaky black they just took that right out of the hands of lashesky love the kick Trimble ski was right behind him and theres going to be a late call there on Nate lashewski as he was kind of trailing the play and evidently got a piece of Seth Trimble he caught him on the the left hip as he was recovering just after he let the ball go Trimble didnt even know he was there so Trimble to the line The Freshman from Menomonee Falls Wisconsin who played extremely well in the second half against Wake Forest tremendously athletic and he can really get down and guard hes one of the best freshman Defenders I can recall and he its like he was born in a stance hes explosive stays in front how many times youve seen baycat do that well thats a Carolina staple on a missed free throws to tip it back and thats why Notre Dame has to be prepared when it comes back that can help start your fast break if youre alert the Irish beat the heels up in South Bend a year ago again luceski had a big game six threes great effort by Cormac Ryan and he kicks it back out good recovery by North Carolina especially leaky black to take away that offensive rebound three this is Marcus Hammond transferred from Niagara rejected by Trimble shot clock at four Ryan knows it gets it off around and out and the rebound down to the heels North Carolina in mantoman theyre switching just about everything thats putting Armando bake out on a lot of guards out on the perimeter Trimble for three tip backed out by leaky black Grimble was open but still should have driven the ball there just because youre open for the shot doesnt mean you have to take it shot fake and drive the clothes out the Carolina taking a lot of Threes And The Irish the team known for taking threes theyre all for one theyve only attempted one threepointer in the game well North Carolinas taken away the three but thats opening up drives and I think Hubert Davis calculating cam Notre Dame make enough twos to beat you and actually make that the Irish have yet to attempt a three in this game until this moment and it goes for hammer Marcus Hammond transferred into Notre Dame from Niagara where he averaged over 18 points a game a lefty that again is on an upward Trend he started the season out injured Applause double team by Cormac Ryan he went to it and then came back from it loved boy everything but the Finish Bay caught Corrals the rebound and lays it in Nate lashewski right there to grab that rebound but it took that extra little bounce that allowed baycott that extra time and baycot just a magnificent offensive rebounder averages just under five offensive boards a game he was third in the nation in that department Goodwin again driving and again couldnt lay it in with the left hand Goodland saying to the official hey I got a hit man this is often the case in Notre Dame games long stretches without a whistle they play zones sometimes they rarely foul Applause dominating around the offensive glass and what really made that play for Bangkok was the cut by RJ Davis when he cut Baseline bacott looked at him and that opened up the middle for him to get into that left shoulder that was a really good cut by RJ Davis reflection lachevsky gave a little brown too didnt want to pick up that second foul good fake great defense by Trimble to take it away thats what a recovery looks like and Trimble is headed to the freethrow line Seth Trimble making an impact at the defensive end of the floor and when we come back Jay bill is 94 feet with RJ Davis the honors keep coming for RJ Davis Music at Domino he choose one gamewinning three that you hit or gamewinning assists that you pass youre not a passer score all right I hear youre uh youre getting into cooking how did that happen so basically I just call my mom for help you know Im not there yet so I have the phone propped up in to help me go through it whats your signature dish now I probably say its pork chops corn uh best New York City point guard youve ever seen Walker all right Armandos hamburger leaky blacks tenders or your burrito which is best my burrito for sure whos the best dancer on the team not even close 94 feet a nice young man very competent in his dancing ability and also very proud of his Cajun burrito part of his nil deal Armando Bakers got a burger leaky black has chicken tenders that you sampled last night pop Johnsons got a turkey burger as well the uh the chicken tenders were actually quite delicious I love them a loose ball winds up in the hands of Goodwin and hell lay it in to tie it up for the Irish all right then Goodwins gotten hit twice going up for layups misses one right around the rim the rebound down to words as Mike Rays gone to Matt Zona physical guy number 25 of the Blues 69 242 a junior and this is where the injury to Ben Allen Lubin can be felt Zona has played only 20 minutes all season and nine of them were in the irishs last game against BC after the injury to looping and zonas got a big body he can bang inside the question is on the offensive end with him in the low post does that clog things up a little bit for Notre Dame and being able to get to the rim slip to the basket so hes gonna have to step out to the front and set some screens boy nobody guards the ball and Hammond says thank you very much as he knocks down his second three of the game and this is the start that Notre Dame needed see the ball go through the net last night during Notre Dames practice their shoot around while they were shooting Mike Bray was talking about what a great place to shoot it I could make shots in here nobody disputed the claim but nobody corroborated that claim either nobody talks back Davis has gone to his bench as well both teams heavily reliant on their normal starting five both teams get about 85 percent of their scoring from their starters its a starling guarded well by Davis and eventually turns it over one of the few turnovers North their Notre Dame usually has they turned it over among the least in the country of coughing it up DeMarco Dunn the sophomore from Tucson Arizona in the game now for Huber Davis along with Jalen Washington number 13 talented freshman coming to back off and ACL surgery and Recovery as Davis knocks down another one but RJ Davis is on a hot stream at 27 against Wake Forest and over his last four games averages just under 21 points per game I still think he is like criminally underrated 17 points per game 89 free throw shooter better than five rebounds per game doesnt turn it over a lot hes a great player well the rebounding as a guard to grab over five boards a game is a big deal and hes just he is a point guard but he also can really shoot the ball his midrange game is excellent he has beautiful form on that shot recent member of the 1000 Point Club in North Carolina Carolines got 81 guys that have scored a thousand points or more and thats ridiculous thats the most of any division one program Notre Dame I think theyre fourth theyve got 67 same as duke I believe you are one of the 67 for the blue balls damn it at the line twotime firstteam allconference in the mack the 2A match the Metro Atlantic athletic top which is a member of the Niagara purple Eagles Buck Johnson on the floor as well for Carolina the minutes for the bench guys kind of up and down Hubert Davis is going to ride the hot hand from whatever he gets from the guys off the bench Johnson thatll help Corner three thats the penetration by RJ Davis just gets you to help off that corner a little bit and youre caught in no mans land in the short corner good hands Again by Davis to force a turnover love with a finish man is he something in the open floor North Carolina ratcheting up the pressure and Notre Dame has to be stronger with the ball and right away Mike brace and stew of his veteran guys back to the scores table to check back in cormack Ryan misses a three and Hammond fouls Davis thats a shot that Cormac Ryan needs to hit Caleb love can be so explosive in the open court RJ Davis getting the deflection and Caleb love not going to get an easier Basket in the open floor than that one on o was the best you can get in basketball Music better of going up and trying to challenge that again he picked up that early foul but I dont know that no matter what he thought he might be able to do that it would have worked out had he tried Jalen Washington screening with Caleb love he needs to roll for the basket quicker and harder to open things up for love and Washington with a turnaround jumper he has barely played coming back from the ACL last year what do people need to know about Washington he is a big time talent that little inside pivot and short jumper hes got a great shooting touch he can stretch it out to three thats not his game right now but Jalen Washington is gonna hes a special talent and is the chance to be a special player here at North Carolina Lucia now with seven Mike Bray said often at practice yesterday we want to get leshevski open in space they want him to take the Carolina bigs out away from the bucket and knock down some threes and lasheskys had a great year but his last three games hes only averaging seven points a game he was two of 13 from three over that stretch Davis again what a game he is having at both ends of the floor what a rebound done right back up and in tough to get blockouts after a turnover in a scramble situation but just a great read of the defense by RJ Davis almost like a defensive back picking that off and cant get enough views of Kayla glove and that transition bucket to get this all started North Carolina on a nice run up by five Championship Monday night 7 30 Eastern on ESPN TCU and Georgia Georgia trying to win the title for the second year in a row who you got well even though football is a sadistic ground acquisition game thats nothing more than a crypto fascist metaphor for war Im gonna go with Georgia as we can tell from the back of your head the back of my head how can you tell which is my head this is me Im on the left uh typical Canadian fashion Im straddling defense a little bit I got them going to overtime which is why I got both on there but I think Georgia wins in it you got a Georgia easy how easy do you guys I think Georgia by two touchdowns Georgia by two touchdowns right I got Georgia and OT and by the way the the back of our heads is available for uh for hiring for nil yeah for nil yes send us your stickers a good defense by Notre Dame to take away that little pocket pass and get Armando baycott caught in a double team and he is forced to use the timeout 6 32 to go in the first half its afternoon finally Carolina leaving by five Music foreign by public wreck more comfortable than jeans more stylish than sweats with the allday everyday pad you can choose your waist and length sizes to guarantee a perfect fit now Comfort looks good success looks different for everyone which means the path to success also looks different for 75 years University of Maryland Global Campus has helped adults succeed youre not waiting to win youre ready to succeed again at umgcedu to this point in the season Armando baycott has been the ACC player of the year hes such a great offensive rebounder goes over Nate lasheski here to get the offensive board basket and here a little fake along the Baseline side to get into the middle and then quick to the ball to get that second jump offensive forward and then after the timeout North Carolina goes right to baycod for the easy score along the right block and the more North Carolina goes into Armando bacon plays inside out the better I think their offense performed 31 double doubles a year ago and on his way to what looks like another one here thats just seventh rebound to go with eight points and were not even 14 minutes into the game hes like 59 rebounds away from setting the alltime record for North Carolina surpassing Tyler Hans Brown and Caleb loves hes a good shooter when he takes really good shots and hes the type that he can miss a bunch in a row but he hits the biggest one of the game but when he takes good shots he can shoot him hes taking good ones today four for six including a couple of Threes And as UCLA and Duke about what Cale would love to do he was on fire at times for the NCAA tournament a year ago words contested hard by Davis but good works the credit for making the tough shot thats just good offense overcoming really good defense and North Carolina if they can continue to make Notre Dame take contested twos how many of those can Notre Dame make in this game thats really the issue and I I agree with Huber Dave as a strategy take away the threepoint line and then contest the tough twos Davis using the screen off the glass no Goodwin comes down with a rebound another really good guard rebounder Dan Goodwin and words misses the reverse that Goodwins one of those hes bigger than you think he is guys when you walk by him hes six six can can rebound compost can really shoot oftentimes Mike Braille put him in some screening action where he can roll down into the post and take a guard where hes got some space and post that guard hes been playing you want to say hurt I mean he has a sinus infection they played against Boston College hes been having a battle through that sort of a very experienced Notre Dame team a lot of older players as Badcock misses this cormack Ryans 24 theyve got 3 23 rolls and a 22 year old all among their top six or seven players they have six graduate students on the roster for Carolina doing a nice job forcing turnovers something that Notre Dame doesnt do very often at all well that was a great job by Caleb love he was fronting he got switched off on a big guy he will they call it front and fight so he fronts them and then he fights him for a position so hes off on lashesky now gets in front of him fights him and then is able to knock that ball away and start the Carolina fast break thats just a really good job by a guard Switched Off on a big guy inbound to baycod left hand and it goes as she leaves into double figures now with 10 traditionally North Carolina has done such a great job of developing big guys right hand left hand around the basket bill guthridge was really the guy back in the day he was such a great big man coach in developing skill levels of young big guys okay theres Dan Goodwin going into the post against DeMarco Dunn a Goodwin steps out thats a good look from Ryan but left to three short Les schewski kicks it out Starling steps into a three and the Irish needed that well that was a smart play by leceski he could have gone out tried to get the foul but he kicked it out to trade a tough two for a step in three Starling averaging 12 and a half per game all five Notre Dame starters are in double figures this year theres a big last three minutes of the first half especially for Notre Dame can they cut into this lead or can North Carolina stretch it out Huff Johnson with a chance for a threepoint play Armando Bakehouse done a very good job of handling these double teams dribbles out of him and then makes a pass and Puck Johnson made the cut and goes to that left hand Music turns sees the double coming dribbles out of it and then gets it right to Puff Johnson underneath the really nice play by Armando Baker Music Applause well thats how good the back of my head looks Seth Seth we bald guys gotta stick together you know Seth doesnt think of himself as a bald guy or he should he is a he is a guy with a lot of hair that chooses not to use it its my choice but kwanzas point about Caleb love hes got 10 points but its an efficient 10 hes four from six from the field two of three from three points because hes taken nothing but good shots everythings been in Rhythm nothing has been forced a steal by Ryan and he will lay it in to make it an eightpoint game last trip down beta picked up his second block of the game to go already with 10 points and eight rebounds maybe thats something that that steel and bucket gets Cormac Ryan going a little bit because hes got to put points on the board for Notre Dame you know all five starters for Notre Dame average double figures but they all five have to score and they caught his Thumbkin is heading to the line with a double team coming over a little bit late there got the foul but Starling throwing on baycot the key here is dont for big cut dont foul early just force the difficult shot over you and you not only forced a difficult shot he blocked it with the left hand but the tendency for big guys when somebodys going by you is to stick your hands out foul and Armando baycat showed the discipline not to do that and made the play toward the end they caught has scored 20 or more in four consecutive games but all hes done in his career this is the first time that hes done that and again some pretty good competition as well as you can see and hes able to get 11 here in this one he plays very well in morning games yeah before when you start before noon I thought I think you know you look great but uh these pajama bottoms youre wearing not particularly attractive well its pajama day or pajama day were here at uh at the dingo how come he gets to dress like that and we dont next time with our man Steve Kershner had told us so pajama is the wrong pronunciation depends where youre from good win another block this time leaky black one of the best defenders in the country leaky black reflected Away by Goodwin good hustle on the defensive end to knock it out of bounds a Goodwin tried to avoid that block going for the left hand taking the ball away from you just have to go right into the body of the defender Tar Heels Jay have five blocks already in this game North Carolinas been really active on the defensive end you know their pressure has been good their help side has been active Justin McCoy is into the game now for the Tar Heels again no Pete Nance out to the back issue and the third made three of the game already for Caleb love with the little jab step but I think the way Caleb loves started the game as lafonzo Ellis pointed out just efficient letting things come to him it really improves his rhythm and that was even though it was a contested shot that was a rhythm jumper largest lead of the game for North Carolina Starling misses a three and this one I think Mike gray had to be concerned about the last three minutes of the game could Notre Dame make a little bit of a run cut the lead or was Carolina going to take off a tough one there from Love the first questionable shot decision that love has had in this game this sort of went oneonone when there was nothing there trying to slip a screen again theres another one but the pressure on the ball helps take away that pass got a size advantage on puff Johnson but misses the turnaround he was getting bumped good job by Johnson to hold his ground and be really physical Applause about 10 seconds between the game clock and the shot clock here at the end of the first half full screen for love splits it kicks it black for three Johnson is called for the foul Caleb love going against Cormac Ryan just gives a little jab step that gives him the room and that room gave him the Rhythm just a comfortable jump shot because of the step you dont always need to use the dribble to create space for yourself a pass fake a shot fake jab step you can move the defense without the dribble closing seconds and a half works with a step back three and black might have gotten a piece of that a good effort at both ends of the floor in the first half here today for the Tar Heels an energetic defensively that was the difference for North Carolina and a doubledigit lead halfway through against the Irish lets send it back to the studio along with Seth and Fons heres Kevin Connor Seth is the Fault guy all right guys thanks that first half that led to six field goals for North Carolina Carolina shot 50 percent including five of ten from three because the threes were all Rhythm threes and this is a team that shoots 31 for three thats 278 in the nation for threepoint percentage and again Marcus Hammond will start the second half as he did at the beginning of the game Trayaurus will come off the bench again they go down to Goodwin in the post and he is a terrific post player offensively but leaky black can guard just about anybody just about anywhere well thats 66 in the post as a guard going against six eight and long armed and one of the best defenders in the country in leaky black that is not a matchup that suggests the post for Dane Goodwin good pass fake God the follow no in Goodwin down with a rebound its really amazing how quick Armando baycott is on that second jump to get to an offensive rebound he missed that shot because all the contact going against lucchesky the cheski thrown his body into him and but baycott very quick to almost get that tipping Ryan now with the bay caught on him and the pass picked off by black was trying to take advantage of a matchup instead of just making a play Trimble Bay cop for an easy two anytime theres a turnover in North Carolina gets out in transition its tough to get responsibilities youre in scramble and you give up an easy basket again no Pete Nance so Hubert Davis starting a smaller lineup with leaky black in effect at the four and Seth Trimble out there from the backcourt along with love and Davis Trimble so alert on the defensive end hes guarding JJ starling Ryan tipped up and in by lushevski and because of the switch he got a guard on lacheski I think it was Caleb love and its tough to get a block out on a rebounder as good as Nate lecheski this Notre Dame team went 155 a year ago in the ACC they made the NCAA tournament a first four team beat Rutgers beat Alabama lost to Texas Tech in the second round and they lost some good players including the first round pick at Blake Wesley and they are just struggling right now 87 overall Jay and oh and four in ACC play Davis in transition and right now the Irish just dont have the answers well Notre Dame has lost three games in the ACC by a combined nine points finishing games and being a little bit tougher down the stretch has been an issue for the Irish but they still have the horses to be a solid team in the ACC but when youre on four you know sometimes that can be really deflating the steal and now North Carolina in transition and Armando baycott doing a better job of Rim running that gets him underneath the basket and RJ Davis getting into the middle of the floor leaky black with the physical defense down low that starts the break for an easy bucket these guards run everybody runs for North Carolina the line his words now checks in for Notre Dame good one out one of the outstanding freethrow shooting teams in the nation but they dont get there very much because theyre such a a jump shooting team offensively a lot of extremes on this Notre Dame team both offensively and defensively Applause Notre Dames going to get caught on a lot of switches in mantoman it bounces to Trimble and hell finish so he does a lot of nice things doesnt he weve talked about what a great onball defender is his ability to stay in front that is an elite skill that Seth Trimble has but hes explosive athletically doesnt shoot it great yet but youre looking at a player that is going to be a great one for North Carolina played a lot of soccer as a kid its called football man Im sure too many guys on the ball Carolina reverses it gets a good shot Applause Armando baycott tips this right to Trimble just a really smart play by Armando baycot and he is a not only a you know hes not just a great rebounder hes a smart rebounder and thats one of the reasons he gets so many he goes to the glass every time but hes smart in the way he does it plays angles really well ski around leaky black for the flush and leaky black tried to go for the steal and when you go for it you better get it because youre giving up a basket the better thing to do is just stay behind Nate lashewski make him score over you Hitchcock with a nice pass black couldnt finish it with a lot of contact another thing baycat can do really well at times just pass the ball he had five assists and no turnovers Wednesday against Wake Forest Im not sure that passing is his best strength as a vision passer but hes done a great job when double teams have come at him of dribbling out trying to see over and I think last six or seven games I dont know exactly what it is but hes moving so much better his Mobility his Rim runs uh have gone to the next level and we will step aside four minutes into the second half here in Chapel Hill Bay caught in the heels up 14 today Im a part of the prince story lines here for the ACC Miami was undefeated in League Play until Georgia Tech got him as the yellow jackets picked up their first Conference win Duke was simply overwhelmed in the first half by the pressure of NC State in Raleigh when they met a few days ago the Wolf Pack won by 24 and the two undefeated teams in conference play are Clemson and Pitt each at 40 Atop The League standings and they will meet this afternoon in Pittsburgh four oclock Eastern right here on ESPN2 and Pittsburgh has been excellent Blake Hensons been outstanding playing at an allacc level jamarius Burton has been terrific Nellie Cummings Jeff Cables got a good Pittsburgh team and getting off to a good start I think was imperative for the Panthers and Pitch got a win over Carolina beat him 7674 back on December the 30th Miamis in 41 Syracuse is in fourth place at three and one and then a whole bunch of teams of two and two Starling got it off in time but misses the three Notre Dame needs to run its offense with a little more Pace you know they got a ball reversal but there was some catch and hold instead of catch and make a move or catch and get rid of it love into traffic and the foul is called Applause uh more college basketball coming your way tomorrow on ESPN Ohio State Maryland good battle out of the Big Ten at one oclock Eastern time and then the second ranked team in the nation Kelvin Sampsons cougars take it on Cincinnati out of the American Conference nice couple better tomorrow on ESPN two freshmen to watch for Ohio State price Sensabaugh is taking off I mean he can really score talk about gifted and then Jairus Walker for Houston is also starting to come on I mean he was outstanding in that game at Virginia and then equally as good in the game they just had where they blew out SMU the other night Caleb love knocking those free throws down thats the first time hes been to the freethrow line in the last three games Music another guy who want to get to shoots him pretty well certainly get the athleticism to get there a bunch yeah thats really the key is attacking the basket a little bit more often not relying on the jump shot to get to the free throw line first time today that we see number 13 Dom Campbell The Freshman from Scarborough Maine thats him with the balls just gave it up a big body again with the Van Allen Lubin out theyre looking for minutes in the front court and Campbells Gonna Knock some people around he just knocked RJ Davis around a big physical guy about six nine 260 theres Lubin alphabet ankle injury but watch out RJ Davis battles in here thats a guard in there he took a shot but he sticks his nose in there and rebounds especially on the defensive end he grabs close to five and a half rebounds a game one of the best guard rebounders in the ACC I think were going to take a look at I dont know there was anything flagrant in that last play I cant imagine there would be no I mean I mean he did knock them over he was going for the rebound at the time Campbell coming into the game today has played all the 13 minutes on the season when theyre all healthy for Mike Ray its a very very tight sevenman rotation Applause you know and that thats I mean thats what they would call incidental contact on after the ball but in in todays game which is overtly physical but where you where you really want to allow the physicalities on the glass all right rebound is supposed to be physical the onball contact off ball on Cutters those are the things that need to be better policed in the game its kind of an audition of sorts here for Campbell to try to get a few minutes and uh try to get my parade to expand that rotation a little bit again not a very big team and not a very deep team you have to think that North Carolina wants to get the ball inside to baycot and there it is do they come with the double if not hes oneonone against Campbell jump hook over and left it short and Goodwin wraps up the rebound Campbell did a nice job of just Walling up and making fake hot make that tough too Ryan backdoor cutlassevski feeds Campbell follows up his Miss and gets it to go a nice play by Campbell just keeping his composure after that first shot got blocked oftentimes when youre around the basket as a big guy if you get your shot blocked its going to come back to you the Campbell having an immediate impact in the game and thats his first field goal in an Irish uniform had one made free throw prior to today Latino and Campbell had it and it will be Notre Dame bowl a lot of contact for no call there better be strong in college basketball these days and leaky black a little bit shaken up it looks like and again it was Campbell involved in the collision and maybe he lost a contact its another nil deal thats good sportsmanship there by Trey Works he must wear contacts himself so hes over there to help for Black coming out of the game 14point lead here for Carolina some of the students are back classes resume on Monday a nice crowd for an early game at 11 30 am local star Carolina haswood sharp right from the getgo Goodwin off the screen gets inside gets all the way to the rim such a good cutter just curled off that low screen and it got to the other side of the basket help side defense wasnt quite as alert as it was in the first half theres baycat wide open under you can really do a lot of things to free him up in the low post you can use a guard to screen across a little low cross action but anytime the baycot gets the ball the deeper he is the more dangerous he is deeper post position but playing Inside Out is the future for Carolina for this season they did it there a ping touch and then a kick out to Puff Johnson for a three anytime the ball gets into the paint its more likely than not going to collapse that defense and puff Johnson has had some really good minutes in this game thats six points in the first half he was great in the title game last year against Kansas I think he had 11 points in that that game played a ton of minutes in that four overtime loss to Alabama played 48 minutes in that game Campbell misses a turnaround thats not the shot that Mike Ray wants from Don Campbell and now hes got to deal with the bait out of the other end love steps into a three flying in to keep it alive was DeMarco done but its Irish Ball Wertz and they can shoot the three they can cut into a deficit in a hurry if they get hot especially in transition you know a little bit of a slower break but you get the trailer in words stepping into that shot and its tough to get guard responsibilities when youre coming down the floor in a little bit of a scramble situation Notre Dame with five made threes today Carolina with six and again and you can see it Priority number one is trying to get that ball inside the big guy great words coming down essentially as the trailer just easily steps into that you got to get out make him put it on the deck because thats only a two little handoff action all of a sudden you draw four Irish into the light blue of the lane and that means a step in three for puff Johnson again into Badcock and again fouled by Campbell and Dom Campbells now been charged with three fouls since hes come into the game and hes only been in there about three minutes well theyre just isolating bacon in the low post and spreading everybody out that means helps going to be longer its going to be tough to come over and double and youre gonna have to get Dane Goodwin right in the middle of the lane on the midline to try to stop that and now a free for DeMarco Dunn to extend the lead broken hand earlier in the year returned against Pittsburgh and has really improved that shooting mechanics from last year to this year Hubert Davis is looking for more options Off the Bench Puck Johnson plays a fair bit whether its done weve seen Seth Trimble it does look like the pieces are there Jay for this team to improve its production Off the Bench as the season goes along a tough drive by native to get that bucket but youre right I think North Carolina has depth and then if DeMarco done and puff Johnson can come off the bench and give quality minutes and that gives the starters a little bit of a break Chucky Hepburn becoming one of the better point guards in the Big Ten Conference second the league 51 percent from three should be a good one coming up next all right Robbie thank you Robbie Hummels got a claim to be the hardest working man in Show Business the Badgers have won six in a row heading into that game with the Illini today good ball movement and a foul on the Irish a really good job at getting the ball into the middle of the lane drawing the defense and then dropping it off to DeMarco gun thats where Caleb loves he attacks the pain hes that much more effective and Dan the rules committee needs to change this role we just had a timeout timeout Applause all of Sonics under two dollar claims are under two bucks so you can get something tasty without breaking the bank Sonic under two dollar clay Sonic hey man you could save

Yum perfectly sized cheese and Prescott cheese cheese cheese real natural cheese now with your favorite crackers so gentle were real cheese people can feel confident Continental is the Smart Choice in tires in the handle extremes yep senior Cormac you on the bench suffered some sort of an injury looked like he was trying to fight his way around Armando bake out it was chasing pale of Love Around the screen and it may have just kind of collided with the fire of the hip of of baycot tough to know exactly what it is was in some difficulty for a little while trying to come off the court appears a little bit better off right now in the Notre Dame bench where he he played the play all the way through after taking that really hard shot off that screen and then once the foul was called he went down and he really struggled getting getting back to the Huddle and then went to one knee outside the Huddle so hes clearly struggling with something meanwhile DeMarco donche given Huber Davis some nice minutes off the bench today hey Hubert Davis has talked to DeMarco Don throughout the year he wants him to play in fifth gear not get stuck in third DeMarco Dunn made a tremendous improvement from last year to this year his season was stalled a bit with that broken hand but he came back in the Pittsburgh game you know with the continuity of of not being injured if he had had that continuity I think that leap would have already been taken but he can be a key piece down the stretch for this North Carolina team Off the Bench really athletic guy whos made a two has made a three and has made both of his free throws today as Carolina turns it over black would still be dealing with that contact lens issue leaky black hasnt made a field goal in this game but hes got seven rebounds three assists two steals two block shots you can have a great impact on the game without scoring boy RJ Davis just ran into Matt Zona who was set in a high ball screen Turn Around by lachevsky boy hes got a lot of different ways to score now hes bigger than puff Johnson and just inside pivot face up and Johnson didnt have a handout you got to make him drive it hed rather have him going toward the basket than shooting an easy jumper Davis a little short offensive rebound Johnson love from the Baseline and down to Starlet for everybody for Notre Dame has to get in there and rebound cant just be left to the front door players its got to be all five Irish have to be on the defensive glass on every possession even though North Carolina is not the rebounding team that they were last year you know with bake out in there theyre still formidable and Zona inside taking advantage of his playing time and a quick shot he got that up quickly Notre Dame has it down to 11 still with a lot of time left in this game he for Notre Dame here to get a stop so you can see how intently all the perimeter players are looking inside the Babcock love couldnt get it in there so hell drive it in himself and this is where you mention it but this is where Caleb love can be even more effective as a player and thats putting the ball in the deck and driving it yeah he didnt have to drive a close out there it was just a a drive off the initial action but hes so strong and so explosive theres no reason he shouldnt be attacking the basket more which will open up his perimeter game even more you can get his shot off anytime he wants hes got 18 points in the game today to lead all scores and as well as Caleb love and RJ Davis shoot free throws Davis leads the ACC and free throw percentage of 89 percent now that should be a goal of theirs to get to the line even more and we saw Ryan has returned there he is with the ball so good news for Notre Dame mismatch here lachevski guarded to buy love but it rattles out good job by love just throwing his chest into lechevski trying to make him make that tough one Applause off balance love that one wont go well theres a tough one for love but the arm bar right into them yeah and the way for him to improve his field goal percentage I dont think this might sound strange its not making more its cutting down like the two or three of those ones that he takes as Ryan knocks down a corner three if left can cut down on kind of the offbalance Runners his productivity his efficiency will go way out well and really what youre talking about is the quality of shots yeah because he if he does that he will make more I didnt understand your math there its not about making more its about missing fewer but thats a tough one there thats a thats an interesting call that that was a block that was a lower shoulder it was interesting so two feet on the floor facing the ball handler wow yeah how do you thats an interesting call I dont wishes he never had both hands on them but it goes North Carolinas way in baycott rewarded with a trip to the line we talked about it uh as long as baytots stays healthy in a few weeks he will count Carolinas alltime rebounding leader he just tied Sam Perkins for second and rebounding today on Carolinas alltime list Tyler Hans row number one and eight Cox about four or five games away from passing in hes already passed Billy Cunningham but I remember Billy Cunningham back in the day you know the refreshment team so he only played three years and Cunningham averaged about 15 rebounds a game the kangaroo kid and I played against Sam Perkins and he got a lot of those rebounds against me you got a few against him right yeah the ones where he was on the bench you played in a in a pretty impressive era for big guys from the ACC ENT yeah I made him even more yeah Perkins and Doherty and Samson that basket is going to count and we get a foul underneath away from the play and I think its going against Carolina now Notre Dame if they can get a bucket here or maybe even a three all of a sudden North Carolina has a little bit of game pressure going down the last eight and a half minutes of Regulation the foul is on Trimble the basket counted Bay cattle get a breather as Jalen Washington whos coming to the game for the heels and Caleb love and conversation with the officials they may have to look to see whether the foul was called but the bucket should be good was the shot released before the foul was called the fouls on Trimble and theres the foul there it looks thats the foul there yeah so that should be out of bounds underneath for another day Applause foreign defines Ryan this is a big one for the Irish and its got him back within seven boy that was a really nice play and a great cut out to the perimeter by Cormac Ryan and hes got as quick of a release from the catch to the release of the shooters theyre going to see the other guy I would put up there one of the other guys is Brady dick from Kansas from catch to releases jump Shooters just lightning quick so after a fivepoint trip for the Irish RJ Davis answers with a bucket and its back to nine for the heels Campbell back into the game for Notre Dame Ryan keeps the dribble alive Washington with a rebound for Carolina its a lot different with Don Campbell on the floor to run a spread offense than lechevsky on the bench love misses on the drive and good win the rebound for Notre Dame Notre Dame has numbers here Starling a transition three tremble with a rebound and a long look ahead pop Johnson how Im sorry is it was a foul called because there should have been I mean that was a foul and now words exchanged and the officials getting in between players from both sides as a couple of the Notre Dame players try to get Dom Campbell out of there well the question is did they call a foul on the play because that was a foul I dont think I didnt see I didnt either and if they didnt thats a thats a Miss I mean that was a foul we will take a look going to break welcome back Dan schulmanship those the officials at the monitor during the time out and Cormac Ryan is has just jogged off the court to the locker room so we will wait for official word but that certainly seems to suggest that he has been given a flagrant two foul which means an ejection from this game and well show you some replays we had a chance to look at them during the break so Johnson with the finish and then Ryan goes down in the right foot of Ryan into the face of puff Johnson which is probably what Caleb love saw that upset him now were going to get a little bit of an explanation here Applause so it is a flagrant two Cormac Ryan is out of the game and then uh dead ball technical fouls which were on love and Campbell I love and cam 11 Campbell so and then Carolina gets the ball out on their game right so these two shots are for the ejection of Cormac Ryan again the right foot into the face of puff Johnson thats what got Caleb loved upset Dom Campbell saw that he got in the chest of love and it results in the ejection of Cormac Ryan excuse me Music so one or two to make it a 12 point lead and Notre Dame whos just one of their their key players as they try to mount a comeback yeah the question is how does Notre Dame respond losing essentially their leader and a guy that can knock down shots good Defender so this is the line off that Notre Dames going to go with for the rest of the game black over lachevsky around and in and all of a sudden its a 70 run for Carolina after the Irish had gotten it down to a seven point deficit that was a heck of a play by leaky black made the catch with a Defender his arms wrapped around him and then took a huge body bump as he was going up and still made the play and those were his first two points of the game shot clock down to five Starling into the paint lost it Goodwin has it gets it off and hits it or talk about a broken play working out for Notre Dame thats just an alert play by Dane Goodwin to know the the game situation the shot clock and knocking down a difficult shot now 23 Zone again for Notre Dame so that middle is going to be open they caught the kick to Davis back to Baker spins jump hook in and out well he got the shot he wanted though North Carolina has to continue the pressure on the ball and then guard that threepoint line with Trimble on him goes Adam and left it short and thats why Trembley just want to wall up and fight in there and make him take a tough shot over you he makes it fine nice look Applause Johnson and the rebound lachevski Notre Dame needs to run offense with some Pace right here get the ball moving from side to side theyre gonna have the floor spread then youve got the option to drive it and kick it Carolina basically switching everything you see RJ Davis fighting Dane Goodwin down in that postup situation now Badcock finds himself on Starling but Sterling gives it up with the shot clock running down and that kind of forced Hammond into a tough situation he had to get a shot up but its been a lot of movement and then oneonone instead of things coming off of cuts and a ball screen slip we saw that more in the first half but North Carolina doing a good job defensively in that last possession Campbell returns for the Irish love back to the game to the heels really the story of this game for North Carolina hasnt necessarily been its offense Carolinas defense has been really stingy now the lower possession game thats not what North Carolina wants they say average over 80 points a game theyd rather play a higher octane game but its harder to get against a team like Notre Dame that slows it down a little bit love into the paint beautiful feet into big cots how good is he when he drives the ball I love having a nice afternoon here for the heels who have it back up to 14 bacon putting up big numbers as well good defense by RJ Davis to stay in front of Trey wurtz hes got a great defensive game Starling got pushed yeah he did and thats going to count the foul on top Johnson and Starling with a chance for a threepoint Play Good reaction to that arm bar see a lot of this with guys driving the armbar but he reacted to it without throwing his head back oftentimes when you throw your head back the officials are going to say you know that was a flop things like that but an arm bar into the side which you see all the time you know that thats a foul impressive looking freshman recruited by the likes of Duke Stanford Syracuse and others misses the free throw though when its still a 12 point deficit for the Irish and the freethrow disparity North Carolina getting there Notre Dame not and Notre Dame not even hitting the ones theyre getting theyre just one for six for a team that shoots 78 percent from the line of the season one of the best marks in the country Davis having himself an afternoon another great job by Armando baycott of taking on the double team and finding the open man officer he sees the double coming dribbles out of it and gets it to RJ Davis for that easy step in three foreign everybody moving their feet defensively for the heels right now though Caleb love just got cowed for a foul down low Armando baycat yet again has been outstanding he is just piling up great game after great game sees the double coming dribbles away from it and then finds RJ Davis for the step in three thats just good basketball by the North Carolina big guy ought to name a burger after him Dan foreign Applause on every platform there is is that bison versus jackrabbits leave it in that sounds like a messy unless its the Monty Python the Holy Grail jacket that guy was tough yeah its just a scratch that was the Black Knight that was a different one but thats such a good skit but we digress 14point lead for Carolina trying to get to three and two at least play if Notre Dame loses the Irish dropped through oh and five next game up Jay an interesting one for the heels theyll be in Charlottesville Tuesday night to take on Virginia another lower paced game and Kihei Clark has been outstanding all year hes leading the league and assists on a lower possession team hes about six assists per game hit by towel and Ill have that game for you Andrea Carter will be with us as well Tuesday night on ESPN crowd wanted some a foul call feeling that love was fouled on his drive to the bucket and North Carolina wants to maintain its intensity throughout the entire 40 minutes and even though this game seems it well in hand you dont want to let up on the intensity how about that I mean as much contact as you can have two big strong guys big cod with the bucket and he gets fouled yeah this is a take your pick possession you could have called fouls one two three call them three or four times they just chose to call it at the end and the foul on John Campbell is his fit so in his first and a real opportunity to get some minutes this year he fouls out in seven minutes of action this afternoon well with Ben Allen Lubin out with that I think it was an ankle that he suffered against Boston College now that really limits what Mike gray can do they dont have a ton of postpresence but whatever post presence they really had was been Alan Lupine who was their best offensive rebounder still lives I mean hes going to come back soon Applause but lubins also a guy who shoots over 60 from two so hes a scoring option around the basket Applause fouled by bacon and moshevsky may be shaken up Applause the North Carolinas game plan defensively was really solid you know take away the threes they were switching everything guarded the threepoint line really effectively and they made Notre Dame take a lot of tough twos try the sport can they make enough to beat you and the answer thus far has been known look at some of the Hoots action coming your way tomorrow and ESPN in the app got Ohio State ticket on Maryland at one oclock Eastern time and then number two Houston at Cincinnati three oclock Eastern and Notre Dames next game we mentioned Carolinas next game Notre Dames next game Tuesday night at home against Georgia Tech seven Eastern on the ACC Network Ohio State just came off a really great game against Purdue they came down to the last possession Chris Holtman has a good team Im telling you bright sensible that freshman that dude can play Man Applause screen for the screener action love picture back after black still tend to shoot black over Goodwin tough shot thats so much respect for Lincoln Blacks game hes really improved as a shooter hes actually percentagewise the leading threepoint shooter for North Carolina shes just under 40 percent great effort Again by Davis and thats kind of emblematic of what weve seen a lot today just a really good effort at the defensive end by the Tar Heels this afternoon its really alert going after the ball help side has been engaged I think Huber Davis has to be pretty pleased just going right around that zone and knocking that ball away and then first to the floor to get a hold of it leaky black on the other end Dane Goodwin kind of forces him toward the corner but still with that length and athleticism able to make the shot over him 16point lead under two minutes to go Carolina on its way to its 11th win of the Season Notre Dames going to drop to 88 tremble baycott great patience underneath and two more for Armando bacon anytime baycod screens he rolls hard to the basket and if you stay with the ball just even an extra Split Second screens and then rolls he just instead of opening up to the ball he just turns over that shoulder runs to the basket Huber Davis taking out his starters now Roy Williams hes seen more basketball games retired than he saw when he was working every game Im at hes there yeah and hes up cheering for Huber Davis and the current addition to the Tar Heels we used to see Roy take all five guys out sometimes when he was angry at them but Huber took all five out there because of the score in the lead and hes happy with him yeah much better feeling to take him out at the end of the game when everybodys giving them an ovation I thought Roy would be scheduling tea times its a nice day perfect perfect time for maybe he doesnt have a tea time right after this maybe thats why the game is at 11 30 in the morning so he could play after get in 18 before dark Trimble made the free throws and then he came out more good moments today from Seth Trimble he is gonna hes really good now hes going to be a great player here both he and Jalen Washington you talk about two guys that have special written all over him Don Tres Styles is in this is Tyler Nichol from the corner gets back his own Miss and hits nickel a freshman from Harrisonburg Virginia the alltime Virginia High School scoring record holder with better than 2 900 points and hes pretty excited to go to Charlottesville on Tuesday night Harrisonburg is where James Madison University is and also where Ralph Sampson grew up Contra Styles is into the game as well done Washington McCoy return now a turnover and Donald commit the foul to prevent the easy bucket foreign Davis I mean there are always things to improve upon but yet you got to be pretty happy you never know with these early starts to exactly what youre going to get hes got to be pretty happy with what he got today just the effort the energy the toughness and togetherness of his team especially on the defensive end its a good performance from North Carolina as we mentioned theyre going to Charlottesville Tuesday night then Louisville BC NC State and then at Syracuse and ESPN game January the 24th and what appears to be a fairly wide open ACC right now then youve got programs like Clemson and Pittsburgh making strong early statements well see how it plays out in the coming weeks and in a long conference season there is still a long way to go Washington to the offensive rebound that has it taken away Robbie Carmody is in the game for Notre Dame a young man who unfortunately Jay his career just basically impacted so severely by knee injuries but hes out there getting a little run here in the closing minute shot clock is turned off Mike Bray says dont worry about it as he heads to shake hands with Huber Davis and Carolina defeats Notre Dame 8164 here this afternoon and I suffered at both ends of the floor for the heels and Carolina has to be especially pleased with the way they defended a good offensive team in Notre Dame the heels were alert defensively and toughened together so Huber Davis has to be pleased with that effort overall so Carolinas now won six of its last seven meanwhile Notre Dame
