rookie of the week nine times Duke has the longest win streak in the country they are a heavy favorite but you never know when two of the best programs in college basketball history get together Duke controls the tip and Duke gets the first basket right out of the shoot 9 seconds in an easy layup for KH kiple also one of the best freshmen in the country Duke has three potential lottery picks between con power and also Cooper flag but look when youre playing a game of this magnitude your best player needs to have an Elite Performance and for Syracuse that is JJ Starin they leading score at 18 per game heres the starting five for Duke you mentioned those three freshman theyre drawn by the terrific transfer seon James huge impact point guard in tyres Proctor canle for three Eddie lampin clears the rebound for Syracuse led by Starling the Junior from local Baldwinsville Lucas Taylor and Elijah Moore the guards Jer Davis and Eddie lanin Jr whos been a rebounding machine machine and will have to control the glass against the tallest team in division one lamin will take it against the 72 malat with eight to shoot rolling inside from Taylor Starling three end of the shot clock rims out to Tyrese Proctor and those are the quality shots that coach alri was talking about Cooper flag will drive it freshman on a new newpt main sets a screen for Proctor a step inside Starling and he was fouled JJ Starling the first foul of this game the player Syracuse can probably least afford to get into foul trouble a TI SP with 17 points in that game against North Carolina but look at the stutter step right here that little change of speed is just enough that lampin has to get back to Cooper flag you got to make a decision either you got to hedge and allow your guard to get back to actually protect the B or you have to go Blitz to get the ball out of his hands being in no mans land is where Lampkin was on at last possession so free throws for the junior Proctor 107 Point per game score well Kevin you talked in the open about the game after the game its human nature after to get the rise for a game against North Carolina but then coming to next game and be a little bit flat thats something that John C talked about every game is going to have this type of magnitude theres a chance early for Syracuse to capitalize on that and get a lead two Miss free throws from the 78 shooter Proctor on the bfer student section already he gets a free ChickfilA sand on the Music post six to shoot for Starling lampin a long way away from the basket going to have to make a play at the end of the shot clock switched on the flag and L has no clue the shot clocks about to expire it is year three for John shy largest home win for Duke against Carolina since 2010 and 17 points doesnt even begin to describe it if you didnt watch the game Duke was up 403 in the first half they controlled the game the final score was really just window dressing flag had a knocked Away by zire Davis Senior out of Delaware starts on flag Proctor a deep one and too strong as Davis elevates over the top of Kiper got to love the defense by Syracuse theyre in gaps theyre playing slightly off he want Duke to be complacent shooting and settling for threes an orang team that is not a very good shooting team and has turned it over a lot in conference play they must avoid those tonight and to Lin again hes got the switch on the much smaller James Lin got a shot off but could finish great Rotation by Duke he got him wide open down low from Mal and Mal stuffs it on the feed from James Lin needs a Sprint back defensively malawat is one of the guys on this floor everybody talks about Cooper flag and con nipple but I actually think malat might have the highest ceiling out of anybody on the Courts only been playing basketball for a few years 72250 freshman from the South Sudan more thats a very difficult one off the hands of flag into the hands of James John shy says go go go lethal transition team malat was covered up its Proctor into the teeth of Taylor very difficult shot forceed by Lucas Taylor even better defense by Taylor just to stay Applause upright and hold his ground defensively now what youre going to see is watch is going to run the floor when hes sprting the floor lampin isnt down there James finally picks his head up and recognizes he has a easy pass to malat for a slam deves two for five start Syracuse one for four with a turnover against third best defense in the country statistically Starling at righthanded shot from the left side of the lane is knocked away then one of the opportunities for Syracuse to slow it down a little bit off that high PNR get the screen and then the screen since Duke is switching everything on the perimeter have the big roll into the defensive player JJ should get a shot open each and every possession if you can make the right read got some scattered booze from the crowd for the homecoming Malik Brown on the ball right there spent the last two years first two of his career at Syracuse transferred to Duke this off season and is immediately involved in a near takeaway with flag he returned to the lineup Saturday John sh told us he had eight of Dukes season height 22 deflections well theyre trying to get him to score the ball more offensively but he is the Secretary of Defense he is everywhere hes active he has a high basketball IQ and John talked about this before just has a great feel for the Applause game again deep into the shot clock for Syracuse Starling gets to his right hand and finishes hes got the first four has know SC rep Starling is a hard right driver if anything want him to drive to his left hand might be a little more Isaiah Evans today Mason Gillis did not make the trip he is out with an illness kiple leans into Taylor and hell draw free throws a four four start for Duke which has been and defense and they hold their opponents to 60 points or less per game and they they play positionist basketball they switch positions one through five its probably the most connected team Ive seen Duke have in a very long time you said early in the year that this was the most talented Duke R you thought maybe since your 2001 title team has anything dissuaded you of that notion watching these guys now and I was coming off a loss against Kentucky a lot of Kentucky fans came after me after that game and I I Ive held firm with that uh just because kiple and flag and malawat play older but theyre fearless and they dont know what they dont know thats why you have guys like James thats why you have guys like Gillis and brown that come in and add that veteran experience I mean Gillis is not here but talk about guy who played national championship game and then Tyrese Proctor and Foster two guys that understand the continuity of the system and how they play all the pieces fit for this team now whether that translates to them win a championship we will see 64 lead off the free throws by kiple rainbow three by Lucas Taylor grabbed by kiple Duke has done well on the defensive glass so far if theyre going to play in drop coverage uh theyre going to try to lure du to a lot of Threes you got to be careful with a guy like canle you talking about one of the best threepoint Shooters in the league leads duken made threes and fifth in ACC 38 he misses his second there and then Brown takes it away and throws it off lampin and Syracuse fans are all too familiar with that sort of play well if lamin is going to seal him he has to hold him off Brown does a great job of just fighting over the top theyre not going to see it but lamin has a size just got to seal him got to hold him Le ground all defensive team in the league with Syracuse a year ago flag such a tremendous distributor canle well balanced in the lane just using that 220lb frame against Taylor call that bully basketball dipping that shoulder nothing Taylor could do and a game height 22 in the win over the tar Hills Saturday Brown knocks it away from Lin again and lampin slaps it away from Brown who waits for flag to get the ball and its poked away dude scrambles back so well defensively in transition and the Ys cannot get an easy shot Starling pull up line drive in at three and hes got all seven well six for 18 team shooting in the win over Cal last game JJ Starling has begun three for five keeper flag has not gotten a shot off in this game as of yet first one and he rattles in home right on Q flag who has dramatically improved his threepoint shot over the course of the year if youre Davis and if youre in gaps you got to shorten that length it cant be that far over one of the hottest threepoint Shooters on this Duke team cant leave Cooper flag for a wide open chip 12 straight game with a made three flag Moore gets a look and then Evans with a late denial and then brown tips it ahead Starling will let it float out of bounds you talk about Malik Brown just playing passing Lanes great job getting out there but you love The Hustle by lanin getting back into it and this is where Syracuse has a chance driving into those gaps JJ Sterling relocating to the free throw line extended knocking down the three and then once again I said before you cant be that far over in the Gap if your Davis you got to stay a little bit more connected to Cooper flag roaming on the and changing up defensively too playing Zone in that game manto man going back and forth well theyre going to have to get it all the way down the court here Starling hustling down Starling off the front of the rim pressure by Duke made it difficult got brown and git together right now F Shire told us we might see more Malik Brown at the four and brown steps out misses the three foul against gundell well following our game here on ESPN 2 its another significant game in the SEC two bubble teams Arkansas coming off maybe the win of the year at college basketball John Cal Perry going back to rup getting a win now they go on the road to get Trey Johnson and Texas really good game at the Moody Center in Austin we saw Trey Johnson earlier this year special special score super special score you get a chance to watch that AR saw a Kentucky game I did I mean what a what an incredible sight a duel with some a Big Time Performance DJ Wagner coming back home to Kentucky and putting on an absolute show getting a win on the road there was a lot made of Coach cows return it was the former Kentucky players who really led the way try to get Arkansas back in the tournament mix Evans rattles around to three there some of the big numbers youre talking about big Z VAV vich as well had 14 as Arkansas shot Kentucky tell every night in the SEC it is an absolute battle the ultimate me grinder might get 13 teams in the tournament well see its going to be double digits either way Syracuse still has no points from anybody but Starling who is dispossessed on the way up and the orangs will have it with five to shoot its Duke 11 its JJ start and actually raising that Capital will bring in top tier players and when you think about whos coming in next year here and cenne Anthony the son of Camelo Anthony sadik White another special phenomenal player along back with Donnie Freeman this team is well on their way they got a great look out of the timeout Chris Bell misses his first shot attemp and he M clouds on the floor for the first time as is patar movich and jquan Carlos who Starling the only starter in there and heres two3 Zone yeah Brown into McLoud flag back on the floor for Duke Applause thats where the play is every time you got to look opposite he catch the ball in the middle right d by gun to turn Face look opposite kick it right for a knock down three and thats dudes best threepoint shooter Isaiah Evans another freshman 45 so Duke doubling up Syracuse right now still JJ Starling the only orange player to score you think about Isaiah Evans 74 of the 86 shots hes attempted are threes you know I think the next step for his game as he continues to gain more experience is not being as onedimensional but he is a dead eye shooter Gung talk about having the Poise catches the ball takes a second to probe turn face looks weak side Evans with his hand ready to knock down to three its an amazing note on this Duke team theyre assisting 61 of their made baskets thats the highest assist rate for Duke since the dick bro team of 19515 two McLoud very little use this year but hes played the last couple of games in the big man scores by the way your 2001 title team was not far off at 58 thats the kind of company this Duke team is in terms of sharing the ball theyll share it again Evans with a shot fake back for proor a three its good Evans hit the last three and sets up Proctor for the next one yeah great job by Evans to get to that short corner Force the defense to collapse F once again rotating over knocking down the shot Duke makes 10 made threes per game four assist six makes for Duke this evening Starling guarded by the much taller freshman flag Starling rejected by flag on a threepoint Try by the way Im waiting for one Syracuse player to utilize a head fake and cck into the player every player has left their feet for every shot James for three its good a timeout needed by Adrien Audrey as duke hits three conss 12 blocks a game 15 steals a game by the way in all of those categories hes in the top nine in the ACC hell be the fourth freshman to ever win national Player of the Year Zion Anthony Davis and Kevin Durant have been the recipients of that award and I think right as of right now I think he is ahead of Janai broom is in a two person race yes between cam Jones hes in that too but I think its between those two respectively Bell puts it on the deck and rattles home with three a needed answer for Chris Bell this play has been so much better since hes came off the bench just doesnt seem to be forcing it knocking down shots better from the perimeter really extending that defense offensively Evans around Starling into McLoud spiked off the Applause glass once again so few opportunities to run against a Duke defense that rats third in the country in defensive efficiency behind only Tennessee and Houston just look how fall out SRA is running our offense good pass catches and finishes two baskets for deim mlau and John shy will take a timeout in games prior to a season ending foot surgery two points against Cy but out coming out four straight dmps getting him in the rotation with lampin I think is going to be really big against the size and the length of how Duke likes to play ad ay said after the Cal game had been working really hard for the last couple of weeks felt like it was the right time to give him a shot his flag against my store that freshman over crushman rebound Starling Syracuse is showing superer flag multiple bodies every time he turns and faces seeing three or four white jerseys Applause Starling gets another screen from the cloud easy for James to fight through it great close out by kiple Bell puts it on the deck Chris Bell very short and thats knocked away off of my stovich and itll be Duke ball with under eight to play thats our under eight timeout opportunities as of right now so some of these potential out of non nonconference games will come in very heavily down the stretch out of the four we saw there wake SMU pit UNC who has the best shot you think to make a push I think pit probably um just because of their guard play the way they can lie it up I know theyre going in and out but I would probably say they have the most Talent wake is there too wake d a good fight week and a half ago ultimately fell at home Proctor for three we talked about if you keep going under those screens I know Syracuse typically sit in deep drop coverage but if youre tyes Proctor K can nipple Cooper flag you have the green light to shoot every time you see that opposing guard go under Dukas at five of its last seven from Deep very good threepoint shooting team and they take a lot Davis fading and scoring over K really like the PO right there by dar davis3 superer flag just three points so far for Duke theyve done it with balance hes only taken two shots put a screen Carlos here canle great job by Carlos fighting over the top of that screen now Carlos going have to fight against flag and Carlos strips it away the undersized point guard kicks it to Starling who three is Applause short Carlos picks up flag again in the half court James drives it over McLoud and finishes James I really think seon James has a chance to be a pro talking to a couple of Scouts earlier today its obvious he needs to improve his shooting but he has a great feel for the game High basketball IQ and hes great at making reads now this team has no traditional point guard but they have a lot of Playmakers and theres one of them kiple who is fouled in the act of shooting a three Davis picks up Syracuses third foul sonion James right here just off the drive you know and thats when Duke can go small if Syracuse switches McLoud doesnt have this size or lateral quickness to stay with James he can drive him straight from the perimeter but also if youre mlau you have to recognize that James isnt a great threepoint shooter you can play off of him and you can contest late with that 76 Wings going Applause the first of three for kiple 87 free throw shooter look at the last five games of thatss including the goose EG at BC 25 at Miami Hit six threes 22 five assists and two steals against Carolina what impresses you most about con nickol game he never forces it I think theres very much a Workman like approach to the game for him every drill you see him work out in he goes the same speed which is hard but he has a good change of pace I like his size I like his frame and the way he utilizes that frame to top the rim I think hes a complete player F cuff Off the Bench for the first time for Syracuse does it the lead for Duke orange just seven for 20 from the field May hard shots Carlos just off the benchs it up to the rim and the Qui back there by Davis who sealed kiple and got Applause fouled Davis at 220 actually has the frame to carve people out for offensive rebounds K canle got caught standing up right there starting at to fly the ball not boxing out Davis great job by Davis to recognize that and just sometimes Duke tries to rely upon his athleticism to get those bounds but he was carving out space left and right up Davis cant convert some threepoint play Syracuse has been great on the glass every offensive Rebound in the game and theyre plus six overall proor from flag shot ready Brown swats it out flag is ready for three and thats short and canle thought he knocked it off Davis and its Syracuse ball this Thursday its tomorrow night great Prime Time womens basketball double header love this non conference game its always fun when Yukon and Tennessee renew their rivalry paig Becker in the number five Huskies in the Knoxville at 630 and then Hannah hialgo one of the top scorers of the nation and number three Notre Dame a title Contender hosting Stanford 830 Eastern on ESPN those games both on the ESPN app you know K the one thing thats so hard about D its the pressure is persistent and is sustained throughout 40 minutes of play about Cooper flag right now is three points not having a great game Syracuse limiting his touches but Syracuse also down by 10 caros what create difficulty on every one of these shots is so high Caleb Foster just off the bench offensive rebound down for brown Duke finally with an offensive rebound the last couple of possessions and then kiple is fouled and Duke is going to need Foster to get going hes had three straight games with goose eggs was held scoreless against North Carolina I know that shot has been struggling but they talk about a guy who started last year 11 points Off the Bench against Auburn but hes a guy you need to keep engaged in offense cuz hes another playmaker and he he does have the ability to make critical shots May a ton last year and I I think as duke gets later into the season theyre going to have to find ways to get Caleb Foster Music going three out of bounds is canle undercut hey you my leg like a rebounder Lucas Taylor so one of the I dont really know where where the foul was there was there a foul thought was just s out of bounds just fall out of bounds okay one of the things that we get to see up close and here is how well Duke communicates youre just at home just watch the way they switch watch the way they fight defensively well malat at the backo of the defense is communicating at the top of the key on every pick and roll and every other good player is echoing commands theres a foul there but before that was 20 seconds of brilliant defense by dke which is dominating that side always down in The Stance I think this is the most disciplined defensive Duke team they had in a long time and such a young team too to Shire has drill this team very well they by the way only committed four fouls in Syracuse has shot just one free throw with all this hard guarding cup gets face around on the big man malawat and that foul will go against Duke Eddie lampin in position theres the fif Duke foul of the half you talked recently about Duke practicing Championship Happ is is that what you mean communication defensively well especially if youre applying pressure on the ball you know and I think a lot of times when guards are applying pressure on the ball its the Bigs responsibility to communicate to that guard where those screens are coming from or what the reads are defensively things that are about to happen so its that trust that is developed between your bigs and your guards with the pressure as well that was the second on kiple hell stay out there Starling trying to get around his old teammate Brown Puff malat goes straight up in the air and brown snatches it away and thats the hard part you get a drive towards the Baseline malat is already in help position with his arms up with that 75 wingspan block out the sun team that starts three two freshman third best defensive team in the country you see last year Foster would have shot that he wouldnt have thought about it Proctor rolls it in for ground batted away with 17 to Applause shoot you like what Syracuse is doing theyre really digging in defensively theyre getting points on the offensive glass they have to limit their turnovers Duke with eight points off those five turnovers thats the reason why theyre staying in this game theyre getting the 5050 balls and theyre defensively rebounding flag replaces kiple proor and Lins going to be called for foul there against malawat first on Eddie lampin fifth on Syracuse long threes equal long rebounds got to be ready to chase those things down we talked about Dukes ability to get in the offensive glass those are the type of possessions that you have to get James back on the Applause floor flag thats where hes going to get a shot hes going to get a shot on any pick and roll of Mal because lampin is in such deep drop coverage hes going to get a midrange shot each and every possession if he wants five for flag its two by does it Syracuse has not scored in about three minutes great job by Cooper coming from the weak side there to stop lamping on the slip black switched on to Cuff the Kansas transfer lost to hand hand James with a steel James down the floor got Starling in the air couldnt finish Syracuse does not have a fast break point in the game once again Duke back defensively Taylor listen to the communication on the court wow fou lamp we talked about lampin sealing Mala trying to be aggressive he kept him in a high side sealed him off and nobody should be able to get around lampin seal with that size and frame he has 1001 career points for lamp congratulations to him thunderous finish if your Cooper flag thats going to be your bread and butter any kind of middle of the Court pick and roll with Lampton even if he shows flag is good enough to get to the rim off the dribble backto back positions theyve gotten a point the basket from the flag model pick roll and theres a three for Lucas Taylor much needed for the senior from Raleigh TL coming off a season High 19 against Cal on Saturday flag another midrange jumper and a late whistle Adrian ay incensed flag will shoot two second B number six heres that pick and roll middle of the court lampin in that drop coverage you know Davis is up on the high side he going to get that pick and roll each and every time and then offensively for Syracuse darling I love this on the screen Cooper tries to jump on the screen he rejects it kicks the ball to the corner forces the defense to help on the help side knocks down the shot you got to get creative with that high PNR start foul was lamin second was talking about that you know sometimes if youre stalling a Veer at the top of the key since theyre switching or if they want to jump it sometimes you can catch Cooper flags head leaning in One Direction or looking at the screen and when he does that that allows you to reject the screen and Sterling has to be able to make those reads with his eyes and that takes a certain level of awareness each and every possession and two more free throws the flag of the other end you saw the note there since the 11 60 attempted free throws rest of his team combined 77 and hes shooting 80 under a minute to play in a first half that has been controlled by Duke which has not Applause trailed L still out there with the two fouls Taylor little flip shot HED around to BR Proctor Flags his settled down now 6 seconds between game and shot clock good recognition by The Freshman pull it out utilize as much as a shot CL as possible both teams have used their first half timeout proor Malad screens for a proctor three like I said lampin is in top coverage going get a wide open shot and its knocked away from Starling at the end of the half Brown Hees it and brown back rims it hours from Canada to see Cooper flat wow I didnt see or have not seen any signs that say Kevin Brown you are not looking uh closely enough I did see one sign that says Stephen A Smith for president now you are looking closely enough for that one I wont be on the ballot yet but thank you for your consideration I mean you are the mayor here you know everybody at the ular score thats not necessarily true theres a guy across the way I havent met yet 14point lead Starling and Syracuse Begins the half with another turnover and then JJ Starling picks up his second foul so much the way the first half ended well coach alri is telling Starin to throw the ball over the top but also you cant be lethargic with your passes you have to utilize ball F you have to be sharp and also you cant Telegraph where youre going to pass the ball stting looking exactly where wanted to pass the rock GLE and tyres proc reach had nine in the first half GLE set up by James spins in Duke 73 of the Applause night and the lead is a game high 17 now for Duke and Syracuse hang around find some baskets here to start the half keep this thing from getting out of hand Davis that do six for G Applause Davis Blue Devil shooting at 46 from the field seven of 16 from three and theyve only turned it over once misses the dunk and Syracuse has numbers five on four Taylor calling for it sets up Starling great look Miss from three flag get in that screen with malat malat is fouled on the catch well Taylor youre going to see Taylor dig in to help on this drive right here on James and no need to be that deep on the drive you got to H you you got to get out to a perimeter shooter thats shooting 38 from the threepoint line cant allow KH kiple to catch and shoot wide open this is what he does minus side they got lucky there foul was lamins third he stays out there the Syracuse big man there we go off his hands though you like the idea there well drag that screen out force that Defender to come with you proor elevates and scores it over the top of the Freshman Mo thought he got away with an offensive foul right there he extended that left arm its a good shot but should have been called second devil in the double figures because of the uncalled foul 13 nothing off turnovers right now for Duke been letting Davis work and he draws kles third foul and theyre letting Davis work but the ball isnt moving its not rotating the defense theyre going more to an isolated set and if youre John sh and if youre Duke defense youll take contested fadeaway jump shots by darer Davis all day long somebody should Dive Right to the basket well hes not protecting the basket hes parallel to the inbound turn Face go Baseline going to isolate Davis again another Fade Away jump shot he hits another has great body control long as they keep isolating blocks and hes going to get the shot he wants time hero from Delaware them to their first NCAA Tournament 2013 roor malawat push Lin no foul either way like it theyre turning malat into a score how little offense have they run for him throughout the course of the year I like the strategy of your Archy right force malawat to be the one to beat you lampin sets up Davis again they keep running about hes got up both baskets in the half on a brick and that will be Syracuse ball I dont know why Davis settled for the shot right there the tur the face on K nipple and keep punishing him keep driving him get into that sweet spot within that orange Gap in the lane Malik Brown replaces malat three first half steals his career high at Syracuse by the way was five give it to him Music very stagnant possession here Taylor hoisted three its not close flag go to work on Davis and the flip is good for Cooper flag within I think got knocked down hitting his own teammate Brown what a tough shot I dont think Jer Davis could be any more physical with coopa flag in his P Starling airball from point Black Range Tracked Down by Lampton power dribble into Brown lampin in all kinds of trouble steel for flag flag and he gets absolutely held up that very well could be a flagrant on Taylor Ted Valentine and John Gaffney are into discuss it yeah thats a one position we want you to a player on the court so Tyrese Proctor K nipple cion James they all can initiate the offense but when you need a bucket and you need somebody to get the composure of the offense no means that is Cooper flag incredible incredible basketball IQ thats been a parent since day one by the way just a smart kid in general he had a 40 GPA in the fall semester people flag you saw that this summer at USA Basketball when you had guys like Stephen Curry and Kevin Durant and LeBron James all probate about not only his skill but his ability to make reads and thats the hardest thing its a lot of times the Freshman the game is going at 8000 mph and certain players have that ability for the game to slow down and even if the game being slowed down at this level is still extremely fast at the next level Cooper was making reads at the next level at the highest of the next level points created system 31 a game like create some more here Davis fouls Brown another terrific F like once again just its one dribble with the left hand watch ball gets rotated here comes the screen Wonder dble with the left hand boom right in the pocket I mean thats a pocket pass thats Precision passing and when we talk about the complete player I know a lot of people get angry at me when I say that but its the Precision of the passing its the shooting thats gotten exponentially better its the ball handling the making the reads and its also the defense I mean he could be a primary Defender but hes also incredible coming from the weak side and making those defensive adjustments and getting a lot of tips and Applause deflections seven in the ACC and assist seventh in rebounding second points seventh in blocks ninth in Steels like I said the most complete freshman I think that has played to in B basketball history I know thats a lot of incredible players thats Grant Hill I think Grant had a High upside I dont know if Grant scored the way that Cooper does right now I know that Z was prolific Marvin Bagley prolific Im not sure that either one of those guys as defensively as good as Cooper flag and making reads its complete its all fastests of the game jquan Carlos fad over CER Syracuse running the fadeaway offense here in the second half all three Buck turn the fade away offense yeah just everybody shooting Fade Away shots you got to come up with something new against Duke I guess another pocket pass and brown brings the Thunder off the drop down from James Adrien Entre calls his orange over potential lottery picks all right uh we just found that news out about the same time as Kevin what are your thoughts on that Jimmy Butler trade I I dont know if I like it for for Golden State yeah Im not sure that can JB adjust I think he can potentially but theyre uity system and how that offense runs around Steph Curry I know you think it adds another dog defensively along with Draymond Green but Im not sure synergistically it works with the style and fluidity of how Golden State plays offense James knocked away Proctor hoyon misses a three about for brown you like the piece as Miami gets back Andrew Wiggins couple of players in the first rounder uh yeah I I think oh good pass oh I tell you Malik Brown John sh was right about him not only is he great defensively but this has incredible Court vision and offense works a lot better with him on the court Brown impacting the game basically every way in this second half first game against his old team first two years in Syracuse transferred after a lot of his classmates in the first two years either transferred or left school okay be just a close the loop on the Butler I I know he didnt want to be there in Miami anymore thought he went about it the wrong way but theres always been some type of challenge with Jimmy and you could deal with that challenge when hes in the prime of his career but dealing with that challenge when youre 35 years old a different stage that Im not sure its worth the investment SE James with a threepoint opportunity for Duke took the hard foul from Bell and a chance for one more for the two Lan transfer as duke is starting to pull away hes just built like an 18 wheeler man I mean he does a good job fighting over the top and I mean just once he buries his shoulder into you theres nothing you can do hes going to bounce you off and then gain his balance in the process and look at that thats a tough lefthanded finish there a lot of NBA Scouts that like seon James they want a shot to continue to improve its something he will continue to work on but defensively he is a hawk and offensively he just knows how to play hes always always in the right position on the court averaging 843 and a steal a game 37 from three we were talking about like theres nothing about this Duke team that just like jumps off the page right but like theyre very methodical in their approach they beat you in the details and in the margins yeah theyre an incredibly fun team to watch despite not always flying up and down the court like fundamentals can be really fun I know this sounds like you know fullon Dad mode here but well you are a dad I am a dad now so maybe thats whyc its fun to watch them get in a stands its fun to watch them switch and you feel like youre playing Five on eight against them when theyre at their defensive best they are just furious theyre playing the game Syracuse wants him to play and they have a 22point lead off the misstep back by Starling James from Foster Isaiah Evans short and theres Brown again tips it to FL Vision to see James and Duke reset with Foster Foster flag Brown James fake drop Brown layup it is looking like a clinic good grief I mean how many extra passes can you make everybody should get like a quarter of an assist for that play on the floor for d i i Davis again hes been the offense in this half and boy he can hit a turn around Jer Davis this is just not a reflection on sarap I mean Duke has been dismantling a multitude of opponents we had the chance to call North Carolina vers pit which is a really close and tight game and Duke was just able to pick them apart Caleb Foster just finished that may be the loudest the Duke bench has been all night they know how important it would be to get him going again just adds so much more depth if he can find his offensive rhythm this is the kind of thing Adrien ay told us he was worried about you can hang with Duke for a while but theres going to be that three minute stretch where they can just bury anybody this has been a lot longer than 3 minutes right now Davis again feed Starling who finally hits a three JJ starlings first points in about 23 minutes of game time Applause instructions for John shy for foster and flag Foster good hands by Carlos as Syracuse point guard will step through and McLoud follows a Applause Miss car is really good at get him low to the ground and pushing up into your pocket you cant afford to be lazy with that ball and play with it in front of him all defensive team in the CA and hopster a year ago actually played well against Duke for hopster last year 10 and nine assists thats going to be a shot flag inside a high flying Applause flag the kid that drove 8 hours from Canada is going to feel like hes flying on the8 hours back Cole now flag with a block shots thats just a smart foul by Bel cuz who knows what would have happened had he not stop that out I know we talk about Cooper flag a lot and maybe if you dont like to CU proy three youre sick of it heres the thing he is worth it every game he does this kind of stuff hes 18 years old you know the hype built and built and built over the past year or so before Cooper flag came to Duke hes exceeded that almost immeasurable height in a way that not many freshmen Applause do McLoud gets a bit of Revenge and a season High eight for him but you look at that stat line KB its 115 and one youre like oh theres nothing impress about that stat line but if you watch the game he the passes the shots the rebounds the moves have been all very prolife not a lot of wasted mov movement with Cooper fly cuff step back three McLoud tough rebound that was the biggest yell for somebody that didnt get off the ground it was now when youre seven4 needs to get off the ground C misses another three and this time itll be gangba entangled with movage its Duke ball on the Arrow I only joke with ML but he love the fight that hes bringing to the table he sprting the floors getting rebounds had the Strong finish and got the offensive rebound and look frankly Syracuse at times theyve needed fight not just tonight fought for well tonight theyve needed fight this year in and out in terms of the different rotations theyve had eight starting lineups theyre still without Donnie Freeman great freshman theyre not sure if theyre going to get him back he hasnt played a month with a lower leg injury you see the boot on the right foot of Donnie Freeman right there red alri told us they should know pretty soon whether or not Donnie Freeman is going to have a chance to come back or be shut down AIT boy that is a quick release Isaiah Evans another Duke three their night know hearing a lot of these coaches talk about hiring a general manager since we getting a capologist and you got a raise Capital see Chris Bell knocked down to three Rachel Baker is in the house of dke John Sher one of the first coaches to bring on a general manager she came from Nike Baylor is really good at it as well and thats going to be the challenge for a lot of schools and all conferences raising Capital to get the top tier players in a school look at the the typical age of players in SEC theyre around 22 Music game within a game Seth Greenberg I love it game within a big game Arkansas trying to get back to the bubble they won at Kentucky obviously Saturday win in Texas it be another quad one win tonight how about Coach Audrey coach with Seth Greenberg yes and had a lot of funny stories for me to share with Seth Greenberg back in studio but not for the public to know not perer hey Duke undefeated in the league theyre going to be 120 if they win this game according to Kim pom heres the percentage chance to win their remaining games Saturday at Clemson is their toughest one statistically then they play Illinois which I love and John shy said I wasnt sure if Id love it but he said I love it now that were going to get a nonconference test step out of the league a different kind of style little prepar for the tournament that games at the Garden February 22nd so add it all up its a 43 chance Oh you mean North thats right thats thats what you call M Garden uh what toughest game on that schedule for you what do you think probably I would probably say Illinois just because of their versatility offensively um but I I also think the game that is going to be a tough game I you saw NC State give Duke a really hard fight at Cameron indor and I thinkon is going to be playing for something especially at Applause home well next Wednesday Dukes going to be in the ACC Network hosting Cal Andre stovich great score for the Golden Bears Stanford which is hovering around the bubble but really needs to rack up wins goes to Georgia Tech starting the double header at 7 Eastern Georgia Tech has made a lot of noise in the past week theyve knocked off both Clemson and Louisville second and third place teams in the league that was right after I said I thought Louisville would go undefeated for the month of February I did hear that but you didnt have to call yourself out like that your spot I appreciate your honesty though it happens every day wouldnt be the first nor will be the last well they go undefeated maybe after that game you know the timing of the comment yeah hey if folks havent watched Louisville play that is a really fun team and an amazing story disastrous last couple years won 12 games and Pat Kelce a whole new roster rejuvenated that theyll be in the tournament probably has a pretty good seed you got to think that Pat Kelce has to be top three for National Coach of the Year Bell misses movich malat draped on him Bell is all alone and he hits a three Chris Bells knocked down three threes tonight you know we got box scores that get sent away every break I am blown away absolutely blown away that Syracuse has not made a free throw this entire game and theyve only attempted one free throw thus far well how about that its been at least 25 Seasons since Syracuse has not made a free throw in a game at least 25 and its not like they havent been aggressive in attacking the paint a lot of their shots have been ISO shots kind of extending From the Block but it just speaks to the Brilliance of Dukes defense one one miss by Brown who has been as brilliant as anybody amazing game for Malik Brown people dont understand how hard it is to to play Elite defense without fouling it takes a certain mental discipline especially to sustain that discipline throughout the course of a game ball knocked away theres another steal for brown who else Foster tough finish for Caleb Foster over the the top of cuff couple of baskets for foster Off the Bench by storic passes up the three cuff will take it out tip by McLoud and a foul going to go against Duke and Malik Applause Brown the Browns six points eight rebounds an assist and three steals in 21 minutes great piece in the daily orange the Syracuse student newspaper this week talking about the Le Brown and parents said that Duke was one of his dream schools but he was a very lightly recruited kid Syracuse got him and they felt like they had a steal and he was a terrific player here for two years but a lot of players left for the last couple of years Malik brown leaves gets the d as Proctor is fouled hell shoot two dont forget coming up next Aransas and Texas big week it could be for the Razer backs in the knockdown drag out SEC ESPN 2 right after this game and on the ESPN app and if we are not done by nine which well see give you an update on where that game starts you know one of the things John sh talked about I was listening to an interview of him on my flight over here about how coachable everybody on his roster is and in todays day and age of the transfer portal with nil I dont think people at home understand how much of a rarity that is have everybody on your roster pulling in the same direction its damn near impossible in todays game cuz somebody is unhappy with their playing time somebody somebodys agent is trying to renegotiate their deal theyre unhappy about the amount of money theyre getting or the way theyre going to be positioned and everybody in this roster for Duke seems that winning is above everything and theyre competing for something different now Auburn could be the same that could be a couple other teams on the same its just you dont see this every single day in todays climate two longest win streaks in the nation Duke and offer really good St Marys teams in there too Brown just blocked that shot John chair told us something today say that fits in that exact vein what youre saying I thought this was interesting he said this is the least social media interested group weve had and maybe people are going to laugh when they hear that but that is a real thing well coming off last year with Jared McCain right he was obviously you know hes hurt but playing for the 76ers was incredible I mean was a social media sensation and star like it it seems like theres all these dudes care about is whoop and thats not to say you cant have fun on Instagram but he said this group just dont care about it he said it helps because Cooper flag doesnt care about any of that stuff and when your lead guide doesnt care it sets the tone for the rest of the roster malawat with the alley dunk on the last one from Evans four assists for isaah Evans tonight and a 27point lead for Music Duke Fosters third foul uh Syracuse will be in the bonus on the next end that might be the end for Malik Brown who gets nice hand from John shy and the Duke fans you know one last thing Kevin on John shy that I have to give him credit for its not every day but you get a chance to fill in the shoes of potentially the greatest coach of all time John has done that seamlessly hes been classy hes had the top recruiting class for multiple years well have it again next year with Cameron Jen Boozer and he has a unique coaching ability that is relatable and keeps guys oh my good that is something thats not relatable to about 9999 of the human population CC John Shire and Duke my goodness up 31 seven dunks in the game and so much ridiculous ball movement you just tell me what you dont like about the next series of plays youre going to see a little Drive kick short Corner oh mil brown with the dime oh a pass extra pass head fake get into the Gap again another extra pass oh reverse Le and then a little he fake in a little Applause show I mean Seth Greenberg in studio talking about a a grown blanket man we got a lot of grown blanking men on this court add it all up its scoop by 31 they led by 14 to the half plus 17 of the second my God Greenberg in studio getting really edgy getting edgy Im liking Im wearing off for whats your favorite kind of Seth edgy edgy Coach G I call him notorious VG its pretty good that was that was worthy of a sticker at least JJ Starling the last pck hes got 12 Starling and Davis post Syracuse Leaders with a dozen theres another Duke dunk its gunga eight Duke dunks I mean this thing is like this is the end of Dukes bench essentially in the game with the exception of malat before a free throw really were going to have a a promo for you tomorrow night love the great nonconference games you get late in the year at Womens Basketball Yukon Tennessee always delivers 630 Eastern on ESPN followed by Stanford and third ranked Notre Dame Irish have won 14 in a row thats tomorrow on ESPN so here you go Syracuse 0 for one at the line nahem McLoud hits the first orange free throw of the game his first made free throw of the year just another tough night we we can just watching just watching you transition from excitement for the first M free throw of the game to a visual of Coach alrey well its been that kind of night so seriously weve talked about the Duke part this we can keep but the other side where do Syracuse go from here I mean you have to thing it to compete are you talking about shortterm longterm yes which which one I mean they played well Saturday but obviously that was a cal Duke is Far and Away the best team in this league but 20 and 12 a year ago theyre 10 and 12 this season the thing about cak is had so many one possession losses that you know it it takes winning experienced players to close out those games we had two of those games between you know Texas Tech Texas and they were had legit shots in both those games so you know I I think this just another learning experience and also I think that the talent level needs to be elevated for Syracuse I think Syracuse fans recognize that I think the coaching staff recognizes that the collective for Syracuse basketball also needs to recognize that because youre not going to get top tier Talent without having top tier Capital that is as crazy as it would sound a few years ago thats the reality of basketball right now by the way that was the reality a few years ago thats been a reality 20 years ago and dont get maybe maybe not with the word Collective but yes in the same sense Duke took a time out to get some substitutes in Spencer hubard walk on guard is in there my stovic floats and finishes Neil begovic graduate student from Stanford in the game along with Harris Foster and gunba Darren Harris a five star freshman who barely plays thats how deep Duke is he turns it over its just the fifth Duke turnover of The Game season low is four against Auburn theyve turned it over a couple of times down the stretch talk about Darren Harris 66 freshman Virginia Gatorade Player of the Year Virginia Virginia number one over number 31 over recruit per ESP in top 100 talk about the depth of talent John shy has on this roster Harris still trying to find ways to crack into that rotation thats how Duke thats how deep this Duke team is you imagine that the number 31 overall recruit in isbi in top 100 is trying to crack into the rotation I mean basically any other roster on the country hes playing maybe Auburn is tough Auburn Duke is not much else the maybe starting yep not sure whats happening here the call from John Gaffney was cuff stepped out of bounds with the ball he and Lee Cassel are conferring about that Dukes next game Saturday at Clemson be one and two in the ACC it looks like by the way Dave OBrien Cory Alexander and the long way to return dick vital will be on the call Saturday we cannot wait oh baby hes the all Rose Roser I want say that I am so happy to have dick byel back in this game obviously hes been fighting cancer had a fall I saw his daughter and her husband at Duke North Carolina Dicky V I love you you are a monument that we have in this game you are staple of this game college basketball misses you we are so excited to have you back we said we said Saturday night going to be an amazing game and an emotional game for all of us that have watched college basketball on TV in our lives and dont know what its like to watch college basketball without deck by to on the sideline with a headset on I mean my first game in college was against Stanford at the Garden Ill never forget seeing him on the sideline awesome and literally interrupting him during his broadcast telling him how excited I was to meet him hes like dont focus on the game we love you dick 8354 is a score Darren Harris has added a couple of baskets Off the Bench for Duke which is shooting 57 69 in the second half if youre looking for steps forward for Duke they crushed Carolina Saturday but they took their foot off the gas in the second half they did not take their foot off the gas in this second half there was no let down the game after the UNC game sometimes its emotional let down anything but for Duke which wins by 29 here in the doome thats why people are picking this team to win a National Title human nature is to take your foot off the gas but thats thats another team thats not this Duke team they are special and they have a chance to be great longest season
