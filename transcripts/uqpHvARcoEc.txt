And Clark currently ranked second in the ACC in assists Hes nine assists away from breaking John Kates career record at Virginia Every time he suits up hes passing somebody of note or breaking some sort of record He provides a stability for this group without question He is the straw that stirs the drink for the Cavaliers Bert Smith Jamie Lucky Paul Cells are officials tonight Virginia with the opening tip Louisville wearing uniforms as part of Black History Month More on the specifics of the jerseys later on Virginia coming off a win against Duke a half game behind Pit in the ACC Shot clock in single digits That does not bother UVA Clark with three to shoot To the baseline and Jaden Gardner cant get the roll The rebound snagged by Kamari Lambs is the freshman getting to start after a nice game against Miami over the weekend L Ellis who controls had a careerhigh 33 in that loss to Miami A game in which Louisville scored 85 but gave up 93 And thats part of it defensively They got to lock in Theyve got the length to do it And they must its imperative take care of the basket This is Withers Corner three goes Jaylen Withers shooting 51 from deep cheering in conference play and a Louisville team that is just three and 22 with one league win has the early lead on number seven Virginia Look its a Louisville team that knocked down 10 threes against Miami Theyre feeling a little bit from distance Vanderlass no good for the Ohio transfer Virginia starting the small lineup again Jordan had a lot of success with that lineup but they can trot out a bunch of different looks Coach Minnet has versatility and a bench that can produce There is lands pulls up too strong and the rebound by Ben Vanderlouse Starters for Virginia Clark and Beman both rank in the top three in the conference in assists Franklin the teams leading scorer as Clark court screws inside and the rebound pulled down by JJ Trainer Nice hesitation to open up the gap Just couldnt finish and punctuate Alice has a mismatch Gives it up instead to Mike James You got to get it down low Thats a mismatch Failure to identify Thats where this group can grow Trainer on Clark And yet still theyre not trying to attempt to get the ball to Withers will try the turnaround He doesnt get it And thats something weve seen from Louisville this year Offensively no connectivity at times 68 verse 510 on the low block Trainers got to demand a touch They got to play in space to allow him a touch Franklin on the drive Knocked away Last touch Louisville And thats spoken like a true big guy 6A and on 510 If you dont throw me the ball youre mad coming down the floor Hoop heads No Were yelling Mouse in the house Give me the basketball You got to command it to get that attention A missed opportunity Is mouse in the house a cousin of bore on the floor Absolutely Bore on the floor would sound weird to yell cheering More common place Mouse Four on the shot clock Beakman driving off the window The put cheering back by Vanderlas Ripens finest Right place right time The ripping Wisconsin native You shocked me today with your knowledge of ripping Wisconsin during shoot The home of ripping good cookies The home of Doug and Shirley Pepler My inlaws laughter Here is Ellis leading scoreer for the Cardinals Now Trainer thought about the three puts it on the floor over Vanderclass and the rebound chased down by the Ohio transfer Beakman for three cheering That one no good But he is vastly improved from deep this season Theyre getting the looks they want Ellis swivels inside Could not finish Now Virginia the other way Jordan you start to say Whats different about this Virginia team offensively Far more firepower and much better than in years past Theyve always been efficient on offense but this team it might be where the offense is ahead of the defense Yeah And thats fine because look the 2019 National Championship team was to that degree as well They led with offense but they were very good defensively and pros loaded with them on that roster Impact pros What you do have with this perimeter in Virginia is three elite twoway twoway players They can guard and they can score And Franklins one of them working right here Theres Withers Hes got five for Louisville All five for the Cardinals cheering Hes been really good the last six games starting to become confident understanding his role leaning into his ability and efficient and knocking down those threes As you mentioned earlier Virginias won nine out of 10 entering play Franklin working on James Now its Clark lines up a three and hits And Kihei Clark with his first field goal He had 16 points five assists over the weekend against Duke Now the big key for Louisville tonight offensively taking care of the basketball Theyve struggled with turnovers While Virginia might not be as elite on defense as theyve been in years past theyre still awfully good Ellis kicks to Withers Hes had the hot hand That one too strong And its Clark with the car These are good offensive sequences though from Louisville Theyre moving that basketball getting the looks they want Theres a level of competence to the offense we havent seen cheering Virginia gets it back after Clark turned it over Beman for three Short Rebound tapped out Out of bounds by Gardner And that brings us to our first media timeout Kenny Payne had a message for his Louisville team at Shooter Well share that with you when we come back Kenny Payne uttered a refrain at shootaround today He told his team a number of times Tonight is a golden opportunity You have a top 10 team coming into your venue into your house This is a lost season for Louisville Three and 22 Frankly its one of the worst seasons to date in the history of the ACC by a member school However theyre building a foundation Theyre trying to install a culture And if youre trying to use a moment as a springboard for next season what better way than a win against a top 10 team Yeah look Anish you never want to be in a position in February where youre trying to motivate your team But thats absolutely of the utmost importance to a group thats gone through what they have So there has to be specific messaging before each game to try and engage a group that suffered nothing but lost the entire season And the idea to come out here and be a disruptor Virginias trying to play for a conference championship Theyre also trying to improve their seating for March Madness Go out there and make it wonky is the message to this Louisville group And so far they bought in taking care of the basketball giving themselves a chance Meanwhile Virginia goes into a game where theyre expected to win And Tony Bennett telling us his message to his team was Were in a race Virginia is chasing Pittsburgh for first in the conference That means the number one seed in the ACC tournament And oh by the way Pit holds the tie break with the headtohead win against Virginia So they may need a little bit of help Tony knows the importance of that He didnt flinch in the response when I asked him that cuz I said these are challenging games Youre supposed to walk in there win by 20 He right away said were playing for a championship So he knows that these guys are locked in understand the bigger picture and to focus in every night you step on the floor This one into the back court with the shot clock winding down and the turnover for Louisville That is something to watch That is officially their first turnover of the game And you look 16 turnovers a game Uh whats really defined them with the turnovers their live ball turnovers their pick six is going the other way for baskets They only gave the basketball away These Cardinals 12 times in that loss to to Miami Thats great 20 points off of those 12 turnovers is absurd And thats not great Arman Franklin from the baseline Franklin Virginias leading scorer almost 13 a game He had 23 against Duke on Saturday What a weapon hes become for this Virginia group That three guard front of guards Versatility of the lineups Lot to like Ellis cheering How many shots like that has he hit this season Tough angle falling away So much is on the shoulders of L Ellis Its a top five scorer in the conference And I dont know if theres anybody who sees more defensive pressure and looks than L Ellis because hes truly the head of the snake for Louisville He took 20 shots against Miami over the weekend to more than a third of his teams total I mean hes the head hes the torso hes the lower Hes the snake Heres Vanderlas from the corner and the rebound to Withers I feel like Virginias starting to take more challenging shots Theyre accepting what presents itself and they can be a little bit more disciplined to take great ones every time Withers fouled on the drive Theres a reason theres NBA scouts here tonight Look theyre here to watch Reese Beakman Arman Franklin but theyre also here to look at L Ellis Hes got something to his game that is very intriguing His knack for scoring the basketball uh thats at a premium at the next level So this guy has it Id love to see him stay here at Louisville for another season Play off the ball cuz I think thats where hes at his best He averages more than 17 a game Sydney Curry has the finger roll rim out Sydney Curry feasted on Virginia last season a little bit later in the season but on this home floor was really an announcement for him Can he channel some of that against one of the elite teams in the country Yeah he had 24 and 14 Heres Clark He does not get that to go Ellis pushing the other way Withers for three Another rebound to Kihei Clark His third Drops it off for Franklin Driving to the rim The cheering tip in not there Lands Pushes for the Cards Ellis calling for it Now Withers over to Hersy Miller Ellis cheering in the corner and hell slow That was matched up by the freshman Chris Dunn Ryan Doug excuse me Heres Miller Ellis for three Yes cheering Kihei Clark a little too tentative in getting out Youve got to contest even more Little bit lax Hand up Yes but not the pressure needed against a scorer like Ell Isaac McNeely the freshman Hes a sharpshooter Clark drives withers in the passing lane and its been an inspired effort early on by Louisville When we come back the significance of the Cardinals jerseys Well explain as well the black national anthem And the Louisville Cardinals tonight are wearing specialty uniforms to honor black excellence and heritage The uniforms feature a theme with cream colors paying homage to cream of the planet And the golden flowers reflect flowers regional to Louisville such as the state flower the golden rod Its part of our culture man You know were going to be styling those jerseys Look for an athlete put on a new jersey represents something Although every time you put on the Louisville jersey quite frankly it should Sometimes you get an elevated inspiring to take your word type of play Thats what weve had here in the first nine minutes for this Louisville team against a team that is far superior in the opponent in Virginia One turnover for a Louisville group two of four from three These are stats that can keep them in games and defensively holding Virginia to a shooting percentage of 27 Everything going right Shot cheering clock down to four Beman hes got to put it up Drives fades and a foul called on Hershey Miller right as the shot clock was winding down It was a foul I mean he got contact on the delivery from Beman And its a bailout because he was in great position At least at first look it looked to be a foul So he he stays Yeah I mean come on Its a foul It better be quick in the review here because the hand clearly caught the arm It disrupted the shot No question Virginia the beneficiary of a no foul call at the end of their win against Duke on Saturday That was when Kyle Filipowski was initially called for drawing a foul on a drive to the rim but after review the foul was overturned Officials said the foul came after the buzzer The game went to overtime Virginia ends up winning And then ACC officials said that hey that was the incorrect ruling If a play occurs after the buzzer while the ball is in midair as was the case its still a foul Well this one is too going to go Virginias way Uh a little bit more rightfully so in this sequence I do want to say this because that officiating crews got a lot of flack Their names dont need to be mentioned again Theyve been mentioned throughout that Virginia Duke game aftermath Thats an elite officiating crew Uh that made a mistake They they understand that they need to be aware of the rules at the very baseline of things U but there was five minutes in overtime to get it done I understand But that crew is an elite crew And after video review it is a twoshot foul So Beakman to the free throw line cheering Saturday against Duke This is typical Reese Beakman He only scored four points six rebounds seven assists a block three steals He does not have to fill up the scoring column to impact a game And thats whats so interesting The portfolio is diversified with the approach total real estate for Virginia A little bit of everything Its a little bit of everything by Stockton in here before March by the way Theyre attending to Gardner getting the blood off his hands I feel like we havent played basketball in a year Lets get back to the action We actually against all odds have a good one here in the first 10 minutes Were waiting so long GDO may step into the arena at any moment One out of two Half of people loving it other half googling right now I dont have reception Samuel Becket theater of the absurd cheering Miller lost it Has to pick it up Shot clock at five Ellis driving on Beakman off balance and Ellis able to draw the foul Beman is first Thats pretty impressive from L Ellis Hes gotten the basketball 6 seconds Spacing is off Theres no real gap He just has to put his head down and attack and he draws that whistle Thats kind of what illustrates the position hes been thrust in this season Hes not a true point but he has to be the point guard ball dominant and yet he makes something happen That sequence no different This Sunday no football So we load you up with more college basketball Can UNMC get back on track Heels in Raleigh to take on NC State Wolfpack fell to Syracuse on the road last night Then its Memphis taking on the number two team in the country the Houston Cougars What is ailing in North Carolina right now Consistency Shot making ability from beyond the arc I mean they have been horrific in that Clemson game shot it well but the three outside of that game threepoint shot has crushed that group Clark over to McNeely His three no good The rebound pulled down by Trainer cheering Another place where Louisville is tightened up in this game taking away second chance opportunities from Virginia Ellis contested over Kihe Clark cheering The crowd the crowd is alive at the Young Center a 3 and22 Louisville team midway through this first half leading the number seven team in the country cheering Heres Shedri Hes seen his minutes dip late with Virginia employing the smaller lineup more Trainer over Shedri and the rebound to Gardner Defensively very impressed with what Louisvilles doing and I was impressed when I saw their personnel and shoot around today I said theyve got the length Theyve got the length to guard but it takes the effort and youre seeing that length mixed with effort to be productive defensively Beman finds the cut in McNeely Thats what Beakman can do We know Kihei Clarks a great passer So is Reese Beman Mike James got caught ball watching and that was just a heady move for McNeely to go ahead and back putt him Perpetual movement from Virginias offense Lands against McNeely Freshman against freshman Curry skip pass nearly intercepted A collision as Clark went for the steal and theyll get the foul on Kihei Clark His first number there in rhythm this Louisville team offensively The dump down low to Sydney Curry He knew the double team read it beautifully made the quick pass but the flash of lands into the paint to draw that foul Starting to see Groom figure it out here this evening Heres Mike James Missed all it last year with a torn Achilles Ellis feeling it Hes got 13 cheering JJ JJ Trainer set a heck of a screen there Heck of the screen to blow Kihei Clark off of the ball to allow their best scorer Ellis to come in rhythm and knock down the three Shedric sets the pick for Beman Kicks it out to Clark Clark got Ellis in the air Give and go Back to Kihei for the easy two Just the back cuts A heady veteran group with high IQ Let them watch Well cut beat receivers and get easy Ellis almost turned it over Virginia got a hand on it L Ellis after scoring a careerhigh 33 Saturday has scored the last 13 for Louisville and he gets a muchdeserved breather Hes not going to be out for long Cant be cheering Miller for three off the mark Offensive rebound Curry backs down Cedric cheering muscles it up and in cheering applause Clark the other way Turn around No cheering rebound lands cheering Im not sure many expected this Its still early Plenty of time left but Louisville has come out inspired Miller on the drive Blocked Theres Shedley cheering And we get a foul on the Cardinals going the other way How about the start from this Louisville group come out shot out of Canon Go ahead Cards fans Throw the Ls up At least throw that one up LL Ellis on fire Hes leading this team with 13 of Louisvilles 20 And Anishh and the fans out there watching our audience Degree of difficulty high on the majority of these And thats what Hell Ellis is tasked with the defense having the target on him and yet still Virginia one of the better defensive teams in the country LL is still getting what he wants tonight 13 points four or five efficient Hes only had one turnover Hes been the lighthouse Three for three from beyond the arc as well And he has almost outscored Virginia by himself Ellis Mike James Trainer Withers and Lands the original starting five out on the floor for Louisville Its Beakman Franklin back out there along with McNeely Gardner and Vanderplas So Kihei Clark on the bench Heres McNeely on the drive Franklin dumps it down low to Gardner Hes crafty down low This time hes blocked and Louisville playing some defense Less than 7 minutes to go first half Heck of an effort from Trainer to come helpside allowing his link to be the difference That is the drive the kick James open cheering splashes it in This This right here is how coach Pay wants the offense to look Space drive kick NBA ideals but executing by finishing a poor threepoint shooting team put himself in position Franklin quiets the crowd and we were talking to Kenny Bane at shoot around and he mentioned the Golden State Warriors the way they play and he said so many people look at the Warriors and see great shooting I see great spacing and great passing Yeah And I see both quite honestly I mean that is a part of it But that play that dribble drive from L Ellis and that kick out to Mike James thats who they want to be How about the defensive effort from Trainer here to come over helpside his length greater than Gardners offering But right there the kick out Nobody around allows Mike James the look that he desires McNeely picked up the foul just before its team foul on Virginia And James has been rounding into form A lot was expected of him last year Never got into a game due to a torn Achilles Took him a while this year to get consistent Hes been much better in the new year as Trainer finishes with a nice move on the baseline cheering And thats just unacceptable defensively from Von Vanderlas and thats what they give up with him Hes a stretchy guy providing the offense He can be a liability defensively Theyre not in the stands Didnt close out properly Easy bucket for Louisville Virginia just seven of 22 from the field Make it seven of 23 cheering and two of eight from deep Settlement of the highest order You got to pursue a better look than that Go out Throw it out Picks it up James off the shot fake down the lane Franklin got a piece of it and a piece cheering of James Ill tell you they got what they wanted ultimately James driving but Im playing on the side Im Thats post repost from Trainer Vanderpass has to prove to me he can guard in isolation That needs to be a point to drive home for Louisville offensively right there A few the few possessions come This Louisville team coming into the game with a 3 and22 record That is a win percentage of 120 If the season were to end right now that would be the third worst win percentage by any team in the history of the ACC The only ones that were worse Virginia in 1961 and Clemson in 1955 And yet here are the Cardinals with a ninepoint lead on a top 10 team And for those wondering if coach Payne is the guy for the job look how this group is playing especially in this three half stretch of basketball for Miami to hear Theyre motivated to bought in Franklin draws the foul Thats one thing weve seen from Armont Franklin this year If the perimeter look isnt there hes been more aggressive taking the ball to the basket Thats part of being a next level guy the ability when they respect the jump shot to then attack the close out kind of clean to be coming helpside or backside from Withers They call the foul on Lambs cheering Franklin busted out of a slump over the weekend at cheering nine of 13 23 points was just two of 14 from the field and eight points in his previous two games combined Sevenpoint advantage for Louisville looking for just their second ACC win of the season and just fourth win overall They started 0 and9 on the campaign Gardner the steal up ahead to Franklin on the breakaway and the flush Its a heck of a defensive effort from Gardner cheering The timing to get that passing lane the IQ to offer it up to allow Franklin to run out Live ball turnovers The bugaboo of this Louisville team Cant have too many sequences like that Meanwhile Virginia has yet to turn it over in the first half Ellis kicks it out to Withers Open for three Great look Just couldnt finish Ellis he he got the attention Not one not two three defenders to allow Withers that look Unbelievable Franklins got nine to lead Virginia and he is fouled on the drive by Mike James Its played Louisville at times playing good basketball but those turnovers and the wins But in a season that has gone the way this one has for the Cardinals You start looking at now the last four games Yes there was the blowout to pit against Florida State They were down double digits rallied back made it close almost one If not for a bad start to the first and second half theyre right there with Miami And then tonight at home against number seven Virginia Again given the tradition the history and the winning thats taking place here that may not sound like a lot but its got to mean something for Kenny Payne A locker room that hasnt quit A team thats three and 22 Look theyd like to be learning at a faster rate What it comes down to is theyre just not there But you saw that huddle Coach Kenny Payne coach Danny Manning coach Nolan Smith These guys arent going to allow this for long Too easy Vanderlass off the feed from Beakman cheering And Virginia within three Cavaliers only 36 from the field Two of eight from three They have not turned it over and Louisville plus two on the glass Speaks to coach Benite attack A nice atto executed to perfection Air turnover Look like Withers may have jammed a finger They run two Currys got to make a decision Lets jump Thats dangerous Shot clock down to two Ellis through Gardner Withers No good rebound Franklin disjointed offensive possession Lucky even got an offering up at the rim Virginia can tie it with a three Gardner dangerous in the high post Franklin on the drive pass Curry and the put back is there by Gardner They got a foul down low as well Pick and roll defense failed Louisville in that possession They didnt wall off They didnt show hard enough in Withers You cant do that dance Withers needs to get that to be a retreat dribble from Franklin He didnt stay long enough So then that gap is just there to exploit Uh those are the little things defensively where the bodies are there but the execution mentally isnt conjoined A foul on the shot by Franklin waved off the gardener basket Withers to the bench We remind you on Saturday these Louisville Cardinals on the ACC Network getting set to host the Clemson Tigers Coverage begins at 7 Eastern on the ACC network And my eyes just went to Coach Payne saying I promise you the exact same thing to Jaylen Withers as he walked away You got to present yourself to demand that retreat dribble not allow that gap on the help on the pick and roll They are looking at Withers hand on the Louisville bench at the very end of it It looked like he might have jammed a finger on that possession where he didnt handle a pass clean Franklin driving left hand and we are tied at 26 Arman Franklin asserting himself hes got a dozen cheering As good as Elis has been Id argue Arman Franklins been even better a n0 run and a lot of its been because of the the driving lanes of Frank Curry maneuvering through a double team has it knocked away and its taken by Virginia bigman pushing driving on Ellis kicks to McNeely Vanderlass over trainer and Virginia with the lead and its 12 unanswered and Kenny Payne calls the timeout as good as Louiss been feels like Virginias game look at McNeel He left his feet but had a plan Vanderlas trainers got to get out there That is a sharp shooter Makes him pay in rhythm Were seeing that rhythm come together for this Virginia group These final two minutes critical to the outlook of this ball game And at times this year Louisville when hit with a haymaker has not been able to get off the canvas as Vanderlas commits the reach in Ellis Fargo basketball The lead for Virginia right now the first since it was 97 cheering and applause Heres Ellis Hes got 13 points Another tough shot That one rolls out Cant have a prettier miss than that one Another highly contested shot But L Ellis comfortable taking them Franklin back to Vanderlas Open back iron Heres Lambs And coming into the game for Louisville Brandon Huntley Hatfield He had missed the last eight games with a right foot injury Hes been practicing for more than a week Look good and shoot around today Hes going to be challenged to fend Vanderplas in pick and rolls as Vanderlas is a step out guy Hes going to have to show the mobility to defend that Ellis baseline drive has to give it up Shot clock at one And that is a shot clock violation The Virginia specialty to go back to Huntley Hatfield for a moment What he gives Louisville is another presence inside He was their top rebounder before getting hurt This guy was a high level recruit coming into college Made his way over here to Louisville I mean top 25 level recruit before he found a home here Hes got talent Hes got a transfer Final 30 seconds of the first half Vanderlas wanted it Hes got the mismatch on Ellis Kicks it out to Beakman Now its great ball movement Offensive rebound Gardner He gets bumped And that will be the seventh team foul on Louisville So a one and one or rather the sixth team foul Tell you right now Garner got away with the push to create the opportunity An offensive rebound right there But savvy move from a guy whos played a lot of college basketball Virginia Tony Bennett uses a timeout Ball 167 seconds to go first half Louisville just committed its sixth team foul So no free throws coming and its Gardner Franklin McNeely Vanderplas and Beakman Kihei Clarks been out for a while for Virginia Its nice when you can have Reese Beakman be your ball dominant guy cheering And then you got Franklin move to the two excuse me the three with McNeely out there This is going to be great look Vanderlas falling down cheering and the rebound knocked out of bounds Vanderpass set that up nicely Stepped back bounced back off the screen from Gardenner Got a look they wanted 09s enough for a catch A quick release Beman will inbound Vanderlas catch and release No And that takes us to halftime L Ellis scored 13 to lead the Cardinals He scored 13 in a row at one point Arbon Franklin got going taking the ball to the basket Virginia trailed most of the first half but they take a threepoint lead to the locker room 2926 your score in the 90s Good luck Louisville This games planned right now for the mathematicians out there Late 50s early 60s Thats a manageable game for this offense that is defunct quite frankly for Louisville But they took care of the basketball They took good shots and they gave themselves a shot Can they do that here in extended play in the second half Late 50s early 60s So thats Eisenhower era basketball Here comes Franklin over to Gardner and swoops him for two Now Virginia going the other way I told you about those 12 turnovers for Louisville against Miami Its not a high number but 20 points given up off those turnovers You cant have big sixes Louisville will get run out of the gym if they have sequences like that Live ball turnovers Now Ellis driving pulls up over Clark and hes got 15 More than half of Louisvilles 28 Very cerebral move Couple rhythm bounces rise fire Heres Kihei Clark He tied London Parentes his school record with his 132nd game started Beakman swivels in Rebound cheering to Trainer Its a good effort defensively from the freshman Kamari lands at 68 Utilizing his length to be a disruptor Trainer kicks to James Comes back to Ellis Good ball movement Withers on the drive Baseline fall away Got to bottle that up Louisville fans and try to present that every offensive possession Everybody had a touch move the basketball find the gap at an advantage while that defense is shifty and vulnerable and attack Bakeman baseline driving and draws the foul It looks like theyll get Lamb You want spacing You want movement Touch here Draw and double Swing Nothing Swing Nothing Swing A drive and attack and close out against a vulnerable defender in Vander Banderlas and rise over Gardner Utilizing your size and your ability to finish cheering Beman without a field goal tonight That was his second point Had a couple of assists in that first half cheering James working on Clark The runner not there Rebound to Vanderlass Where James can grow Playoff two Come to a jump stop Compose then lift for the offering at the rim was out of control Never squared the shoulders to be an effective finisher Vanderlas travel This length is starting to bother Vander plus a lot But you are now 23 22 minutes into a basketball game Thats the first turnover for Virginia Thats nearly impossible Thats what Virginia presents Youve got to go beat this team They aint going to beat themselves They had a game against Wake Forest this year where they didnt turn it over in the first half So theyve done that before Crazy Only nine turnovers a game for Virginia 18 to 22 year old kids are full of bad decisions and yet Virginia seemingly makes none of them on the basketball floor Ellis one doesnt go Trainer the offensive rebound left the put back short when the body becomes a pair Thats not fun probably wasnt a buddy in the first place Fax Gardner baseline No Trainer skies for the car cheering Withers calling for it in the corner Ellis never saw him Ellis on the drive through the clouded wrath of the defense Kicks it back to Lambs His pull up not there lands the steel off ahead to Withers Louisville gives it back Now Franklin thought about the three Drives dumps it off Gardner down low There is your 2023 edition of Louisville basketball Thats a fourpoint swing You just got to think it I mean it lands on the throwhead You just got you got to see it better Ellis nearly lost it Shot clock down to 10 James working on Clark Jump stop Needs help James lowers his body Contact No foul Rebound Franklin That was a charge Ka Clark was in position Didnt bite on the head fakes Took the contact They got away with one there a little bit Gardner Nice move down low Thats what he can do Thats why hes going to score 30 at the wide for the rest of his life I mean make no mistake this guy was one of the primary weapons a year ago for this Virginia team Theyve taken a step offensively Hes taking a back seat but when his numbers called Jake Gardner is ready to deliver a little bit of the spin to win music head fake Oh you aint coming All right Im out Kenny Shro Jordan Cornet Virginia led by three at the half The lead is now seven Few minutes into this second half We mentioned the first few minutes of this half would be critical for Louisville Live ball turnovers Theyve had a couple of those Cant do that against Virginia The first four minutes of this game were so critical cuz Louisville needed to show that they werent going to go away They werent going to resort to those bad habits We did see that with those live ball turnovers that went the other way but it hasnt been a group thats folded Theres still a fight here but they need to be better with that basketball and give themselves a shot cuz Virginia can truly open this one up in the blink of an eye James posting up down low and a foul Time is out Immediate timeout 1535 to go Hell step us up Jordan Cornet This is the latest brackettology according to our guy Joe Lardi Virginia right now a three seed Miami of five and then at 89 Now that puts you somewhat in proximity to the bubble as well A lot of teams in the ACC teetering either on the bubble or near the bubble Thats unacceptable Above all else you got to protect your goal A a mental lapse from Virginia a Louisville team that stayed with the play Going back to that field Carolina in real danger being the first preseason AP number one to be left out of the tournament field That had happened since the tournament field expanded in 85 Franklin off the window The one I dont understand and this is not so much brackettology or net rankings but AP poll how is Pittsburgh not ranked Yeah but you know what Dont get caught up in that As you well know the ranking doesnt matter It doesnt matter You worry about that net You worry about what Joey Bracket says about you cuz my man gets it right every going Ellis drives kicks James corner three and Louisville clutching back for as good as L Ellis has been Thats only his second assist of the game But hes driven several times attracted defenders and found an open shooter A group that struggles to shoot getting pristine opportunities because of the talent that L Ellis is a willing passer He is as well Franklin to Beakman Hes cheering had a few of what you would call hockey assists Yeah The pass that leads to the pass that scores the ball No question Ellis is 15 points on five of eight shooting James has seven LAMBS FALLING AWAY cheering AND Louisville within two This team is playing the best basketball cheering of their season right now and the fans appreciate it cheering cheering Gardner over Trainer and Louisville can tie with a two and take the lead with a three cheering They run two defenders like that trainers got to be ready to cut Here comes Ellis Out to Lambs off the shot bank Clark snatches it Thats repetition Thatll come for the freshman Lance That head cheering fake pull up knockdown jump shot Beman in the teeth of the defense Turns it cheering over Eyes up for Ellis I mean this is a spot where its got to be L deciding Big opportunity L Ellis has to be the decision maker But going back to the defensive possession the length of lands and other likeminded bodies thats who Louisville can be defensively as they figure out this game of basketball at the collegiate level Meanwhile Huntley Hatfield checks back in for Louisville First game back after missing eight with a right foot injury He was moving pretty well in practice today Hes been practicing now for more than a week Ellis to Huntley Hatfield A blocking foul No basket cheering Right idea for Gardner Just dont think he got there in time Tries to get there Help side Yeah he wasnt in position Was still moving right Right idea for Gardner Just a tick too late He was outside the ring He was still moving Right whistle They wanted that to be in the act of shooting How you man James to inbound Ellis for the lead McNeely comes away with it Mike James had good offensive rebounding position Ball just careened off in a not ideal spot for him to corral James has been Louisvilles second cheering leading scoreer in conference games applause Franklin thought about the three cheering Shri now in there for Virginia A little more size McNeely gives it up cheering Lands pushing down the lane in traffic Out of bounds cheering and it goes to Virginia Huntley Hatfeld did a right job running the floor again Another offensive rebounding opportunity Just couldnt get it Lance a little bit out of control Couldnt finish Oo thats tough Thats a bang Hard to tell Thats a bang bang whistle cheering James shadows cheering Beakman Another turnover cheering Lance driving on Franklin and a foul on the floor Franklin tied him up on the way to the brim And that was a wrap up Thats going to have to be a flag room one They are talking about just that The crowd wants it Theyll take a look That Thats definitely going to go that way Yeah that that thats absolutely going to be It wasnt the fullon wrap but the intent was there to a degree You saw it That should be the flagger one whistle Stand by Well let you know Officials at the monitor will be back Louisville where the Chan Fishells Paul Cells came over and told us the last foul on Arman Franklin was not a flagrant Its a common foul And again by definition one of the parameters for a flagrant foul is when you dont make a legitimate play on the ball And that looks like a rap It doesnt look like hes making a legitimate play on the ball Im surprised that that wasnt a flagrant one And thats what I asked Paul I said it looked like Arman initially there was intent for the ball I said it didnt seem like it had the intent that in that case would warrant the flagger one in my opinion He said it wasnt excessive enough in nature because Arman Franklin didnt wrap entirely around the body There was no belief to say this is a flagrant one level So its a common foul We continue playing basketball and that foul is on the floor So a flagrant would have given Louisville free throws instead I did not agree with it but the record show I thought that was the playground ter Oh no inside Gorgeous move and were tied at 39 Hes got 17 cheering applause cheering Clark dribble drive dumps it off for Shedri So cool The sheep count that man when he sleeps Kihei Clark crowd getting into it Let me just draw two defenders Dump off to my big for a flush Just a cool customer whos played more basketball than most at this level Its a national champion Started in that game as a freshman He aint going to beat the turf and made one of the biggest plays of that tournament run right here in Louisville against Purdue Heres the steal Franklin the other way Trainer chasing him Franklin missed it Vanderlas able to recover cheering JJ Trainer has impacted this game defensively Those sweeping passes crosscourt arent easy against this length of Louisville And Sherriick slipped out of bounds Back to Louisville This Louisville team is getting the the swing pass crosscourt that is beneficial for any offense Just isnt easy with the length of Louisville and their ability to get deflections But Arman Franklin you got to see that one through Six turnovers by Virginia in the second half cheering after none in the first 20 minutes cheering Ellis six out of 10 Three of five from deep 17 points Shot clock INSIDE OF 10 TRAINER WITH THE three and he gives Louisville the lead Just a 26 cheering threepoint shooter But the confidence and belief has arrived here in Louisville this evening Trainer entering play was one of his last 15 cheering from beyond the ark McNeely answers Thats a no No All right well take it Its one of those moments for Virginia McNeely fully has that in his bag but wasnt the proper place But Ive been correct cheering I mean theyre running two Id have L make a decision with the basketball Find the opportunity every time Withers with space on the baseline Were tied at 44 cheering cheering cheering Clark cheering Thats a long two Got it He just provides everything thats necessary You need a bucket He attacks drives sucks to defenders dump ball and he can be a scorer when has to do it Hes been asked to do so much in his career at Virginia He can put on any hat necessarily in role play And hes got some fond memories as we were talking about in this building The Purdue game the Mad Dia shot It was Clark who made the pass and had the assist on one of the seminal plays that the Kyle Guy shot against Auburn Those are the plays that you remember that play will live forever in Virginia Lure and happened in Louisville Withers three not there Who knew they might need those type of late game heroics versus a three win Louisville team this evening cheering I dont think many expected a twopoint game at this juncture Vanderpl You see the offensive weaponry for Louisville Theyve had their role players step up and make plays but ultimately the burden is on L Ellis That is not the case for Virginia A lot of different shot makers can step up Virginia 38 from three in conference and a foul on Vanderlass That 38 threepoint clip in ACC games tops in league play But thats where you got to attack Vanderlas We know about him offensively Can he guard down low Hunter Hatfield was the guy to challenge there but its got to be a withers Its got to be a trainer They have to look at hey lets see how this guy can post defend Here comes Ellis through the trees Needs help and blocked by Reese Beman Reese Speaker not taking the bait Defensive discipline on 10th Ben Vanderplas Vanderplas hails from Ripman Wisconsin He loves to fish since halftime Yeah it started with Kihei Clark with the dribble drive and then dump off to Gartner for the dunk and it kind of settled the group like Okay here we go Then you got McNeely knocks down the early shot clock three K goes and makes a bucket and then you got Vanderblas ripping the nets if you will from Ripin Wisconsin All thats come together Now the challenge is can we be the team thats a top 10 team in the country Can we be the team that gets stops puts this game away so it doesnt come down to winning moments in the final few minutes Thats where I want to see the growth from Virginia And they shroud Jordan Cornet Wednesday night in Louisville at the KFC Yum Center cheering This Cardinals team that has lost 22 of 25 games Theyve been hanging with Virginia throughout the night Well Ellis got too unselfish there to his detriment You got to just float Thats got to be float game all day Virginias made its last three from the field They play it late into the shot clock as usual Dunn is in there and Clark able to draw the foul Its on Trainer Thats just a challenge for Trainer with his length and size to get low to the ground That running back level that Kihei Clark Kihei Clark plays at a true challenge Couldnt keep up Forced to foul Vanderlas a rebound away from a double double Vanderlas for three Front rim tapped out Thats done He is going to be a special player down the road for Virginia Clark on the inside able to draw the foul and he took a hard spill This is when Kihei Clark starts to light up Final seven minutes of whats been a close contest This is where your veterans come to the focus And Kihei Clark has played more minutes and won more games than most in this conference in history cheering the 68 freshman out of Freeport New York Ryan Dunn His defense in the second half against Duke that was a game changer for Virginia cheering Hes got such a high ceiling I mean just has every bit the look of a guy that can be a next level guy the skill will come the body will fill out but hes so long so fluid so skilled and has taken the incremental steps throughout this season to be a rotational piece that can help them win Ellis gets three Vander plus the rebound and he has his first double double as a Cavaliier cheering Clark gets it back from Beakman 15 to shoot the drive Shot fake Louisville doesnt bite Clark shimies inside and gets the two Thats the wy fifthear vet Hes just a winner Hes never compromised with how he plays the game Theres no erratic nature in his approach especially when it comes down to this point Hes gotten in that painted area and hes been devastated That one knocked away That shoot around earlier today Kenny Payne and Danny Manning and the Louisville coaches were telling all their guys when Kihei Clark gets down underneath the basket hes going to shot fake Yeah hes been 510 his whole life He understands what it takes to be able to be effective down there And its patience and its waiting to strike And hes as good as any at that And down the stretch here he has made so many winning plays Were still six minutes out but thats why this lead is almost back to double figures Thats a 9point advantage Virginias largest lead Cavaliers on a 90 run Intercepted Heres Beakman Another live ball turnover The lob for Dunn cheering who draws the foul This is the unraveling This is what Louisville has done time and time again this season carelessness with that basketball and not just a giveaway but a giveaway that goes to scoring on the other end You cant have that when youre the inferior unit that is already trying to play uphill cheering Land has picked up his third Terrific womens basketball matchup on ESPN tomorrow night Olivia Miles and number 10 Notre Dame hosting 19 and8 Louisville Notre Dame 11 and three in the ACC Just a game behind first place Duke Virginia entering tonight Just a half game behind Pittsburgh who leads the ACC Panthers picked to finish 14th Theyve reloaded with transfers And much like Virginia those are two old teams playing with a lot of grown men as Dunn is called for the foul By the way youre obligated when mentioning Notre Dame womens hoops to mention Olivia Miles the most entertaining player or one of them excuse me Apologies to Kaitton Clark Aaliyah Boston and others but shes as entertaining as the rest And shes got Notre Dame right in the thick of it again 5344 Ellis using the Curry screen Withers gets past Dunn who fell down cheering And Jaylen Withers a 77 free throw shooter to the free throw line Again I cant stress this enough about Louisville They have such long athletes Jaylen Withers absolutely one of them Slow developing but able to get there Defensively they need to be consistently good If the offense isnt there fine But this group needs to say for the rest of this season to be disruptors to other teams We have to lead with our defense and we have to take care of the basketball and with our length and athleticism well at least have a chance in some of these games You can tell from talking to Kenny Payne yes theres been progress made here in the last few weeks getting closer against some opponents but you get the sense theyre going to have to win a couple of these games to really build that momentum heading into next season already 22 losses That is a program record Barring a miracle Louisville will finish with singledigit wins in a season For the first time since the 1941 1942 season when they went seven and 10 as an independent Clark swims around Curry I mean this K Clark you got to laugh Hes so valuable You have to chuckle James calling for it launches and hits Thats 10 for the red shirt freshman Mike James Now theyre going to apply some fullourt pressure a little bit Try and speed things up some Not having pressure cheering Try to shorten the clock a little bit Got to put together some stops if youre Louisville And it starts with stopping the dribble penetration of Khe Clark cheering Clark guarded by Miller Vanderlas wide open Cindy Curry has zero interest in guarding out there Vanderplas could have himself a couple minutes here of clean looks at basically the world offensive James now its Withers from the wing rolls out Curry the rebound AND THE GENTLE DROP cheering IN I mean what a push off on Vanderpass that there was no whistle cheering And Duke fans rejoice cheering applause cheering Clark has the mismatch on Curry Takes him to the basket using the shot cheering fake Back to McNeely over Miller Its good The freshman rattles a three and the lead swells back to eight Unflapable offensively but its Kihei Clark with the kick out to McNeely again factoring in somehow Ellis has been quiet here of late Not easy going up against Clark and Beakman for 40 minutes Yet he finds a way Thats 19 for L Ellis cheering A twopossession game cheering and applause as we come up on three minutes to play in regulation Down low Gardner all too easy ball watching Dont watch me Watch TV And just an easy dump down A mental lapse in the highest order for Louisville and the interior defense Here comes Withers driving on Gardner Blocked at the rim and Gardner called for his second foul 17 time Can Virginia hang on or can Louisville pull a stutter 251 to go Think about what Kihang Clark means to Virginia What hes been in these final few minutes of this game is saying No no no no I know what winning is and what it takes Im going to go ahead and do it here And look the the conversation about K Clark well hes been around for a decade Hes played here for so long I get it all But also worth noting in that is hes played at a high level for all these years as well This young man was tasked with being a freshman and starting in a national championship game in 2019 And since then the ask for coach Bennett has differed every year And hes answered the call He is one of the most important players in Virginia basketball history make no mistake about it And weve seen him improve and grow his game Hes become a better outside shooter and one of the great leaders in college basketball as we speak I I dont know how emotional Coach Bennett is but he going to cry when he leaves He going to cry when Kihei Clark leaves because these guys have been through so much together and Kihei has been such an important piece of so very much You think about it over the last decade Virginias been the most consistent winner in this conference and Kihei Clark has been there for about half of those years cheering Sixpoint game Louisville Still with a chance here L Ellis trainer getting ready to check in for the Cards 10 to shoot Lamb has picked up his dribble Now its Withers Hes had touched from the baseline Franklin pokes it away Such a good defender I mean just had his eye trained on He knew Trainer was going to be vulnerable with that basketball cuz those are tendencies It got that deflection to create an opportunity for Virginia to build cheering Nine on the shot clock 140 to play cheering Franklin with five to shoot against Withers And the contact and the foul on Jaylen Withers and number 15 cheering Louisville still with one foul to give and this gives Virginia more time to run off Vanderlas against a trainer finding Clark misses the bunny cheering Miller the rebound Still a two possession game Got to go a little bit faster Ellis accelerates cheering and a foul on the floor before the shot Eight team foul on Virginia So L Ellis an 80 free throw shooter goes to the line for a one and one Love the awareness from Ellis Knew exactly that The clock is no longer something you can afford to watch those seconds tick and with urgency drove that thing and initiated contact Third foul on Kihei Clark 19 points tonight for Ellis cheering And he now has his 11th 20point game of the season Two of those 30point games including Saturday at Miami cheering 116 to go We got a timeout from Louisville cheering Its a fourpoint game applause Now listen it hasnt been the season that Cardinals fans want and thats a massive understatement but I think you can applaud their effort tonight No question You know when we travel and do these games obviously Anish we go to the shootarounds for both teams and we talk and to the coaches and personnel to give you the best broadcast we can We went to Virginias How long did that last About 20 minutes Because they know who they are where coach Bennetts got this group aligned for a run in March How long was it How much coaching was done in Louisville That felt more like a practice than a shootout And we saw Kenny Payne blow the whistle stop plays guys You got to get this right Micromanaging everything because its a group thats learning culture and how to win The job is just different right now when it comes to coach Payne music as opposed to Bennett Credit to Bennett cuz hes got it to that place Its taken time to have an elite program Coach Payne has what it takes He just has to do it very meticulously now to get them there Tonight motivated executed and reason for optimism in what has been a lost season And Kenny Pay told his team at the start of the shootound you have a golden opportunity tonight against a nationally ranked top 10 team one of the best in college basketball coming to your house He reiterated that message a couple of times when practice ended cheering Virginia gets it across half court We come up on a minute to play Its nice to have these three guards Very trustworthy All three good at the free throw line Thats how you close out the close ones Something Virginia has a pinch hit for Bakeman against Lambs Out cheering to Clark Shot fake Shot clock at four Reverse layup Not there And a foul is called 16 Good head fake from Kihei Clark Felt like a travel Was some contact Not a travel It was unorthodox I actually dont know if he traveled There was enough contact for a whistle I think there was a slip unorthodox that made it look like a traveler I cheering dont think on the replay it was There was enough contact to warrant somewhat of a whistle there Im okay with the call There was contact cheering cheering One out of two for Clark a career applause 80 free throw shooter Still a two possession game Final 45 seconds Ellis looking to get three Beakman cheering shadowing him James dribbles Now its Ellis on Clark Ellis driving Turns No good Training the offensive rebound Threepoint game Less than a second for the game today Virginia nine out of 14 at the strike cheering Tell you looking at McNeely there hes made some big time shots for this Virginia team applause and cheering Kihei Clark the inbounder small in stature but boys makes the proper decision Thats why they elect to go with him as the inbound Smart cheering Now Withers has to be long here I mean there is an advantage to Withers to maybe get a deflection Clark runs cheering the baseline looking for help Hes got a call out cheering applause It looked like Vanderlas was open but Clark knowing what Louisville knows If it goes to Vanderlas 59 free throw shooter that is an immediate foul And so why do you have Pa Clark as he knows exactly what you know rather than make that low percentage decision just rethink it go back call the timeout Now if youre Tony Bennett do you change the inbounder and maybe have a better free throw shooter as a potential receiver like a Kihei Clark No I think theyre still going to keep Kihei Clark as that decision maker Theres link that has lended some deflections from Louisville all evening So I think they still want him to be that guy delivering that basketball Virginia also has two timeouts Oh it looks like Vander plus that 59 free throw shooter is indeed going to be the inbound Trainer with that wingspan of an Andy and Condor will guard Vanderlas You also have the quickness of Kihei Clark to go get the pass Oh they dont defend the inbounder They get it in quickly and Clark is fouled and a one and one coming for Virginia and Kihei Clark Foul is on L Ellis cheering 76 on the season 80 for his career cheering Nobody in Virginia history has started more games Nobody cheering has won more games in school history And nobody has won more games in the history of ACC play cheering And Clark misses the free throw Louisville can tie with a three Ellis has it You dont need the three but youre running out of time You got to move Withers against Franklin Picks up his dribble Lands about now You got to shoot a three Heres Ellis cheering on Vanderlas Over to Lance Five to shoot Lance puts it up Left it way short It comes to Vanderlas and hes fouled with a tenth of a second left Louisville had a chance They just couldnt get the look and they didnt have the timeouts to call the timeout and settle it This is a team that doesnt know how to win you You have an opportunity to attack get two you get two Its inevitably going to be a one possession game yet still But you you loiter you wait you loiter you wait and youre forced to take a three And L Ellis your guy doesnt even have a hand in Just another tough close loss for a team that doesnt get it Now the embers of heartbreak will linger for Louisville Virginia escapes It hurts not having that timeout to get your your puppies in a row cheering And thatll do it I dont think anybody expected this game with these two teams to be this close Louisville battled all night At the end you saw the experience the savvy of an older Virginia team against a Cardinals team that that just hasnt figured out how to close as you said No And one guy that has figured it out Kihei Clark Hat tip to that young man
