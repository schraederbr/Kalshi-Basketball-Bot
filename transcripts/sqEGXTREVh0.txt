that kept him out of that Sacred Heart game they won that game easily nonetheless and Burton will start today for the Panthers who come in with a record of seven and four start of the year one and three but as we said have won six out of seven since then North Florida well talk about their schedule three and six uh a true murderers row of a nonconference schedule for the Ospreys our officials this afternoon Ted Valentine Clarence Armstrong and Tim Comer who threw it up in North Florida in the blue jerseys wins the tip North Florida has immediately an offensive foul on a moving screen against North Florida its called on Jean and Parker the players to look for Jarius hicklin whos had some good shooting performances against up competition this year Placer number 15 and Hendrickson a former twotime allatlantic Sun performer Drisco does not like that they have a set play off the tip ball for Parker to get a dunk they didnt get that backs up a foul sloppy start for Pitt as they throw it out of bounds Nelly Cummings Greg Elliott had been hot of late for head coach Jeff Capel and Blake Henson has been a revelation since coming over from Iowa State in his first season at Pitt for head coach Jeff Capel in his fifth season with the Panthers 5873 his record here in the steel city still looking for our first shot of the game as they feed it inside for Jaden Parker King and Federico hook shot is up and rebounded by Greg Elliott Applause Music look for pitcher to try to get the ball inside with good spacing which would create Easy Shot opportunities they do try to get it inside to Federico who had a huge game a doubledouble last time out against Sacred Heart hes off the mark rebounded back up and cleared by Jayden Parker pit really hammered Sacred Heart on the glass they out rebounded them by 28 in that game and we see a little bit of that early well theyre really trying to establish Federico down in that low post get people to double them and then space the floor and they can offensive rebound out of that Gary primarily the threepoint shooter turns it over steel jamarius Burton pulls up from 12 Applause and a good box out leads to a pit foul against Blake Henson one player who will not play today for Pitt is John Hughley IV who was an honorable mention all ACC player last year uh personal reasons not playing today and they really ran the offense through him last year oh without question he was the key and with the new guys coming over it has helped spread out the offensive execution and expectation and Coach cape has done a really good job integrating the new guys oh for three from the field so far for Pitt as Parker has met at the rim and fouled the phallus caught against Burton his first North Florida led by head coach Matthew Driscoll a Pittsburgh native in his 14th season as head coach of UNF LED them to the NCAA tournament in the Atlantic Sun title back in 2015 hes in the middle there he just stood up that is head coach Matthew Driscoll and if anybody that knows him talks about his energy level his excitement for the game hes such a positive individual and he brings such positivity to his team Parker 42 freethrow shooter Off the Mark he has scheduled well call it ambitiously this year what do you think about this schedule coach they played the number two three and four teams in the preseason AP poll Gonzaga Kentucky and Houston lost all of them lopsided but thats a tough schedule theyre ranked second by ESPN BPI without question but its but his kids really practice hard yesterday everybody was in a great frame of mind and looked for them to really give it everything theyve got out here today against Pittsburgh Federico lays it first two of the game four hits what Pittsburgh likes to do is use Federico to set a ball screen around the foul line and then roll to the basket and they like to give him the ball in the low post with really good spaces so nobody can come down and help him double hickling step back jumper clearing the board Nike sabandi who just checked into the game a sixyear senior from Indianapolis two fifth year players in their rotation only Notre Dame has more fifth or sixth year guys in the ACC as the tank shot is up and in for Blake Henson one of those fifth year players yeah veteran players but theyre not veteran playing together and thats one of the things coach Capel has really worked hard in doing getting them to understand each other and play with each other floater by Placer is Off the Mark rebound has followed around several times eventually controlled by sabandi so Bandy can play the point or the two so handy is found honey this is what Pitt likes to do they like to have Frederico come set the screen you see the spacing so nobody can really come and help and he does a great job of finishing at The Rim good action there by Pitt on offense to Bandy 77 free throw shooter a sixth year senior transferred from Miami of Ohio where he played three years averaged about 15 a game at Miami and hes got over 1600 career points in his career transport Applause Music of Advantage just extremely well here at Pittsburgh brought in several guys whove played very well so far this year its been a big part of their turnaround seven and four on the season had some notable wins probably most notably as the lefthanded Bank Shot is up and in by Jaden Parker who has all three points for North Florida but they they went on the road in the ACC Big Ten challenge they crushed Northwestern by 29 Points and then they opened up their ACC schedule at NC State and beat them on the road so theyre 10 in the ACC kicked 14th out of 15 teams in the preseason well one of the things coach Capon was trying to do in picking up transfer with guys for winning programs that was important to him that that sort of DNA came to this fit program you look at a player now like Nellie Cummings whos really caught fire off late a twotime patriot League champion at Colgate once in the NCAA tournament the last two years hit off to the early lead six to three is the score Music welcome to the neighborhood did you know that a good part of Pitts turnaround this season can be attributed to the threepoint shot theyve really shot it well of late well they really have and really two guys have really stepped in and done a great job Cummings and Elliott both of those two young men are really good Shooters they also are very good off the bounce and that creates more scoring opportunity so again you know coach Caper was looking for specific things and I think he got that and is recruiting to fill a lot of the need to make this pit team a very dangerous team you talked about Cummings and Elliott those two have really sparked that turnaround in shooting theyve roughly doubled their scoring over the last four games see the biggest one needs double their point production and more than doubled their threepoint shooting reverse layup by Federico is saved back inbounds by Pitt with still plenty of time on the shot clock but the Regal has to get a little stronger in that low post he has good position but he still takes off balance shots Cummings going oneonone defended well by Jonathan abar jump shot by Elliot halfway down and rebounded by the ospreys Music Chaz Lanier has checked into the game hes got the ball North Florida has to have more ball moves right now theyre really stagnant whether or not its ball screens or whether or not they screwed the floor and try to penetrate and fish the long three off the back Iron rebounded by Henson that shot from placer Music on the defensive end against the Banji Cummings down the lane nice feed to Federico he lost it turns it over good hands there by North Florida and Jonathan abar foreign Music lets go back to what you said about Federico well he does he that theyre really working to get him the ball right now hes in really good position hes got a square up go up and explode hes not exploding hes got a high jump not broad jump when you broad jump you bring the ball to the defender and you get it blocked or deflected Federico 611 220 Hes listed at a sophomore from Finland first year in Pitt sees a very thin player still trying to add strength after a year going through the ACC Wars hell get stronger I guarantee you youll have to inside for Parker who lays it up a bar I should say who lays it up and in good inbounds play there by the Ospreys awar is a very good offensive player hes really good around the basket and they use him a lot of those actions where he can duck in and roll to the basket average is about seven points a game and only 14 minutes a game savanty strong take off flashing in Music I really likes the Bandy he does a lot of things coming off the bench with his pit teams and the other thing that nobodys really talked about with fit is defensively theyre really doing a good job defensively they contain the ball better I I think they really talk and communicate theres that defense you talked about one of the twins Jorge Diaz Graham with the rejection a freshman from Spain off glass no good but Burton will go to the line yeah so Bandy does a really good job when he comes in you got a guy that can play either guard position he can shoot it but he also can finish around the rim so he can play on the ball or off the ball and there you see the rotation coming over with the block you know Rim protecting and defense is critical if you can eliminate points in the pain youll be surprised how many games you win that was Jorge Diaz Graham on the Block and now his brother twin brother Guillermo Diaz Graham will check into the game so both both twins are in the game right now and theyre both about seven feet tall and I tell you what and offensively theyre really skilled and if they didnt have their jerseys on I dont know how you tell them apart I tell you what they would have a tough time dating because the girl wouldnt know which one she was going out with Im telling but they really are really good players and I know coach cable is really high on them and their development because their skilled players both prepped at IMG Academy down in Florida I were just 14 again hasnt been heard from so far into the corner for a three batted by Guillermo Diaz Grand Applause locked well done again Mike abar whos played well in limited minutes foreign North Florida has to find a way to get the ball to the basket theyre settling for jump shots and thats what fit wants them to do instant rebounds the a bar three who our fans that saw pit played last year and watching them play this year they dont get frustrated last year I thought there were times they got frustrated or foul wasnt called they missed the shot this pit team just keeps playing and they play with the same purpose and determination and focus that coach Capel wants him to play at he told us about the camaraderie they have off the court and its a very close team well it is obvious in how theyre playing last year I thought there were times they got kind of frustrated and coachs job was more to keep calm as it was coaching this years team hes really just coaching them because they already are playing with that sort of patience and demeaning ripped away and with the transfer portal now you can really overhaul your team quickly look at the numbers these three players are putting up for a pit but they have to be the right guys and thats when coach cable talked about I wanted guys that came from winning programs that are used to winning and winning is important Guillermo Diaz Graham is fouled on the shot by Chaz Lanier hell go to the line Henson came in from Iowa State although he didnt play in his two years there he started at Ole Miss where he averaged about nine a game we mentioned Cummings a twotime NCAA tournament the last couple of years at Colgate Elliott came from Marquette where he played Four Seasons there and he shot the ball extremely well so far in a pit uniform you know one of the things that I always say coaches that were guards they understand positioning and chemistry because their college careers were predicated on getting everybody involved and keeping everybody happy so they want guys to have the ability to do that thats why theres so many guards I think that are coaches see where the starting lineup all played last year not a single one of them played here at Pitt because except for Burton excuse me Burton started uh today but he comes from when you see this deep defense of me thats an excellent defense by Pittsburgh and I think so much has been made of the threepoint shooting but their defense is going to be what carries them once they get in the ACC we talked about Pittsburgh native Matthew Driscoll hes an energetic guy and hell have you retrofired up nothing well and what a tree hes come from unbelievable background he played at Northgate High School which is about 15 minutes Northwest of here and that was his first coaching job back in 1988 hes a Pittsburgh native hes a Steelers fan as Jorge Diaz Graham knocks down the three you see some of the stops hes made along the way paying his dues before he eventually caught on with Larry shy head at Wyoming and Clemson he ended up with Scott drew and Baylor and hes been the head coach at North Florida the winningest coach in school history well he coached under some great guys Larry shine is a basketball Savant I mean everybody in the game knows who he is and what hes been able to do and then Scott Drew has just gone on and done just a tremendous job so uh his background is really solid and Pittsburgh is just such a unique town they have so many personalities you know you know you start with John Calipari I mean so I mean the basketball in this city is very very rated and so many people have touched so many lives have come out of here he estimated hed have about 50 people here at the game friends and family supporting North Florida behind their bench Music Steelers town its 147 is the score foreign Music Applause High School you compared him to Teen Wolf when we saw this photo before the game and then when he was at LaRoche College yeah seriously is that cool or what I mean unbelievable thats just playful Im not sure if he was in Miami Vice or playing for Butler County but uh this is like its Photoshop but he was cool as a cucumber there bird guy through and through and he told us a story about how he got his start in coaching and he was working as a manager at a McDonalds he didnt finish college at Slippery Rock until he was 27 years old felt like coaching might as be something he wanted to get into and then started working his way up the ladder getting to know people treating people the right way and now hes made a nice career for himself hes made a lot of friends along the way when I told him I was doing this game I had three coaches make sure I told him hello so hes got a hes really well respected Music his team down seven right now Midway through the first half so the rim up and in and then okay what with the shooters on the floor we talked about Cummings and Elliott earlier Burtons able now to get the spacing to get to the rim I thought last year he did a great job of driving the basketball but now with the space he does an even better job whats the call here Music there you see Burke right there hes always had the ability to get to the basket but hes always had to go over a shot blocker now he doesnt it looks like on this drive I think theyre going to call it a block blocking power Jorges gas Graham but coaches will take that Im telling you Robin with being able to rotate over there and give up your body good things are going to happen down the line by by being able to do that both twins checked out of the game immediately a block as Pitts been very Stout inside defensively yeah again I I keep saying if you can protect the paint defensively youre gonna win a lot of games its really forcing North Florida to just shoot a lot of Threes which they havent been successful at so far thats what a team do athletic but you can get out there and guard it without fouling though but you can get out there and guard it that is the second foul on Burton and that will put Hendrickson at the line for three shots you know I thought last year Burton fell a lot of pressure I thought he felt the obligation to have to do a lot of things and a lot of times I thought he would come into the game but the game plan being for him to do X and he had it just seems very relaxed in what his role is foreign Applause basketball around the country coming up next Cornell takes the 50mile drive up I81 they square off against Syracuse the orange have won the last 41 against the big red dating back to 1969 its coming up afterwards out here on acc Network yeah coach behind the lord of the north I tell you what he doesnt move too much up there hes a heck of a coach Im going to tell you Cornell gets up and down the court they played Miami recently and both teams scored over a hundred so Cornell loves to get up and down the court should be a fun game at the Dome three for three from the line for Carter Hendrickson well see if that gets him on track as first points of the game foreign Music situation as Placer flips it up and in his first two of the game plus theres really quick with the ball he can initiate he can play off the ball really good score for North Florida wide open in the corner a three is good for Greg Elliott sometime when youre that open you rushed it but he really took his time and got his feet set then he comes back and make a steal on the other end thats what Im telling this team is committed to the defensive end as well as offense there you see him skip pass he knocks down the three but he doesnt celebrate hes rushed back down defensively and is able to make a steal and save a basket well save to what would have been a layup for North Florida excellent job there at both ends by Elliot we mentioned how well hes been shooting in late 62 over his last four from Beyond The Arc pickling down the lane and its a foul biglin is probably North Floridas best driver he does a really good job off the bounce of finishing at the rim and also getting other people involved there you see him driving right there its offensive charge is taken and again Elliott does a great job but again its its pitch defensive principles that bail him out hicklin is the teams leading scorers for North Florida five fouls five turnovers for UNF so far theyve struggled offensively because of that pit defense its a Bandy going one on one pullup jumper good effort by Federico but it eventually comes away the more Florida and a foul on Federico on the loose ball thatll be his second the coach cake was looking at his mouth at some point you got to kind of give up on it you know youre not going to get he likes the effort he likes going after right now its over you need to get back and not pick up a cheap Style that is the sixth foul against Pitt Zone north Florida will shoot free throws the rest of the half starting with the next foul and that could be a real bonus so to speak for them because theyve had a lot of trouble scoring from the field Im surprised we havent seen the Zone from North Florida this is Hickman since defense as you said has been airtight so far because Sarah stepped back three and he turned and looked at like I I can make this now you better guard me but I tell you I thought it was a tough shot I thought it was good defense started his career at UMBC now in his fourth year at North Florida he was on the team that upset Virginia so hes used to playing against ACC people down to four on the shot clock Elliott to the rim with two theyre not going to knock a shot away shot clock violation right there you see North Florida they do a good job of moving the basketball watch plus there goes drives it steps back but hes very difficult up games the UNF has scheduled you see he had 19 in Washington they played here in town against Duquesne last month he had 24 points and then four threes against both Kentucky and Houston thats the kind of threepoint shooting you need in these up games well hes a talented player I think the biggest thing with him is his ability off the bounce to make plays and he can get to the rack and to get to the basket and finish its interesting if you didnt look at the scoreboard in this game you think Pitt was up by 10 or 12 but its only a fourpoint game and UNF has the ball theyre hanging around Placer another three strong rebound brought down by pits Blake Henson Pittsburgh has had some opportunity to specially around the basket and just not finished Music scoring games so far as a foul will put Music at the line the phallus called on North Floridas Dorian James his second and Henson is one of those young men that you can play him on the perimeter or you can play him in the post hes big and strong can finish around the basket really knows how to use angles especially in that low post position so Henson will go to the line where hes a 76 free throw shooter forced and Syracuse then we feature these games Louisville here at the pizza take on pit at two then a top 10 matchup between number five Notre Dame and number six Virginia Tech and then eighth ranked NC State hosts Clemson to cap the night all come tomorrow on acc Network one out of two from the line for Henson still just a fivepoint lead together Applause strong take to the rim couldnt get the roll for a bar and rebounded by the Panthers but North Florida is not settling for jump shots right now like they were earlier they were actually running stuff nice feed from coming you know I really like coming Cummings is a really good shooter and has proven he can do that but he also looks to set up his teammates he leads the team in assists sixth in the ACC four and a half a game Hendrickson couldnt get it up on the rim rebounded by Federico good interior defense again for a pit Cummings has not scored in this game he averages 11 a game but he has distributed the ball he had that pass the skip pass from the threepointer to Elliott Rico lays it in really trying to set up Federico I didnt really want him to get a chance to get good looks and the unselfishness with this big team is playing matches Pitts biggest lead of the game 9 points again inside and again turned away sabandi youre a step blocked out of bounds by aball Applause there you see theyre looking for Federico right there they throw it up in the air for him to get that air space and be able to finish that time Henson kicks it over to him to be able to finish its nothing like having your four and five playing off of each other catch the three off the in Federico has six points already which is already above his season average tough post pass goes out of bounds another turnover and one of the things that Pittsburgh is doing the fact that theyre very active and theyre challenging all the passes theyre not denying passing Lanes but once somebody has the ball theyre not making it easy for them to make the next pass and theyre still containing the basketball its the turnover of the game for North Florida Music good pass into the corner for another open three its good same connection Cummings to Elliott his second three in the game well yeah Applause Im sure found it inside again he born with a nice big shot and it stops an 80 run by Pittsburgh Jeff Capel will call a timeout and we will step aside as well hit with a 10point lead Music we love our new home theres so much space but we have Applause stay away Applause Applause Greg Elliott has had a heck of a day for Pittsburgh and theyve been able to use him in a lot of different ways off this action you see right there they have for the RICO come over he sets the screen and rolls and they got that early it created help and they hit Elliot right there and he buries the three but that was set up by their earlier action theyve really tried to get it to Federico so far hes got six points Elliott also has six points both of them on threes that have come off feeds from Nelly Cummings that Florida that timeout was actually taken by North Florida down by 10 Music sabandine knocks down the jumper and again that was created by Federico but hes been rolling sucking up the defense and freeing up the shooters how would you like to see North Florida defend that better probably go underneath the screen and make the guy thats using the screen have to knock down a jump shot and stay at home to Federico so everybody else can stay home another poor post entry feat and another turnover for North Florida yeah again you see the action right there Federico rolls then then this is what they call a bulldog action the weak side Wing raises when they knock down the jump shot oh my God threepointer for Nelly Cummings with a hand in his face now the biggest lead of the game four hits but now if you go under that screen with Cummings running it then you you can give that shot up so thats probably why theyre hedging and not going under because Cummings is such a really good storm North Florida falling further behind needs something offensively its hickling to the rim he lays it up and in first two of the game for Jarius Hickman their leading scorer Robert he is so good getting to the basket like you said earlier he did it against Kentucky hes done it against everybody that they played against as now Ted Valentine stops the play because there was some kind of hand hand checking yeah they want to clean that up um its it started with the basket on the other end Pickman kind of bumped after he made his shot kind of bumped into one of the fifth players and then coming over the screen he did the same thing and we have a veteran crew and they just want to clean it up early double foul on the play its a double foul hicklin was the player for North Florida and I believe it was Cummings for pits and they whenever you lower the shoulder somethings going to be called or was it that on Elliott I think it was caught on Elliot yeah not uh coming yeah they bumped into each other and another fact Applause this is going to be called against the Ospreys Dorian James just picked up his third foul of the game and you have to let Cutters run and whenever whenever you see a double foul or any sort of incident you know the next couple of minutes everything is going to be called really close so thats not the time that you want to bump somebody or grab somebody Wednesday is national Signing Day for football weve got you covered right here on acc Network in the ESPN app well have our annual special breaking down all of the ACC recruits taking you through each school with highlights and evaluations our one hour show up against a three Eastern noon Pacific hit coming off a another good football season eight and four theyre headed to the Sun Bowl to take on UCLA on the 30th as the threepointers Off the Mark and running back the other way stolen away here comes North Florida three on two pickling attacking the RAM and hes fouled again hicklin does a really good job of getting to the basket but you know that Tom Cummings got a little bit anxious and tried to feed the ball into Henson and he really wasnt there if the guys kicked that car off the off the block you really shouldnt give him the basketball Music Applause pickling an 80 freethrow shooter missed the first Lanier in for Barry this is a very important stretch for North Florida yeah gotta gotta keep it within Striking Distance in this last two and a half minutes dont want to fall behind by 17 or 18 going into the half theyve really done very little offensively so they could get this back down to 10 at halftime you got to think theyd be feeling pretty good about it it would be a winwin I think both teams as us did earlier shed be happy about the first half I think Pittsburgh has executed their offense very well they just missed some shots I think Florida has stayed connected and put themselves in a position to stay in this basketball game and excellent feed by sabandi to Federico as Hendrickson comes up short on the long three Henson on the run one on two hence it Galloping to the basket leaves it up and in so the time he got the bomb at the top of the key it was no question he was going to the front of the rim plus air quick three and rebounded by sabandi and now hit looking to really open it up 17point lead with the ball in a minute 40 left foreign Music Music had a good look he just missed it much needed three there for Hendrickson minutes ago in the first half and Coach Driscoll has really stayed calm in this half I think he wanted his team to come out and play with a lot of composure and so he didnt want to act like he was too upset hes really managed this first half well Federico turned away by Jayden Parker Applause there you see some Bandy right there finding Frederico a great basket right there they want the big guy to finish like that there you see a great three by North Florida Music we love our new home theres so much space but we have ants fired at least Geico makes bundling our home and car insurance easy for bundling Made Easy Go to geicocom hey Lexus Music together happy holidays from Lexus Music Applause Federico Federico a sophomore from Finland played last year in North Oklahoma originally committed to West Virginia but reopened his recruitment in February of this year and ended up at Pitt he comes off a very strong game against Sacred Heart and hes picked right back up today well one of the things that I noticed as a coach all the perimeter guys are looking for him which means hes a good guy which means they recognize that he works hard and hes trying to get the ball in the low post but he can operate because guards have a way of looking off post guys that they dont think work real hard threepointer from the corner what a rebound by Federico and then a foul against North Florida and that kind of effort is a thing that you have to earn the respect of your teammates he doesnt give up on plays he picks up a foul earlier because baby he should have gave up on the play but I tell you this pitch sport team is really trying to get him involved in the offense and theyre very unselfish and how they do it I believe hickling just picked up his third foul of the game so their leading scorer just picked up his third foul Federico knocks down the free throw hes got a really nice touch Bob and he really does the only time he gets in trouble when he gets off balance and as he gains some strength uh in his lower body that wont happen Music born in Egypt but raised in Finland one out of two but a lane violation well give him another opportunity you look at all the Firepower on this pit Team guys like Henson averaging 16 Cummings and Elliott 11 Burton 15 but its Federico whos the leading scorer so far hes got nine points I tell you the ACC race is going to be really interesting because theres different styles and teams are able to win different ways so its going to be a thing of what style is able to overcome the others got a six second difference between the shot clock and the game clock going forward as trailed by as much as 17 down 16 right now and looking to get some momentum going into the half while Sarah Nifty dribbling lefthanded layups up and in seven points for Placer and that was one of the few times Federico was not there the challenge at The Rim UNF looking for one last stop to close the half with six seconds left Cummings guarded by Barry Cummings with one second left throws it up wildly and UNF does get the stop thats the end of the first half I thought it was a great first half by Pittsburgh especially on the defensive end and executing offensively sharing the basketball 3925 Federico with 10 three other pit players have six Placer leads eight Force turnovers and an 113 advantage and points off of those turnovers yeah and thats something thats interest because when we met with Coach cable yesterday he really didnt talk about his defense he talked more about the chemistry about adding some players with good uh pedigree but defensively when I watch film and seeing them today they really do a good job defensively he just won six out of seven taking it to the rim and scoring Blake Henson eight points gets one six out of seven this is their last nonconference game of the season they had headlong into ACC play for the rest of the regular season thats the other end Parker rebounded by the Panthers Panthers once you get in the conference players to different animals like trying to lie to family you cant do it everybody knows everything about you is that something that happens often in the Clark family any family Gibson a nice job keeping the dribble alive and pit running the other way with a 16 point lead led by as much as 17 late in that first half knocks it down I tell you Henson likes to score uh his brother played for me when I was at South Carolina Ive known him for a long time that whole family they like to play football and they like to score the basketball hes averaging 167 this year as Hendrickson knocks down the triple North Florida needs more of that they love to shoot the three a couple of times under coach Driscoll theyve led the country in threepointers made birds of tray that kind of moniker defines the program a little bit and offensively as Federico scores again and the difference in what he did then and earlier was he gathered himself and he got his footwork together so he could explode to the rim offensive foul on Placer Applause there you see Hanson good footwork he squares up finds the basket knocks it down thats good action right there off of a downstream and able to knock down the three points now to lead North Florida kickball you know Robert I said earlier I thought both teams in certain ways should have been very pleased with the first half you know I think coach Driscolls got his team now executing and running good stuff they just have to come up with some stops Music Elliott is very versatile as a score weve seen him knock down three early and now he can finish at The Rim Music floating three Music he has had two go down and looked like they were going to go and they just bounced out Cummings pulls up Federico missed the putback gets the third opportunity see thats what Im talking about the first one that he missed he should have just exploded he should have been over the limb team points now for Federico Federico you see on the season hes about tripled his season average Music Applause as you said though North Florida has to start getting some stops at the defensive end they cant just trade baskets no I offensively I think theyre playing a lot better than what they did the first four or five minutes of the game loose ball foul will be caught against UNF Applause there you go see hes got to make that well but once we get into ACC hes not going to get that second opportunity that this shot is going to be rebounded by somebody bigger and strong so hes got to make the first one on that action instant might have teased him about patting his Stats today get closer to that DoubleDouble like he had last game its in that now I love the way this pit team is playing together though um theyre really doing a good job of sharing the basketball wide open three from the corner UNF has just not found the range from Beyond the yard Burton running the break Goodson pulls up for midrange and scores again and let me tell you those that saw Burton last year and when they see him this year theyre seeing a completely different player Burton is really playing trying to get other people involved hes playing at a pace where he can be very effective Elliott came up short on the double clutch three but he gets his own rebound starting to get away from the Ospreys and they nope it has opened up its biggest lead of the game now 23 points with the awardwinning Geico mobile app our customers the tough matchup why because he can drive the ball from the perimeter and finish at The Rim he can post you up being plays off of angles and he can step out he can make the midrange jump shot he can come at you a lot of different ways he has eight points already this half Pitt has 14 points in the first four minutes of the second half and theyve opened up a 23point lead foreign Music Applause Applause Music I keep talking about it but its its a constant in this game and a major factor they contain the basketball you know and no one is getting to get to the rim and when they do theyre getting great rotation come on it has controlled the game trailed briefly for about 20 seconds to start the game and have led ever since Elliott thought about the three with 15 minutes to go nice feed to Federico in deep Federico flips it up and ends 16 points Robert that was actually that he took his time that time early in the game he got it in there and he rushed the shot up without even finding the basket now hes slowing down his action hes picking up the basket and hes scoring pickling knocks down the three piglet is a really good player I mean you can see how talented he is and what he means to this North Florida team 41 threepoint shooter in his career making about three and a half threes a game this year that was his first today I caught up the Zone I mean I was expecting to see this early a lot of times coaches wait to the second half to show something so you so you cant clean it up at halftime Federico career high points Applause quickly the other way a bar challenged by Federico Music Federico Duncan chemistry is something coaches talk a lot about this Pittsburgh team right now has very good chemistry Federico extending his career high 20 points as we said he averages four and a half points a game off the mark on the three however the rebound fumbled Federico nine out of 13 from the field at the other end laying it up and in Dorian James and North Florida will call a timeout Applause Pitt has opened up a 24point lead with 13 and a half minutes to go Music we love our new home theres so much space but we have ants without question theyre really looking for him I like this action that they go to where he sets the screen and then rolls and then they find him and hes finished at The Rim the other thing he does is he rolls that time again he finishes and then you always like to give the big guy a little sugar so you throw them and let him slam it wow but you still want to see him go up a little stronger on some of those yes uh but hes doing a much better job of finding the basket than he was earlier in this game but I really like the way pittage using him in the way his teammates are looking to get him involved he had a career high last game 17 and 14 rebounds against Sacred Heart he has equips that today brother to brother but turned away that was a beautiful look from Jorge to Guillermo but they couldnt finish I love Florida has gone through that zone nice finish by a bar hes got six points Applause no one to drive and hes the guy right now that North Florida is going to have to play off of kincense midrange jumper is pure hes playing with a lot of confidence right now every time Henson is touching the ball hes looking to make something happen its coach Thomas hes just happy to have an opportunity to play set out the last two years at Iowa State and so hes enjoying being out there for this Panthers program yeah but Robert hes always liked playing offense thank you step back three heckling knocks it down points for hicklin the Junior from Orlando because theyve even switched up the Zone a little bit here tweaking in well its like a match up um you know here in Pittsburgh they call it the amoeba who started when he was coaching here at Pitt and you just kind of match with the lineup offensively that you play against it looks like a 23 but it can morph into a one three one four three two Henson with 18 now and pit comfortably ahead with the 11 and a half minutes to go Music welcome to the neighborhood did you know Federico and Hinson having big games 22 of those points in the second half and Henson in particular has knocked down four or five midrange jumpers and its not something you see a whole lot of anymore everyones three pointers and layups thats the whole game but that midrange Shopper can be very effective as hes showing it really can be and a lot of times coaches said well we rather take the three but if a guys not a good threepoint shooter then the midrange and Henson has done a really good job of attacking the basket and pulling up taking the midrange Clinton knocks down another three snow at three point three point that midrange jump shot theyll just give you that yeah but if theyre gonna give it you have to take it thats what Im saying so yeah twos better than nothing right and so you know and thats what has been able to take advantage especially Hanson because he is a midrange shooter basically theyll give you that shot and if he can make it its two points hey you know for Henson looking pretty easiest Diaz Graham couldnt get the roll and then a foul on the rebound against the Ospreys you know one of the things and this is why this I think this bit team is going to be good I think the AC is going to be a very competitive league because its competitive energy this Pittsburgh team plays with a high level of competitive energy when you play Big Time basketball no matter what conference you play in the energy level has to be there and the competitiveness has to be there and thats what this fifth team has brought to this ball game they wanted an alleyoop abar had different thoughts and now pickling clears the glass still 20point lead but hicklin has started to heat up Hendrickson a three and called underneath no out top against Jorge Diaz Graham and Hoy Hoy didnt agree with that but hes a freshman so he didnt know what to say whatever he just kind of looked he looked like with all the contact thats going on you make that call for three it was a threeshot foul thats the second time Hendrickson has been found shooting a threes an 82 percent free throw shooter tomorrow our womens basketball quadruple header starts at noon Eastern with Wake Forest and Syracuse then well have three games following that the first of which is here at two oclock Louisville against Pitt top 10 matchup Notre Dame and Virginia Tech and then well cap it off with Clemson against eighth ranked NC State its all coming up tomorrow womens basketball quadruple header on acc Network Applause Music Hendrickson makes all three hes got 12 as Federico will check back in for Guillermo Diaz Graham now this gives Pittsburgh a different look because Henson goes to the three Music pressure here for North Florida Applause Hanson will float in and out of the foul line Music good play defensively and out of bounds to North Florida yeah for young players you cannot see the post when youre above the foul line thats just a bad angle to make that pass its too long to lead the defense can slip around as they did and get in front and make the steal we saw you and F do that at the same end of the Court a couple of times in the first half where they threw a post feed out of bounds UNF turned by 14 at the half theyve trailed almost the entire game down to by 17 right now Quinn on Henson down to seven to shoot sets up the ball screen plus Sarah down the lane leaves it up and in that was a tough screen right there on comedies and he was saying nobody made a call it was tough and a bar is down on the court hes being helped up he was in that screen action as well and right there nobody says anything he gets clipped Cummins get clipped and winds up taking a bar down I think he kicked him in the face with his shoe flew up and hit him in the face there you see the screen Pittsburgh has allowed the ball to actually get to the rim and not be challenged so pit was up by as much as 26 this is now an 80 run for UNF to get back to within 15 still a long way to go to really get back into the game but they have rattled off eight in a row Federico clearing out space and scoring and again the biggest difference is hes taking his time now hes not rushing he knows he can score and hes shooting the ball with the confidence of a big that knows he has a height Advantage 22 for Federico and now the jump ball the alternating possession will favor the ospreys you see the feed right there you see he takes his time finds the defense locates the basket and then finishes youd be surprised Robert how many bigs shoot the ball or in the process of shooting and havent picked up the basket you know soon for Federico a new career high Applause and a broken Edo ospreys run Music defended well on the two to shoot Parker desperation got it up on the rim and its rebounded by the Panthers thats his game thats what he does so well he uses his body finishes at The Rim hes just a completely different player today tough pass to handle there Parker kicks it out extra pass Hendrickson the three came up short Again rebounded by Burton threes on the corner for coming and Rebound in North Florida and Jaden Parker Hendrickson turns and fires he has not found the range from Beyond The Arc today hell send us to a timeout pit up 19 with under eight minutes to go has been offering us here today with his wife and his newborn who who looks very concerned with the state of the game right now that newborn is where we think we all want to be foreign they really supported each other extremely well you see Jordan Berry there who played six years in the NFL and lets not disturb that child all right that looks so peaceful I just cant even tell you how good that looks right now to be sleeping without a worry in the world Federico Mr S free throw Oscar about why didnt he punt and he said flat out Id be better than my two brothers if I really put my mind to it and practiced it a lot so remains to be seen in fact we have a photo of him in playing Australian Rules Football theres Oscar at 15 years old um hey he says he could be better but hes not a bad threepoint shooter he was all rookie and he see it fairly Dickinson last year not at all Music yes 10 on the shot clock here heres Barry from the corner and we know weve got I cant miss that shot no he tried to make it the Floridas gone back to the zone this is Diaz Graham Puerto Rico again back to Graham and hes found Applause Wham is very skilled hes got to get stronger um to be especially playing inside be able to finish I hope hes okay theres an injured North Florida player its Parker who was called for the foul as well as his injured on the play Lets Take a look at what happened here number 24 looked like he turned his right ankle when he came down on the floor wow North Florida flew up to Pittsburgh Thursday afternoon theyre actually not flying back out to Jacksonville until tomorrow morning they have a game against Davis and Elkins as their next game thats a division two school on Monday back home then theyre at Bethune cookman on Thursday they play in the Atlantic Sun uh they were picked fifth out of 14 teams in the preseason poll Liberty was number one Jacksonville was picked number two thats a really good lead Liberty is always really good um Richie McKay does a really good job there at Liberty and McCall the athletic director it was my athletic director when I was at Tulane it was my oversight and he just does an outstanding job of picking coaches there theyve got Darius McKee I think hes averaging about 25 a game a diminutive guard for them Parker in it good deal of pain as hes helped off the court Jorge Diaz Graham was an interesting free throw routine to say the ladies cant say Ive ever seen that before today work for him there this is the type of game where Graham can get some raps and get some experience going into ACC play blocking foul caught on Cummings it looked like he had a charge and then he reached so pick comfortably ahead here theyve won six of their last seven this is Pitts last nonconference game they did win their ACC opener at NC State earlier this month so they are 10 in league play that game is going to really benefit them because a lot of people will not be able to beat NC State at NC State and they really had a really good Vanderbilt team on the ropes to the right there at the end they have a very very difficult resumption of their ACC schedule theyre at Syracuse on Tuesday you think Carolina Virginia at Duke yeah I tell you yeah whenever you go up to Syracuse the warden or the North he just makes things very difficult up there hes an unbelievable coach Jim behan and what hes been able to do there and then youve got Carolina to uh also Virginia I mean Virginia is playing really well right now this is the veteran Virginia team its the first time that uh theyve got everybody back and uh theyre really playing at a high level and you look at the preseason poll one two three Carolina Duke Virginia playing all those teams Syracuse down at eighth in the preseason poll but gonna be a tough stretch for a pick coming up but this is a team thats got to have a lot of confidence right now yeah and Im gonna be honest with you when I coach Id rather play those type of teams early than late whenever all the focus is on you and you have to win games now youve got them out of the way or youve seen them before and youre familiar with them so in some ways its not bad but the Carolina game I believe which is going to be here is going to be really huge they play Carolina on the 30th here on acc Network they also play Virginia right after the New Year here so two of those games will be here at Peterson Events Center where theyve won roughly uh call it 75 percent of their game since this building opened back in 2002 you cant lose at home thats why they call this place the zoo I mean it will really be jumping hes playing with such boys and a total command of the game foreign Music Applause Music this North Florida team is going to give people especially in their league a really hard time because theyve got Shooters theyve got some size inside and they really do a good job with Hickman its creating a lot of opportunities Applause Burton missed the last game but hes got eight here today yeah and the biggest thing is that I watch as a coach hes playing under control I mean straight up straight down hes not forcing anything he just looks a lot calmer than he did last year where the time she would get a little flustered when the ball didnt go in the basket or he didnt get a call he just looks totally in control foreign started his career at Wichita State played there a couple of years then Texas Tech and he sees really Blossom since coming to Pitt big numbers last year as well as this year he makes one out of two from the line and has points yeah UNF is perennially one of the top teams in their conference always in the top four in the Atlantic Sun at a bit of a Down year last year and we talked about their schedule I mean schedule three of the top five teams in the AP preseason poll and we asked coaching them whats going on with the schedule he said were gonna Bank half a million dollars this year playing those games thats just the way it is at that level we fund a lot of our athletic department by playing Gonzaga Houston Kentucky yeah but you have to make a decision do we play against the opponent or do we play the way were normally going to play because you obviously when youre playing Kentucky Gonzaga Pittsburgh those folks theyve got a different level of athlete than youre going to see every day in your league so now wed make adjustments to play against them or do we run out regular stuff and taking their lumps again here today 13 now for Elliott check that 11 for Elliott Music you go to Gonzaga you play your first game of the year there you lose by 41 you know what are some of the you werent on that side of the stick the score a lot but what are some of the things you can sort of well get out of a lot well like whenever youre in that position our coaches Texas a M4 because we had to play some money games and you know you have to survive about four bad whistles to have a shot you know and you got to prepare your team to be able to do that just because youre on the road hit Clinton chance for a threepoint play with under four minutes to go here in Pittsburgh in my home we were always busy and keep things on a tight schedule so happy on the left is pithead Coach Jeff Capel hes assisted by his younger brother Jason cable both terrific players and you know their family very well extremely well I tell you their father Jeff was an excellent coach he coached at Wake Forest with an uncoasted Old Dominion had a tremendous career there you know you talk about instate rivalry one son goes to Duke the other son goes to North Carolina ones coached by Mike Shashi the other by Dean Smith probably the two best coaches ever to coach in the ACC and so its just a tremendous basketball three and Im sure at the dinner table theres a lot of interest in basketball conversation that Dad now was an excellent card player he had all the tricks and everything he used to go on the Nike trip and he would take everybodys money with his card tricks this is the game he had different tricks where he would pull Aces out of the deck I bet I can pull a two I mean I dont know how he did it but we nobody played cards with him regular because he was so good at it but he was a tremendous mentor and very proud of both of his sons the third is the pit head coach 221 and its interesting when we talked to him yesterday theres just some people you can tell when you talk to them and they talk about their parents you could just tell his dad who really meant a lot to him his dad passed away five years ago you can just tell how much his dad meant in his life they did he did to all especially expire young black coaches and all because his dad was a real inspiration and a leader with that and he gave a lot of inspiration to a lot of people and both of his sons have just turned out to be tremendous gentlemen and Jeff his demeanor and I told him this yesterday I thought really fit this rebuild at bits because he has the patience he had the understanding and the background of what needs to be done he doesnt get rattled hes not going to go off of a script and hes just the right guy in the right place and hes built programs before and hes in his Fifth Season at pittlet lets be honest the first four years have had a lot of adversity hes trying and starting to succeed at turning this around rebuilds are hard I was part of two rebuild one at Georgia Tech and the other at Tulane I was fortunate then and the key in rebuilding is getting a guy thats is good you think is good but hes better than what you think he is at Georgia Tech we got a young man named Mark Price who was 14 or four years all ACC ACC rookie of the year uh and at Tulane a guy got my first recruiting class went on to be the second alltime leading scorer in the school history thats being lucky I mean and so uh you know Jeff is really rebuilding this thing and in a difficult time Robert because of the transfer portal I mean people think its a plus but its hard to get chemistry its hard to build some tradition and getting some stability and hes managing all of those things AJ Marshall a walkon almost got the crowd fired up there with a possible threepoint play well go to the line for two shots I think everybody remembers coach cable as a player for the half court shot against North Carolina that pushed the game into overtime yeah one of the more iconic moments in that rivalry when he hit the shot to from half court at Cameron sent the crowd into a friends even more of a frenzy than they were already in probably as the phallus caught him will head to the other end with two and a half minutes to go he had a big career scored over 1600 points at Duke 433 assists and well over 203pointers but you know he takes the job at dude when he was the associate head at Duke you take the job here at Pitt the safest job in America is the associate headed I mean you know and so he really saw something in this job and in this rebuilding hes just gonna have to the job basket is good for Brandon Rasmussen its his first uh points of the game and the first field goal of his career he has a walkon from the Virgin Islands a bit of a rise from the crowd thats still here supporting North Florida Pete has been comfortably ahead most of this game a sebandies in there three from the right wing comes up short for Nate Santos the sophomore is in for the Panthers both teams have put a lot of their reserves into the game here this is jaw and Z is pass deflected hit on the Run Santos Nifty and a blocking foul this North Florida team what theyve gone through with this early schedule is really going to prepare them for their league theyre going to be tough theyre not going to be intimidated going into any environment and Coach Driscoll brings so much energy uh you know I tease them all the time can you just get excited at least sometimes I mean he always brings that enthusiasm and theyre going to have a good year Music dont forget coming up next Cornell makes the short 50mile drive up I81 to square off against Syracuse trying to break a 41game losing streak against the orange against for the big red gaining back to 1969 thats when were done here well send it up to the JMA Wireless dome in central New York assume theyve dug out from the snowstorm we got up in that direction you know you talk about Syracuse we all regret Louis Orr one of the Syracuse great pass a couple days ago and he was just a gentleman among gentlemen and a tremendous player from Cincinnati played at Syracuse was the head coach at Siena Seton Hall Bowling Green was most recently an assistant at Georgetown just a very nice Santos throws it down Applause gets a rise out of the crowd thats stuck around here with under a minute to go so pit will improve to eight and four North Florida will fall to three and seven threepointer blocked and about a seven second difference between the shot clock and the game clock this should be pits final offensive possession all right brother to brother and they wont possibly run the rest of the clock out here they will time ticking off hit in control and pip wins its seventh game out of its last eight 8256 the final Pitt really executed both on the offensive end and the defensive end tonight it was a wellplayed game by the pit Panthers foreign 26 Point win for Pitt as they finish off the nonconference schedule at like seven and four but eight and four overall nonconference schedule they win seven out of 11 and they got a couple of big games Music
