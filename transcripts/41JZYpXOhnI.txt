coaches great representatives of both universities and both of these teams are whole again with injured players returning Hunter Couture the key guard for the hokes averaging 13 1 12 points per game back in the lineup after a head injury and Virginia has told us that Dante Harris their Reserve guard is available after practicing this week well see how much time he gets off the bench going right inside to Lyn kid early hes one of the most improved players in the country from a year ago the energized Virginia Defense comes up with his first steal of the night Jordan Miner in transition no and here comes sha padulla some kaher has the season scoring average up over 16 per game drive and dish to the corner MJ Collins for three MJ Collins has struggled shooting a three this season but the last four or five games hes seeing a bigger basket so now this end Virginias Isaac mcne seems to be the number one key on every opponents Scouting Report these days youve got to run Virginia off the threepoint line cuz at times they can be offensively challenged look for Virginia Tech to really extend on him and thats what youre going to get if you extend on him coming up those screens that pocket pass will be available terrific pocket pass and great finish by miner Miner making his second start there you see the starting five for the hookes with Couture in the back court with Collins and padulla Robbie Baron and the vastly improved Lin kit inside well that is what number zero in Chicago maroon and burnt orange brings to this team among other things a dead eyee threepoint shooter a dead eyy threepoint shooter and moves without the basketball as well as any in the country he changes speed he changes Direction he waits on screens and he is shot ready but minor to me as you said the as The Bigs of Virginia look at the right hand side of his screen as he sets that screen hes going to slide to a pocket right here here you got to help on mcney terrific pocket pass and thats what Virginia is going to look at out of that little Twan game that twoman screening game pulla with a bad pass done is fouled at midcourt that pass right there is exactly what Mike young was talking about prior to the game sha Pula hits singles you dont have to hit home runs in their losses Virginia techs turn it over 15 times a game and their wins are only 10 make good decisions take care of the basketball a key for this game for Virginia Tech and that really cost him last time out Saturday in a 7571 lost to Miami indeed like you say coach 15 turnovers six of them from padulla mcne finds Miner again goes to the other side missed the layup really good youre talking about McNeely and youre talking about Couture both of those guys off the ball their movement is a clinic Collins again a little strong this time heres reys beakman the reigning ACC Defensive Player of the Year averaging nearly 13 points a league leading six assists per game and the whos are back within two and nice job beeping rejecting that ball screen a really good finish with what either had You got to keep him in front youve got to make Virginia score over the top of you you cant give him straight line drives and you got to force him to shoot contested Applause shots C Virginias pushing out a little bit further defensively taking Virginia take a little bit out of their Rhythm Robbie Baron red transfer from Northwestern misses his first shot attempt whos with the basketball down by two the ball pressure of Virginia is just disrupting slightly that rhythm of that Virginia Tech offense and so again Mike young told us at shooter around today the defensive matchup they want more often than not as Hunter Couture trying to shut down lock in on Isaac mcne hes got to be physical on on mcne because as MC Neely comes off those screens if this guy thats defending Miner the screener all right if that Defender has to show that pocket pass is going to be available so youre going to have to change your coverages on McNeely coming off those screens roie to beakman tries to drive Baseline Collins Cuts him off shot clock under 10 back to beakman finds Miner strong to the rim his second dunk of the night same thing wide wide pin down you extend and show on that wide pin down and a pocket pass has been available now Jordan Miner was the coconference player of the year in the NC last year at meramac but hes had a hard time getting on the floor for Virginia this year coach and what has that process been like for number 22 and one you come to Virginia and what they do offensively and defensively is fairly intricate especially on the defensive end marac played a two3 match up Zone basically you you an easier adjustment than having to come out get out and extend on ball screens get out and ex extend on screens off the ball help on dple penetration and get back into play so hes learning to how to sight the defensive adjustments that you have to make playing manto Applause man

with the follow and a foul T Clark swoops back a three its good with 21 bounce back Murphy for the win no and Virginia holds on whether as nonconference Rivals over the years or as conference Rivals now in the ACC Seth Greenberg had seems like whenever these two teams get together it goes down to the wire its going to come down to a 5minute game and you can dig a hole and dig out of it uh you can be down 10 but in the last 5 minutes its going to be a possession basketball game and you know at that point of the game youve got to take care of the ball youve got to limit your opponent to one shot and you got to get the shot you want and both of these teams defensively and offensively are terrific in terms of executing it then can you make this shot all six Virginia points have come at The Rim including a couple of dunks by miner making his second start as a Virginia Cavalier shot clock down to three Andrew roie fires from the Baseline an airball and the hokes with a basketball a chance to retake the lead ODU transfer maai long in the game at the four spot bringing a little bit more athleticism pretty good match up with Applause Music dun K trying to find Couture Ro staying right with him to the Baseline Corner three nothing but net for the redot Shawn Padula the 61 Junior from Edmond Oklahoma with his first three thats just really good offense move the ball move people Baseline Drive Baseline drift open three terrific pass by coutur mcne no long rebound to padulla the reigning ACC player of the week last three games averaging over 30 points per a little strong off the back iron dun clears the rebound for Applause Music Applause Music Applause UVA shot clock down to 10 Ro off the curl minor hands to beakman open from three got it this is as efficient as Ive seen this Virginia offense all season long the ball is moving guys are shot ready the screening angs are good really good execution and the pace of what theyre doing is very good Dante Harris will check in for Virginia at the next stoppage 6 minutes in maai Long hangs in the air no dun rips another rebound one of the great home court advantages in the country UVA riding a 19 game win streak the longest active streak in the entire country Miner is fouled and he will head to the line to shoot two that is the first foul on Hunter Couture and the third on the hokes bakman because of his size and his ability to set his man up coming off that ball screen the whole idea of a ball screen if youre watching the game is to force two people to play you and then if you force two people to play youre four and three behind and bman does a really good job Virginia Tech you look on the left hand side of your screen all right they dont tag this R watch peakin he sees a Couture laate on that tag really good decision and great spacing by Virginia in that high spread ball screen Virginia with its first lead of the night Miner coming off a solid 95 rebound performance in Saturdays game at Wake Forest this from a guy who again last year at miramac averaged 17 1 12 points 9 and 12 rebounds two and A2 block one and a half steals youve got to think that if they can work him into the rotation and get starters minutes hes going to make a difference that totally and his role offensively is different because hes a screener and a shaper here rather he was a low post scorer in NEC which obviously is a two steps down from what were looking at right now they won the NEC tournament last year Fairley Dickson went to the NCAA tournament because Mar was not eligible because they hadnt been a division one team long long enough yes har on the hack sack one and ended up being Purdue the alma M they did here is Shan padulla the fouls on Dante Harris his first and padulla makes the front end you can see the Supreme confidence sha padulla is playing with in recent days and recent weeks for the hokes now 10 six overall two and three in the league but they have yet to win a true Road game this season do you ever score 30 back toback oh no in your career oh no well if you did I either yeah I didnt either but if I did back to back Id be pretty confident too absolutely now what comes first the confidence and the success or the success and then the confidence I dont know call Cory Alexander he would know here is Harris after missing the last 10 games I think he could be just a huge component for UVA the Georgetown transfer can take a lot of the pressure off of Reese beakman whos had to do so much this season on both ends of the floor was the most outstanding player of the Big East tournament two years ago three years AG here he is defending padulla on the Block got a piece out of bounds Virginia basketball Harris can defend he can move the ball and he and he can get a pain touch watch this back down right here didnt get a great look at it but Id say thats a pretty solid defensive play good did a nice job of Walling up and contes it if you want to watch the game just watch number 11 without the ball or Couture zero without as they move without the ball pass hit the net trying to find Harris underneath goes out of bounds back to the Music hokes Ive talked about the success Virginias had here at home they also are without a win in their four true Road games what is it about college basketball and so much this year Seth where the home court advantage is even more pronounced well theres a very Level Playing Field this year at college basketball there are a ton of very good teams no great teams theres a ton of terrific players maybe only one or two guys that really do can dominate a game so a Home courter Advantage is is real and its routine uh its hard to win on the road and uh this year especially and as it pertains to this rivalry game why is Virginia better on this floor why are the Hokies not as good away from blackburg you both of these places terrific home courts I mean you know Castle col seam is one of the great home courts in college basketball the way its configured it goes straight up to castle guard rocks and rolls at the Baseline and and the same same thing here at jpj this place is a terrific venue and a great home facility Tyler nichel little too strong on his first attempt from the Applause floor Harris kicks to the corner Jake Groves puts it up and in three points for the Oklahoma grad transfer his first three of the night and thats what Harris gives you he gives you paint touches which collapses the defense you got to help and he makes a great decision on the kickb Brandon re Steiner the backup point guard for the hes with a basketball malel potit runs into a double team finds M long puts it up and he will hear about that for the rest of the night this is the Commonwealth Clash the UVA athletic department

double the post big to Big look on left hand side of your screen the ball goes into potit theres the double youre going to stay home on Couture and then close to long youre dictating who is going to get that shot Virginia start Virginia Tech started two for two from the field theyre one for nine of their last nine shots well nationally Virginia leads the country in giving up the fewest points per game 577 points per game and Tony Bennetts defense works from year to year regardless of who is is on the roster it seems to be a stifling proposition for the opponents they dont turn it over and they dont take bad shots so you have to play against their set defense and if you play against their set def defense theyre going to take away straight line drives and theyre going to take away post UPS well if Jake grov can deliver like that from outside what a huge weapon he is for Virginia its a 6 run of the whoos with their largest lead of the night long with the layup really nice penetration good job of nickel keeping his eye on a rim to make that pass Groves becomes a matchup problem especially as a screener and popper when hes in those twoman games if you show and help on those screens he can fade and get out to the threepoint line Leon Bon into the game for the first time number 35 in white for Virginia Lake Buchanan facing up to The Cutting Grove first twopoint attemp a little strong off the window Tech with the basketball down by three thats where Virginia has struggled playing through contact with their baits nichel uses his body to ward off Buchanan potit on the putb no thres with a rebound and here come Theos beakman with a Applause Music Applause basketball a mismatch right there good job of scrambling out of it by Virginia Tech eight to shoot pman pulls the trigger 1913 Virginia thats bigmans second threes he was knocked down two threes got to the rim once and really doing a nice job right now defensively Couture cant get the three back bomb on Up Above the Rim for another Carol pman aggressive down the lane no thought he got bumped on that drive Nicholls pass read beautifully by roie another hokey turnover and like you mentioned Virginia does not turn it over best in the country only eight turnovers per game committed by UVA even their loss is only 10 John Wooden would say be be quick but dont hurry right there nichel just played he was a little bit rushed Let The Game come to you make the simple play hit Applause Music singles its a big possession for Virginia Tech you cant let this thing get away because of the Applause tempo ret Steiner to niichel really good defensively everything on the perimeter no pain touches Cs got to put it up and it gets stuck a wedgie from the graduate student for the Hoke 1913 the whoos leading the

App Applause today h clear for takeoff heres Proctor from threepoint land Pittsburgh at number seven Duke Saturday on accn forgia five assists on seven field goals really good Rhythm get a twoman game Drag by the Hedge Defender Groves thats stability shot fake step side knocked down at three this is just hand down man down good Rhythm dribble by beakman hes knocked down two threes I love the rhythm of what Virginia is doing offensively the balls moving people are moving even though mcel has knocked down any threes hes still a factor in this game because you extend on every screen which opens up the floor the rhythm of Virginias offense has been tremendous and on the other end set their defense has disrupted the rhythm of the hokes now just four of 16 shooting ball pressure pushing him out of Step really really active they took the ball out of the low post theyve taken ly kid out of the game basically and right now Virginia Techs not taking great care of the basketball which is a concern for Mike young hits back on the floor defensively as Bond penetrates Miner traveled nice job by Lin kid just to wall up and force the turnover I would be surprised if Mike young tries to go into kid right now get him a touch on the Block but ly kid is yet to take a shot he was a perfect eight for eight from the floor and Texs last game on Saturday against the canes and in they go to him working on minor no double team spin to the Baseline and a traveling violation pretty good little misdirection right there Mike young talked to us about that ball fake it bring it right back get kid posted up he get pushed underneath the backboard no Applause angle Pond beakman McNeely Dunn and Miner out there for the Applause Cavaliers oh hard McNeely Works without the basketball who does he remind you of with the way he plays mcney yeah a poor mans Joe Harris done on the putback thats pretty good A Poor Mans Joe Harris I didnt say homeless just a poor mans five straight points for the who the lead is up to eight and its another un unforced turnover you got we got to remember how young this this Virginia team is really good job great 45 degree cut good contest right there but Ryan Dunn his ability to get to the offensive glass really nice job hes just a second year not a sophomore not a sophomore second year I dont want to get I dont want to get reprimanded by Cory were here on the grounds of the University of you got this thing all down right now its unbelievable you are locked in hes got a bingo card and hes making sure you do all the right things cuz if not your phone will be blowing up Ive got to mention the retunda at least once Ive got to mention the lawn at least once or else I hear about it did he live on the lawn no he didnt live on La no the only lived on La doesnt live on La but Ralph can live on La no and Ill tell you the story with that Ralph had a room on the line he Liv with Coach Holland he lived with Coach Holland because he was just too big to fit in those tiny little rooms so the only scholarship basketball player who has actually lived on the lawn Malcolm brogy I can see that there you see Ralph his uh banner and Ralph is in the building as he often is here tonight rooting for his Alma moer what a marvelous we had a we had a nice lunch at Samsons American Grill we did not far from here maybe well get like maybe a derve when we go back tonight maybe I had my Terry Holland meatloaf big whistle meatloaf had to be good fman with another steal waits for mcney tries to shovel it to Miner good Hustle by Couture to knock it out of bounds Cavaliers keep you know whats interesting as good as Virginia is in terms of playing in half court passing the ball waiting on screens moving the ball theyre not really efficient in transition obviously because they dont get in transition a whole lot but this is a really young team you know talking to Tony B before the game uh patience not where they want to be its almost invigorating trying to figure this team out putting guys in position but understanding that he likes his pieces but his pieces right now havent matured yet and theyve got to add some pieces obviously in this next years recruiting class and I find that interesting as coach Bennett has a conversation with Tony Henderson one of our three officials that is Brian oconnell checking to see who the foul is on I found it interesting to hear coach Bennett talk about that I mean hes a national champion hes been here 15 years but is still invigorated year after year trying to figure stuff out these two coaches and I said it all the time are Savant Mike Mike young is Savant offensively I know theyre struggling scoring but if you look at what they do how they do offensively its amazing and Tony Bennett in terms of teaching offensive basketball I get a kick at old people say that you know Virginia you know I mean how do how do you want to why would you want to play that way look at the success his players have had at the next level because they do know how to play they do Embrace roles they do know how to use screens they do know how to defend uh to me the most underappreciated woo part of what Tony B does he preparing his players to play whether its in Europe or in the NBA nine former Cavaliers currently in the NBA its a pretty good number really good number and good players by the way that three ball from mcneels first points tonight Miner knocks away the post entry Baron turns it over its turnover number seven 15 in their losses theyre half almost halfway there the ra around Miner couldnt handle the pass but gathers and brings it back out to Dun shot clock at Applause 15 dun slips the screen beakman pulls up from 17 doesnt get the roll big rebound by ly kid youd like to play ahead of this defense great help padulla with the great dump off for the layup by Robbie Baron youve got to get some clean stops and try to get ahead of that defense cuz right now the pressure on the ball the activity off the ball def defensively for this Virginia Defense has really taken Virginia Tech out of rhythm and taken any room and Rhythm shots away from Applause them great grease screen look for a quick drag screen right here in transition theour fouled by Applause mcne weve got our next media Timeout on the second followed by Baron the whoos in control is McNeely starting to heat up here at Music jpj the

Gott skin heart Music feelingson Music top all right okay I did it my way Music you the competitions never been better this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESP the third youngest of Dom and bernardet Padulas nine kids has been on some kind of role lately in each of his last three games sha padulla has had three career highs including going over 30 each of the last two games Music hes not quite as hot so far tonight but he hasnt had to do as much with the return of Hunter Couture but he has shown set that he can go off at any time he can go off at any time and Im telling you one thing re speakmans heard about Sean padulla for the last three days oh yeah and REE beakman defensively is a little bit like my former ACC defensive player the year jaman Gordon and he gets to the point where Id say you you got to guard that dude you know hes lit everyone up and like Jamal Gordon said coach he might have L everyone up hes not lighting me up sha pull he said coach pman said coach padulla is a good player but Im guarding him Im taking him out and thats exactly what hes done so far in this game its not just that he struggled scoring its hes also turned him over and sped him up which is a big part of it if Jamal Gordons watching this game right now he knows exactly what Im talking about cuz I would just give him the other teams best player and I wouldnt have to worry about that guy with Seth Greenberg Im Doug Sherman and not every team has somebody with the defensive acument of Reese beakman but does every team have a player who wants that challenge Seth good teams do winning teams do uh you want a front Court perimeter Defender and you want I mean a back court Defender who can lock someone up and you want a front Court Defender that can guard that Wing type player but the best teams have guys that can just flat out guard people pulla now picked up by Dante Harris who commits the foul yeah just like Virginia Techs focal point was ISAC neing you know Virginia Techs focal part was Art we got to run Couture off the threepoint line and then weve got to get up and underneath padulla push him out get him out of rhythm and make him a risk reward passer and thats what theyve been able to do Elijah potit back off the bench for Tech hands it to Couture finds niichel little strong again Miner with a good rebound thats a good battle inside I think Miner has been really good caught two pocket passes has been pretty physical defensively and active defensively good screener this seems to have been a more complete Virginia effort at least through the first 17 and 1 12 minutes coach Bennett talked about that before the game that they have done it in stretches this year they have looked good so far here tonight p R has been a part of it hes got a couple of made threes Reese beakman has a couple of made threes for the fourth time this year here he goes into the lane wide open Andrew Roy Applause no Music cure nickel wide open he has struggled to find the range tonight that was a really good luck good job of coming off that screen hard Couture hard roller you got to tag the roller wide open shot for nichel nickel one of two hokes flying pretty near their home Nicholls from Harrisonburg Virginia Robbie Baron from Applause Richmond beakman step back three throw back to beakman now pman looking to take advantage of P inside steps through and kisses it home 10 points for beakman its a 154 Virginia run and this matches their largest lead of the night so far in Charlottesville when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division 1 most of any kind its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC a coming up at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific over on ESPN number 12 Arizona host USC at the male Center bronny James still trying to get things going for the Trojans what have you seen from bronny now that hes back in the fold for the Trojans hes a nice player uh he hasnt you know hes a nice player look the best thing about Brony James right now is hes healthy enough to play Y and everyone wants to evaluate every dribble every pass every shot oh my goodness he went 0 for seven you know he hes become a story because everything he does Trends which is really unfair to him its also unfair to the rest of the guys on his team cuz hes just getting acclimated to college basketball he didnt really experience any preseason and you know we should leave him alone but hes too much of a story because everything he does becomes a story and a headline and a trend where what he needs to do is just really be anonymous for a while and enjoy and being fortunate enough to be be able to play Virginia Tech just committed its ninth turnover of the half McNeely with the lefthanded finger old Buchan and tried to flush it here comes padulla roie picks him up ball comes back to MJ Collins at the free throw line kills the dribble back out to Hunter Couture post seat boxing out Buchanan trying to shape up and create space for a post entry so good defense right now the Virginia Defense is like an impenetrable wall like you get you drive in the Gap theyre helping theyre help is early so they can recover theyre closing out theyre keeping the ball in front theyre giving up no splits and theyre contesting every shot its a clinic defensively by Music Virginia the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I walk in theyre always glad to see me everyone that touches that vehicle they take pride in being here for the brand we hold ourselves to you know very very high standard I think this is a Premier Place the way they attend to the customers is second to none our c Ser experience were like family at the dealership so when we sell you a car were not just selling you a car your family at the end of the day heres our featured ESPN womens basketball matchup for Sunday afternoon Angel Reese and number 10 LSU host Arkansas at the marovic center in Baton Rouge coverage begins at 5 Eastern 4 Music Central should be a sellout crowd at the Pete the folks in Baton Rouge love their LS and why not what would the mens coaches equivalent be to the outfits of the coaching staff at LSU I dont know if there is one is there a in in modern College mens basketball I dont know if there is Applause one wimp Sanderson back in the day the pl Jack final 13 seconds of the half beakman has been so good got to the ren but couldnt finish now 8 seconds to go for the hokes padulla down the lane finds Couture for the open three and that is a tremendous way to close out the half for Virginia te absolutely terrific he get a stop on one end you push you get Baseline like you would have wanted to if youre Virginia youve owned a temple and Rhythm of the game youve been really good defensively really havent had got a lot of good looks having said that they just to kick the field goal at the end of the half and now started with the the ball to first possession a bucket here would be huge there it is on Hugh Baron on the kick out from Lin kid who by the way Lin kid played 10 minutes in the first half and did not attempt a shot and theyve got to get L kid touches just because of that if he gets touches now the defense is going to double big to bigger at least scrape ball comes out maybe you get some steping threes but you know the analogy of great job of be getting in the lane and using the size with a high release love is high release love is ility to hit a spot but you know the analogy is you kick that field goal at the end of the half you get it you get the ball back because of of let the other team start with the ball to start the game and you get back to back threes but its really important this end of the floor to be really just a little bit tougher Virginias going to make you defend to the end of the clock if youre going to defend to the end of the clock and you know youve got to be tough and physical late in the clock McNeely takes the bump from Couture and goes goes down hard holding his right elbow grimacing as he heads to the free throw line you see all these scoring opportunities m is getting he does a great job on those wide pin Downs because Virginia Tech is chasing him he does a great job of curling off those screens into the rim getting his shoulders ahead of the defender and getting scoring opportunities does a great job playing off the ball had only four free throws in the first half the 87 shooter makes his first heres Saturdays basketball triple header over on acc Network Clemson squares off against Florida State at four Eastern then these Virginia Cavaliers take on Georgia Tech and finally Kyle filipowski and number seven Duke host pit at Cameron indor I know we were showing our NBA lineup coming thats a pretty good game too now I think its nuggets no doubt might watch that game too MJ Collins gives to kid hands to Couture D had a quiet first half for Virginia grabs another rebound the whoos have led by as many as 10 points on multiple occasions up eight with a basketball and then the defense of Virginia is just pushing Virginia Tech out just a step to get him out of rhythm roie did not come out as far as beakman thought he was going to and so that pass goes flying into the bench Virginia gives it back to tack thats the only their fourth turnover Applause they only commit eight a game padulla from long range Miner boxed out kid the rebound comes to Dun and beakman walks it up thats one of those shots Im not sure that Mike young wants to move the defense a little bit more than that yet hes played so well great cut once again curl cut off the back screen because youre chasing MCD off all those screens the guy thats defending the screen has to help on that back screen I love the way McNeely read the defender Lin kid and switched to his left hand for the layout four points for the sophomore from POA West Virginia kid tries to save it and its Virginia Tech basketball say Miner was the last to touch much to the Chagrin of the folks McAn coutur is so good without the ball is putting on on a a clinic right there lets see who it off offer Im not sure if that ball was he bounced in and it was out of bounds but he got it back theres a pocket pass hes got to be ready to score that I get the sense you could just sit and watch Couture and MC off the ball for 40 minutes oh its its its a clinic both of those guys change speeds change direction late on screens theres a rescreen on the left hand side for roie but if you watch on the right hand side of the screen watch number 11 comes off the screen boom ball doesnt get stuck Miner gathers and draws the foul Miners been terrific he really has been he he hasnt finished everything but hes been a screener and then after he screens hes made himself available right he set a screen hes rescreen uh hes gotten good angles on his screens hes done a really nice job off the ball as a screener a young man who grew up on the

and connected watch 22 here they blow up the dribble handoff and miners steps out gets a hand in the deflection and then re deepan and Ryan D do the L but that play started defensively with pressure on the ball and finish with Jordan Miner being up on that screen getting that deflection and getting Virginia out in transition youve seen Virginia a lot more than I have in person Doug what is your impression of Jordan Miner today in relation to the other times youve seen him well hes found his bearings you know he has not gotten any sort of extended minutes for a variety of reasons but the last couple of games when given the opportunity now he seems to be able to contribute as potit lays it in hes contributing at both ends 100 Tony B have told us before the game its taken them a while to figure out their defensive principles played Zone in earlier in col at marac learning how to play manto man you know its getting out on screens like that and then recovering back terrific really really terrific the other part for Virginia that they have their complete roster back Dante Harris gave him six really good minutes in the first half couple of assists didnt turn it over and that allows for beakman to be beakman dun misses the layup you know what it means so now youve got Miner coming off the bench two more that extends the rotation for Tony Bennett this is a team that was nationally ranked three times earlier this season as high is number 22 theyve not been receiving votes for good reason in recent weeks but the pieces might be there to get back into the NCA tournament talk is a long season with tremendous opportunities another deflection by minor the light bulb goes on for different players at different times uh you you go for marac who terrific program very well coached team to the ACC this microscope a totally new system a lot to learn and what happens is sometimes you got to unplug plug back in reboot and thats exactly what were seeing right now and Jordan has always had the support of his parentss mom Couture as Dad Charles who attended almost every one of his games at miramac while they were juggling time with Jordans sister Camille whos now a junior on the Batson college basketball team but he is somebody who can really contribute for Tony it doesnt always work out though as you know for these up transfers and for down transfers it doesnt always work but for him it seems to be coming together now a couple of months in its an inexact science for sure like I I I put transfers in two categories like to me theres no difference jar between him and a one and done CU thats what he is hes a oneand done uh a plug in and play hopefully then Padu knocks down that jumper then some people just rebuild their whole program like Wake Forest they R in three transfers but thats not what Tony Bs going to do when hes going to take these guys that are returning next year and hes going to then find pieces to complement Applause them offensive foul

University Virginia mhm she did an absolutely phenomenal job when she came to Virginia there really wasnt a woms basketball program what she built here is absolutely tremendous great coach great person every first class in every aspect of what she was able to do here this is the Commonwealth Clash that were involved in here tonight Virginia and Virginia tackle the hokes have been playing from behind but theyve been able to hang in there down by as many as 13 that cuts it to six play ahead of the defense clean stops advaned pass play ahead of the defense good job of nickel getting out and transition really nice simple playe hit singles first three points for the young man from nearby Harrisonburg Virginia McNeely tries to answer and does although thats a two and will be reviewed at the next stoppage the two on the floor same thing he comes off that Baseline screen and you shortcut it and go balls side hes bumping that thing back and thats either a two wide open two or three you got to have pressure on the basketball to disrupt the timing of that because he does does a great job of reading screens Couture with a burst unable to finish numbers if Virginia Applause hurries and there you go it developed slowly but Miner came free underneath and Dante Harris found him it developed slowly because Dante Harris used a little back trible and bought time for the play to develop thats a highlevel mature basketball play Harrison has been really South heres the big big double again a season high now for Miner with the 10 points first bucket of the night for lin kid Lin kid using his dribbles and escape to get an angle if youre going to double him big to Big you cant let him out you got to force him out away from the basket he cant get to the middle which does not happen often he makes 67 of his field goal attempts number one of the ACC and so many of them are in tight like we just saw watch this ball screen little back trouble here just to freeze the defense create some space give Miner a chance to roll that is just a big time play you see everyone on Virginias lifted above the free throw line so theres no backside help on the roller great spacing but Harris made that play by using his dribble and bringing it back and creating space Miner making his second start of the Season second in a row against Wake Forest on Saturday at nine points five rebounds even better here tonight padulla and nichel sit down for Virginia Tech Brandon re Steiners back in for the first time here in the second half Robbie Barons out there as well MJ Collins defends beakman three to Applause shoot tan Murray into the game for Virginia had to put it up quick pass inside Lin kid lets see if the hes can get him going good defense by miner theyll go again to that match up Ken over the left shoulder no and Miner gets the rebound Miners done a really good job of Walling up putting his chest between kid in the basket both High hands and making him score over him really s minor defensively on and off the balll has been very good and this is where hes been really good off that pocket pass well hes got a physicality that nobody else on theg roster has a dozen points now for the 68 Brad transfer from Kingston Massachusetts and the lead is back to double Music figures Jordan Martins been absolutely terrific offensively defensively out on ball screens help open off screens off the basketball and as a screener and a receiver the guy thats most open is most times the screener whether its off the ball screen on a roll playing off the ball wedge rebounding using that big body to create angles Jordan Meyer defensively out on screens out on ball screens patient down here big physical body hes changing a little bit of the DNA what Virginia has been early in the season theyve had no physicality in their front Court they havent had the ability to play off those pocket passes and score miners given them that in this game against Virginia Tech young man who loves the game of basketball took the train 90 minutes each way to get to BC high school and then to brim and may before finally getting his drivers license cut it down to only a twohour round trip commute Couture Baron re Steiner no offensive rebound malel po fresh 20 on the shot clock for Tech Collins finds the open man in the corner Robby Baron for three good job that that basket was created

getting important minutes here down the stretch for Virginia beakman off the hesitation doesnt get the roll here come the hokes again down by Applause five singles really important right now for gin

to knock them down here in the second half five for from the threepoint line in the second half playing ahead of the defense right there Nickel in transition and quick attack Baseline Drive Baseline drift Baron knocks down that three the best way to attack Virginia is to play ahead of the defense the second way is to move the ball move people second side it and then drive it when they do that youre going to get a better shot 72 run the last three minutes for Virgin Virginia Tech under seven minutes to go Robbie Baron long rebound secured by roie big stop for UVA 645 left in regulation McNeely back in the game now beakman whos sitting on the bench stood up for a moment now sits back down theyve got the luxury to again have Dante Harris at the point heres mcne Rising out around it out miners right there gathers and hes fouled you know mcely works so hard off the ball coming off those screens that what it does is the defender thats defending the screener which is Miner gives Miner a chance to see right there he has no one who can put a body on him and cut him out because youre helping on McNeely whether its off the curl whether its off the punch off the dribble when you help off that dribble someones got to find Miner and cut him out hes got a straight line to the rim hes come up with a couple offensive opportunities off of penetration whether its off a cutter or off the dribble I think the discussion was whether that was on the floor or a shooting foul as you see the Hokies he never went called for five Cavaliers with three team fouls one thing about Virginia they they they commit the fewest fouls in America I think only about 13 a game it really is something the combination of the defense that they play because theyre in gaps so they not rotation Id say he should have released it but I think hes on his way up so the foul is on Robbie Baron and Miner will shoot two heres our next star St at espnnba Friday double header Nica joic and the Nuggets play the second game of a fivegame road trip against Jason Tatum and the Eastern Conference leading Celtics at 730 Eastern then the Mavs hope to have Luca donic back for this one against Stephan the Warriors coverage begins with NBA Countdown at s Eastern Draymond back for the Warriors how about did you see that pass YW the other day the over the head blind pass hes pretty good oh my goodness that that that Denver Nuggets team is just fun to watch great match up last night between joic and how good was Jal beat oh cant get stuck Nicholls pass draws the foul on the entry youre going to get that posted easier on a ball reversal than on the first side unless you go some type of mid misdirection which youre going to go misdirection you got to bring it outside the midpoint to basically the shoot which is basically the foul lane and then come back but if you keep it on that side of the Applause floor watch Couture here watch Couture here coming off and he runs into Miner and beakman and the foul goes against Miner so before he could fire and come off that screen the personal goes against the hoes and coutur is a terrific screener hes got a little John Stockton in him that he gets to the legs of the defender thought it was interesting talking to coach young about how that has developed for him over the course of The Last 5 Years his ability to run off of screens here he comes again beakman all over him just a pest but Couture is undeterred he just puts beakman on his back thats just a dribble head to zumax to pin down to a dribble handoff and he uses that screen and and then seals the defender and hes strong enough and all of a sudden its still a fivepoint game and its 5 minutes to go the way its supposed to be mcney back to beakman bman finds his fellow guard WS it around to minor and hell head back to the free throw line interesting back cour right here with Harris and beakman facing mcne at the three Harris is a very good on ball Defender which enables beakman maybe to go and defend Applause Kor well Seth UVA started the game on fire shooting the basketball making four of their first six they have missed their last seven and in spite of that hanging on to the sixpoint lead Mike young said five was the number they felt they had to hold Virginia 2 to win this game five threes Im not sure he was expecting Miner to have 15 points what a what what a what a benefit for Virginia the way hes playing feel that same pin down dble hand off nichel poti goes flying into the Baseline couldnt save it and the Cavaliers get the basketball back poti is fiercely competitive on glass uses that big lower body to wedge people Applause out under five minutes to go its a sevenpoint game you see the season high for Jordan Miner and this is Lone season with the Cavaliers he comes up screen rejected Harris a bolt to the bucket and thats what you get from Harris side ball screen he rejects the ball screen youre worried about the action on the other side with McNeely and he just explodes to the rim Mulla has it knocked Away by Harris beakman kicks it back out mcney shot ready just left it short but you can just feel it here tonight Virginia is a different team with Jordan Miner and Dante Harris read my mind it it changes their Dynamic it changes their DNA it changes their depth it changes their rotation it changes their ability to get easy buckets right on the right hand side of your screen right there here comes the ball screen haris re Jackson if you if you saw on the weak side and if we can see that one more time coutur is locked up in a twoman game on the left hand side of the floor weing about M Neely which gives Harris an opportunity to get to the ring Miner receives a well earned Round of Applause as he takes a seat on the Virginia bench nichel the hes needed that one and a big rebound for mcne really good underneath that b explain same play dribble hand off pin down dribble hand off for Couture and a throwback to give nickel a pretty good look bu cannons back in gets the feed after the screen and hes able to finish the Freshman from pane Idaho makes it 5443 an 82 Virginia run draws a timeout back for the finish

ruined Tonight Theres No Stopping Us Now this is just spectacular thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and ABC Dr Harris is G in Virginia an absolutely huge boost right there you see him reject the ball scrip because youre locked in on the left hand side of the floor that makes it really difficult to give help and then a nice little pocket pass be Canon playing through contact thats an area that Virginia is really working with him on to get a wider base to play through the contact not take the ball away from the defender two really solid plays for Virginia you know Seth the Cavaliers have been connected tonight on 21 field goals theyve got 15 assist assists and Reese Beakmans been allowed to be Reese beakman 12 points four steals four assists just doing what he does padulla on the coming out of the timeout they get a good shot almost every time uh Mike young is a savant coming out of timeouts in their half court sets with their spacing with the different actions that they run theyve missed shots today I mean and a lot has to do with Virginias defense but you know Couture and padul are going to continue to grind away theyve got to find find a way to get some clean stops theyre still right in this basketball game good pass again you Canon attacks no ring defense and the Freshman goes right after it all those wide pin downs and those curl cuts the pocket pass has been open how about the production out of the five spot for Virginia tonight 22 combined points between Miner and Buchanan padulla drains the three little misdirection good throwback right there big time shot by padulla here comes a little pressure Don weights for Dante Harris and now Virginia with two and A2 minutes to go in no Applause hurry same thing you count off a beautiful feed from Dante that action coming off the Baseline that curl action and pocket passin Tech has had a real hard time defending it pulla creates space but missed the shot Virginia in control with under two minutes to go I watched a lot of tape on Virginia before this game great hands right there you dont recognize it heres Robbie Baron their best their best execution all season long and people say well you know they only have 58 points its not the number of points its the efficiency and how theyre getting their points and theyre not taking an abundance of Threes they are doing what they do within their DNA exactly theyre coming off of those wide pin downs and Baseline Cuts theyre curling it which is forcing the defender on a screener to help and their bigs are showing themselves and theyve been able to finish off of that pocket pass and me defensively theyve been terrific watch Ado Collins inside hand down really good rip nichel picks it up Baron with the finish I like this Virginia Tech Team like say well you know what what is this do to Virginia Tech it was an opportunity for Quad one win Virginia Tech is going to have a ton of opportunities for Quad one wins all right the castle is a brutal place to play theyre going to get Virginia back into Castle so like this is an opportunity do they wish they might have played a little bit better been a little bit tougher a little bit better with the basketball the turnover number once again obviously is an issue but Virginia Techs going to be just fine and the great thing about Mike young is hes the next play coach right hes going to learn from this game wipe the board clean get to the next play put the bandid on the problems and move Applause forward theres what you were talking about Coach the quad one matchups upcoming for the hokes and of course the goalpost move on this what is today a quad one game may not be when you get there but there are certainly quality opponents upcoming for the hes but as we talked about off the top I mean its not just these two teams of the ACC its spread around the country homec court advantage is very real everyones getting beat I mean I mean it just look each and every night were seeing it I mean eight of the top 10 teams in the country last week lost to teams that were unranked y think about that so there is a a certain sense of parody especially when you go on the road Virginia Tech is going to be just fine they got a great coach great leadership they got great locker room which is so important theyll be just fine genius played really well today crowd appreciates the pressure broken mcne to beakman blob it up to the rim and it backed in trying for an assist but you give two points to re beakman Applause Tony Bennett did you got to defend without fouling this time in the game so that you dont give virgin Tech the chance to set up that Applause Music pressure this is one of those games that you know you got to you got to have a shortterm memory because Virginia tes got to go to NC State NC States coming up that emotional win against Ray Forest you know learn from it move on lets get better and the one thing you cant have happen is uh you youve got to get to the next play because the games come fast and furious now you dont ignore the mistakes you address the mistakes and then you move on and you get ready to play the next game by the way the booze were because if nickel had Miss that free throw everybody in the building would have gotten bacon theres nothing wrong with bacon they wanted their bacon I mean who doesnt want their bacer makes a couple of big free throws instead back to an eightpoint game have you been here when they had to give away to bacon I dont think Applause so but if an opponent misses consecutive free throws bacon for everybody so if someone goes to the bench and you know Virginias up big I mean do you give the foul on that guy to maybe maybe you get some bacon yeah if youre Forward Thinking if you really like bacon of course well I mean just for the for the students right youre a man of the people you would have done that at fdu back in the day well do were big Crow at harv and P standing R only in the Rutherford gymnas now here is Dante Harris after missing the last 10 games with an ankle injury hes been practicing this week but from what we were told it was with some limitation they werent sure what they would get out of him tonight but he has played tonight Seth as though he has no limitations padulla creates space and hits the three its a fivepoint Applause game its good no call good no call really good play by padulla not not a good no call and thats not a good no call now I see on the big screen I didnt see it was kind of blocked that watch his right arm thats thats thats a clear out thats a foul it is so hard to on the ball you can get a charge today off the ball taking a charge you cant that that thats an offensive foul no doubt about it watch the extension of the arm you can be moving as long as youve established position but because none of the three guys in strike blew their whistle its not a foul the big shot allows the hes to pull within five that is you know what that is a very valid point thats why you are who you are I cannot argue with that stting the obvious Im good at that so now the hokes as weve said what 10 times tonight just hanging around hanging around can they steal this one with a minute to go and there have been times and I can speak of the past where Virginia has struggled with pressure well padulla in the midst of his great scoring stretch stretch of his career is on another mini heater here having scored eight of the last 10 points for the hokes and Mike young who said to us we got to stop throwing the blank balll away exploited its good to hear him say one of those uh 15 turnovers and Padulas got seven of them after his six the last time out so thats still a recurring problem no doubt cuz you cant give Virginia extra Applause possessions against the pressure mcney barely gets it to Groves who saves it back to mcney they dont have to foul and now they get it into the hands of the man they want with it back to beakman alone in the corner and the foul there you have to thats good given by Hunter Couture they had a shot at really good job on ATT get to First trap r trying to get one more trap over half court then you give the foul but eventually Tony Bennetts Club got it into the hands of their All Conference Point Guard ree beakman who stands at the free throw line 76 free throw shooter your senior you want the ball in his hands leads the league in assists assist to turnover ratio makes good decisions makes his free Music Applause throws you saw a little bit of a light bul because you know talking to Tony before the game he was excited about the potential of his team and the work they were doing with him but Im not even sure he saw this although he did say they had really good profits great play off the done block Here Comes roie giving it to D that might have done it Couture the quick answer at the other end 28 seconds on the Applause clock if Im Tony Bennett I really feel like weve taken a step for now here heres the deal its your investment equals your expectation but then you get to go validate wins you know when you play in League especially youve got to turn around and youve got to go validate wins so you have this win you take it and youve got to build on it still a sevenpoint game Collins for three Harris he went out of bounds and was nudged after Couture had picked up his fourth personal foul this is number two on padulla so they will walk to the other end for more free throws now people will look and say well Virginia you know you know UVA got to the line 14 times but all those fouls would basically come uh at the end of this game neither of these teams foul a whole Applause lot just a good basketball game and you know what the game back at the castle is going to be a good basketball game cuz that place will be rocket the great thing thats happened at Castle Coliseum its it might be you can talk about great venues in the ACC might be the best home court in the ACC yeah I think there are a lot of folks who would say that haris able to barely get one out of two padulla pulls the trigger roie grabs it shot clock is off and Virginia is going to be allowed to dribble it out in the latest Commonwealth Clash Virginia takes down Virginia Tech and the nations longest active home board winning streak is now 20 in a row thats really impressive and as impressive
