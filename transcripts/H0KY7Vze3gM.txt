Duke is the tallest team in the country and we are set for a outstanding game we think tonight air from Cameron and Applause D G Diaz Graham will give it up here Gman Corin is 610 in his own right but the guard play for the pit Panthers is off the charts Le it shot CL down to six Dukes defense has been nothing short of suffocating all season long and it will force the first Miss tonight well and the goal for Dukes defense throughout this game is going to be to keep both jayen low and ishma leet out of the painted areas we get a look at Dukes starting five seon James that won the last seven games with him at the point and you see him dropping the dime to malawat malawat with a man finish averaging eight points by five rebounds the game and look at the pit starting lineup we talk about those guards now legged and low they combine for 35 points a game but Cory theyre also great rebounding guards absolutely youre considering one of the best rebounding guards in the league when you think about ishma leet and then of course jayen low at the top of the charts when it comes to assist man once again Duke collapsing in at paint on the wing Proctor got it from thiro l nothing stuck for the Duke Blue Applause Devils Obi can you tell that this is a big game the camera craz and not that there arent always loud however theres some extra juice in the building here tonight recognizing that it undefeated Panthers team who beat the Blue Devils on this floor last year posed a significant threat G Diaz Graham will Swit that one in from long range and he found the touch in the last game out against Stanford at home knock down a couple of Threes in that one and starting to play much more confident at that Center position James outstanding passer Dukes been passing the ball exceptionally well theyre averaging 21 assists the last three games and that one will be knocked down by James on Q the 66 gr to make it eight to three nothing better than knocking down to three right in front of the opposing teams bench as theyre talking to you Theon James having the opportunity just to turn around and have a little conversation back with the pit bench just a little chitchat dke coming in number four pit unranked but they are knocking on the door of the top 25 yesterday they got the most votes of any team that did not get into the pole shot clock of factor down to two nice shovel and the dunk by cor and when you see Duke switching jayen low is still going to try to attack Cooper flag even in Hell position unable to keep low out of the painted area where he gets his first dime of the game see why Cameron corins hitting a team High 68 thats where his shots come from and it will given that up the corner shot and round it out marots only shooting 25 from Beyond a threepoint Arc but is capable of making those shots L with a onehander off the iron rebound tipped around malat comes out of there with it kiple wants to push the tempo hes averaging about 12 a game flags first one of the night offt Target the Pittsburghs a good team they were picked to finish number five in now 18 team ACC Duke of course number one and theyve been playing like it on the drive lean rebound comes out Music High I get only 30 beyond the threepoint line the guards do many things well getting threes not necessarily one of them that is one tough shot pretty much everything has been so far for pit but give malawa tremendous credit for doing a great job staying in front of lean and forcing that tough shot hard for his a guard to do that let alone a 72 guy James in tight and that one knocked away opening minutes and a good Pace here Duke on top eight to five its been a great Pace early to start this one off Pittsburgh has survived the early Rush on the Blue Devils however weve got 40 minutes at hand here notorious do be were back in Music Action Dr Richard an associate professor of medicine neurology du director of and chief of Neurology ofp patients and and was

basketball is brought to you by Disneys Mufasa The Lion King in theaters everywhere right now Cory you and I have seen it so many times Duke starts to put that hammer down early and run away they were trending that way a couple of minutes ago then pit put up a stop sign they absolutely were when you consider knocking down their first two threepoint field goals and the momentum in their favor especially in this building however theres no one that can prepare a team more so with the environment that theyre going to see than the young man on the Pittsburgh sideline Jeff capable who spent four years as a starter here under Coach K Im sure something he talked to his team about was surviving and taking that first punch and responding kle bottled up inside got the shot up but it clangs off the iron coach Kay actually sat with Jeff Cable in his practice earlier today came downstairs from his office to see a guy play for him coached for him as well theyre still very very close I think when he sees you Cables going to come up to give you a huge hug cuz you refer to him as that young man thats exactly thats my thats my little brother right there so hes always going to be a young man to me even though hes getting you know Wise in his years low harassed on the scoop that wont go straight on kle got a good look that wont Applause drop freshman had some outstanding games at 18 points five assists against Georgia Tech eight assists against Kansas he can really dish it Coach K in the house as well Corin gave it up tapped out and hell keep it on this end theres the legend in the building and he doesnt come to a lot of games however when hes got one of his former players on the opposing sideline or a coach often times he will show up and making an appearance here this evening to make sure he gets a chance to see Jeff capable who spent seven years not only playing the four years for spent seven years beside him as an assistant coach call flipped to Duke heres flag good luck and swishes in a triple hes been shooting the basketball extremely well OB that was the one thing that so many people questioned about Cooper Flack how well does he shoot the basketball how well does he score shooting over 50 from three coming into this one over his last four games perfect two for two against SMU on Saturday so Duke already four made baskets on four assists and thats been how their offense has been clicking for several games now really dishing it well and a big time block and also a whistle on the play with 1419 to go as James got up there but back to flag its a name that you will hear so much youve already heard so much about but you see him doing it on both ends of the floor offensively knocking down to three then coming over denying the opportunity from cam corn and now K picks up the frustration foul after getting his shot blocked but Cooper averaging one and a half blocks per game which is leading this Duke team once again he leads in all five major statistical categories not sure weve seen that at this Duke at this level Austin flicking that one out of play Duke will retain possession the defense has just been incredible for Duke allowing only 59 points a game Ken pom has him as the number one defense in the country Mike young the Virginia Tech head coach say the best defense hes seen in his six years in the league thats how good Duke is playing right now on the defensive Applause side Austin from the corner In and Applause Out pit has missed their last six shots poked away to midcourt a Scramble for that and now good job stepping in by Austin Austin to the Baseline got airborne and draw the one thing for certain the Panthers are not going to back down and we mentioned the fact that they won here last year youve got a number of guys that took part in that you consider the point guard jayen low ishmail Leed Zack Austin the back court for this Panther team they understand what it takes to come in here and get a win because theyve done it before and looking to solidify that they are one of the best teams in the ACC by coming in here and trying to knock off the blue doubles up and in by Austin and tomorrow night on ESPN 2 really good mens basketball double header beginning at seven number 23 Old Miss in fville squaring off against Arkansas and Hunter Dickinson and number 11 Kansas will take on Arizona State at Allen Fieldhouse 117 Duke and the ball a pit was down 16 in the first half in their last game they Roar it back to beat Cal the swing and Evans off Target rebound knocked away still big battle for that in the paint it came free and the whistle here with 1326 to go in the half and a reach and a foul on that play foul will go on seon James with Brad out of Sugar Hill Jord he will pick up the Music personal Caleb Foster in as Applause well pit coming to Cameron with the same record as duke also unbeaten in the early going in the ACC having won five straight pit has not faced the schedule that Duke has few have actually straight on pretty good looking there by leot but a foul great to have you with us tonight real pleasure to be inside Cameron indor another sellout anticipated here Dave OBrien and Cory Alexander and two teams that are considered right now obviously Duke the only team that is ranked in the conference inside the AP Top 25 but pit is knocking on that door to get in the top 25 pit is absolutely a team that could represent the ACC in the NCAA tournament but also can challenge these Blue Devils for the ACC champ Championship they are that good if not the best back court in the league one of the best back courts in the league when you consider not only low and Leed but getting Damen done back in this game now on the floor whos another double figure score for them that theyve missed over the past month duns been out for seven games going back to November 24 had a thumb injury he also had an ankle injury the thumb injury required surgery this is about the earliest he was going to get back into the Fret working on restricted minutes tonight and another foul thatll go against Cooper flag thats number two on flag and now Cooper flag picking up that second foul still 1230 remaining in this first first half John Shire going to have to take Cooper out of this one and well see how the Blue Devils respond theyve stalled on the offensive end of the floor still sitting on 11 points right now so its been a little bit more of a struggle for the Blue Devils and give pit a lot of credit for getting the job done defensively leg get to put it in at 21 against Stanford the all can be very explosive 27 against Cal at 28 against Ohio State inside for two and one of the things that Chris Carwell doing the Scout today he told this Blue Devil group Zen low is going to get into the paint we dont want him to but its going to happen and he is Relentless attacking getting downhill putting so much pressure on this Duke defense well tip of the cap to the pit defense Duke has gone one for they last 10 shooting Applause it up top brown Syracuse transfer Evans the youngster he was harassed couldnt get that lay in to go on the run the pit Panthers want to push the tempo Austin knocked away from him kle good look around and out he could have asked for much more than that no cans got a number of good looks unable to knock them down early in this game and now Duke still continues to struggle on the offensive end of the floor opportunity for pit to tie or even take a lead with the three here 1120 remaining malawat getting ready to check back in for the Duke Blue Devils jumper on the way by Austin yes and he can be really good beyond that threepoint line hes at 45 on that Arc shooting the basketball extremely well now back into the starting lineup he was coming off the bench before dun was injured but now finding himself in position to where he may be able to hang on to that starting spot playing so well so far its been about P weathering the storm on a couple of occasions early Eric Cameron had to reaching foul mod Diaz Graham the sevenfooter will pick up the personal CER flag in foul trouble right now but his career off to a great start at Duke Music fans our to videoo Music Applause Applause now unest experi Happ OB in todays game the most important position especially in positionist basketball is a playmaker a playmaker is made up of a number of different factors someone that can facilitate of course a guy that can go out and gets you a bucket and one that also makes plays on the other end of the floor defensively Cooper flag has all three of those characteristics which makes him not only a playmaker but maybe the best playmaker in college basketball 32o games in ACC play and a historical note on him the first 17yearold in NCAA history with multiple 20o double doubles its recently turning 18 on December 21st so was able to come up with three of those double doubles 20 20 and 10 double doubles before his 18 birthday Diaz Graham will pick up his second foul as mentioned two for Cooper flag so both of those guys in some early trouble Le Cel Brian oconnell Pat Driscoll our fine officiating crew here tonight at Applause Cameron Gillis on the wing up top for Proctor around on the back Nifty mooves slicing inside cant convert rebound Pops to the corner for the pit p and we talked about pit surviving that first punch by the Blue Devils and now has really been the momentum in favor of the Panthers even though both these teams scoring much lower than their normal rate pit would prefer to have it at their Pace 7even nothing run at the moment for pet theyre going to throw that one away very few turnovers in the early going just two now for ped Duke with only one but both these teams even though theyre very good offensive teams hang their hat on the defensive end of the floor and when you talk to both these coaches of course who learned from the same gentleman how important defense is they did it on the court playing for Coach K and also coaching alongside them they have gotten their message across to their respective team blue doubles with eight straight wins including a December win here Cameron against number two Auburn getting inside for a flush notat all by himself knows exactly what to do with it he has four early points the fifth youngest player in division one basketball of course coopa flag the second youngest so youve got two of the top five youngest players and theyre getting better and better each and every timeout OB Mal by the way with a 98 standing reach almost touches the rim in a standing position shot clock again down to three on the drive and the spin cmings and a whistle but we Big Time bailout we talked about how good this pit back court is as we get an opportunity on the other end to see malow watch with great hands and then the ability to be able to finish avoiding jayen low but part of the reason why this pit back court is so good youve got this young man Brandon Cummings who comes off the bench now his one game he started made 53 score 15 points against Cal at home but he get a bucket coming off the bench understands his role and goes to work immediately when he comes in a very good individual player oneonone as we saw in the last possession but also can play off the basketball away from it catch and shoot tyes Proctor fouled him to put him at the line he makes 76 out of Midland Pennsylvania had a 30point game against Eastern Kentucky so he can Applause explode so its Pit by one much giv up the dribble KB Foster shot clock inside 10 now for Duke shot clock down to four illis on the Move Slams on the braks and converts what a luxury it is to have a young man that played in the national championship game a year ago transfer in to come off the bench and give you that veteran experience with so many young players on this Duke roster hes a guy who can can shoot the ball very well beyond that threepoint line hes been scuffling this year 28 he gets rolling though he can be something else OB look at how the Duke Defenders are in the Gap but it still doesnt matter Jaylen low is that good even when youre in gaps he finds the the SE to be able to get to the painted area picking up another foul as you see low going in and of course no ones going to like that call in this building but you see two hands in the back from canle John shy not happy about it but the two hands in the back is going to be an automatic call Le C right on top of it so the 67 freshman canip little bit of a grin there from Coach K he wouldnt have been doing that on this sideline he would not after that play they it got bottled up and they throw it away again that crunching D for the Blue Devils three turnovers for the pit Panthers defensively both these teams are absolutely on a string theres never movement without one of their help Defenders moving to the basketball part of the reasons why they both do a great job forcing turnovers even though this has been a relatively clean game hit giving one away on that possession James slanting inside and knocked Away Big Time block there by Cory and hit Gillis with five and hes come off the bench to give the Blue Devils a nice lift and thats the thing Cooper flag gets two fouls where do you go you go find one of your veterans on the bench that can come in and give you a lift its been Mason Gillis already here this Applause evening CH and low trying to get going 17 points a game the back court has been Sensational hes going to be on the line and a turnover for pit so 1814 Duke Mason Gillis coming off the bench already got a layup now knocks down the three ball to extend the lead to four for Duke here on their home floor taking on The Undefeated p Music in SCH Applause Applause only basket Applause e Music Applause Music well Cory pit as we go back to last year theyve had success in this building they absolutely have Blake Henson had a huge performance seven of seven from Beyond the threepoint Arc celebrated to the greatest extent after this game when you consider that Duke went to pit a week prior and blew them out on a Tuesday night up there Blake Henson got his revenge of course stood on the table much of the shr of the Cameron crazies but jayen low 17 points six assists zero turnovers in that game his first here at Cameron indor Stadium Jeff cable year number seven for the pit Panthers the Duke Alami felt that his team was really snubbed by the NCAA selection committee last year but you want to make sure you get in come to Duke and win a game right in January canle off the iron oh knocked away but count that basket thatll be go tending and K malawat has been a big time factor in this one weve seen him with a number of finishes up front now up to six points for him but he is been the guy that has really helped stabilize Duke on the offensive end the floor not shooting the basketball well only eight of 22 from the field but four of 10 from Beyond the threepoint AR Mal from South Sudan did not start playing basketball till he was 13 but by last year he was representing his native South Sudan in the Paris Olympic tipped up two times rebound hauled in by James remember flag on the bench with two fouls GLE long range got it he buries a three he cant continue to allow him to have those looks missed his first two got great looks but knocks down the third one to extend the lead to nine for Duke here on their home floor 10 nothing run a Music Applause well Duke with their biggest lead here in the first half 234 kipple with a great look absolutely buries that one coach Kay in the house and of course one of his pupils they both loved it different ways of expressing it at the moment one loved it a little more than the other got to be tough a Coach K to sit over there I mean especially when youve got Jeff on the other side its one thing you know for him to be the come to a game and its all du but Jeff is one of his own actually at one point actually went across to the camera craz it was getting on Jeff cable a few years back and told him cut it out hes one of ours actually said those words hes one of us not tonight though right A P heres Diaz grah will knock that one down from threepoint land yeah thats Jorge the older of the twins who has been shooting the basketball well as of late also yeah hes 12 out of 20 from threepoint territory kle trying to go over the top and a foul inside the lane against the pit Panthers here exactly 6 minutes to go before the break number two South Carolina highlighting our next ESPN 2 featured womens basketball matchup they take on Texas AM Thursday at 5 from Colonial Life Arena in in Columbia the Gamecock won five in a row 12 out of 13 from the agies Tina powpow spent time with her this summer at the Nike Academy and she is an elite shooter one of the things that da Staley needed after losing to Caitlyn Clark in the final four two years ago went and got powp now in her second year looking to repeat as a national champion with South K great confident shooter yes as well Cooper flag backing with the two fouls for Duke and the Blue Devils to put it in at the Baseline hi on the drive lost his balance and gave it away Duke with a rare turnover here in the first Applause half jayen L the sopore who has a dke connection absolutely does his Godfather is the first ever point guard to be drafted number one in the NBA as canle gets a look KN down his Music second and Duke opens it up 2617 but jayen Lows Godfather the first ever point guard to be drafted number one overall in the NBA happens to be John Lucas a Durham native and so coach Lucas was going to make his way up to this game but the weather did not permit that to happen but coach Lucas also has a son on the Duke bench Jay Lucas so whos the god brother of jayen low so some connection here between the two like it with a basket on the other end to close it to Applause 2619 black looking for some movie Applause Proctor thought about it the drive and kick canle yes some on the triple he has nine youve heard it before OB it only takes a spark to start a fire I believe the fire is going right now Co and nipple knocking down three consecutive threepoint field goals to push the lead out to 10 for the BL great basketball family his mom and dad both play college basketball they combined for about 4000 points slendering in Corin gets a bucket oh so so his scoring I mean that thats hereditary when you think about that he he might be the the least of the scores when that bu you talking about parents combining for four grand thats a lot of points th points between the two of them proor drives and swatted Away orge Diaz gr with the block 349 to go here in the first half for Cameron indor may not be the best score in his family but so far hes been the best score in this game back to back to back threepoint field goals for KH canle as hes allowed the Blue Devils to push ahead here as Jay Lucas loves watching what hes Music seeing e e e e e oh Applause Kev thank you guys look forward to that Duke with the inbounds in a quick whistle I love Tom greedy goes hes open and thats got to be fixed thats got to be fixed thats a coach talking to you got to fix that absolutely and the other coach talking about trusting Cooper flag John Shire has called Cooper a saon he understands how intelligent of a basketball player he is wise Beyond his years and so hes going to trust Cooper to go out there and of course knowing his role and his importance to this team to make sure he does everything he can to stay away from that third foul however Cooper is so aggressive especially on the defensive end of the floor often times his instincts are going to put him in positions so Im not sure well see Cooper play the remainder of this first half if Im coach shy I may want to try to you know get him in and out of there at times Malik Brown making one of two done with the foul and pit with a basketball less than four minutes to go in the first half the students are here in Forest at Cameron indor classes dont begin until tomorrow but the kids are here tonight they wouldnt miss this for anything not at all especially after the Panthers won here a season too and coming in with an undefeated record in ACC play this is a huge game on so many different levels especially for pit because theyre not a lot of quality wins available for you in the ACC this season take advantage of them when you can good defense there by Corin popping in NS that free Austin going airb hes traveling with it not not great spacing on the break on that possession right there both guys on the same side not balancing the floor ends up being a turnover the fast bre and you know the work our man Dicky V does with that great heart of his and his Gala coming up in May for tickets go to that address right now that is one lovely looking Carle for that Dicky V switched it up it used to be a Mercedes he went to the drop BMW this year lovely okay over the top Applause on the run here comes lean lean into the paint done on the drive took a little bit of a hit there shot will be around and out coren cant find the range and its Duke by nine malawat racing to the ram but off the fingertips as they went for the alley great Rotation by Zach Austin to be able to get over there and disrupt that and now if your cam corn you got to go right through Cooper flags body understanding hes got those two fouls dont let him off the hook fading away from the sprm and uple crosscourt got a wide open shooter but cant drain it and a whistle and a foul Proctor couldnt hit it from long range and the foul will go against Duke malow watch with the personal and its one and one time Sion James coming in in the Auburn game starting at the point guard position transferring in from Tain Obie I spent time with him at the CP3 Camp earlier and the CP3 Camp was combined with the Jason Tatum Elite Camp so Im thinking this is a small forward coming in 66 220lb point guard mhm and so but he really been a breath of fresh air to the starting lineup for the blue Dev was and not that Caleb Foster was playing bad but he gives them a different dimension from The Experience standpoint also on the defensive end of the floor point guard who had tane averaged 34 minutes a game for four years scored over 1000 points hauled in 500 rebounds and that leadership of his is very integral when you think about the young team youre already starting three freshman with this group Gillis a little too strong and a whistle here a late whistle here to go against the Duke Blue doubles and thats going to be the second on malawat so that late whistle results in Kam on malawat having to come sit down is Malik Brown will check in immediately for him and it was a foul the problem was about when it was called it was once Le it went down that the whistle blew and of course right in front of the Cameron crazies thats never going to be a popular call here Cameron IND you like 1 1000 2 1000 you know when is that coming back to back Miss free throws on one inone opportunities for the Panthers and points have been hard to come by its a team that averages 84 points a game OB right now theyre a quarter of the way to their season average talked about the Duke defense suffocating its been a turnover here forced by pit however sloppy play by low down the lane somehow got it free to leg it his pass in stuff by Corin and thats the way you finish if youre Cameron Corin thats the way you go to the basket nothing soft around the rim finish like that every opportunity and give your chance a your team a chance to be successful here on the road 113 to go before the break 3023 Duke Music now pit with a big stuff moments ago but this is not how they drew this up Cory well you know OB often times its about the result not how you get there Jaylen low stumbling down the floor ish leer falling out of bounds but finds Cameron Korn who goes up and finishes strong to make it a sevenpoint game 113 remaining Here and Now Duke has turned it over more than the panther so Duke with theyre just reaching stretch a number of turnovers that have cost them however they still hold on to a sevenpoint lead approaching one minute remaining here in the first half bounce speed flag with a left tenus you often hear the screener is the guy thats going to get open Cooper flag heading two screens on that and then the nice quick roll to the rim Malik Brown finding him for the easy one BL has been a lot of this first step on the bench foul difficulty has five Applause points leg it looking to spin and fall away and that wont drop seconds to go thats the point of emphasis of Dukes defense make you have to take a tough tested twopoint shot if you make that great tap you on the back and say great job but often times it ends up being a opportunity for Duke to go down the score on the other end Brown gives away the dribble going up off the fake flag with shot clock down to two got to get one in the air and conip with one and the shock clock draws the foul hit on the lower body as he tried to wle free for a better looking shot 87 before halftime and immediately getting Cooper flag out of the game after kiple shoots these free throws but Cooper once again recognizing the shot clock going down getting the basketball in the hands of kiple allowing him to be able to try to make a play late in the shot clock gets to the free throw line and you should have seen how quickly Chris Carwell jumped up I didnt know CC still had it in him of course ACC player of the year was a great play but was moving quickly up to John Shire letting him know hey Cooper with two fouls lets get him out on a defensive possession Chris Carwell the associate head coach got the W in there last got his first win congratulated him earlier today he got his first win as a head coach with the Blue Devils sh was out sick and John sh said I love my staff yes and and how much trust he has in this staff he knew he did not have to worry about them being successful at SMU on the drive Leed and a whistle with 19 to go and K canle coming over there now thats an area of concern for the Blue Devils Cameron Korn going to the offensive glass coming up with that second chance opportunity as you see Leed unable to finish but as corn comes in kiple gets in the way stops the put back but still picks up the foul sending corn to the free throw line his second foul for 66 at the line so some really nice games but 19 seconds John S going to take the opportunity to get Cooper flag back on the floor for offensive possession theyre risking him picking up his third but 19 seconds yeah most likely hell be the inbounder on this trying to throw the ball full court to someone we might say that he could very well be the best passer on this Blue Devil team so why not get him in the game made the second oh no hes not going to be the inbounder 34 24 chance for a heave its tipped that one flung to the other end off the backboard by Diaz Graham pits lowest scoring first half of on their home floor 12 baskets on 10 assists for Duke flag gets a touch and knocks it down and a quick start for him in the second 20 he has seven when you get two fouls in the first half it lessens your aggressiveness you see Cooper flag coming out on the first possession hes going to be ultra aggressive here in this second half now that he can play free pull up one drop by low guards really have to get going if Pits going to have a shot flag running the floor cant convert he goes down at all fours an opportunity here for the Panthers to push it leg it slicing in and a miss but look at that OB K kiple in great position to come our way with that rebound Cooper flag jumps over his teammate to go get it and you got to understand like as a player when you had to miss so much time in the first half especially having to sit and watch with those two fouls youre only thinking about what youre going to do when you get back on the floor trying to operate so many skills canect B cant connect one and done on that possession for Duke Leed jumping in the paint and flag got in there and deflected it on the other end quickly he recovered fast there are rebounders and then there are guys that go get it OB this is a guy that goes to get it cona nipple is in perfect position for a rebound however Cooper goes to get it a true rebounder goes against the basketball at his highest point and thats one of the reasons why hes averaging over eight rebounds per game has five so far in this one Jay low averaging 17 points can he begin to shoot it look at First Defense is just outstanding on the perimeter but a slam there by corn he got free inside thats the one area of concern offensive rebounding the second time the cam Corns been able to get in there and come away with the offensive board and that time is able to put it back for the slams nine points so far to lead the pit Panthers for 3 and0 in the ACC Duke 4 and0 and started to heat up late in the second half hell spin into the paint draw the foul and hell be heading to the line Duke doing the job defensively tyres Proctor bites on the pum fake but then gets back in position to contest to Zack Austin three but no one there to keep camc corn off the glass comes up with his second offensive rebound and put back L foul number two can put a 96 foul shooter had missed only one this season before that one he was 24 for 25 I waited until after he took the shot you did you did the right thing Obie you didnt even put that out there no one can blame you for that yeah give him 12 points hes had a solid game came in averaging 12 I me one of the things that Duke has really done theyve slowed down Pittsburgh picks a team that likes to play Fast theyve got the fastest point guard in ACC and J the low but they normally get up and down the floor quickly they unable to do that Duke has set their defense very well and now forces another turnover trying to get into the painted area oh well theyre going to change their mind on this and I love watching college basketball players look at the coaches and as if theres a challenge theres no challenge in college basketball and now they just showed the replay yeah that only made it worse I think they got it right the first time actually theres a foul they going to get flag here and thatll be number three if its on him and indeed thats the case but look what the Miss call results in that was a that was a turnover that basketball should have gone to Duke as you watch iSell Leed go no one else touches the basketball that should have been going the other direction and what ends up being the result of that is Cooper flag picking up his third foul on the only down bounds play quite a turn around there they got it right the first time and picked off flag on the attack with a slam and a b oh my how about that one Cooper flag Airborne for the slam yikes James is amazed every Bud he was deaz Graham with the foul and now its up to 40 to 26 Cooper flag with a sensational Applause slam thats a big time punch to the solar plexus well see if the pit Panthers react appropriately leet wants to get in close and he finishes that the Panthers are going to continue to try to attack get downhill get into the painted area ish Leed jayen L they live in the paint havent had a lot of success getting to the rim but Le able to get one to go on the last possession black and he top what he just did a moment ago into the line another the slam this time a twohander holy cow well when he went to New York at the age of 16 and started doing stuff like that on a legendary Court everybody was amazed now hes doing it in division one college basketball long range and that one off the front of the iron rebound ripped down by James and at this point Cooper flag is a guy that plays the right way hes not going to go heat check but it is absolutely Heat check time for two in right James will draw the foul as he is knocked to the deck with 1607 to go I mean Cooper flags already had some moments in this freshman year but hes had a couple in this second half that I think topped them absolutely when you consider going off the bounce recognizing the mismatch going to be difficult for G Mo Diaz Graham to guard him on the perimeter and then as he Im sure were going to see that later on sports top 10 highlight more than once James to the paint spoted away Corin with the stop dun from 19 will swish it in he can get heated up he started their first six games got injured but hes hting 53 of his threepointers he can be a real turnaround guy and hes playing on a minutes restriction right now of course coming back to his home state so a big game for him to be able to come here and play a Cameron indor and to make sure he has the best showing he possibly can jam slicing in denied D will get a second chance over the top and a whistle 1527 to go duke on top by 12 423 for e e e Rucker Park in New York City this is Cooper flag now only 16 years old on this court where Legends are made and OB you know the saying in New York City if you can make it here you can make it anywhere thats the basketball world thats what the Rucker Park is if you can get it done in the Rucker you can get it done anywhere 60 points for Cooper flag at the Rucker however Im not sure that can match the two highlights that weve seen from Cooper here in this second half alone as you look back at the numbers from his historic day at the slam summer classic volume six a couple of seasons ago of course you saw all the stars Dylan Harper Ace Bailey in the mix there but Cooper was the star of star that night and he has been that the same here in the second half Dr J L Alor before he became kareim Abdul Jabar look at the list of guys who have put on legendary performances on that court and of course my guy Peewee Kirkland whos not on the list but has legendary Tales from getting the job done at the Rucker youre fighting for Peewee Flag by the way seven of duks eight points and second half before that one and Duke opens up a 433 lead this is Ralph flag checking it out and of course Coopers grandfather Dan Bowman over there checking it out Kelly his mom unable to be here cuz shes with his twin brother ace at his game at Greensboro day today so that Dad and Granddad coming here checking out the show been a show twoo here in the second half car Cooper flag was real quiet in the first half sitting on that bench with the fouls shot clock down to seven here and TI out down to eight and tipped with 1505 to go here in the second half and again pit has not tasted a loss in ACC Applause play blow with a pull up GRE it thats the guy thats going to have to get going for pit to have some success he had a big game here a season ago 176 assist zero turnovers and hes been able to put up big numbers throughout this season had 27 and eight against Cal a couple couple of games ago they need him to be aggressive to have success here on the road youre right if its going to happen for pit theyre going to come back their guards are going to lead a canle down the lane nice adjustment to lay it in great job by KH nipple recognizing the defender trailing him on the screen so knowing he would have a route to the basket so first five minutes 11 points four out of nine forcing four turnovers so they came out roaring defensively leg it shot clock at eight steps back beyond the three and cant hit Applause it and a reach and a foul thatll be committed by Jaylen low 63 sophomore from Texas and for him number three so hes in some trouble with 14 minutes to go yeah we talked about the importance of Cooper flag for the Duke Blue Devils however that Pals in comparison to how important it is to have Jaylen low on the floor for pit he is the engine especially on the offensive end for them flag leaning in follows his own Miss and down it goes but those are the characteristics youre talking about the second jump right there Cooper knows that the first shots not going in he is already in the air attempting the second jump before anyone else can even leave the floor suddenly has 14 points and six of 10 shooting and he cant save it the lunge by low but he couldnt keep it in so thatll be turned over to Duke and now the fifth Force turnover by the Blue Devils here in the second half pitch starting to fall apart a little bit losing their composure now down 14 and continue to give the basketball away something that Jeff Cables team can ill afford here on the road you made the point they are a good offensive team they came in averaging 84 points a game hitting about 50 collectively as a team real good team but they had not run into Duke yet flag will flip it James and weve got an issue Zack Austin Zach Austin looking yes this can made a shot Austin writhing in pain in the back court oh man you hate to see Applause that young man whos had so much success this year for Pittsburgh such an important part guarding flag in UC see that right shoulder hes senior and coming back home to North Carolina iss from Winston Salem thats a strange play me to get injured on that and reaching for that shoulder and he is remaining down on his back Zack Austin the 67 senior good to see him getting back up and well see if he can continue even better to see him moving that right arm a little bit but OB I can tell you right now I am involved in so many text chain arguments regarding Cooper flag I am a believer and I have a lot of people who may not be and I ask one simple question to them after watching this game are you not entertained this young man has put on an absolute show here second half and we knew he was going to come out aggressive the first possession goes to him he knocks down the midrange jumper and he has been all gas no breaks ever since here in this second half Im trying to Im trying to understand what the counterargument would be oh believe me theyre so much out there hes not a scorer hes not an elite athlete I can tell you what he is he is a great not good a great basketball player now P needs a counter they need a hot hand right now and it might start right there on the jumper by done we talked about how good he can be beond that threepoint line give him five points and we talked about him back home playing his first game in over a month in his home state so of course wants to have a strong showing Here and Now with Zack Austin going down willll get much more of an opportunity flag a double nice pass and thatll be finished by James but a terrific pass by FL to say a strong finish by seon James would kind of be redundant countered because everything he does is strong but goes right through the chest of Diaz Graham who has a 5 in advantage over him in the paint Duke looking pretty comfortable right now approaching the 12minute Mark here in the second half done again cant finish that one rebound tapped in controlled by pit and slapped out of play by Malik Brown Damen dun locating showing off that soft shooting touch you mentioned how well he shot the basketball from three and then on the other end we talked about Cooper Flags bille ability to find his teammates simple cut after being double team by seon James getting into the open spot and finishing in the painted area the flag leading Duke in scoring rebounding assist Steals and block shots what else is there not too darn much and thats for the season and before the shot in the block a shove and a foul now who knows if that if he maintains that of course Kaman malawat could possibly catch him in Block shots there are a number of guys seon James with steals there are a number of guys kind of on his heels but right now hes leading in all five major statistical categories Obie I reached out to Grant Hill earlier today and I asked him did you do this your senior year and he said no Cherokee was hating on me with the rebounds of the Bron F comes away with a loose ball spinning in that l Lane spinning to the other side and draws a foul and well take the timeout Under 12 Duke on top 5236 second half has been the Cooper flag Music show e e just it is City the first time in 2025 e Applause Music ke thank you very much and Duke at the line here leading 550 2 to 36 I wonder if KC was over there singing his best DJ call songs before he came over there another one think best is a relative term right thats it thats it OB knows the notorious d o knows his DJ call we the best one of two and 15 points and Duke on top 5336 in a real danger zone for pet it is and what look at seon James picking up 94 ft understanding still the importance of his team playing well in this moment not letting their foot off the gas at all Leg its had a tough night came in averaging 18 pass got there but a foul stops the clock the guys back in the studio talking about Southeastern Conference and what a be trap every game is you and I have Alabama Texas AM coming up on Saturday its going to be fun getting into the SEC which has had an historic nonconference slate something we yet to see in college basketball this week six of the top 10 teams in the country in the SEC however we got a pretty good one here skipping in the lane got the pass free to leg it cant cash in and a foul here against pit they going to get done going in two strong and hell pick up his third yeah we will March to the other end to shoots and this is where Cooper flag has really been starting to come on at the free throw line was 8 of eight from the line against SMU on Saturday so to go along with his abilities to start making threepoint field goals now hes becoming much more a score and of course all great scores get to the free throw line and take advantage of those opportunities hes 79 Duke is a team 75 pit makes 78 and a miss is that my fault did I do that no I dont think that thank you thank you youre off the hook as far as Im concerned because you have nothing to do with it why our producer Kev Belton is not letting me off but I appreciate you doing so in close gets another basket give him seven but pit needs a long run and they need jayen low they need its Leed they need production from this Elite backt that they have that has not been able to get on track here against the steni Duke defense James working at 66 LS it hes strong hes super strong in the painted area but more importantly you cant go down there and trap him because hes got Shooters all around him on the perimeter so therefore youre fearful of going in and send another body because he sprays it out to the other guys L will knock that one down and a timeout so Jeff capable wants to take one here and assess with Duke on top 5541 another out here at Cameron indor Applause Applause Music Music know now C flag earlier tonight with one of the dunks of the year over Diaz Graham thats over 7footer look at the reactions here the reaction was great but OB I have a question when you consider the fact that twins often feel each others pain do you think Jorge felt the pain of G Mo being on the wrong side of that poster as we get a chance to see both guys sitting and talking to each other Im not even related and I felt their pain yes wow that was the problem is hes going to see it so much longer thats going to be on every highlight reel right every commercial moving forward for the remainder of this season tune in again and sports center top 10 if you want to see that you can wait for one thats right pit comes away with a loose ball down 55 41 Evans open air mail that one the rebound however up and in by Corin and Corin had a productive after the evening here I spent his third offensive rebound and put back but again Brandon Cummings with a very good look a breakdown defensively by Duke kalea fer left a very good shooter wide open but Cummings unable to get it to go and of course for the Panthers theyre going to have to start knocking down some of those looks if theyre going to try to get back into this one James from the corner and so up the threepoint Applause L helping off of the ballside corner is a mistake Im not regardless of what level youre playing at Cooper flag going downhill and that was easy pickings to find s James in the corner forgive me seon hes looking to make a move at the top of the key heres dun wed to take a triple at the foul line denied D has been outstanding a long jumper air mailed and hey shot CL violation but thats Dukes calling card you can see how connected this team is defensively build that wall in the painted area but more importantly when the pass goes out not conceding a wideopen look seon James getting out contesting the shot at the end of the shot clock so Duke by 15 coming up on eight and a half to go flag looking for a cutter and thrown away off the fingertips hummings going to try it a flips it up and in thats a nice move for two nice play by Cummings right there recognizing Cooper flag is going to attempt to block the shot he tries to go after everything Cummings more than willing to challenge flag and go with the reverse layups talented crushman averaging eight points a game for the pit Applause Panthers flag again lost it on the Run coming going in strong over Evans Ela its 11 o just like that now the Panthers taking Duke turnover turning him in the points on the other to the floor thats four straight points John S wants to talk about it 749 this game is far from over Duke getting sloppy here down the stretch and pit taking advantage of it Brandon Cummings with the beautiful Left Hand reverse to get it closer Music Music for e turn to the che sad e e kenpom has Dukes Defense number one in the country they are connected group OB you see when theres an open Lane multiple white jerseys coming over to Build That Wall to make sure they take away any easy opportunities but the defensive possession doesnt end once they stop it initially they take away the drive and then all of a sudden once you dribble to coffin corner there are two blue doubles there forcing the turnover and this is what makes Duke successful theyve turned it over a bit here over the last couple of possessions leading to a 40 Run for the Panthers allowing them to make this an 11point game well see where Duke goes here on the offensive end of the floor to try to settle things down yeah a couple of cracks lately and theyre going to turn over again Dukes lead was 17 its now down to 11 NBA Wednesday coming away with a countdown at 630 Thunder and Cavaliers at 7 burs and bucks at 930 on ESPN big game youve got the best in the west with the OKC Thunder the best in the league the Cleveland Cavaliers 31 and4 Big Time match up tomorrow night in the NBA trying to continue to cut in and the block malawat got up there high P got back quickly to recover and this is going the other way canle could not convert and no foul still plenty time left yeah K malawat has been switching on guards all day and doing the job defensively hes taken on the challenge of having to keep is legged as well as jayen low out of the painted area and hes won that match up more often than not throughout this Applause game long with a quick step Airborne no rebound tap back to him and a kick out he Cummings got a good open look couldnt hit it pits had their opportunities OB a basket there would have gotten this in the single digits where they havent seen that in quite some time throughout this game Tyrese Proctor he can hit a triple left alone hes going to be in the paint to shoot it and and its in and out and a foul on the floor malat takes the hit 72 freshman malw watch has been a Difference Maker in this game OB seven points for him only three or four from the field but seven rebounds now thats his second offensive rebound but hes got blocks and hes been a presence in the painted area that the Panthers have had to think about just as a live threat alone anytime he rolls to the rim youve got to take him away which means youre going to open up some for someone else on the perimeter Austin with the foul follow watch to the line 75 does he remind you of anybody in particular in terms of his development right now he reminds me of dwell embiid I remember watching dwell embiid at Kansas this one year and was playing alongside a number one pick and Andrew Wiggins and so when you look at a guy like malat he could follow a very similar path as what weve seen from Joel embi hes going to Contin to improve on his offensive game but what he does naturally running the floor Rim running blocking shots protecting the paint and his ability to switch out defensively this young man could be a staring all right at 15 and eight against Georgia Tech few more like that and performances like tonight and look out oh looking to penetrate and throws that one away P many a turnover and down 13 theyve kicked it over 11 times and another opportunity for the Panthers squandered away and when theyve had that momentum building off of turning Duke over they were able to get it going on the offensive end the backto back bucket heading into the timeout but havent been able to capitalize on offensive end since flag thinking about a triple underneath had it knocked away but the slam up and in on the watch with another basket give him 11 but Obi you mentioned his 98 standing reach he didnt have to jump very high to put that one back and that gigantic wingspan hes put to Great use here tonight on several occasions Applause defensively camon crazys in full throw here tonight and a shove as flag get hit hell be filed by jayen L number four OB weve had some signature moments in this building throughout of course the since it was in came into Inception in 1940 you go back and you look at it the Zion 360 against Clemson now the Cooper flag take off from the third hash mark against Pittsburgh will hang in lore with z Li DP yes people will remember that play for many many years to come when they think about their visit here to Cameron Indoor St I think they are going to remember this one tonight too I think youre right Diaz Graham right in his face he committed a foul on that play too so that wound up a threepoint play spectacular to say the least and Duke opening it up here 64 47 they have slowly been adding on it was a bit of a run a few minutes ago by pit but that has disappeared the leggings had an excellent season 18 points a game its just been rough sledding for him here tonight Bing with a misfire and here come the Blue Devils again with five minutes before the Applause end and flag will take his time Proctor up to set screen back out for Proctor and hes going to turn it over oh that Im not sure about that one because Proctor got rid of the basketball and coopa flag actually went to pick it up does he come down he doesnt come down and Coop so thats a pass Pat Drisco may be thinking that proor landed before he got rid of the basketball yeah Im with you I think in the end it was an ugly looking pass yes it wasnt pretty very awkward so Duke up Music Applause Music 6447 seion James set a really solid game have eight assists in their victory over SMU dish to flag looking to work yes tough to stop that and just a slight Flex even though cps not the strongest guy strong move for him right there still thin only 18 years old a fresh 18 but still plank strong in the paint low flings that one out back over to the blue doubles it goes 350 to play and its been a terrific second half here for Duke up 10 at the break and now leading at 66 47 Cooper flag and Company big second Music half e go Music Gos Gos go Applause strong strong Str Applause Music ah keev sounds warm sounds toasty unlike the rest of the country including right here in Durham temperatures in the 20s today yeah maybe that that walk from the car a little more difficult getting down to Cameron Indoor Stadium we need to toughen up a little bit but I mean its like its all of 100 yards but yeah I I know what you mean 6647 Duke in complete Command here in this ones second half has been been all Blue Devils and pit unable to make a long sustained run to really climb back in the game but pit will look back to where they had it at 11 in multiple opportunities to get to single digits turnovers cost them and unable to get it going and Duke was then able to stretch this lead out rolling and flag just lost the handle on that one low Off to the Races goes to the left hand great defense by James as he rolls up to the the benefits of having a 66 point guard you mentioned earlier Duke the tallest team in the country and they use that size that LM to deter opportunities to get deflections and to get the job done on the defensive end the floor got it from threepoint land Obie they worked on that and shoot around today and that was perfect execution you know theyre going to trap Cooper flag coming off the screen to roll he just drops an easy pass in the middle to James who becomes the playmaker in the middle of the painted area finding Proctor for the three ball oh with the bounce here for dun and dun cant hit it flag with the rebound if pit was going to come in here to Cameron indor and grab a win their guards were going to have to have tremendous performances Duke has shut off Leed and look they really have Duke has fetched their muscle in defensive end of the four show just how good they are on that end and how they can be a special team moving forward James shot clock inside five left it short no he didnt that went over the top of the back but its an illegal shot we watched Larry Bird do that back in the day go back then thats right would not have counted 209 to go thats a horse shot right there we thats one you always go to playing horse be a youre looking at me and saying you always go I never win you went there all the time I know you beat people all the time on that the key is to continue to look at the center of the rim regardless of whether theres a backboard in the way not get the arc over top of the backboard wish someone told me that when I was 13 under two done getting back into the swing of things thats good news for the pit Panthers theyve been missing for seven games with a couple of injuries hes going to be a big factor for them by pulling down another rebound and its all Duke he has 10 rebounds but Duke has stayed in the gaps they have not allowed the the the Leed the J drives to the rim where they have been able to be successful all season long du done a great job of keeping them out of the painted area and not allow him to be successful drive and up and in as Proctor sweeps in thats a 13 to nothing run showed you Cooper flag with another double double 19 and 10 and another impressive performance by Duke there on quite a run done with fire it up and miss and under a minute so Duke will win their ninth consecutive game they are firing on all cylinders right now and most impressive they were able to build a double digit lead going into the half with Cooper flag in foul trouble so it was everyone else that stepped it up and till Cooper took over here in the second half going around the back draws three heres Proctor open he kns in a threepointer now Proctor got hit its going to be interesting to see theyre going to go over and look at this Proctor got hit on the three theyre going to say as Lea cell Pat Driscoll and Bron o Connell are going to go over and look at this watch as he shoots the basketball dun comes out and Taps him and it was a light tap but it all is about where did the tap happen and you have said all you need to say on that one no question so they go over to the monitor here in the college football playoffs semifinals are on ESPN as you know Thursday Notre Dame taken on Penn State in the Capital One Orange bow at Hard Rock in Miami and on Friday its Ohio State squaring off against Texas in the Goodyear cotton bow classic at ATT stadium in Arlington both games kicking off at 730 Eastern 430 Pacific and OB I know youre a history guy we have history in the making you got two black coaches squaring off when you consider Penn State and Notre Dame which guarantees there will be a black coach coaching in the national championship game for the first time ever I know youre a history guy I love that and you see the quote of course from James Franklin at the end of the day does this create opportunities for more to get in front of athletic directors I believe it does and of course these two guys at the Forefront of it leading their teams to the final four of the college football playoff absolutely has to 7447 Duke and again the officials now conferring castelo Connell and Driscoll Duke by the way with all five starters in double figures so heres the concern I dont believe that they can go back and assess a foul on the play so I think all they can do is give a flagrant foul and so or maybe a a a technical foul so I believe it has to happen otherwise you set a precedence for allowing that to be able to happen moving forward yeah right now le Cel with shy and capable explaining what they plan to do with 306 seconds left done racing by and after the threepointer was made theyre going to go flagrant 2 I believe dun has been ejected blue number one has been assessed a flagrant 2 foul and has been ejected and again it wasnt heavy contact but I understand and can appreciate the officials doing that because otherwise if you dont take these measures now what happens when it the next game because you let players think okay its okay for you to do that and again the official was shielded from it so you couldnt see it during live action well I think they handled it effectively as you look at the flagrant two out of the rule book I think its very clear was deliberate well when you look at the any contact to the growing area thats not incidental I believe thats why it was called a flagrant too not sure where it hit tyres Proctor it was close enough in the area to where it was enough to be able to the flagrant two ejection I thought the crew handled that appropriately and Duke with the basketball in the final seconds they are celebrating here at Cameron indor in front of their 533d consecutive sellout kids are back in the classroom tomorrow but they were here in force tonight as you knew they would with the pit Panthers in town Pittsburgh having one here last year so Duke exacting venge in this ACC encounter Duke is now 50 in ACC play very impressive still point2 on the Applause clock still time showing on the Music Applause clock and theyll dribble away the final point six and now weve got a final score as duke wins at 76 47 they win this one going away tonight so Duke
