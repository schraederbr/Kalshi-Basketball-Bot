and then on the other side jir Watkins one of the elite Defenders uh in the ACC theyre going to test Marcus Burton tonight with their length Florida State wearing white uniforms and Notre name in those blues 139 for FSU 10 and 11 for the Irish the NS have lost four in a row a heartbreaker against Boston College over the weekends Notre Dame had a similar Heartbreaker against Miami on the road in Coral Gables as dayquon Davis gets us started with the bucket there big news for the Irish no Matt Alo so you see Burton mohamd Shrewsberry Davis ji to starting five yeah thats huge Alo his experience in particular against this pressure defense of Florida State thats going to be key turnovers can Notre Dame take care of the ball against this Florida State Defense the Irish struggled over the weekend against Miami as Sir Mohamed air balls touched though by Florida State it with the Irish look at the nles the nles will be out without one of their starters Taylor Bowen who missed the game against Boston College over the weekend AJ switon first career start but the NS will also not have Jerry Deng available one of the rotational pieces from the bench and certainly when we spoke with Coach Hamilton and staff but that was concerned in particular against this back court of Notre Dame when youre switching again theyre going to test this Florida State Defense as well too one of the better back courts in the ACC and Burton shuberry nobody shoots the three ball better than Notre Dame in conference play at nearly 41 they lead the lead and Shrewsberry one of the top five in the league at firing away from Beyond The Arc Swinton hit a couple of Threes against Boston College over the weekend does not connect there from Beyond The Arc out of the NOS play in their first game since the announcement that Leonard Hamilton will be resigning at the end of the year after 23 three seasons Malcolm the tone has certainly shifted for Florida State the rest of the camp but sh around Leonard Hamilton certainly had a lot of energy uh they really feel like the talent they have it and they want to play for Coach Hamilton as we take a look at a charge offensive foul excuse me uh y trying to post up on Burton uh but the tone and shooter around was energetic uh this morning for Florida State Florida States assistant coach Kevin nickelberry hit a half cour shot that sent the whole team into a frenzy they chased him down all the way from one side of the court to the other they said its his first made half court shot in two seasons we were sitting with Coach ham when that happened and he had a big smile on his face he said he aint hit one all year and he hit one today Notre Dame leads by one thanks to the three from Shrewsberry one of the top marksmen in the conference on the attack is that Bur sure is Marcus Burton he can really fill it up thats uh when we talked with Coach Shrewsberry he said thats what Florida State makes you do make individual plays and certainly Burton is a guy that can score with the best of them because their ability to deny the ball or any reversals theyre going to force you to make individual plays like that Michel sherberry telling us earlier today as well that he just wants his team to mentally be able to finish ball games theyve played well over the last five or six games theyve had some theyve had some tough finishes in those games against Carolina and the state Miami where they LED in each of those games as Davis fouled was he shooting a three yeah itll be three shots coming for the freshman and thats what coach Shrewsberry has talked about its been the turnover you look at their last game against Miami take a look right here again the close out was late but he said look the turn turnovers have been an issue all year long in particular in ACC play their last game a loss against Miami 16 points off of turnovers they gave up to Miami but he said the bigger thing too has been defensive lapses in games in particular right there to close out as late and then you compound it by filing a threepoint shooter second season as a head coach is michah Shrewsberry Davis knocks down the second of three free throw throws well Notre D actually led by 13 early in that second half against Miami they just couldnt close the game down the Hurricanes get their first ACC Victory after a 20 game losing streak in conference dating back to last season with Coach lener was there yeah and this is right here though big game for both these teams coming off heartbreaking losses obviously talked about Notre Dame but then Florida State of a loss on the road to Boston College late in that one Ms up 15 and that one in the second half and up eight with under a minute to play the Eagles winning at the end on a threepoint shot with 3 seconds left NS active defensively they get the deflection theyll stay with the Irish and thats Florida State Defense right there you look at it scramble situations but because theyre active theyre length theyre going to try to get their hand on any swing pass or post entry pass 10 on a shot clock left for the Music Irish inbound in front of that seminal bench sir Mohamed a top 60 consensus recruit this state games this season with an injury for coming back in late December Burton thats what the NS want to do force him away from the basket tough attempt now Atkins Davis triple Drive kick out Watkins improved threepoint shooter this season not there Clips the front iron out of bounds Irish Ball and great job of Team blocking out that time keeping Yan off the offensive glass and again thats going to be another key we spoke with Coach re Barry and staff rebounding in particular defensive rebounding for Notre Dame they said they must keep Florida State off the offensive glass these NES have beaten the Irish four times in a row and seven of the last eight the NS lead that alltime series 11 to5 the Irish have never won in Tallahassee gotten close a couple of times these two teams have also met in an NCA tournament Hs first sweet 16 run under Leonard Hamilton back in 2011 Shrewsberry contested step back rattles out he and one of the best rebounders in the league rips it down and hes Applause fouled you cannot ask for a better defensive possession if youre coach Hilton and staff again its just close outs they did not give up any dribble drives and then they forced you in to a deep contested three late in the shot clock doing against ji turns faces nope on that turnaround hook good defense from the Irish heres Music Burton on the drive oh the Finesse high off the glassin in well he is just a matchup nightmare I mean hes so Shifty we talked about his numbers over the last five games and then if you give him space hes shooting over 45 from the threepoint line in the last five games theres a foul Davis stripped up its on the noes but Marcus Burton one of the best to do it in the league yeah one of the top talk with Coach cam about it and you know look he had some guys out hes dealing with some young players playing more minutes and playing bigger roles than he expected coming into this one but when theyre healthy the they have the talent the length and depth I think to be a very dangerous team theres a three ball in the corner from Garrett sundra 611 freshman from Ashburn Virginia only plays about 9 Minutes a game his 10th appearance of the year thats a big three to glosen up this Florida State Defense Luke couldnt hold on Davis whos worked so hard on that facet of his game becoming a better score this season for the Irish he flips it in yeah he really has become a matchup problem again he can really play three through five if they want to go uh small and he create problems because of his ability to do exactly that play off the bounce to your point about Florida state in the depth not having two key cogs Taylor Bowen as Jackson whos Miss time this season misses that shot no Jerry D tonight how does that affect what FSU wants to do well because of the way they play uh again it it impacts their rotations and ability to pressure the ball again right now Florida State when theyre healthy still lead the ACC 14 for turnovers per game but again right here Notre Dame doing a great job breaking down the Florida State Defense nice pass of that time by Shrewsberry and then Davis on the other end in transition again its been a nice start for Notre damee mainly because they have not turned the ball over Michael Shrewsberry Club over the last month has played some really good basketball they got their first ever win in Charlottesville they beat Georgia Tech I mean you look at a familiar tune in all of their losses especially since Marcus Burton has come back its been late in ball games they cant finish as e and whoa he really has intrigued uh many folks similar to Davis again he becomes a matchup problem because of most bigs arent used to being able to play out on the perimeter like that are you kidding me from a 611 big like that my goodness you heres Burton against Thomas Burton attacks leans in flip no Yan cleans glass Irish by Music V Thomas the veteran to Holtz Jackson back to HT Baseline Drive Burton goes down are they going to give it a charge yes they are well you right here the reverse you talked about it thats a 611 guy looking like a two guard shift your body and then finish on the other side eyes on the rim the entire sign Newan leads the ACC in field goal percentage over 56 on the year also the Leagues top offensive rebounder on the year very active on both ends a guy also that provides some Rim protection Florida is Florida 18 A little sloppy though from the ns early three turnovers its also a key for the Irish right we talked about it early going Notre D can protect the basketball theyve got an efficient offense one of the best 50 in the country according to Ken pal and offensive efficiency a lot of it with guys like that buron but you and wins the battle block shot and all want to get into transition H head down attack floats Clips off the iron rebound B taken down by Jack great block out again that time by Muhammad though on the other side keeping you and off the glass shuberry Music pure Bren Shrewsberry can really fill it up from Beyond The Arc a quick hitter here yeah we saw him and shoot around and then before the game if youre not there on the catch uh its too late uh he is going to make you pay quick release and The Big Three Shrewsberry Burton and Tay Davis really uh have been solid for this Notre Dame uh team and and thats just great transition offense try to get out before the Florida state half court defense can get set up SW looks a little shaken up there as he goes to the bench Jackson as well Watkins re enter Shrewsberry is hit two threes in now 18 games on the season and at least two threes and hes doing it within the flow of their transition sets or half court sets does a nice job trailing and then they do nice job pushing the ball ahead again Florida State thats a breakdown and anytime miss or make you must identify scwb in transition Music swe now Christian me is entered for Florida State as well Watkins to Yan against ji 1 V one Shrewsberry monitoring for the double team Yan wants to get to that right hand he does good defense though by J made it tough did not budge at all won the first bump and then took the second as well too but that threw you off excellent post defense Mohamed no ja yes Ive been impressed with him again J hes been active both end solid post defense and then that time on the offensive Applause glass irishs lead is 10 Watkins midrange J able to trim the deficit back down to eight Watkins first points of the evening he averages over 18 a game for FSU this season double figures in 32 of his 34 career ACC games in Tallahasse 179 Notre day Mohamed clumsily falls down couple of Irish players have hit the hardwood NOS have numbers Advantage need to swooping in for the Lefty L and he should give an assist to Y that time he cleared the path and made that bucket much easier uh almost shielding the defender had no chance whatsoever to recover and try to contest Julian rer handles the rock started his career at northwester veteran guard provides defense and ball handling ability as does Imes nearly traveled there shuberry hell go out of bounds the fsus ball got all these players and you know coach Hamilton is such a humble person he wont take credit for that hell give credit for his staff and so forth I wasnt trying to hear it at all but the thing that he talked about that hes most proud of all the young men that graduated from Florida State and all the other programs he was at and the type of men that they become he said thats what I want my legacy at Florida State to be you dumped down Watkins strong to the bucket itll rattle home no strm that deficit to four the work that Leonard Hamilton coach Stan Jones associate head coach for Florida state did on guys like Devon Vel fan new cabin gelly Solomon Alby the list goes on and on right of guys that have come in that have stayed a couple of years and been able to develop into good NBA draft P the numbers dont lie and his resume does not lie and certainly again he has what he has done at Florida State I can argue that its harder what he did here what he built from scratch than any other place its just remarkable what hes done and hes the only guy that I know that revers aged he recruited me when he was the head coach of Oklahoma State and then I played against him for four years against those Miami teams Constantine Popa Edwards uh Morton whos on his bench but I said coach you still look how how do you look younger as youve gotten up in age and he gave me a smile and certainly uh coach ham again one of the best to do it Mohamed jumper turn around not going to be there rebound need to hell push the break now Watkins jab step Yan turning facing stripped good hands by Burton oh Nifty behind the move behind the back move kick out its Cole Sera whos enter for Notre Dame Alberton dragged that pivot foot turnover well the idea was there again though of that Florida State relent defense Relentless but Ive been impressed early Notre Dame has done a nice job defensively they switched up and played some Zone again trying to slow down this Florida State team keep them out of transition keep him out of the paint and then defensively also too whether its zone or man theyve been very active in the passing Lanes forcing some turnovers you Malcolm I laughed when coach Hamilton came to shoot around he saw you immediately he goes hey Big Daddy and then he started singing for you cuz he gave you a hug well my parents uh Elbert Eloise hucke still I have nothing but respect for that man although I didnt play for him my mom loved him she just said Im not getting on the plane though to go to Oklahoma state with my son just a little too far huh yeah a little bit too far I think things worked out for you I think it worked out well for Coach ham as well too and right now though his team needs more of this into the Open Court Jackson no tipping Watkins reaching back for it nos on an 80 run thats just great hustle and touch by Watkins again that tip he made it look easy there were guys around him and he did that with his left hand the Irish scoring Dr in nearly four minutes thats allowed the nlls to get back in it here in this first half airball y nice pass Jackson right hand finger roll time out Notre Dame a lot of love but I think its the other guys guys like tyres Proctor whos probably going to be a first round pick as well too but they can beat you in so many Applause ways now heres burn Florida States held him to two for six to start what he like about the way the NOS are defended theyre keeping him out of the paint and I think thats the key thing easier said than done and theyre forcing them into some really tough contested shots Shrewsberry shot clock winding down has to float it cant connect rebound Watkins whos up to his rebounding game over the last five Swit three ball no energy to get back to it second chance now for FSU Watkins head down turns faces its pretty sweet well hes got such a strong lower body great length and thats a tough floater off one foot comes back to the right hand High over the defense Watkins has eight he leads all scores Florida State leads by two and a 120 run and buron not on the same page as Davis that seminal length coming into Play heres Watkins yeah right here again look at this comes back off the opposite foot comes back to that right hand and hes practiced that shot he saw him in shoot around and then before the game of working on that same isolation play on the wing on the other end Florida States doing what they do again when we talked with Coach Shrewsberry said they are so disruptive Florida State because of all their switching they just dont allow you to run run offense Davis is in a pickle as he falls down able to avoid the travel now Yan has he turning trying to use the that bucket footwork foul its a little too much sauce there for jck I mean and thats why hes a match up proper again hes a 611 guy with a hesi with handles again look at this right here again thats a little Kyrie right there spin him back and Ja has done a nice job early though when hes tried to post pushing him out I think thats a problem right there though when you have him out on the wing trying to slide again the helps got to come over a little bit quicker to give a little bit more help you Misses the first free throw shooting 66 on the Year from the line but in his last six 90 from the charity strip foran and thats going to be key again teams are in man posing bigs dont necessarily have the foot speed to keep up with them so he could get opportunities at the line if the help is late he was eight for eight against Boston College Florida State went to the Line 39 times against the Eagles on Saturday SW TK to guard Burton Burton spinning no J was trying to crash in there for the tap back noes clear leading by three Jackson falls on it goes down gets back up and jump ball possession arrow to the Irish this game getting chippy uh early physical game both teams doing a great job defending dribble drives there been very few easy buckets uh in this game and got a veteran officiating cre on this one but again theyve been well played both ends defensively both teams doing a good job forcing each other into contest the shots feel like the Irish want to slow things down right play an efficient game Florida State wants to speed you up get into the Open Court they force a turnover that pressure and and its as simple as that the switching coach rury talked about it he said look theyre just disruptive so youre going to have to have guys make individual plays any dribble handoffs or swings to the wing theyre just going to try to deny it and get their hands on it like that right there and force turnovers well theyve turned the ball over now four times in their last 6 minutes Notre Dame hasnt scored a point since the 12min mark well the good news is theyre within three and theyve also been good defensively uh but again you cannot turn the ball over I think the key thing though is is theyve kept Florida State out of those live ball situations where they can get in transition for easy buckets SN driving hard to the bucket he was clicked so go to the line that is J second and he is so explosive we saw him out here pregame and he certainly would be a guy that could be in a dunk contest windmilling very athletic but the thing that the coaching staff was out here working with him on is that right there trying to get to his midrange playing off of two feet SW Knocks down the first want to remind you Sunday ACC Network gymnastics meet is live from Carmichael Arena in Chapel Hill 24th ring Clemson 23rd rank tar Hills coverage beginning at 400 pm Eastern 1 pm Pacific snon was a standout football player as well too wide receiver and also ran 100 and 200 in track so again one of the more athletic players uh in the ACC and Malcolm he was Florida States first commit of the 2024 class Leonard Hamilton saying hes a classic FSU guy reminds him of a young Terren man some of the things that hes doing early in his career NOS Force another turnover Watkins ahead of steam that was the first live ball turnover in a minute that weve seen and those are the ones you have to avoid if youre Notre Dame nolles on a 170 run they lead by seven Davis trying to end that thats a tough contested shot ball not moving for the Irish right now offensively nos taking advantage Davis Rising Fire brims out offensive rebound for the n swings in attack foul oh he was trying to put someone on a poster and athleticism on display but this is all set up though by the Florida State Defense look at this right here again I said he is Elite defensively Watkins and then defense leads the offense through contact right here take the hit and finish look his eyes never left the rim and then we talked about it swin one of the better athletes in the ACC that time trying to take off the rim sandre did what youre supposed to do right if youre going to foul you make sure he cant make the bucket on you absolutely get your moneys worth put them at the free throw line but the problematic now of for Notre Dame we talked about it early on they were doing a great job taking care of the ball but that has not been the case uh in the last really thre minute stretch and sometimes bad shots are equally just call him a turnover bad offensive possessions theyve hit a rough stretch here right now lets see if they can settle offensively and get the better looks well true to what Leonard Hamilton has built in tallahi AJ swin has provided an energy boost his first career start the Freshman from cin John Maryland AJ goes by Alfred James as SRA lays it in and in a scoring drought of over seven minutes finally ends for the IR what a beautiful pass that time by Muhammad again nice little set play there high screen and then roll the help wasnt there and thats the first easy uncontested bucket in this game for Notre Dame here is swon Applause sh I said it saw him in pregame and his head was right at The Rim showing off the Hops that time my goodness little a shot little shot of energy here at the tuck via AJ Swinton the consensus top 60 recruit out of high school 7 foot wingspan for the Freshman Burton shot clock winding down air ball shot clock violation that stion coaching staff loves it well this guy S one of the elite athletes in the AC Taking Flight Florida state is on a roll all set up by their defense leading to easy opportunities on the offensive side the two I think really underappreciated or under talked about obviously uh Louisville Pat Kelsy what he has done one of the best backwards rain Smith Chucky heern but Clon that back court Ill tell you chase Hunter one of the more underrated players not just in the ACC but in college basketball him and Jaden Zachary thats a tough back Fort I wouldnt be surprised if those two teams challenged to from ACC tournament time Thomas can hit KN to on the foot back Florida State he extends the lead to 10 for Coach Brownell right at Clemson how big is it to have Chase Hunter Ian shefflin and what they bring to the table not just on the court but what they can do for the rest of their teammates as veterans in the leag experience and thats what both these coaches talked about we talked to Coach ruberry and you know I think people need to remember yes Marcus Burton is talented but hes still a young player hes only sophomore yes last season had a great ACC freshman year but him and Braden Shrewsberry two of the more talented guards back court theyre young again theyre sophomores so again I think oh theyre going to grow but right here I love this angle right here showing this spacing and then that is just great work on the offensive glass credit to all our guys in the tech technology department making all these angles work for us our camera crew and again it just shows the phenomenal spacing that Florida state had on that last possession our cameras our control room appreciate you they were out here early today everything up during shooter R getting you set for Florida State in Notre tank Watkins was fading away that would have been a big leag shot made by jir good defense though from the Irish and olds activity and energy has been tough for the Irish oh back door cut thats pretty sundra wasnt able to finish through the contacts offensive foul KNE to moving screen I think he knew it yeah no need for that right there again Watkins were more than capable of Getting By without an illegal screen on the other end its been a couple times again Notre Dame has had yeah thats an easy one to call right there but Notre Dame has had back door opportunities just got to be a little quicker again Muhammad on that previous play was looking to set up a back door it was there but the timing was a little off again theyre going to need more of that and then also against quarter State you got to set solid screens Mohamad with SRA cutting good ball movement Burton clean look and you better believe hes going to finish that I think thats twice now we said in this game clean look all set up dribble drive and then make the extra pass theyre going to need more possessions like that but one of the few clean looks weve seen in this first half another illegal screen on Florida State that time on Malo well this right here again just excellent spacing and ball movement and you leave Burton open or Shrewsberry theyre going to make you pay and it feels like again Florida State should be up more so if youre Notre Dame you got to be happy youre only down seven and you really had a score ing drought for a minute really seemed like three minutes where you couldnt score and youre right within Striking Distance heres Burton from Beyond The Arc where hes improved over 12 points from a year ago 42 from Beyond The Arc which opens up more opportunities like that NOS throw it away Burton steps into a three yes sir Irish right back in it Marcus Burton is a pro hes playing hes playing somewhere whether its NBA again he is just a handful only Trails Cooper flag in terms of Point per game and again when you start talking about next level guys my goodness Im glad Im sitting over here with you and not trying to guard him out on the perimeter very difficult to match up with and keep out of the paint you talked the fact that hes a pro right its an ba Scout you wanted to see if youre an NBA Scout how he matches up against Florida States length five on the shot clock Davis Shrewsberry contests good defense mohamd CLE great defense that time by BR and Shrewsberry again thats all you can ask for defensively contested shots that leads to a quick hitter for mohamd he was fouled could not convert hell go to the line so how about the Irish here over the last few moments yeah again its been all set up by their defense theyve gotten a couple of turnovers but Burton really again you got to go to your star player you knew coming into this game Florida States not going to allow you to run much offense so you need a guy you need a dude that can just go get you a bucket nobody better in the ACC than Marcus Burton oneonone Sunday on acc Network in the ESPN half a double header of womens basketball Virginia Tech Virginia that Commonwealth class Cal Notre Dame right after that 12 and 200 oh the joy Center percel is going to be rocking Anna hadalo Olivia miles talking something over well theres six players out in the court for Florida State now again both coaches are looking at the refs like hey look we sub somebody in and Coach shuberry saying hey look thats could be attack six guys are out on the court ball was handed to Muhammad who has been solid filling in for mat alako who again is out with a wrist injury we saw him trying to go through shoot around Matt alako and just not able to go he wented every time he took a shot on that right wrist so sir muhamad steps in and he has been really good for this Notre Dame team just first half for the Freshman the Irish will climb back into it with a 90 run Thomas launching not going to go knocked out of bounds it belongs to Notre Applause day the es and flows of this first half right the Irish first 10 minutes belong to them then the nolles on a 170 run take a 10point lead now Notre Dame has closed the Gap to one with a chance to take the lead before for the break heres Burton five Burton 43 Burton on the attack lost it out of bounds it belongs to Florida State he got 22 seconds to work with thats great transition defense that time really not necessarily transition but just keeping Burton out of the lane and then when he gets in there put bodies in front of him Davis Juans got to let a half court shot fly rips off to the right 29 28 times in that one 20 minutes of ball left Mike Shrewsberry telling us earlier today can we make the winning plays when it counts we could be 82 in the league if not for some tough finishes in the ACC then old first bucket of the half belongs to you and thats what he does hes one of the better offensive rebounders in the ACC and right now hes leads the ACC with close to four offensive rebounds per game add to that number right there heres J hes been quiet so far turning facing hook shot not there rebound Yan Five Points five rebounds now for you and Applause hello thats a nice little action right there in transition and youre just not used to seeing big receiving dribble handoffs so agile so skilled is Davis using that big frame to get to the rack yeah both teams getting after it on the offensive glass that time Notre Dame nice work extra possession Jackson drives the middle stripped recovered by the noes Yan against J to that right hand throws it up no he was fou and right here again this is in transition Yan leads the break and then he gets a d triple hand off the help is not there and my goodness Yan showing off the house and then right here Tay Davis this is another offensive rebound though for Notre Dame theyve done a nice job those 5050 balls offensive rebounds uh gaining extra possessions and looks at The Rim y cant connect on the first of two free throws but the lift that hes given Florida State already here in this second half four quick points he only had three in the first 20 minutes of the basketball well again his versatility again his mobility and ability to play off the bounce hes almost like a point big in terms of his ability to handle the ball so he can lead the break play the point for them if needed Leonard amilton thinks the mechanics are also there for you and to develop a jump shot shot something guys at the next level want to see as he makes a transition into one day hopefully being an NBA Applause player Basta skills at 611 for you turnover Irish active Hands by FSU inside oh pretty good pass from Watkins you and just not quite ready for it couldnt grip it hed have had a flush there was a slight window to get that ball in there he almost threaded look at this right here again our camera crew one of the best look at this angle I mean thats through bodies you got to be perfect right there Davis on the turnaround from inside 8 ft yeah thats some great footwork by Tay Davis again youre just going to need individual plays cuz Florida State again theyre going to continue to deny the ball and not allow you to run your offense offensive foul on Applause you again lets see m yeah and again if he doesnt extend the arm then maybe they let him play on but he got that arm up and and we got a great officiating crew thats an easy one for them to make right in position uh they were a perfectly positioned to see that arm come up pad Driscoll John GNE Tony chazza some veterans who have done this a long time in his zebra strikes heres Burton big sequence in that first half to get not her D back into it when who was starting to get away from the Irish he attacks are you kidding Applause me I mean at his size and his ability to get into the paint and then navigate and then finish through contact really a big reason why hes going to be a guy thats going to play at the next level Watkins a guy who could play at the next level as well has improved that threepoint jump shot over 35 now on the year he knocks it down and they charge the other way and thats why Watkins will play at the next level uh hes an elite Defender not a good Defender hes an elite Defender his ability to slide his feet great positional size he can really play one through four uh defensively really so impressive what hes able to do though on this end look at that textbook slide your feet get your body in front of him one of the best defenders not just in the ACC but in college basketball jir Watkins and the ability to guard multiple positions right at that 6 fo 6 s frame that he has yeah hes a Leonard Hamilton prototype again he loves those guys you know 65 and above that can play and guard multiple positions began his career at BCU theres a foul away from the ball young players take note right here again everybody thinks its about scoring but look at that again the helps side defense you look at all Florida State players in the Music Gap over the top for Jackson heres Chandler Jackson you it to Davis screen set Davis uses talented fresh guard threw it away was looking for Watkins great defense from rooper yeah rer read that one like a free safety back there freshman never saw him through that thats an easy interception J between the leg dribble athletic Drive couldnt did everything but finish ball goes out of bounds luckily for the Irish itll stay with them on this side of the court and chai right back at you and showing off some ball handling skills that time just unable to finish the floater cabaji known for his ability for the offensive rebound block shot by Davis the smallest guy on the floor NOS into the break Watkins deep NBA three straight away yes sir that transition right there offense you cant ask for a more wide open look and youre absolutely right thats the area of the game that Watkins has worked on Boston College Eagles Malcolm H did the all a favor later that season huh right afterwards led by Tom Coughlin the head coach upsets Notre Dame snaps their 17 game win streak and that right there put Florida State back in of the hunt and what a year that was in college football had some Legends on the sidelines as well too who hols Bowen Tom Coughlin said beats Nebraska for the national title later that year heres Watkins after the 5sec call off the glass tried to bank it in now Davis active hands had he play Watkins wide open three ball yes sir turnovers a coach Shrewsberry talk with us about that he said look thats been the issue for us uh turnovers in particular live ball turnovers that leave the points thats just caress the ball you should care it but you have to know when you play Florida State somebody is always going to try to get their hands on a pass rebound or dribble about the response from Burton from three hes been lights out in this game much needed basket one of the accs best player in Marcus Burton now Watkins has a match up he likes Notre Dame I think realized it tried to send a double and call an offensive foul though they do but the previous play again heads up play by The Freshman but then the answer Marcus Burton cannot give him that much space thats a breakdown again Burton and Shrewsberry the two guys uh in particular those two guys that back but you give them any airace most times theyre going to make you pay Leo Watkins for hooking his arm around Burton there the Irish catch a Applause break drewberry dribble hand off Burton gets inside stops on a dime Roper not known for his scoring ability looking to pass Shrewsberry attacks Watkins goes down and an offensive foul Im going to say it again jir Watkins is Elite defensively look at the close out right here again close out shut off the jump shot and then take the charge you have to have Elite athleticism Elite length but then his footwork look at how he closed out under control low but had his hands up high to close out on Shrewsberry and then come up with the charge cannot do it any better wow offensive foul Galore right now both teams out doing a great job sliding their feet coming up with charges right now though Florida State extending of that pressure again theyre just going to continue to be relentless defensively try to see if they can force turnovers both teams have the Irish oh heres another offensive h w what a sweet sequence weve got going here over the last couple of moments Watkins got clipped in the mouth yeah lets see again from this angle we were blocked from where we were at yeah again again now it it was you know hes trying to get one of the better Defenders off him just got his hand elbow up too high thats an easy call for the Reps to make again getting them right in the jaw area Burton almost forces another turnover the noes have 14 of them the Irish of 12 of them neither team taking care of the basketball Watkins has had a big second half cant connect from the corner simol still by six Davis head of steam downhill with the left hand yes sir and I like that tay Davis bringing the ball up against the pressure give Marcus Burton a little bit of a break theyre just running guys at him see if they can wear him out let Davis bring the ball up and then let him start the offense Watkins you in the second half has been the story the rest of the team for FSU not able to provide much of a scoring yeah the Tay Davis right here this is a big move Little Euro and then finish with the left hand and again like Yan hes a a forward that can bring the ball up against pressure again right now give Burton a a break get the ball back in and I like this let Tay Davis relieve some of that pressure for Marcus Burton Malcolm Davis has shown he can be a leading scorer right and take some of that scoring load off of Burton shoulders 26 against Boston College earlier this year 27 against Georgia Tech the kick out in the three Sera not able to connect Davis though the hustle play feeds it inside ji angle and he flips it in ji again it may not show up big numbers in terms of points but his presence in the paint very impressive and has been huge for Notre Dame big reason why theyre only down two been a game of runs the Irish now on a 70 run theyre within two d Davis leaning fading no Burton attacking to try and tie the game he does once he gets downhill youre not keeping him out of the paint now in here throw away Burton comes away with it on the attack high off the glass not there out of bounds itll be Florida States ball right here again ji taking his time and EMP power move and then Marcus Burton downhill good luck no way youre keeping him out of the paint and his ability to finish with the left hand makes him so dangerous he can go with the left or right Burtons got 19 Davis has eight the Irish on a 90 run Florida State trying to end that run in retake the lead oh Davis that little awward able to recover Watkins thought about the three dribble Drive stops Davis deep three for the freshman and he missed everything tie game here in tally link Jared now of course the coach of FSU hes got the nolles ranked in the preseason top 10 Jamie Arnolds one of the best pitchers in the country top five pick in the MLB draft probably for this Summers first rounds lot of olds fans excited about baseball it begins next week back here on the court Malcolm you can talk some hoops 4343 the Irish have fought their way back into this thing huh Notre Dame has done a great job hanging around early thats run that Florida State went on and then they settled and then their defense has been equally as impressive as Florida States and then your two star players playing really well Burton and Watkins have been solid all game long Cruz Barry cant Applause connect you nice pass S easy Jam Malik Yan has done that now twice in this game hes a very good passer out of the double team thats a beautiful find for an easy dunk Nolls take the twopoint lead buron high off the glass count and one hell go to the line well anybody uh that questions whether or not uh this guy is one of the elite guards in college basketball uh you need to be get checked but right here Yan out of the double team beautiful pass and then right here one of the more difficult shot makers in Marcus Burton we talked about it his last five games been on fire 22 points and shooting over 45 from the threepoint line got 202 tonight the Irish Lea do people know you played baseball and were pretty good at it I was like Pedro from Major League got drafted by the Houston Asos could hit anything straight but you throw me a curve uh that was a problem but I was drafted by the Houston Astros Thomas sticks it back in Old ret Take the Lead s Missi Malcolm Huckaby so youre saying you could hit a fast ball I could hit a fast ball I could throw I can run all that just dont throw me any curves no off speed and Malcolm Mohamed strong Drive lost it a foul called on the floor who is that on its on Chandler Jackson well the one thing we have not talked about much both teams without some key pieces tell B bow out for Flor State on the other side Matt alako not able to go so the breastman has to step in for him and mamad I think has been solid for Notre Dame I think the big thing is hes taking care of the ball in that first half no turnovers had three assists and again thats key and right now I think some confusion on it whos actually shooting the free throw and I think theyre either trying to see whos taking the freto I think theyre trying to pull a little hokey dop on uh Florida State they dont think Muhammad should be at the line they think its ji yeah so they tried to get the better freto Music shooter lets see and then yeah no foul there and then yeah thats clearly ji that should be at the free throw line and its two shots Notre Dame is in the bonus for the rest of the game for the final 10 minutes 17 fouls on FSU ja cley hits the first 74 on the year doesnt get there a ton these are just attempts 39 and 40 right now in this game difference Notre Dame 16 points off of turnovers to 12 for Florida State look coming into this game uh we thought that was going to be a key to the opposite side Notre Dame and not giving up those points off the turnovers but their defense has done a nice job creating offense all right so under 10 minutes to play tied at 47 what are the keys for both of these teams defense well tapping the zone right now Notre Dame went Zone and thats the area you need to attack they got to the F line just short on the jumper right there truberry couldnt finish through the contact Davis battling for it oh its off him out of bounds Florida stage Applause ball so on this side right here Notre Dame youre going to have to continue to do what youve been doing Burton has been the guy getting into the paint the key thing is continue to take care of the ball I think hes going to play it out with Burton let him go make a play and then go from there my mistake I thought it was Florida States ball officials actually pointed in the direction of FSU instead though they award it to Notre Dame Burton cant connect on the Applause freebie still tied at 47 Jackson attacks midrange floater Applause yes Jackson and the nolles retake the lead by two hes got four points its Watkins 19 thats pacing FSU Davis takes Jackson Off The dribble to mohamd slashing flipping it up it rolls off the rip tapped back foul Colts and its on Florida State on Chandler Jackson that is his four nice work this time by Muhammad but right here again a breakdown the Jackson nice little floater soft touch and then on the other end right here Tay Davis dribbles out of the double nice cut that time by Muhammad and again he has been solid November 18th had surgery p a lower B surgery returned December 31st at Georgia Tech and then played really well at Duke had his first double digit game 11 points but obviously his father deser Mohamed long NBA career 18 season eight different teams and the former star at Kentucky Sun playing silid tonight against a very good FSU team forter State team cant convert offensive rebound Davis he cant finish through traffic rebound Yuan you approaching a double double hes got eight points eight rebounds Z defense again from the Irish key thing is get the ball to the fou line if youre Florida State ball f and then get it right there you turning facing cant connect off to the left knocked out of bounds itll belong to Notre day and thats twice now Florida States gotten the ball to the free throw line the guys just have missed fou line jumpers or little short floaters so again theyre attacking it the right way but just not able to capitalize do you like who they put though in that soft spot yeah thats you want you in there again again he can be a guy that can shoot that jump ER or just post if you have a mismatch and then hes a very good passer so how theyre attacking it is good slowed Florida State down for the time being the Irish have gotten a couple stops with it oh HS that into the stands and you see what happened there they just denied Burton so they want anybody but Marcus Burton dribbling the ball and then theyre just pressuring so theyre face guarding Burton not letting him get it back and theyre going to make some body else make a play excellent defense that time by Florida State we talked football earlier Logan Logan IM was doing his best Riley Leonard impression huh through the ball absolute spiral into the stance great defense again from the Irish and ji again really love his presence and what he has done for this Notre Dame Applause team again watch them theyre denying Burton right now Watkins theyre just trying not to let him get the ball Burton switches hands cant connect Yan rebounds and leads the break athletic enough to do it Yan will attack himself count it and the basket hell go to the line for one more Im going to say it right now Malik Yan is a matchup problem and a guy thats intriguing for NBA guys youre 611 guy take the hit through contact and one here again theyre denying him the ball they want anybody but Marcus Burton to get the ball right here jir Watkins denying and then when he does get it hes got three guys chasing him they just want to put bodies in front of him misses the layup there theyre just trying to wear him out theyre throwing bodies at him coming in defend one of the better guards in college basketball Malcolm the Irish have attempted 50 shots 20 of them coming from Burton hes nine of 20 in this game as you saw on your screen hes been fantastic 22 points one of the true stars in the league and theyre still denying Thomas now again and hes working so hard just to get the ball Sandra working against Watkins you and denying Burton Serta five on the clock theyve got to find somebody now three now two Ser up prayer Nope off to the right tipped up second chance for the Irish everything right except finish that play off its all set up because theyre just denying uh Marcus Burton Burton steps back three ball in the air off to the left a third chance Davis blocks out of bounds and the Irish will have a fourth opportunity on this possession well again theyre getting offensive rebounds but theres no flow to their offense mainly theyre all trying to get Marcus Burton the ball somebody else is going to have to make a play I think Tay Davis is that guy right now let him because right now there just face guard in Marcus Burton and daring somebody else to make a play its not an Apples to Apples parison but Davis doing a lot of the things that Toby L did for Virginia Tech couple of games ago to help the Hoke he beat Florida State here on this court similar size as well at 69 that last touch Davis turnover for the Irish theyre just making it difficult to even inbound the ball again you got to set screens nobody really moving for Notre Dame on that out of bounds underneath and and theyre going to continue Florida State to try to get their hands on any pass 14 turnovers for Notre D Florida state has 16 of them themselves FSU hasnt figured out this Zone that the Irish have gone to the last couple of possessions defensively yet another Applause turnover the visitors from South Bend down five six minutes to play Davis stays with it off a tough pass from Shrewsberry Davis spinning leaning no rebound Watkins two on two jir Watkins Euro Step kick Davis fires from the corner Applause airball Shrewsberry Blows By Swinson he cant finish boy sloppy moments here from both teams Notre Dame going to keep control of the r not a clinic though offensively for either side yeah I think all these guys are tired they spent so much energy defensively ptin Shrewsberry uh you look at Watkins Davis all these guys out here getting after it defensively my buddy in Talent stat sha Davidson puts a note in front of me the Irish have missed their last seven layup attempts and thats fatigue against some of these uh I cant necessarily give all the credit to Florida State in terms of after the rim but I give credit to them in terms of how theyve worn out the legs of these Notre Dame players again thats a staple of what Leonard Hamilton does may this nine straight shots weve talked about lengthy scoring droughts approaching 5 minutes are the Irish again they had a stretch of over seven minutes in the first half without a point SRA Corner yes and one he hit the three from the corner all set up Marcus Burton playing off of two feet jump stop and then find your shooter in the corner look at that two guys on somebodys got to be open and thats a big time play by Burton sunra pointing at us and says do more prep on me said I know you didnt Circle me in your scouting report he misses the free throw but hes had some games this year 11 against kraton out in Vegas has shown the ability to hit the ball from Beyond The Arc hes had a couple here tonight the Irish are within two and none bigger than that three right there in the corner Thomas stops his dribble Swinton now y double team comes Swinson on the attack blocking foul Yan again hes quick and when youre a big you know the Doubles coming you either got to spin out of it or make a quick decision with the ball you again nice job playing out of the double team right here again doesnt hold it sees the cutter and makes a quick decision Yans got three assists to go along with 11 points and nine rebounds hes close to his eighth double double of the Year Swinton hit itss the free throw do want to remind you that next Wednesday ACC network is a big double header its Cooper flag number two Duke and theyre going to be playing the cow Bears right after Stanford and Georgia Tech go at it at seven from mamish Maxim Reno Damon stmy group oh theyve been beat up this year theyve been battling injuries they did just pick off Louisville over the weekend that stopped a 10game winning streak the pack Kelce Squad yeah big win Nathan George one of the better young point guards in the ACC right now though Florida State up Applause for SW had a career high 10 against Boston College over the weekend hes followed that up with nine more big points here tonight freshman from Maryland getting the job done for the nolles who are without two rotational players Shrewsberry has been quiet this evening cant connect Davis has been a beast on the glass oh rebound hes fouled hell go to the line his work on the offensive glass weve said that on multiple possessions now uh hes just been aggressive right here trying to bring down the rim thats a good foul though by Swinton do not let him get an uncontested dunk put him on the free throw line eight points nine rebounds for Davis cant knock down a critical free throw there hes got five offensive rebounds just in this half thats T Davis the effort on the glass has been phenomenal for the 69 Jr from Indianapolis started his career at seat Hall over in the Big East hits that one trims Florida States lead to three lets see what Notre Dame does yep they go right back into to the Zone key thing is lets see if you can identify now they go back to man again theyre disguising it starting off that zone and then they switch back into man loins says forget that Im just driving and hes fouled and he and the NOS are in the bonus so hell go to the line heads up play that time by Watkins and again back to our earlier points weve been talking about it coach rusb and that was one of the keys when we talked to him this afternoon and shoot around he said look we have to keep teams off the free throw line in particular Watkins one of the better uh players at drawing fouls and getting to the free throw line matter of fact jir Watkins one of the best 10 in the country at getting to the free throw line nobody for large parts of this season did it better in the league Watkins attempted 22 free throws in a game earlier this season against rice I think the work he put in though on his outside shot I think thats been been huge uh for his game and you look at Watkins three of six from the threepoint line we talked about the star players tonight and they have basically not disappointed Burton 22 Watkins 20 and for me though the Improvement that Watkins had made with his threepoint shooting really key to his game and a big reason why hes going to play at the next level hes deep in his bag No Doubt a great defender as you mentioned earlier versatile can handle the rock 6 s good size prototypical Prospect for that next level in the lead two big free throws right there for this game gos by five this has been the Bugaboo of Notre Dame season all year finishing Applause late Burton feeds rer sunra four on the clock 32 Davis calling his un number for three he knocks it down how big was that shot its huge and sundra again they didnt Panic they got late in the shot clock didnt settle and then you get a wide openen three thats a huge bucket a by Davis turnover was looking for you and was Watkins number 18 for Florida State in this game Florida State who recently over the weekend couldnt close a game out similar themes for both of these teams Shrewsberry straightway off to the right sundra offensive rebound hes been solid sundra defensively and then on the glass oh and Shrewsberry STS on the sideline thats a turnover for the Irish J I mean he came out and you know the same Leonard Hamilton had a ton of energy uh this after afternoon in shoot around and again hes been dealing with some injuries with these guys but he feels like as they get closer to being 100 he likes this team Watkins in the middle of that zone cant finish and then he fouls thats going to put Notre Dame in the double bonus thats four fouls on Watkins as well uh its remarkable you look at the numbers Rick Barnes Rick patino some of the other names in the ACC numbers Coach K Roy great Dean Smith its really remarkable what hes been able to do but back to this game though another its two shots so and so one more shot coming here for ji he missed the first well Notre Dame has really uh been the team on the offensive glass 14 offensive rebounds for Notre Dame to six for Florida State right now Watkins down low you got to put a body on somebody cuz Davis in particular and ji have done a great job crashing the glass and now on this side if youre Florida State you got to figure out the Zone The Zone of Notre Dame really has bothered and slowed down Florida State still got to get the ball to the F line Malcolm the NS havent made a shot from the floor in nearly 5 minutes A lot of that due to this Zone Davis finally hits one from that spot thats the area you got to continue to attack against the zone you get the ball through the foul line and now you make the big make a decision give up that F line jumper or you got the dump off low to you excellent zone offense that time by Florida state Florida State noted him usually a close game over the years turnover forced off the body of J active Hands by FSU underneath and its a right play though again Marcus Burtons getting into the lane hes got three people on him somebodys going to be open thats just a great recovery cuz J looked like he was going to get an uncontested layup timeout taken by coach Hamilton well take a quick Break nolles by Three crunch time and tally little over two minutes left in this game and if youre Florida State against ball fix again youve had a lot of turnovers in this game uh Florida State 18 turnovers in this game a lot of them coming out of the zone so again ball fake and then see if you can continue to try to get the ball to that F line area its been a terrific Tuesday Showdown here in the ACC presented by tro price threepoint seminal Advantage who will make the winning plays how about you and the step through and that time Notre Dame they started off Zone and then they switch mid a defensive possession went man Yan saw it helped it not come took his time nice little up and under hold by five Burton drives kicks to J top of the key rotation Roper Burton retrieves under 10 on the shot clock Burton on the attack there you go Oh Marcus Burton I mean its just laughable how hes able to get in through the big bodies knife his way through the body control and then finish my goodness thats a tough shot by Marcus Burton 6 feet 190 lb of fun is Marcus Burton hes got 24 one minute to play Im not sure who its fun for for Russ as broadcasters huh definitely not defending him but youre absolutely right fun to watch throw inside foul and one Ying with one of the biggest moments of this game the touch that this play takes walk heads up and then Yan with a reverse layup alyu again watch this play right here Watkins Yan body control and one its all set up though by the spacing look at this fa right here in that zone if youre buron in that one right there you got to wrap him up dont let him get that ball to the rim help was late and thats just great execution that time 15 points for you and nine rebounds and three assists for the big man Tails from lawrenville Georgia the suburb of the Atlanta area began his career at all Miss heres the top chuko prospect one season ago oh hes been huge for Florida State one of the moreable bigs and college were going to step aside quickly m wel NOS by six under 50 seconds to play uh his ability uh to make plays for his teammates hes got three assists some of those though hes got more because of the hockey assist hes able to throw out of double teams and his ability to defend one through five I think thats going to make him a lot of money at the next level whether its on the NBA or overseas whats Notre Dame got to do right now get quick and then get right to the basket they just have been missing layups again you dont need a three in that situation down six they got exactly what they wanted got into their set they just missed another layup thats one Tay Davis would love to have back obviously 38 seconds left he got a foul but again if he makes that layup you have a chance to set up your defense and then go for one steal if you dont then obviously you got to start thinking about fall and putting Florida State on the free throw line Davis has had some bright moments tonight 12 points9 rebounds Yan right here again this is where he thought Yan was going to go up and try to block that you faked like he was going to go contest and took it away and he really never really had a good handle on that one thats just a missed Opportunity Knocks him both down the line hes got a double double his eighth of the season 18 and 10 from The Talented big man Burton on the attack foul now this was an issue for FSU when they were up seven or eight over the weekend against Boston College fouls with under a minute to go when youre comfortably ahead and The Possession battle favors you the rest of the game it does and obviously inbounding the ball you got to be now aware make Miss obviously 32 seconds left Notre Dame is going to try to go for Steals and then obviously foul so Florida State you must again that was an issue on the road at Boston College not able to inbound the ball so again when we saw them shoot around working on those end the game situations obviously need to be aware too if you have timeouts last thing you want to do is throw the ball away second ones Miss Shrewsberry rooper nice pass Davis attacks block no theyre going to say go t count the basket and theyre going to take a look at it though and see I thought he might have gotten that on the way up now the initial it looked like it was still going up live what I saw the call for go tending is under review lets see ooh I dont know lets see now again right here ooh I think thats still going up thats close now it has to be indisputable now from that angle right there that ball looks like its still on the upward uh trajectory lets see again right here I think this is probably going to be our best angle and that ball looks like its so close they will confirm goal t Okay so again because they made the call as a goalen I think obviously it needed to be clear and again thats one of those where they could have gone either their way but the initial call go and I like what this crew did they didnt take a lot of time took a couple looks and it made the decision now see if the NS can inbound the ball they do to you it much cleaner this time Watkins up ahead Thomas executed perfectly by Florida State they lead by seven rooper truberry blocks right back back into his hands hell step back that three off to the left no goes out of bounds itll belong to Florida state with 93 seconds left you8 for George attack Clemson its on the ESPN app well get you out to West Durham and Coach beheim as soon as we can the nos trying to snap a four game skid Jackson finds Thomas he checks late now you and the Irish are going to call the dogs off a day after one of the biggest pieces of news in college basketball coach Hamilton resigning at the end of the year Florida State
