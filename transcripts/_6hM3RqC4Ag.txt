a Clemson seven straight ACC Road wins just one of the many program records this season its been a special year for the Tigers who win the tip this is a Clipson team that came from down 10 on the road against Virginia over the weekend theyre just playing their best basketball right time of the year 12 of their last 13 have resulted in wins the one loss came in triple overtime 5 Seconds to shoot chlin goes up and under to open the scoring well for me thats going to be the matchup Im going to have my eye on Ian sheflin is a matchup problem hes a guy thats averaging close to a double double and again uh Boston College must keep him out of the paint good dont it just flashed up the Bost College starting five Elijah strong misfires from three and notably Chad Benning not not in the starting lineup but is available to come off the bench did not play in that second half against Cal we talked about what a special year it is for Brad Brownell in this Clemson team those are all the record set by this Clemson team its remarkable and theres three guys I think uh in the running for Coach of the Year in the ACC Brad branell obviously Pat Kelce uh right now lot of folks have him at the top of the list but I would not rule out John Shire and Brad Brownell what they have done with their respective programs really phenomenal what is it for you that puts Brownell in that conversation I dont disagree with you I do feel like a lot of people do have Kelsey though as Hastings battles for the ball well recovered good battle Dylan Hunter wins it well for me its I want to wait lets wait till the seasons over I I think put a lot of emphasis on who wins The League uh as well too I think certainly that goes a long way plenty to play for as you talked about and Illustrated into tip for those three teams buying for an ACC regular season Championship good look inside Hastings draws the foul now were talking a lot about Brad Brown now these two coaches know each other very well Earl Grant was there at the beginning as Brad branell was building this Clemson team spent five years together and you know Brad branell said this is his least favorite team to play against because hes got got to go against his former assistant Earl Grant and Earl Grant a three and2 record against his former boss both these guys are two of the best and they both said the same exact thing pregame they hate playing this game because they are such a good friends obviously Earl spent a lot of time on Brad staff and both these guys seriously looked at us and said we hate this game uh because of that relationship they have its that tight hey we love talking with prad PR now he had a big big laugh talking about Earl Grant in The Times They had together but what he has done here in Clemson an Elite 8 appearance a year ago and this is a team poised for another Deep Run just feels like he gets them playing their best basketball when it matters most well the matchup of Fort Clemson Donald Han Jr right here again when we spoke with Brad branell he said thats going to be key defending to threepoint line Hastings in perfect position cleans up the spill plus the foul well its easier to see why the Boston College staff so high on this young man right here Hasting has all the physical tools thats a big time offensive rebound and PB you take a look at Hasting numbers he is going to be uh speaking with the coaching staff they think he can be an elite rim protector you look at what hes done in his three games where he started still very raw but all the physical attributes out there for him to Be an Effective player Chase Hunter pull up pop drills it you talk about First Team all ACC guys hes going to be on both of our pallots I know that and I think a big reason why I have them Peg to be a team that can go deep in the NCAA tournament that back court of Zachary and also Hunter foul on the rebound take another look at this Chase Hunter nothing but the bottom of the net well right now close to 17 points a game thats just a filthy cross a couple of NBA Scouts in the building to take a closer look at Chase Hunter and you know again I think hes one of those guys that has a future in the league because of how solid he is Hastings rocks the rim again hes got two flushes of the opening three minutes well if youre Earl Grant you have to be pleased with the energy that your team has come out with a nice little dump off pass by Chaz Kelly Hunter answers right to the rim Chase Hunter he can beat you so many different ways yeah that right there again got to do a better job trying to keep him out of the paint Kelly through traffic gets it to go in Boston College going punch for punch early with the number 11 team in the country so much for both these teams being solid defensively right now its been a offensive show early on and locking keeps it Applause going well nobodys missed it seems like everybody uh has scored every possession now we havent even played five minutes and its been really solid offense high percentage shots on both ends heres Dion Brown going against hunter in attack mode spinning his way free crafty take back and forth we go well the interesting thing theres only been one jumper one or two jumpers its everything else has been at the basket for little dump off passes Lockett lines up a good look and buries it Victor Lockett backto back baskets for the senior well the question coming into this season how do you replace BJ Hall a guy thats playing at the next level Victor Lockett has been that answer but he has been really good for them hes fit in seamlessly with this Clemson team chlin follows his own Miss heres Zachary hes actually been quiet facing his former team its been his tiger teammates that have had the hot hands early that ball deflected before it could find Zachary we step aside offensive explosion to start yeah this right here Victor Lock and showing off the range Clemson up three early the ability to pick pop out and stretch the defense he has threepoint range uh he has filled in nicely and answered that question coming into this season how do you replace the production that PJ Hall gave them and that was the biggest question mark for cson and lockin is filled beautifully shot clock down to two Chapin leaves it short Zachary chases down the offensive rebound heres chony Wiggins foot on the line Jak Hy breeder turns it over and theyre trying to post up Wiggins that time Boston College elected to go and double excellent job that time defensively of Boston College team defense coming down doubling causing a turnover Applause Music Deion Brown fires cant connect H seems trying to chase down the rebound and Clemson has numbers five on four Hastings hustling back and Wiggins takes it himself and the floater Falls well we saw Clemson warming up hour before the game that exact shot right there they spent about 10 minutes on that again its no mistake when you see players making shots like that little offbalance Runner thats something they practice again this is not an easy shot right here a little floater right at the fou line area soft touch defense backed up he made it look easy Clemson takes a fivepoint lead to Tigers team looking for an eighth straight ACC Road win Hastings a onehanded Hammer hes got three dunks to start this night well they may have to check the screws on that uh backboard there he has rocked the rim a couple of times high energy in thats another big time move fak the hand off and then kept it and went in for another Monster Jam hes got seven of DCs 11 on three Monster Jams getting the start in place of Chad venning and he has made Earl Grant look smart Brown spinning on Zachary almost forces a turnover Fred pay in the lane tough take RMS out no good well Hastings is a interesting Prospect a guy that added about 10 lbs of muscle during the off season and that Mobility right there thats a big time little faked the little dribble handoff kept it showed the mobility and Agility and finished at the rim and they are so high on his potential hes been putting the Highlight Reel together in this first half its a counteract braad Brownell has gone to the bench and brought in Christian Reeves a rim protector at 7 foot2 14 in Applause Orange they go to Reeves and he hammers it home instant impact Off the Bench for Christian Reeds well both uh bigs on on both sides Clemson and Boston colle theyve been very active defensively but more so on the pick and rolls theyve been very good picking and en rolling to the rim for some easy looks contested three rattles in and out it was halfway down for pay kick to the corner Wiggins got it johy Wiggins hes been brilliant in this first half off the bench and the Tigers taken eightpoint advantage and thats all set up though by Reeves diving hard to the post drew the defense with him that open up that passing Lane for that skip Court pass and Junior cant connect usually hell make you pay from there Clemson on a five nothing run looking for more Hunter got it well he is so good off of screens that time the help wasnt there and he just kned his way down got to his midrange and then hes got great touch a hunter for me I think hes one of the more underrated guards in college basketball look the ACC knows about him obviously LED his team to the Elite 8 last Applause year kick to the corner D Jones he cant connect Clemson in control though a 7even nothing Tigers run Boston College trying to end the drought and its stolen away itll say BC Ball but Clemson finding a good Rhythm here and this is all set up by the passing of Clemson right here Hunter to Rees with the dunk Clemson on a roll hard screens they have great spacing and then you have a decision on the back end do you cut and cut off the diver to the post or give up that passing Lane its just a great design play all set up though by their screening and also passing and it was Wiggins who cashed in on the three Clemson seven points Off the Bench early in this game a good bench boost and a 10point lead in control heres Josh Beetle hands it off for Hastings wasnt ready for it now Beetle hes facing his former team we talked about Jaden Zachary coming back to KY Forum but Beetle played three years for Brad brell at Clemson we remind you Saturday final day of the regular season it is loaded Sonic Blockbusters all over the place Alabama Auburn Arizona Kansas Duke and Carolina how good is that you cant uh beat that day right there and were in March right now and so much and there so much to play for but I think about that Carolina Duke game that is going to be huge North Carolina has been playing really well as of late thats going to be a big one Saturday for them right now Joel lardy has them last for in certainly though they win that game uh theres no doubt about it they will be on the Applause field well if you look at the way Carolinas been playing down the stretch of this season six straight wins I know Dukes been real real good as Jaden Zachary buries one against his former team but wouldnt shock me if they were able to pull that off with everything at stake playing at home with deam yeah and they figured it out and Hubert Davis and staff deserve a lot of credit theyve writed the ship theyve been playing really well Ive liked their balance their last game they had nine different players scoring obviously you know RJ Davis still one of the better scoring guards in college basketball but its been by chitan theyve been really good attacking the paint as well right here again Beetle playing against his former team little Shifty beautiful spin move almost had the and one Brad Brown Al Clemson head coach joked with us a little bit he goes youre seeing these trades now in in ACC play last season it was Ben Middlebrooks going to Etsy state in return getting Jack Clark who was part of that Elite 18 team and now Josh Beetle goes from Boston College to Clemson and Zachary goes from BC to to Clemson its its amazing that would have never happened when you were playing no and I think obviously thats the dynamic of it but certainly again these coaches have adjusted and adapted to the new normal thats uh certainly the environment were in and this guy right here has played a huge part in Clemson being uh the number 11 team in college basketball that back court they continue to play well Deion Brown answers after backto back baskets by Zachary hes starting to hunt his own shot pulls the trigger from three got it Jaden Zachary seven straight points against his former team well theyre familiar with that right there again we talked about it a guy scored over a th000 points in a Boston College uniform thats the part of his game I think the biggest Improvement look you know hes going to be solid defensively very good uh point guard but his threepoint shooting that has been the part that has separated him again right here in the paint but the range from the threepoint right there the help is late and hes feeling it early look at what hes done his last six games games hes been playing really well shooting at a high percentage and you see the assist numbers as well and the seals thats been constant throughout his career whether he was playing at Boston College or now this season with Clemson he stablished himself in the ACC being an elite defensive player yeah hes uh really were going to look at some of his steals numbers later on in the broadcast but its not even close the next guy uh after him you take a look at it active steel leaders in the ACC and thats pretty impressive right there if you look at some of the names that are on this list and he is by far well ahead of the next guy behind him so it goes in Testament to how well he has been defensively in this league and you know whats funny still to this day his career high is against Clemson in last years ACC tournament when Boston College knocked the Tigers out 22 points you think Brad Brownell looked at that performance and said we we could use him uh in Orange and credit again Earl Grant and staff have done a great job the Player Development you look at what theyve done with Donald Han Jr how well he has improved but Jaden Zachary every year got better under Earl Grant Applause I think when you look at the minutes per game to you know Zachary he started all three years hes even got you just edged out on the alltime threepoint uh field goal percentage Yeah Im blaming that one on my teammates if I had more touches I might have been able to get my percentage up but thats a whole another story but K has had a remarkable career right now though for Boston College and its been too easy uh for Clemson they got to try to somehow contest and then get out but I think these 5050 balls have really hurt them but Clemson has beat them to those offensive rebounds or loose balls Second Chance points the name of the game Jones he cant clean up his o spill Boston College finally emerges Deon brown with a head of steam kick to the corner hand buries it from Applause three as soon as hand left shot that ball Brad br El shook shook his head we asked him keys in this game he said that right here defending the threepoint line in particular in transition and thats excellent offense that time by Boston College nice pass ahead by Brown Eagles first made three of the night Clemson turns it over the tiger still in the drivers seat leading by 11 with Donald Han his last of 13 games has been over 40 getting plenty of burn get some starts for the Golden State Warriors and and obviously PJ Hall drafted by the Nuggets so again a lot of Talent on that court but certainly that was a huge win for Boston College to a team that eventually went to the elite eight Dion Brown drains the three Boston College cuts it to eight erl Grant three and2 against his former boss so you never know what can happen Brad ranell told us this is his least favorite matchup going against the man thats spent 5 years on now both these guys have done a great job in their Recruitment and also development of guys that have come into their program and PJ Hall was one of those guys I would have hated playing against him just so physical a tough matchup could do a little bit of everything for that Clemson team and you think the next Tiger thats going to put on an NBA jersey is Chase Hunter I know you said that a couple of times throughout the day absolutely theres a several NBA execs Scouts in the building tonight to take a closer look at him and and I say look hes just solid and I think about guys that have played in the ACC Alvarado who was at Georgia Tech just solid hes just a solid guy nothing flashy but again uh defends shoots the ball uh really well and just a great leader Alvarado is a great comparison for Hunter and thats the name I use when I was talking with Scouts they they ask and Im like look thats kind of how it reminds just that guy that that again will do all the little things necessary to win and Brad Brownell told us as Dylan hunter gets the rejection there that chase has been one of the best practice players hes had and a great leader and has helped pass that tradition that and the standard that has been set at Clemson down to the younger guys well he made an interesting comment about what Hunter has meant to the transfers as you take a look at sefin bodying his way into the lane but he said the transition for Jaden Zachary coming here and locking he even took it back to Joseph Gerard yeah uh he said Chase Hunter was the guy that was the leader that stepped up and made that transition easy for those guys they just Rave about his leadership hes made it look easy tonight a 12point lead for the Tigers looking for more Dylan Hunter delivers the hunter Brothers lighting it up on the road a 15point lead 51 from the floor I had to do a double take when I saw that stat uh 71 uh he has really been playing lights out for Clemson Hastings in perfect position to tip that in hes been the bright spot for Boston College in this first half and with that Hastings ties a season high of nine and I love his energy hes been really active on both ends Hasting and looking him run the floor right here Applause the trailer hand Junior that just rims out come on up ahead sheflin running the floor leaves it for Chase Hunter fading away and hits it well sheflin should get a assist for that again his touch passing that time again knew he couldnt come down with it and score gets rid of it before he comes down to Hunter all he had to do one dribble and pull up again unselfish Play Again by Ian SE and Hunter so efficient tonight as Beetle the hesitation pays off for Applause two locking kick to the corner shefflin a three got it Ian shefflin has taken over theyre putting on the Trope its a clinic right now with their passing again that time blocking unselfish with the roll could have easily shot that ball kicks it out to sefin theyre just facing the floor and then theyre making some beautiful passes unselfish play by Clemson strong answers with the corner three of his own and thats a beautiful skip Court pass by Beetle and much needed three by strong to slow down this run by Clemson sheflin the hot hand right now for the Tigers finds Jaden Zachary give it go here and sheflin pulls the trigger cant connect that Applause Music time Beetle going against his former team has a step Hastings there again how good has Jaden Hastings been on the glass tonight A careerhigh 11 well his activity has been the story of this first half for Boston College he has kept them in this game but its been the passing of Clemson sheflin again to Hunter Clemson still up 11 Stanford ended Boston Colleges hopes of competing at the ACC tournament remember those bottom three do not make the conference tournament this season Clemsons got a real shot to win it especially the way theyve played in this first half hu theyve been consistent all season long big reason why theyre balanced scoring offensively yeah I think that is a big reason why theyre so difficult to match up against its not just one guy any one of these guys can go off at any point for a a big night but theyre so balanced offensively and then sound defensively I would not be surprised to see them back into the elite eight or further this year in the NCAA tournament strong off the backboard heres hunter in attack mode goes right at Beetle Chase Hunter hes got 11 again some sometimes thats not bad defense thats just a tough shot guy going away on a runner up over the defense a soft touch but thats a tough shot youll live with that if youre Earl Grant not bad defense just the guy thats one of the better guards in college basketball Luca Taves Off the Bench and into the box court for Boston College Clemson in control an 11point lead for the Tigers shooting nearly 60 from the floor in this first half it has been an offensive Clinic here in Chestnut Hill and I like this sub by uh Earl Grant putting Taves into the game he has been really solid for them as of late they Rave about what hes going to mean to this Boston College program for the future Zachary tough take and he knocks it down just as Boston College trying to get closer theyve had to answer every time Applause Clemson and this right here again the reverse pivot look at the footwork young players take note under control him and Chason Hunter are two of the better guards in terms of playing off of two feet under Music control Taves no look pass to the corner strong got it and thats what Taves brings thats a beautiful pass a g Frey on the Baseline heads up Play Beautiful skip Court pass for a wideopen three they Rave about his Court Vision Luca Taves again this is all set up by the Freshman point guard beautiful Court Vision unselfish plays and in strong all he had to do was catch and shoot Bost of college on a mini 104 run theyve made five or their less seven as we remind you UFC 313 dont want to miss it this Saturday 10 pm eastern time you can order the main card ESPN pluscom PP Applause V well you know its going to be a heavyweight fight at the ACC tournament next week and Clemson and Brad Brown now they feel like they are bringing a team they could absolutely win an ACC Championship would be the first time since 1990 that they can hang a ACC Banner there at Little John Coliseum and why not again theyve already uh beat well lets lets call it what it is the favorite going into probably the ACC tournament in Duke and they have the experience as we take a look at another dime by Taves and Ill tell you what Hastings this has probably been his best half of basketball uh in a Boston College uniform uh he has been active on both ends but in particular offensively he has finished everything around the basket Hastings a perfect six for six from the floor faigh 13 points in this first half as Jaden Zachary the former BC Eagle winding down the first half clock now in attack mode Zachary into traffic and hell get two at the line this season what a success story and Errol Grant and staff deserve a lot of credit for his development uh but also his loyalty uh Earl Grant shared a funny story with us when he came to and said hey look Im thinking about but going in the transfer portal and moving on and when he found out it was Clemson he said look the relationship he had with Brad Brown now he said look you got to do it uh he was happy for him but uh make no mistake about it Earl Grant and his staff deserve a lot of credit for his development but that young man bet on himself and what a great story right now his team a 12point lead another time Luca Taves the last three times down the floor Taves has earned an assist for Boston College and the Eagles cut it to 10 in Zachary a Clemson showed why in that first half this Tigers team has won 12 of their last 13 if they hold on to this 10point lead it would Mark eight straight ACC Road wins this is a Clemson team poised for another deep postseason Marron good rebound by lockin Zachary the trailer lines up the three missed it offensive rebound chlin lost the handle up ahead to Elijah strong and he puts it up and in for two great Outlet pass that time and strong did a great job not bringing the ball down one quick dribble then went right back up with it great transition offense by Boston College Music chlin stripped Applause again Clemson an eightpoint lead with eight seconds to shoot ball underneath their own hoop a reminder if you missed it in the first half program records that this Clemsons team has set this season it has been a special season for brown brown now and this group Hunter this fires big there boss to college with a little momentum to start this second half strong stays in attack mode and just like that its a two possession game and thats a strong move by strong again not sure how he was able to keep his balance through contact and able to finish with the soft touch Zachary tough take Jaden Zachary thats a vintage Zachary bucket and every time Boston College feels like theyre going to get closer uh this a Clemson team has had an answer that time Zachary nice little jump stop and pull up jumper off the glass to stop the run of Boston College Zachary has 13 facing his former team started three years for Boston College before moving down south to Clemson and right here again great transition offense by Boston College and then Zachary with the answer again he and Hunter do a great job playing off of two feet theyre very under control rarely do you see them pick up charges and they complement each other so well you would never know that theyve been playing with each other for less than a year absolutely and thats a great point that chemistry and that goes to I think the leadership of Chase Hunter embraced him with open arms heres Chaz Kelly for Boston College shot clock down to five Fades away and gets it to go jaaz Kelly his second bucket of the night keeps it as a sixpoint lead for Clemson and thats a tough move by Kelly again youre going to have to do that against this Clemson team and theyre not going to give you a lot of ball reversals and swings so youre going to have to go make individual plays but Clemson has had the answer again this time Chase Hunter with the pullup three big time three from Hunter whos been so good tonight six of eight two of three from three that rolls around does not drop for Applause hand kick to the corner Zachary working against Dion Brown Beautiful drive off the window and in for two Jaden Zachary up to 15 points tonight and thats just too easy again its easy said than done but you just cant allow yourself to get beat off the dribble in the paint paint touches kill you that time again Zachary into the paint easy luck layup Jaden Zachary starting to take over and again you have them deep in the shot clock to help that time Hastings again you have to make a decision because the bigs of Clemson they can step out and shoot locking and also sheflin can shoot thre so you make a decision do you help and give up open threes or allow your guys to bait oneonone and that time the Clemson offense went out Zacharys homecoming got his Boston College degree last spring after three years with the Eagles hard foul underneath Kelly went right into traffic second personal foul second foul and theyre going to say he was in the act of shooting that rolls off the rim no good on the first take another look yeah again he started his upward motion so again from the initial angle it looked like we were blocked but he definitely was on his way up and thats twice now Chaz Kelly to aggressive moves to the basket Boston colleges three of six from the foul line tonight Kelly makes it four of seven with that Applause make no doubt number 11 Clemson still in the drivers seat 10point lead but Boston College staying within Striking Distance the time ERS unable to separate so far in this second Music half chff calls for it gets it hell usually make you pay another opportunity Zachary drives in rejected Elijah strong swats it Applause away thats great help and Recovery by strong to break up what looked like was going to be another layup for Zachary heres Dell Jones lines up the Music Applause Music three strong gets it to go Elijah strong hes got 13 for BC tonight and whats so key about that locken spent so much energy getting out hedging on that ball screen now thats going to loosen up of that ball screen for Boston colge because strong is starting to knock down jumpers lockin trying to answer on the inside and he Applause traveled well Eliza strong right here pick pop out Boston College on a little roll time of the world in the uh college basketball calendar and plenty to play for for these teams but certainly a big big one this weekend coming up a North Carolina Duke never disappoints foul called on the inside and Boston College could continue to chip away at this lead Clemson led by as many as 16 in this game and theyve done a great job of Boston College obviously it starts with their defense and then theyve been setting some good screams and getting high percentage shots and we talked about strong ball screens setting a hard screen and then opening himself up popping out and then that time a nice little back cut again the passing but it all starts with their defense theyve been getting stops against this Clemson team bosu college is cut what was once a 16point lead to five the Eagles wont be put away they keep hanging around here at home closest the margin of his bid since it was 16 11 Applause chlin count it plus the foul Ian chlin when you need a bucket number four usually delivers and both of these teams setting some great screens Chaplan freed up look at the screen now he forces Hasting to come over dump ball pass and one didnt see much contact there from that angle nonetheless though uh hes at the free throw line and weve talked about how good he has been over the last four games 17 points 10 rebounds averaging a double double and shooting 71 tie up ripped away Victor lockin those are the hustle plays that have helped separate cson throughout this season cant cash in that time though and Junior in transition in attack mode lock in good transition defense back and forth we go chase Hunter into contact and hell get two at the line back and forth both teams trying to get up and down and unable to convert right here again great defense by locken to stay out of his way just a win up and then on the other end Hunter going right at strong and windes up at the free throw line Hunter with 14 tonight too shy of his season average just over 16 points per game in the key stat with Chase Hunter hes got the second most starts at one school amongst active players so 119 starts at Clemson the consistency that he has had while hes been at Clemson really uh Second To None phenomenal and a big reason why they went to the Elite 8 last year and theyre the number 11 team in the country right now his leadership the coaches Rave about it to go along with his game player retention so valuable in todays age of college basketball and Brad Brown now keeping guys like Chase Hunter and Ian sheflin has helped this program year in and year out stay solid stay balanced keep the Applause culture and it is shown up on the road once again Tigers closing in on what would be their eighth straight ACC Road win now Huck its hard to get one ACC Road win you know how difficult it is in conference to go on the road and get a win how has Clemson been able to make it so effortless on the road this season well theyre in some pretty good company but you take a look it starts with their back court I think the back court obviously a Zachary to go along with Hunter but theyre bigs of both of them sheflin and also locken two of the better passing bigs uh in college I think that balance really is what made them makes them difficult to match up against Boston College not going away though that rims out no good from Fred Applause Payne bua Taves back into the game for Boston College I felt he gave them a great boost to close out the half three assists did a nice job breaking down to Clemson defense and then setting his teammates up for some easy opportunities Hunter great feed sheflin couldnt quite handle it re gathers it kicks it out wide open three no good Applause Boston College two and A2 minutes without a made basket they go to Hastings he has not missed tonight and that continues Jaden Hastings a perfect seven for seven from the floor his footwork I mean that right there thats a big time move a little fake spin come back to your strong hand and raise up JY Wiggins answers on the other end Applause and thats what makes a good team great is when Boston College or an opponent this season has gotten within Striking Distance it feels like clebson has always had the answer and thats the sign of a good Music team Taves cant connect Clemson has been pushing it in this second half Zachary looking for the trailer good defense Dion Brown the steal and the Finish thats great anticipation by Brown an errant pass by Zachary one of the few mises hes had and brown read it all the Applause way and a travel a challenge not going away well the Freshman Jaden Hastings with the footwork Big Time finish the Boston College though still trailing 57u in December 15 to9 and you didnt know what Boston College youd get after a disappointing West Coast trip you get swept by Stanford and Cal mathematically eliminated from qualifying for the ACCC tournament you go down by 16 early against this Clemson team in Boston College has not thrown in the towel no they thought all the way and theyve made some really nice plays on both ends Dylan Hunter cant cash in from three Hastings spins around finds Dion brown brown scooped to the hoop and bossing College back within five and thats all set up Hastings with the nice Outlet pass rebound grab the 5050 ball and then throw it ahead heres Chase Hunter looking for lockin picks it up doesnt score another Miss by a Tigers team that is Fallen cold for the first time tonight Brown transition triples good its a twopoint game and Brad Brownell at half court deciding and I think hes going to call a timeout to stop this run by Boston Applause College time out Clemson its a 7 nothing Boston College run and its all set up by the defense Brown though with the three Boston College within two theyve done a great job creating offense with their defense they Clemson six turnovers after just two in the first half six in the second half looking to regain their footing the lead cut to two going inside Victor locken working against Hastings nice take Victor lockin delivers out of the timeout well if youre Clemson I think thats what you need to get back to theyve been settling a for some jumpers are playing more on the perimeter try to get locking some touches in the paint and then play from there ripped away Chase Hunter and gives it right back uncharacteristic in this second half by Jaye Hunter thats now seven turnovers for this Clemson team and even better hustle by Hastings running back breaking that play up but hunter comes up limping after that defensive stand now this is the Victor lockin bucket that ended a 2 and 12 minute scoring drought for Clemson take another look at it so youre going to take a look at locking right here again a great footwork both these bigs have displayed excellent footwork but on the other end I think this is something well watch that looked like he just slipped and not if he rolled his ankle but hes over getting looked at right now by the trainer they taken out of this game temporarily well get you an update as soon as we have one brown been aggressive in this second half Miss is there good defense by chlin and hes rewarded with the rebound Zachary its good Jaden Zachary hes got 18 against his former team and that was a big one right there to give Clemson a little breathing room just fourpoint shy of Zacharys career high which came nearly a year ago against Clemson playing for Boston College a reversal here in March 50 Weeks Later Music stolen away Zachary nearly two steals per game draws the foul in transition hes doing it all for the Tigers right now back here at BC hes one of the alltime steel leaders in the ACC right here clean pick and then Off to the Races again he is just so good defensively you got to be uh cogent when hes around the ball hes going to try to get his hands on it you take a look at it active leaders hes clearly at the top in the Applause ACC shot clock down to 10 Dell Jones The Freshman hoists it cant hit it Applause Brad Brownell not happy with that shot right there Elijah strong went right into traffic re gathers it after the Applause Miss Brown driving Bas line finds Taves for a three too much on Applause it Jones forced it that time no call despite contact transition three and missfires offensive rebound Elijah strong nowhere to go with it and a jump ball underneath Victor lockin tangled up with Dion Brown phenomenal job though so much goes on behind the scenes uh making all this happen so thank you to all those guys and GS and weve gotten a great one to finish at least the kti Forum season final home game of the year for BC and they are hanging with number 11 Clemson chlin out of the timeout thats a big man move chefin delivers and if youre strong right there again youre trying to flop or youre trying to uh draw a charge and again you got to hold your ground thats just too easily at this point at the game again right here youre giving up some size but again youd rather stay behind youre trying to get a charge if you dont get that again its just too easy the helps not there again great spacing by Clemson and recognition the Boston College cut this game to 6260 since that point 7 nothing Clemson Run BC has missed five in a row the Tigers defense has intensified and forced a scoring drought of 3 minutes Music Applause now well one of the things Boston College was doing on their run they were get getting out in transition thats hard to do when Clemsons getting buckets so Clemsons done a nice job scoring and also in their transition defense keeping them out Boston College offensive rebound pay good to see Chase Hunter come into the game after the timeout the senior limed off the court earlier this half he has been terrific tonight as he usually is 16point performance and hes just solid again the best comp I can say there was a guy at Georgia Tech playing now in the league Jose Alvarado he was just so solid very very solid for that team and thats Chase Hunter again hes a guy that just doesnt flashy but just makes winning plays and you know what Alvarado did in his senior season won the ACC tournament the chase Hunter certainly looking to do that next week ACC Tournament begins on Tuesday got to close this one out first good recovery there by Clemson after the turnover uncharacteristic turnovers lockin cant clean up the spill and a frustration foul Elijah strong Drew championship for the first time since 1990 so you know these Clemson fans are going to have to root for Carolina something theyre not used to doing a lot to play for its a great time of the year and those games really so much at stake but certainly that Duke North Carolina a lot at stake obviously standings in the ACC but also for a team in North Carolina who has been playing really well as of late trying to solidify their tournament uh resume Brad brownells Clemson team got the sweep of the Carolina schools for the first time in program history beat Wake Forest EDC State Duke in Carolina in a single season it has been a special year for this Tigers program and they are getting tested on the road tonight just a fivepoint lead Jaden Zachary with an opportunity to add to it from the free throw line hes got 18 points against his former team four shy of a career Applause Music high and despite a 4 and4 Conference record this is a BC team that has been difficult to put away two wins when theyve been trailing by 15 or more they fell down by 16 early but a battle back impressive fashion and no Grant again they deserve a lot of credit uh his team continues to play hard and youre right they have given Clemson everything they can handle the number 11 team in college basketball right now theyre in a fight against this Boston College team especially when you consider they were mathematically eliminated from CCC tournament contention over the weekend you would not know it with the way theyre playing count it plus the foul Jaden Hastings hes got 17 a career high what a special night this is all set up though look at Luca Taves he has been in the Paint Court Vision on point another dime and finish for Hastings who has had his best game uh at as a Boston College Eagle his previous career high coming into tonight was nine hes now doubled it 18 points doubling the careerhigh Jaden Hastings and its a onep possession game with 621 left and I like the change up by Earl Grant again his teams uh come with a little full court pressure lets see what they drop back in to now they drop back into man heres Dylan Hunter now Victor lockin shot clocked down to five Chase hunter in attack mode flies to the rim and draws the foul hell get two at the line thats great Patience by Clemson Hunter could have easily pulled and shot this three decides not to get to the basket again excellent patience and thats why they are such a good road team are that better an experience this is a guy at the free throw line the leader of a team that went to the elite eight last year in Chase Applause Hunter well they have been so difficult to beat this season only five losses on the year and three of the five have come in overto theyve got six straight wins since that latest loss to Triple overtime lost to Georgia Tech seven straight wins on the road like you were just talking about hawen and when they went up 16 points early youre thinking all right this is Clemson theyve been a buzzsaw one of the hottest teams in all of college basketball and credit Boston College theyve continued to battle back tonight Hunter restores a fivepoint lead with 550 to play Applause Hastings calling for it on the Block they get it to him going against Chase Hunter thats a mismatch double team comes in passes out of it and a foul committed by Dylan Hunter closing down Luca Taves thats the ninth foul against Clemson so one more and Boston College will be in the double bonus the rest of the way Donald Han despite BC playing well in this game theyve shut down the Eagles top scorer just one of nine tonight and that back court Zachary and also Hunter that was the focus coming into this one obviously defending the threepoint line and then anytime you play against Boston College uh Donald H Jr is at the top of the scouting report but the other guys have picked up the slack in particular this prman point guard Luca Taves have been really good for Earl Grant Off the Bench tonight is it any shock that a guard that Jadens is defending is having a season low hes done that throughout his Applause career one possession game the Clemson lead which was once 16 is down to three offensive foul Boston College dialed in defensively they are bringing it to number 11 Clemson here in this second half great defense right here on ball a defense and Earl Grant is loving that defensive effort Fred Payne getting a lot of accolades from his coach for that defensive stand right there and junor in attack mode working against Chase Hunter only three points tonight for Han Jr too much on that one Hunter rips down the rebound and a foul called well speaking with Brad Brownell before the game he said this is my least favorite team to play in the ACC cuz I got to go against Earl Grant who spent five years as my assistant Earl Grant a three and2 record in five games against his former Boston its been another terrific battle again between two guys that know each other extremely well yeah this has certainly has been one of the better performances by this Boston College team defensive pressure Relentless right now and this change up you would never look you would never know it by looking at the way BC has played particularly in this second half that they were mathematically eliminated from ACC tournament play this has been a gutsy effort final home game of the season with number 11 Clemson in town just a threepoint game with four minutes and 30 seconds to play shock clock down to six Jaden Zachary going against his former team kicks to the corner Hunter wasnt ready for it and its another Tigers turnover and and thats one Hunters got to let fly not sure if he mishandled that but its a simple dribble Drive kick that one he certainly needs to let that one go when hes open Taves for the tie couldnt connect Zachary lost his footing Wiggins lost the handle and its Boston College ball thats now 11 second half turnovers for this Clemson team that all season long has valued the ball and rarely turns it over and Brad branell and staff talked about the physicality that Boston College Plays with and thats just a great hustle play that time again Hastings getting his hand on the ball coming up with a Applause turnover we take under four minutes to play the turnovers have piled up for Clemson in this second half its left the door cracked for Boston College Dylan Hunter big takeaway there and Clemson cash in on the offensive End Tigers at a 2 and 12 minute scoring drought here chefin passes out of the double team Dell Jones The Freshman scoop to the hoop for two well his first step is lightning quick oh he was there in a flas beautiful reverse layup and finish thats a tough move to give Clemson a fivepoint lead Jones first basket of the night and its a big one going inside Hastings Jaden Hastings a perfect8 for eight from the floor now well be at the foul line when we come back weve got a good one on a Wednesday night in the ACC dont miss this finish seems who has doubled his career best previous high was nine hes at 18 tonight and hes at the free throw line here this is the first and BCs doing this impressively without their usual starting big man Chad venning who despite being available has not touched the court tonight Hastings is filled in beautifully he has made the most of those minutes although 0 for two at the line costly free throws there with three minutes to play Applause heres Dylan Applause Hunter and now Jaden Zachary with 10 seconds to shoot off to sheelin goes right into Hastings leaves it short offensive rebound Victor Applause Music lockin lengthy possession here from Clemson can they cash in Zachary kicks to the corner the extra pass Dylan Hunter cant hit it from three locking fouled dripping down another rebound you know Clemsons football coach dbo Sweeney is nicknamed Victor locken the lockin Ness monster and he certainly was that on the glass that possession I like that and this right here again just great work on the offensive blast Boston College in a scramble situation right there off the ball movement of Clemson and unable though to come up with the defensive rebound double double for lock in tonight feels like the bigger the stage the better he plays at 22 points of the win against Duke and Carolina this season and for me he has been the exactor weve talked about it now coming into this season how do you replace PJ hall guy whos playing at the next level in the NBA and locking has been that guy hes been the answer Brad Brownell doesnt like the call under the rim thinks it should have stayed Tigers way lets take another look yeah I cant really tell again both guys going for the ball but now Clemson changing up and putting on a little full court pressure and now they drop back into their normal manto man and Boston College has not scored in the last three minutes Clemson clinging to a fivepoint advantage on the road Eagles have missed nine of their last 10 theyve Fallen cold at the wrong time after a heroic second half comeback and the missing Applause continues that might be a frustration foul after the Eagles offense comes up empty again a scoring drought of now 3 minutes and 30 seconds and thats a veteran move though by the veteran Jaden Zachary again understanding theyre in the bonus Boston College that time pay got a little too aggressive and Zachary sold that foul got himself to the free Thro Applause Music line so Zachary steps to the line 19 points to lead all scorers tonight makes the front end of the one and one you know Clemson hasnt played in many tight games unlike Boston Collins who we just showed has been in plenty of tight games theyve got 14 wins by 10 or more in ACC play so 14 of their 16 wins by 10 or more and thats some pretty good company those two Duke teams were very good and youre absolutely right it shows to just how good they have been in conference play I mean it has been a historic season and when you can get that many comfortable wins in conference a lot of those on the road again even though Boston College has battled in this second half theyve stayed within Striking Distance Clemson has always answered BC unable to take the lead and get a foot in front now Hunter winding down the clock 90 seconds left in regulation looking to add to the sevenpoint lead chff a three no good Applause no points in the last four minutes and 15 seconds for BC Clemson has dialed in defensively when its mattered most Taves the floater doesnt drop another tiger stop they have clamped down the stretch of this game under a minute left in it and not a bad look that time by Taves hes got a pretty good look for a floater right there just unable to Applause finish shot clock down to eight chefin spins in tips it in and sheflin and thats what youll see him do that multiple times in the game rebound his own Miss and tap it back in he is a handful a 6 nothing Clemson run in Boston College in a five minute scoring drought the Eagles are going to go scoreless for the final 5 minutes and 30 seconds of this game missing 11 of their last 12 in credit the Clemson grit the defense delivers again and make it eight straight ACC Road wins for number 11 Clemson well they got all they can handle from Boston College uh Earl
