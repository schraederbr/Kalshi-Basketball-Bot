and 7655 last night to eliminate NCAA tournament B Clemson and we are underway BC winning the opening tip and this guy Jaden Zachary their point guard at a big night last night with 22 Bell Harris at 27 a Quinton post who gets the touch here he is the star the sevenfooter at 17 points8 rebounds a game Batson on the drive getting Airborne opening second here Boston College to retain and OB I was interested to see how Virginia would start this game who would guard claudell Harris with those 27 as you mentioned but the accs Defensive Player of the Year Reese beakman will guard Zachary thats off the inbounds will air mail that hes been really up and down at a cold shooting night against Miami he was two for Music 10 so Virginia 229 they regrouped with a win Over Georgia Tech to Clos the regular season but they have lost four of their last seven loose ball thatll be controlled by Dunn and a second chance here for the Cavaliers Virginia with a different starting line out lineup as Blake youan and is inserted into the starting lineup Tony Bennett has tweaked the lineup again thatll rattle home for Harris who picks up where a left off last night with the 27 yeah except for he was 5 for 14 from Beyond The Ark last night not as efficient however gets a great start here one of one for clao Harris who has played very well here in Applause DC dun on the wing hands off for beakman the 63 senior in and out by McNeely could be a real key in this one tonight Boston College gets it to Harris again with another triple the the advantage of having played games having a rhythm going offensively already Virginias last game was Saturday and of course the Eagles have played two games on this floor already and play well offensively in both of those pman outstanding passer as well six assists per game so noted for his defense Buchanan getting into the paints and Bs it in and thats what Blake Buchanon gives Tony Bennett more of an offensive minded player but also a taller player to go up against Quinton post whos not just going to get the job done on the Block hes going to hurt you on the perimeter as well Zacharys at a really fine tournament Harris wants another one oh my is he coming out firing another one nothing but net three threes and thats the decision for Tony Bennett after you see a guy go for 27 do you put ree beakman on him tough shot there by Ryan Dunn as he gets it to go great recognition by Ryan Dunn cutting to the basket knowing exactly where ree bman would deliver the basketball and gets the bucket but how long can Tony Bennett go and allow claudo Harris to light this fire mlon ran into a big Applause wall and now bman will set it up for Tony Bennett beakman lost the handle on that rolled in his hand 1648 to go here in the first half clao Harris who was five of 14 from Beyond the threepoint Arc three for three already to start this game and hes allowing his teammates to know Im him as he points to his chest M Ney tried to Slither a pass but Matson was there to intercept two early turnovers for Virginia team that only averages 84 turnovers a game tops in the country Music Applause Quinton post with a touch spinning past Buchanan to lay it in he takes advantage of the Freshman the senior who took Miami apart on Tuesday night with 30 points 13 rebounds a lot of foul trouble against Syracuse last night but against Syracuse he had seven assists so he wasnt doing as much from his scoring standpoint but also facilitated so had eight rebounds yanon with a shot clock at six mcney up top beakman shot clock at two he gets to the foul line but it wont drop and a scrap for it will see a foul as well Boston College Scrappy as a team certainly and here they are trying to play their way into the semis BC on top of Virginia 11 to four especially Reese simply because Tonys driving I think Reese will must prer to be the guy with the steering wheel in hand I think so Neta 52 DPI 57 two wins against quad 1s lardi says among the last four in that theyre safely in with a victory post try to bounce into the paint trying to Target mlin but bed Applause Music away Groves will give it up heres bakman mcney will get the shot away but it wont fall its going to be important for McNeely to make sure that claudell Harris has to defend him as Tony Bennett has made the switch now Ryan Dunn will guard Claud out Harris however now you got to deal with Quinton post already four made threepoint field goals for Boston College as the big fer has gotten involved in the mix yeah he can fire it out there too 43 from three in the Virginia victory over Boston College was 7268 that was one that the Cavaliers desperately needed bman and the catch made by gross came out of nowhere to lay it in Jake rose with a basket well being the Rees beakman leades the ACC and assist Im calling the p pass OB hell take Applause it Jaden Zachary gave it off for the big Applause fella Zachary gets it back goes in strong for two tough take by JayZ going to the bucket Jay grov had a great job of staying vertical but zacher with the concentration to finish it off Boston College they do a good job taking care of the ball solid offensive team but 75 points per game and a whistle with 1355 to play in the half the nice back door set up by Jaden Zachary and then the concentration never takes his eyes off the target stays eyes on the rim even through the contact and is able to finish it off claudell Harris with number one t Mur back on the floor here for Tony Bennett T Murray played a career high 28 minutes against Georgia Tech in the regular season finale 12 points for him earning more and more time off Tony Bennett bench going for the back door cut but a Applause turnover and a 16 to6 Advantage often times we see Quinton post at the top of the key this time defensive miscommunication by Virginia gives him enough space to line up and knock down the three ball post again around and out this Applause time now Virginia already with a handful of turnovers downstairs its Miner bottled up still try to get the shot up there but nothing doing OB Virginia is the fourth higher seed that weve watched come out struggle on all defense to start the game its taking him a little while to get into it post with a fall away no strong stand there by Jord mono not allowing post to back him down and get closer to the Applause Music basket pman will set it up now for Tony Applause Bennett Murray just into the contest and hell drop it in and great recognition by Tame Murray to recognize that Quinton post was not coming over to challenge him so that he could drop it off gets a shot on the rim softly and gets a Applause Music bounce mlon downstairs post banging away cant finish but the tip is up and in mcglockton and thats what de mton adds to this lineup even when hes not getting the basketball hes a GU that continues to pursue extra opportunities on the offensive glass 106 rebounds the game not a big scorer but he can crash the glass beakman nearly lost the handle on that throws back for beakman heres McNeely to turn and fire and in and out man that was in the cylinder got a good look and of course Isaac MC can make those shots but give CLA o Harris a lot of credit for getting out Applause challenging Harris Jr and that one up and over the top of the backboard it goes back over to Virginia official Boston College by 10 early just getting started here in this quarterfinal the last one of the Applause evening one game losing to North Carolina and Joel Barry who went on to become a national champion in 2017 the year after Virginia held eight points so far trying to cut into this lead Ro coming into the game will knock back a triple big bucket for Andrew roie who did not play his first DMP of the Season against Georgia Tech in the regular season finale but making his presence felt early in this Applause one shot clock to seven post sees that just got the front of the iron Miner was right there in his grill so Virginia trying to grab some offensive momentum roie giving a nice one off the bench beakman on Zachary pretty good match up there tane Murray from the foul line drops it in Applause and suddenly Virginia has come to life yeah two buckets for Tame Murray one from Andrew Roy so Virginia getting some rare bench Applause points Zachary looking for an answer he gives it away bman out of the pack with it bman pushing the temple left top done with a slam talk about a lightning strike and a seven nothing run and the Virginia faithful in full throat here well this should be a heavily populated UVA crowd Madson Virginia the closest school the closest ACC school to this Arena so Im sure that the tickets were in high demand for the orange and blue here as theyve shown up to support the hoop Applause under N9 and a half before halftime here in our last quarterfinal roie wants to hit a long one but thats going to be well short boy Dunn was going up he was about to make Sports Center and he was absolutely on his way straight to Sports Center if he would have been able to finish that one off and a whistle on the Baseline there with 91 to go but even though he didnt finish that one over he may be on Sports Center anyway Ryan Dunn looking into the rim as he finishes off the Beautiful alleyoop from Reese beakman as the Wahoos on the bench are loving the energy that has been provided by the guys coming off the bench Taye Murray Andrew roie getting involved in the Game knocking down buckets and giving this Virginia team some energy Jordan Miner just picked up a foul moments ago and that one just thrown out so Virginia suddenly grabbing big mole here as they have cut this lead to five against BC Dante Harris back into the into the lineup for the first time a young man who played his home games here when he was with Georgetown also the Big East tournament Most Valuable Player a few seasons ago Murray bounces for Dunn Dunn rolling they double him up tried to swing it for Harris and thats out of play and done missed Blake Buchan who had a wide open dump underneath he Pats himself on the chest letting Blake know I should have got it there unable to do it but often times difficult to see out that double team but a missed opportunity for Virginia thats four turnovers for the Cavaliers Cory mentioned the number one in the country in fewest turnovers per game a little over eight nothing new for Tony Music Bennett tough shot there by hand to knock it in I tell you right now OB no one in this game wants to have a bigger game than that young man right there Donald Han Jr grew up of course a UVA fan as his father played for University of Virginia from 1998 to 2002 Dante Harris roie UK Canan some contact no Applause whistle hand with a pull up pop and too strong 2215 BC the 11 seed we already had one upset tonight in our first quarterfinal of the night session and C State knocking off the number two seed to Duke Blue Devils Harris Murray finding a little of the paint enough to get two to go down T Murray playing with a tremendous amount of confidence on the offensive end of the floor and you got to love how guys stick with the plan with Tony Bennett tame Murrays minutes have been inconsistent throughout the year however at the end of the season hes playing his best Applause basketball hson steps back fires in and out the glockton will give him another Music chance and trying to take that Baseline but shut off there by Murray dun tried to save it but he was over that line and we will take a timeout here 652 remaining in Washington DC in the first half Austin College still on top of Virginia 2217 shout out to Longwood and James Madison both representing the great state of the of Virginia already in the mix as the University of Virginia still hanging around on the bubble according to ESPN Bracketology I believe theyre in though OB regardless of whether they win this game regardless I believe theyre in Harris cant find the range there he was really hot out of the gate he hit the first three threes and Im going to go as far as to say I believe that Wake Forest is in I Pittsburgh is in I think the ACC will have six teams in the NCAA tournament this year because I believe the committee will recognize that this league is much better than its been given credit for this entire season you talk about eye test Murray goes down the lane cant connect he has come into this game with a full head of steam for Tony Bennett absolutely has he attacked that Rim I thought he was going to try to take off on that one OB got his steps together post start well away from the Music basket under six minutes before the break and Zachary got it free shot clock at five way downt and thatll be well short by hand here was with the shot clock winding down 2217 Applause BC mcney quite dangerous beyond the threepoint line 45 beakman for Buchanan Quint po who averages 18 block shots per game contesting that shot not allowing Buchanan to get a clean look and now battling for the ball on the other end post with that left hand and in and out and a foul thats going to go the other way so no basket the foul go against BC and Deon mlon with number Applause one so the scoring stalling out on both sides here roie back in the game and Murray will hit the bench now for the Cavaliers but great minutes from tane Murray coming off the bench giving Virginia offensive spark six points for Murray already in this Applause game Music roie driving that Baseline great job by roie keeping his dribble alive not picking it up turning it over beakman shot clock to five on post roie thatll rattle home thats a perfect offensive possession for Virginia Tony Bennett wants to use the clock they use the clock and at the end of the shot clock ree beakman touches the paint finds Andrew Roy who knocks down his second threepoint field goal of the game youre right you snipped that off thats Virginia basketball thats Virginia basketball at a nutshell that one possession throw coming over to double up on post twopoint game suddenly Harris at the elbow too strong now the Cavaliers with a chance to tie it or take the lead Groves hits it nothing but net first lead tonight for Virginia and thats when Virginias at their best when theyre shooting the three and shooting it Applause well Madson wants to answer and he does all neet strong response from Madson as he struggled only one of 10 vers Virginia in the first match up between these two teams on February 28th one of 10 from Beyond a threepoint r makes a big one there when hes hot he really gets hot hes 40 out there for the year McNeil sealed mcne wont wait he like the look he got but it wont fall Jaden Zachary coming up 22 last night point guard trying to dump it downstairs and a foul against Virginia roie trying to get in front of his man 25 523 RO with foul number one run continues his movement as he goes Baseline keeps his dribble alive gets the basketball out for Virginia they dont panic as the shot clock gets low you see Reese beakman still with 5 Seconds keeps his Poise keeps his Pace finds roie who knocks down his second threepoint field goal of the first half Virginia makes you defend the entire third 30 seconds of the shot clock Boston College with the ball Quinton post with a nice pass but Buchanan converged on it loose ball Madson spins into the lane and hits great job by Madson coming up with the loose ball Virginia trying to save it under the basket of course which is one the Cardinal sends you never try to save the basketball under your opponents basket gives up an easy opportunity for Madson off the loose ball so BC on the broken play thats going to be a foul and one Rees beakman going airborne and a quick answer for the senior the foul by Zachary is first the first basket of the game for Reese beakman who leads Virginia in scoring 143 points per game also leads the ACC in assist where he has five already in this game the defensive player of the year now with three points in this one Nam to the second Team all ACC which of course I completely disagree with but more on that later I dont I dont think youre alone necessarily Harris back from mlock yes and a foul strong take by Devon mcglaughlin to the rim in the beautiful find and we talk about Reese Beakmans playmaking where Jaden Zachary does the same for Boston College actually that was claudell Harris with a nice find thats his first assist he didnt have one yesterday but his ability to score the basketball draw so much attention he was able to find mlin for the tough bucket an opportunity for the am one second foul on Buchanan he goes to the bench mlon a 71 foul Shooter had a huge game against Georgia Tech back in January he scored 30 points so he could be a factor Boston College by four 220 left in the first Applause half beakman slowing it Applause down re the senior from Milwaukee will let it fly and the rebound by claudell Harris Harris Unstoppable early bson will catch and fire post giving them a second chance and thats where Boston College was able to hurt Crimson yesterday outrebounded the Tigers 4327 had 13 offensive rebounds in that game Zachary wants a shots he fills it up from threepoint L and JayZ taking advantage of it three more Second Chance points for the Eagles as Virginia took a lead but Boston College now racing their lead back out to seven there six out of 13 from three Virginia answers quickly Jake Groves Only Hits about 48 when he takes him yeah only that I mean again you would think that might guy might want to look at more opportunities not enough 3point F goal attempts to really qualifi for any of the league leads but 48 hes at the top of the chart Applause Zachary Zips the pass to mton shot clock at seven and the last 45 seconds of the half of this quarterfinal of the ACC tournament post rampaging down the lane you dont find a lot of seven Footers that can do that OB but weve had the fortunate pleasure of being able to watch two of them tonight K filipowski in game one and now Quenton post a lot of skill big man in the ACC sevenfooter the all ACC second team selection for Boston College 7 Seconds split between the game and shot clock beakman on Zachary mcney Ros open not this time Groves High up for the rebound and a whistle Ted Valentine blew the whistle 86 to Applause go 3529 Boston College Virginia with just a brief lead a few moments ago they get mlock in for Music Applause second and so Earl Grant will bring a league Bay the 67 sophomore onto the floor and weve got a timeout Virginia this is a quick one 30 seconds just 86 seconds left before halftime my store and my design business work the Bears are unable to make it into the semi final round but however weve seen big upsets today last play here before the half beakman to take it went high off the window the tip wont drop and there it is Boston College leading for most of the first 20 minutes and a strong first half by Boston College they came half tame Murray will start the second half after his strong production from him in the first half six points so Virginia opens up the second half of the basketball here at Capital One Arena Murray up top for mcne they move it here for beakman mcney catches and shoots rebound tapped out offensive board and another try here for Virginia SM play about Blake yanan knew he wouldnt be able to Coral that basketball beakman and draws the foul re beakman the ACCC Defensive Player of the Year again he is going to be foued by Zachary is second expect to see Reese beakman be a little more aggressive in this second half trying to touch the paint give Jaden Zachary a lot of credit for the way hes defended Reese beakman Zachary was disappointed by the fact that he was not on that all defensive team bman scored 18 along with eight assists in the win over Boston College at Chestnut Hill was a win that really kind of steadied the ship for Virginia but still they had by that point tumbled out of the top 25 entry pass for post and a foul before the basket so no hope there no hoop there and lets check in with Angel gray Cory I think he might have been listening in on the uh huddle or rather in the back with coach Bennett as well because he did say that he wanted to establish Reese beakman a little bit more in the second half he was pleased with how after that second timeout in the first half that they really started to find find their Rhythm playing together not feeling like they were sped up mind you this is their first game in the ACC tournament finding their rhythm is key especially in the second half angel I spent so much time with Tony Bennett I can finish his sentences at this point so I know exactly what it is he wanted to happen in this second half Boston College had a couple of cracks at it beakman Airborne off the window for two and thats it right there Rees beakman instead of waiting for everyone to get down taking his opportunities in transition and attacking JayZ off the Applause bouns Zachary picking up the dribble heres Harris crosscourt by post backing away heres Harris and couldnt get that one to go but a big rebound by mlon De mcglockton doing a great job on the offensive glass thats one of the areas where its Virginia is susceptible giving up second chance opportuni they find the big guy in the paint on a nice give by Harris to post for two but claudell Harris has played a very mature game he has in forced shots and has also done a great job facilitating finding his teammates a second assist after not having one last night pman again now hes starting to hunt that shot well ree beakman has a size advantage over most of the guards hes going to play against at 6 three but also with his wingspan he knows that he can take his chances especially once he gets into the painted area Virginia only briefly had the lead in the first half mlon lines one up got an excellent look pman for the rebound and suddenly hes everywhere hell bring it up quickly Murray in transition will drain that Applause triple and we are tied at 37 and the Virginia fans back and roaring post with a yes sir thats a strong answer from Clinton post as all the momentum is on the side of Virginia as they found their offensive Rhythm here to start the second half Clinton post answers with a big bucket McNeely on the B speed for Murray the short jumper is good Virginias movement away from the basketball is Elite you see tame Murray never standing still but you got that same movement from at mcne on the other side Zachary slipped a bit beakman harassing him as he does so many Zachary was tripped on the pl T Valentine said as the Boston College Point Guard went down in the lane coming up tonight 1130 eastern time nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of todays ACC tournament quarterfinal games this is the last one of the day North Carolina Pittsburgh and NC State all into the semifinals should Boston College win this that means only one team that had a double buy will get to the semifinals in this tournament but its often times an advantage for the teams that have played already on this floor and establish their Rhythm they often times come out and have better starts foul off the ball here Ted Valentine blowing the whistle its going to be a double foul on both Ryan Dunn and Quinton post battling post is going trying to get Applause position first post with number Applause one take a look as you see post and done battling for that position and again I like that call I like the call of a double foul because both guys were guilty was getting a little too physical between the two post plucked Away by beakman and trouble coring Applause that and now Virginia trying to take the Applause lead Murray pman again T to shoot beakman with a very difficult angle and post there to collect the Applause rebound so the Cavaliers missing on an attempt they would have put them in front Harris on the drive oh thats a pretty bank shot it is and also the fact that he had an option to drop it off but forced The Defenders to retreat and got a easy look at The Rim clell Harris his first points in a long Applause time beakman of the paint again blocked by po he got a fingertip on it thats two straight possessions where post has done a great job keeping ree beakman from getting to a sweet spot in the paint post and done really going toe to Music toe done leaning on him po just turned around and said to one of the officials what gives here nine to shoot on the cut Madson is fouled in the paint Virginia fans didnt like that but the whistle stops the clock with 1508 to go on the contest and a 4239 lead here for BC theyll get Isaac mcney for that personal his first coming up the all ACC team Music surprise the buzzer beater that moment when the Joel of course is checking our pellaton group chat right now your pelaton group chat yeah me and Joel We in a group chat together talking about our pelaton rides Etc almost 1100 you guys need to take a break yeah well its a lot more than just that a lot of basketball talk in as well a lot of congratulations to Joel for that big Applause win bro will feed up top roves with a Fall Away off the iron post grabbing another rebound so 4239 Boston College they have had the lead almost the entire game although its been close you see Virginia going without a true Center Ryan Dunn all defensive team member guarding Quinton post however no one guarding Deon mlin under the basket another defensive breakdown Bob Virginia giving up a easy Applause bucket Music goes again now beakman under 14 minutes to play throws the launch and swished it in a triple thats what Tony Bennett has traded for having the big man on the floor hes traded some offense and now youve got Jake Groves knocking down threes Andrew Ro shot the basketball well and tane Murrays the first player for Virginia in double figures throughout this game Madson really could not have asked for more but a missfire from the corner when hes cold hes Applause Applause cold Virginia running down that shot clock over and over hes on the line Ros going to turn it over you see this over and over and its really been amazing this year how many of those calls this season last season and the natural reaction for most players is when you catch the basketball to take a retreat step that back foot goes before you take off however when youre on the sideline you dont have space to do that so its going to have to be a sweep to the side in comparison to stepping back Virginias first turnover in 17 Applause minutes Zachary post getting into the paint Zachary cant hit it Groves High up for the rebound once again for Virginia can Tire Take the Applause Lead this for the last spot in semifinals of the ACC tournament here in Washington DC off off done back for beakman shot clock to seven Groves well short at this point I believe that if the how hard Ryan Dunn is having to work guarding Quinton post I believe Virginia has to find way to get done some space to be able to operate on the perimeter and put Quint and post in some tough positions defens the double mlock done with the rejection dun who led the ACC and blocks this season comes up with a big one there but I would love to see him get the ball on the perimeter and just drive Quinton post here see if he can get to the rim heres done right around Harris and the foul the Glock one up and hammered him as dun was going Skyward to slam that down that may be one they go over and look at that was pretty vicious that that was a hard foul and again I dont think it was a dirty foul by any means whatsoever his third foul done with the strong attack but that makes contact I mean he gets hit in the face on that possession watch as Deon mcglaughlin comes across watch the left arm boom thats right in the face I mean Im shocked that the officials are not overlooking at this one in the monitor yeah right now just a common Applause foul and nobody looking at the Monitor and so Dunn goes to the linean where he makes 53 and you know its sad to say OB but had Ryan Dunn fallen down and grabbed his face and rolled around on the ground they would have gone over to look at and they are actually now or at least it looked like for a moment Ry steinan was going over to take a look corre the foul is on number 21 de mton well that was just to correct the foul it was mlon all the way yeah we knew who got the about as evid this is third foul dun can scuffle at the line not on the first one he only makes Applause 53 but Virginia right on the doorstep tying again 1201 to Applause play itll be knocked out by Boston College so itll be Virginia ball Jaden Zachary wanted a violation on Ryan Dunn crossing the line before the basketball hit the rim Ted balen time right on top of it says he would he gave it Music time official timeout so an official timeout well take the break to Boston College still clinging to a onepoint lead 44 to 43 over Virginia playing the semifinals of the ACC tournament Cory Alexander Dave OBrien and Angel gray with you here from Capital One Arena North Carolina very impressive today 9267 over FSU Armando Bott with another double double Pittsburgh knocked off wake very tough loss for Wake Forest 8169 pit never trailed in that game though they did cut the lead from 19 down to three late in the contest and we just saw NC State defeat Duke 7469 upending the number two SE Boston Collin now trying to win their third consecutive game in the tournament everybody dropping beakman had an open look and the high rebound comes to BC a much more aggressive second half for Reese beakman whos now three of 11 from the floor but has seven assists and only two turnovers but weve seen him trying to score more as Quinton post tries to score on the Baseline playing against a smaller Ryan Dunn great recognition by Earl Grant to get him an opport on the Block second foul undone and post to shoot good foul shooter hes 82 there mentioned named to the all ACC second team and also the all defensive team in the ACC its about two blocks per game hes a really fine Applause Defender a graduate from Amsterdam 1129 to play he smooth at the line there back to a threepoint lead for BC Post in the first match up vers Virginia was only 6 for 14 from the field but went 11 for 11 from the free throw line to get him to 24 points more efficient here from the floor today be on the drive and kick and the connection there with dun a nice finish from Ryan Dunn Reese beakman holding the basketball long enough to get the attention of Quenton post to drop it off to Dunn just at the right time every time Virginia has been knocking on the door of tying or taking a lead except on one occasion BC has had an answer heres post not this time well this BC team has been playing great basketball coming into the tournament they have won two straight so now with the two wins here in DC they won their last four Ro Grant team has a lot of confidence coming into this matchup Ro nearly lost his footing in the paint dun has the size Advantage as he gets into the lane and hes fouled Zachary trying to stay with him his third foul back court has had a fairly solid night but nothing is spectacular as Boston College had last night I believe a lot that has to do with the opponent defensively when youre playing against Virginia one of your guards is not going to get off and thats going to be the one that the ACC defensive player of the year is guarding and so its going to be a tough night for that guy now claudell Harris got off to a great start but hes calmed down ever since yeah 27 against Clemson yesterday as roie launches one that puts Virginia in front this may be Andrew Ros best game as a wahoo and it comes off the heels of a game where he didnt even get inserted into the Applause L Groves coming over to double mson post again five to shoot it done leaning on him poking at the ball and he cant hit it pman comes out of there with Applause it Virginia by a point roie head down driving it again dun in the paint pakman again roie Music again tough rebound there for Harris that would have been a big bucket if Ryan Dunn had been able to gather that one cuz he was ready to take off just Mish Hammer the pass up of a nice find from Ro Harris the tear drop no Tapped Out for post heres the triple yes hes been the answer OB every time Virginias taken a lead or made a run has been Quinton post knocking down a three or getting a big bucket for the Eagles Boston College surging back in front in this Applause quarterfinal under nine left Harris trying to drive that Baseline and hes going to be fouled by elag bay prince elag Bay with number one Buchanon to return here for the Cavaliers hes 611 freshman so more size for Tony Applause Music Bennett First Team all ACC we saw RJ Davis very strong again today Bowski was terrific in defeat as well OB in my 33 years of being associated with the ACC is Quinton post an all ACC performer gets another opportunity at the rim and finishes it off Ive got to say that Reese beakman not being on the first team is probably the worst travesty Ive seen in my 33 years in this league haris coming off the bench and he drops into well have more on that when we come back we have 8 minutes to go here and Boston College still clings to Elite 5149 Player of the Year in the conference I wanted to go on air and blast all the voters and I was a voter for this happening however what it made me realize is Im not certain that all of our voters I know there are a lot Im not certain that all of our voters know exactly what theyre watching and understand understanding why Virginia is the third seed in the ACC this year and why they win and Reese beakman is the biggest part of that Harris and thats in and out well it was in the cylinder as Matson returns another one up there well short on the runner I think you admit they got most of them right I believe that they did get most of them right but I believe that they got a few wrong not just one that was the biggest one that they got wrong but I believe that there were others that were wrong and again a lot of it is based upon opinion I dont expect for everyone to agree with my opinion Ted Valentine set a foul on the deck but I do expect for everyone that is a voter to actually do their research and watch the games and if you take into the fact and in your game when you consider wins above replacement no one bigger than Reese beakman when it comes to wins above replacement you take him away from Virginia theyre a three game winner in a CC there you go I bought three of the out with nine quick points before getting in foul trouble and claudo Harris and Jaden Zachary took up the slack however Quinton post going back to his scoring ways 19 points in this one to go along with nine rebounds and two assists Angel gray can add guys if we can just talk about the Ascension of Quinton post since hes transferred to Boston College coach Grant told me that hes just happy that he went after him told me at the time Quinton was at Mississippi State averaging about seven minutes per game two minutes per game now trusting in Him He said hes being named the most improved player just a season ago now coach is having to call NBA Scouts about checking him out as well as a potential draft pick this is a guy that has trusted him put the work in as he knocks down another three his work ethic cannot be matched and he said he has put himself on the map angel I dont think coach Grant has to call anybody about Quin po as a potential draft pick I I think theyre calling him because when you consider seven ft with this touch the ability to shoot the basketball and also protect the rim hes a guy that we can definitely see in the NBA yeah 21 points tonight Rose will dump it down to Buchanan moving it inside beautifully Virginia and a quick strike there by Gro with very unselfish by the Cavaliers yes youre used to seeing Jake Groves get threepoint plays but its normally from Beyond the Arc NE attacking the basket but the great give and go the oldest play in the game OB but it still works a nice F from Blake Buchanon to Jake Gro who finishes through the contact and opportunity to add one ludell Harris number two lgin grows 73 a guy whos been around two Eastern Washington and Oklahoma before coming to play for Tony Bennett McNeely going to the bench Dante Harris the junior getting some minutes here tonight for the Cavaliers that has been the Achilles Hill for the whoos this year they have not been a very good free throw shooting Team all season long and in a game thats so tightly contested as this one you need each and every one of those points every time BCs needed a key basket they have gone to post they do it again as hell draw the foul before the shot they want him to touch it it seems every time down the court and they should because Virginias having to guard him with 6 s Ryan Dunn so Quenton post is going to have an advantage in the post if he can get the basketball on his hands Ryan with foul number three of course Ryan done very familiar with Boston College his brother Justin was a pitcher at BC before making his way to the big leagu oh stand they going to get another whistle a lot more fouls here in the second half and thats going to be four undone so hes going to have to step off and Buchanan back on for Virginia hes one and one Applause time so post to shoot so far in the ACC tournament but look at the fact that Quinton post has score 14 of BCs 18 second half points missing the front end hes been all the offense here in the second half with the Eagles BC had made 22 in a row in the ACC tournament before that Miss beakman to the paint had to adjust his shot and out it goes Ted Valentine said it was tipped and amazing to see the players signaling to review that you cant review in college basketball theyve been watching way too much NBA way too much NBA theres no review you look to the bench asking coach to call the timeout to challenge that that doesnt work here it was more than one guy yes it was four it was Harris will lifts got it Virginia back in front OB remember this used to be Dante Harriss home court he spent two seasons at Georgetown playing here in Capital One Applause Arena set his toe is on the line so that was a two 5353 po Post in close and another big bucket for him three games in three days but you would not be able to tell by the Eagles especially Quenton post he looks just as energized today as he did on Tuesday Harris tried to Slither that pass into Buchan picked off by BC but look at this look whos initiating the offense Quinton post bringing the basketball up the floor playing that point Center position facilitating and trying to find a way to get his hands on the Rock once again Madson just three for nine shooting it hes denied by Groves shot clock to seven Zachary kind of a wild shot cant Applause connect vir jinia shuts him Applause Music Applause down Groves leaning in cant hit it Harris draws the foul 4 16 to go OB three weeks ago if you would have told Tony Bennett at a crucial point in the game youre going to have tame Murray Dante Harris Blake Buchanan and Jacob Groves on the floor with Reese beakman he would have laughed at you but thats the way this team has evolved Tony Bennett has gathered a lineup to where he trusts so many different guys within this lineup That whoevers playing the best will finish the game post to his second foul Harris with a misfire D Harris the transfer from Georgetown averaged about 12 points a game last year now Virginia three of seven from the free throw line we talked about it earlier in this game that is something that absolutely come back and haunt the whoos in a close game looking to make it a onepoint contest and he front rimmed it they continue to have issues at that foul Applause Music Applause line Applause mlon the hand off for Zachary he gets it away Harris off the fake heres a triple shot clock winding down couldnt hit it now another chance for Virginia to tie or Applause Music Applause lead grov wants it Miner got a big rebound and hes taken down and fouling the play Jordan Miner all the way to the deck and a foul on Harris thats going to be his third weve got 323 remaining in this quarterfinal it remains a very tight one late in Music DC SVP thank you my man we look forward to 323 remaining here Boston College and Virginia in a tight one 55 53 BC down the stretch we come for one more spot in the semifinal yeah and I got a chance to going in there and holler at Stanford Steve earlier today so Im sure hell be in the studio with with SVP tonight so you know good chance when you come to DC to get the hang out with those got Clinton post leading the away for Boston College 23 points and 11 rebounds but Miner at the line now Jordan Miner 68 Music grad who is at 60 at the foul line and thats in and out another missed opportunity for Virginia you got to think about the points theyve left at the free throw line throughout this game six of them now three for nine Harris here he comes off the front of that iron as we approach three minutes to Applause go mcney turns the fire and hes fouled on the play in the act of attempting a three and not only that OB Devin mcglaughlin just fouled out of the Applause game number five he is done and mlin is the heart and soul of this team of course Quinton post is their best player but you see Isaac mcney running through the elevator screen and this not the foul up top is not allowing AAC MC MCN to land on that shot mlin trying to help out a teammate right in front of Ry Music Steines Isaac mcney came in averaging 12 points a game he has not scored but he is an excellent foul shoot Amanda they need him now they absolutely do and they need someone to be able to go to the stripe and knock down some shots and hes 89 he misses and you see all the body here as mlock lunges at mcney fouls him down low as Isaac mcne finally makes a free throw for Virginia yeah they had missed six in a row OB Virginia had a game where they were 0 for 11 I mean 0 for 10 from the free throw line Isaac mcney made one free throw versus Wake Forest to sealed that game but can you imagine winning a game going 1 for 11 from the free throw strike can they havent been good there tonight but theyre tied now Aris Jr the spin move that wont drop rebound comes to post got tapped around and it came right to the big two and a half minutes to play Zachary denied Matson five to get off a shot now down to three hell Loft it up there hes had a bad shooting night and now Virginia trying to take Applause advantage and a game that has certainly been played at Virginias preferred Music Applause Pace beakman to drive it McNeely off the fake nearly threw it away Beakmans got it he cant connect post cradles the rebound re beakman got a great great look on that one I was surprised that McNeely didnt reload and shoot the three after he got the defender to fly past him on the pump fake Earl Grant wants a timeout here Boston College takes one with a minute 37 to go in a tie game itll be a quick one 30 seconds and well be back here to Washington Music DC players with 60 plus points 30 more rebounds ACC tournament last 10 years in some fine company OB you want to know another one the worst things Ive seen in the ACC in the last 30 years when Jason Tatum was not named the most valuable player of the ACC tournament in 2017 it was given to his teammate Luke Canard who had a very good championship game but you see the numbers from Jason Tatum throughout that tournament M Brandy was not very happy about that lets just say the least you do not want to get Mom and a state Brandys still not happy about that so Boston College with the ball coming out of the timeout by Erol Grant its been some run here for Boston College theyre trying to make it three in a row and get to the semifinals but Virginia in the way Zachary in the back court and they will set up a play glaudell Harris Another Touch for post leaning on miner who blocks the shot right back at Applause him Jordan Miner with a big one but can Virginia Capital La theyve gotten stops but havent been able to get scores on this end of the floor beakman going up against Zachary dumps it for Miner blocked Madson got a hand on it that is up and off the iron but a foul another great drive and dish by ree beakman touching the paint dropping it off as Jordan miners getting it done offensively and defensively a strong defensive stand timing that perfectly blocking the shot of Quinton post which has been difficult to do Zachary picked up his fourth foul to put Miner to the line its been a struggle for him just a 60 foul shooter shooting two boy one minute to go think about where Virginia would be right now if they made some foul shots OB if Virginia becomes the third straight higher seed to lose here in this quarter final round they will have to look back to the free throw line and only blame themselves yep for it 5 for 14 Cory just brutal so tied at 55 under 50 seconds to Applause go and hands off for Zachary back to post Miner just blocked his shot a moment ago he gives it up for Zach got to get a shot up there he launches and its in and out and a whistle of 292 seconds to go BC had a crack at it still tied at 55 and a foul here against Boston College I tell you that was a strong defensive stand by Virginia Jordan Miner holding his own in the post versus Quinton post and then Reese beakman recovering not allowing Jaden Zachary to get a good look from three and now despite the terrible time theyve had at the line Virginia is there again dead last in the ACC in that category but Groves makes the first and has Tony Bennetts team in the lead another one coming and hits the pair Applause 5755 Harris taking his time 20 seconds left in this Applause quarterfinal Harris on roie 10 seconds left Im not sure why Boston College is holding the basketball Harris straight on that clangs away Zachary gets it to Madson he launches another one he hits it he hit the shot Madson at the buzzer and they were struggling so mightily at the line until Groves hit those two so its on to OT as Boston College wins the tip Virginia by the way has won nine of their last 10 overtime games thatll be tipped and controlled by the Cavaliers I tell you what OB Jordan miners been a difference make on the defensive end coming in taking on that role of in Quinton post Quinton post has been silenced since Jordan Miner checked into the Applause game beakman to set it up for Tony Bennett heres mcney to drop in a triple Isaac Music mcney it had a very quiet evening in this quarter final until the latter stages and now a big triple yeah that was a loud three ball right there for mcney on the first possession of overtime and this is Virginias largest lead at 60 to 57 the Fall Away well short there by hand and theyll let it roll out 357 to go in Applause overtime and an official stoppage here Jamie lucky something on the floor oh see thats normally thats Quinton post job thats thats part of a pom pom yeah thats part of the pom pom normally Quinton post would pick that up and bring it over here and lay it on our table thats what he did yesterday for some reason were still yet to determine why but we keep getting that Ron Sanz actually brought one over earlier to make sure that this was the place that pom pom scrapping went to mcney again not this time goes over the top got a clean board bman well short and itll go the other way BC Applause ball Earl Grant not happy with Jamie lucky and it has to do with Jacob Groves going over the back of Jaden Zachary ear Grant wanted that call yeah grows at 69 Zachary 62 but often times and I didnt get a good look at it often times if the guy the smaller guy in front is backing into that taller player thats why the foul will not be called post comes up top they hit him again W Harris trying to wiggle free thats slapped stolen away bigman wants to push it roves back outside for roie most of the fans in the building are on their feet right now certainly all the Virginia fans and they have been loud tonight mcne stumbles tried to keep control of it and now a fight for it possession arrow will keep it on this end with 249 to go and overtime and Virginia Ball but with the possession arrow favoring Virginia theres only 19 seconds on the shot clock as you see Jordan Miner setting a mean screen on Donald Han Jr only 19 on the shot clock for Virginia Rees beakman making sure that all of his teammates know that theyve got to let a shot go as soon as they touch it MCD catches fires and air mailed it didnt get to the iron so that is a violation of the shot clock colle and Boston College can tie on this Applause possession a wild finish to regulation Madson hit the shot the twopointer to tie it send it overtime right before the horn hes got it again open to fire cant drain it Matson hesitated on that one Obie he looked to get that two Quinton post when post was covered he decided to shoot and the hesitation caused him to miss that shot now if youre reeing right now this opportunity to get everyone out the way and just blow the doors off of Post Post denies him its going to be knocked out of play off of Post but thats the third time that I can recall in this game where Quinton post has stood up to the challenge of Defending Reese beakman and come away the Victor Virginia from the Baseline to put it in and a timeout 205 left in overtime in DC well be back in Music 30 in regulation that twopointer in the nick of time to force it into OT hes only made four out of 12 and one for six from three but huge on that occasion yeah the hesitation on that one the pump fake threw him off through his rhythm off but I tell you what if you had to choose between the two shots if youre Mason Masson youll take the one that he made youll give away that Miss because the one that he made gave his team another Fighting Chance and thats all Earl Grant has asked of this team throughout this time here in DC a reset BC has the possession arrow three timeouts for Boston College Virginia has two and again if youre just tuning in Quint post of the Eagles of Boston College Leading The Way with 23 and 13 rebounds also two assists and a steal Jacob Groves with 15 to lead Virginia and theyve got one other player in double Figures its Tean Murray with 11 claudell Harris Jr with 11 for Boston College BC trying to make it three consecutive wins and play their way into the semifinal but Virginia after the double by getting on the floor for the first time here in Washington DC in this tournament tonight and the winner to take on NC State tomorrow very important game for Virginia I know that they would rest easier with a win here this evening as Bracketology has them in the last four in moved down after Sean Hall got a win over St Johns this evening and Dayton also losing in the Atlantic 10 tournament so out of the timeout 205 left in overtime eight to Applause shoot Andrew roie McNeils got to get a shot in the air he gives it away beakman will fire got it he hit a triple money shot by beakman and just a smile he struggled from the field throughout this game the rest of his game has been up to par but he has struggled shooting the basketball a big three for Reese beIN on that possession Madson cant answer and now Virginia holding a 6357 lead in overtime under 90 seconds to Applause go Applause and the Cavaliers are going to take their time iss Roy no Miner jumping in and its out of Applause play Rees beakman at the end of the shot clock you have no choice but to let it go and after he sees it go through finally some Jubilation from reys beakman as he sees a bucket go down from the perimeter his only threepointer but 11 points 10 assists and seven rebounds for him Boston College in desperation mode Harris hits it big time shot for claudell Harris in a threepoint game claudell Harris hit three threepoint field goals early in this game within the first four minutes and thats his first since 14 points now for Harris who had 27 points in last nights Victory Virginia has held him under wraps however a big three for Harris to make this a one point one possession game Music again so Virginia by three again they have won nine of their last 10 overtime games NC State awaiting the winner of this one after big win over the Duke Blue Devils earlier tonight in the quarterfinals 7469 Pittsburgh a winner over Wake Forest Pittsburgh never trailed and North Carolina started the day 9267 over Florida State so theres your bracket soon to be down to the last four 700 tomorrow night and then 930 for game two with Dan shman Jay bis just Sims well chalk going in the top part of the bracket both the higher seeds with the double buys North Carolina and Pittsburgh winning Duke losing and Virginia on the ropes here threepoint lead trying to hang on and survive the scare from Boston College Big D bringing it across under 50 Music Applause seconds beakman after that giant Applause triple under 40 pman with a bounce speed Miner yes 6560 Harris with a long three short Zachary fighting for the rebound he wins it back his pass is stolen away by miner and Madson commits the foul to stop the clock with 14 seconds to go Jordan Miner has been the Difference Maker for Virginia here in this second half and overtime coming in defending Quenton post a big bucket offensively on the last possession for Virginia off the nice find from Reese beakman and now coming up with a steal as if officials will go over and see who actually was fouled Miner got the steal but handed the basketball off but Miner was then fouled and of course theres no rule against fouling away from the basketball in college basketball so it will be Jordan Miner who goes to the free throw line you see he hands it off however Matson does grab Miner thinking he still has the basketball and that was a good foul although because Jordan Miner is 0 for three from the line as the team to seven for 16 adding to those woes and yet it was two big foul Shots by Groves in a clutch situation and they had missed a bunch Miner makes that one so they extend the lead to 6660 madsons got to hustle and get a shot in the air and that triple touch is nothing out of goes 77 Virginia closing in on the semifinals of the ACC tournament Boston College with a magical run over a couple nights but thats over and Virginia will win it they defeat Boston College 6660 the Cavaliers are into the semifinals of the ACC tournament 6 their first overtime win in the
