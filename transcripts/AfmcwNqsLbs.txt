Squad yeah when you start at seven oclock and see the Pittsburgh and Virginia have one Clemson lost so they drop down into the standings Miami just trying to keep Pace in the ACC trying to chase at ACC regular season championship Louisville in red Miami in white and we are underway in Coral Gables its the Hurricanes that start with the basketball Applause what a game they had here Monday night Duke in town awesome crowd and they put on a show and show that they mean business in the ACC foul on the floor and Sydney Curry and roll defense is going to be huge uh in this game Miami runs a lot of ball screen actions for their guards whether its off of screen and rolls or pin Downs in something that Louisville worked on really hard today but right here out of bounds underneath North Chad OMeara opens a scoring take a look at this Louisville starting lineup Cardinals have struggled all season long and the 109 year history of this proud program they have never lost 21 games until Tuesday night its Mike James 21 losses the most ever suffered by a Cardinals team and yet youre at shooter on today Malcolm saying you would never know this was a threewin ball no there was a lot of energy and again look of this alova program we know the history we know what the standards are I talked with a spoken Kenny Payne about that and said look uh these guys that has been the message all year to them they were in here though again getting after it trying to prepare for a Miami team Jay that has been really good at home hurricanes anchored by Isaiah Wong hes making his 100th career start in a Miami uniform tonight Jordan Miller floater doesnt fall tapped around grabs his own rebound kick down pack of three Applause Second Chance points in particular Miami if they get a offensive rebound you must get back out on the threepoint Shooters thats something Kenny Payton staffs was concerned about defending the threepoint line tested three trying to answer off the mark one thing Louisville can certainly not afford on the road is a slow start long step back and it falls in a friendly roll for Isaiah Wong and its seven nothing Miami early shoot around was a two oclock this afternoon for Miami Isaiah Wong was in here at one oclock first guy in here getting shots up for an hour before shoot around pick and roll situations and then also catching through thats what the best do they continue to work on their craft foreign Applause Music Applause working on his shot one of the best players in college basketball Isaiah Wong on fire early Music foreign we love our new home theres so much space but we have ants inspired a lot of house I hope you can keep it clean at least Geico makes bundling our home and car insurance easy for bundling Made Easy Go to geicocom all right everybody its two of any of these for just six dollars can you get a Dave single with a 10 piece nug yeah how about two day singles for six dollars and thats class sit down sorry Choose Wisely choose Wendy Music Jim larranaga in year number 12 with Miami after an elite eight run a year ago this team seems poised for another Deep Run in March yeah some similarities uh to that team last year a Nigel pack obviously stepping in and filling some of the production that Charlie Moore gave them but I think youre a little deeper this year when he goes to his bench he does not lose much coming out of the Kenny Payne timeout Louisville hits a three through Al Ellis has been the brightest spot offensively in what has been a dark season for this Cardinals team and his last 15 games El Ellis 17 points a game five assists and posted two skills hes been playing that time really well unfortunately because again they struggled to win games but L Ellis has put up some pretty good numbers Applause Withers lost the handle Miami has numbers in transition packed wide open three cant connect wrong there to clean up the spill that right there I think shows the progress that Isaiah Wong has taken under Jim larenega again makes a good read and transition makes that pass to Nigel pack but then he gets after it on the offensive rebound as well so again hes a guy that is making good reads and then doing a little bit of everything for Miami Alice keeping Louisville in it early hes got all six for the Cardinals through two threes and the thing with him look you know he can score uh Ill be at that last pick game it was a little bit of a struggle but prior to that his assist numbers have gone up as well and hes guy uh that shoot from anywhere on the court the score of all three levels Isaiah won so crafty hes already up to nine points to lead the hurricanes so fun to watch he really is but Kenny Payne though talked about not trading buckets with teams now right now theyre training buckets with Isaiah Wong hes got hes got all ACC player for sure and hes got a great support and cast to go along with him top 20 team of the day should showing why early undefeated at home trying to stay that way Isaiah Wong and Nigel pack have Miami in front comfortably early Malcolm Huckabee and those two two of the best in the ACC when it comes to the backcourt yeah you look at the numbers obviously Virginia got a huge win at home today versus Duke but that NC State backcourt as well too for play Beyond Smith but uh when you talk about two guys that can score with the best of them not just in the ACC but in college basketball Isaiah Wong and Nigel pack two of the better guards in college basketball a lot of good talented backcourt to the ACC but you could put Isaiah 1 and Nigel pack up against any of them Applause rule will judge themselves a 10point hole early shot clock down to two trainer gets rid of it just as the buzzer sounds and connects thats a great jump stop a little uh floater in the lane he got up great elevation and nice body control uh by trainer Music theres Jordan Miller hes a poplar Miller in attack mode splits two Defenders off the window Music decision that time by Miller not to settle for a jumper thats great touch Applause LL is pull up pop cant connect offensive rebound Sydney Curry count it plus the foul Music or Louisville on the defensive side that time again a breakdown the help is not there and Millers able to get to the basket were back on the other side thats a really time offensive rebound put back by Sydney Curry youre saying right before the break Kenny Payne does not want to trade buckets though you know Louisvilles done well scoring in this stretch but Miamis made three in a row Applause Poplar deep three in transition saved by Wong and Louisville has it with Kamari Lance Music trainer lines up a three too much on it Poplar up ahead AJ Casey all alone and he slams it home not happy with their transition defense that time unbalanced again they got a pretty good look offensively just missed the three but it was good ball movement but then on the back end as you said and again trading buckets and I think its how theyre giving up those buttons straight line drives that time breakdown in their transition deep go inside again in another for a threepoint play of the oldfashioned way this time Mike James Music right here Music is the end balance Kenny Payne again somebody has to get back to break up that fast break uh by Miami and then right here the and one the beautiful pearl cut one and Jay look at times Louisville has shown flashes I go back to the kick game for the first probably eight up to nine minutes of that game uh theyre tied doing some really good things offensively the problem now has been though on this side of for Louisville defending the threepoint line and then containing dribble drives off of pick and rolls like this wide open off the mark from Poplar removal and struggled all season they consistently get stops on the defensive end even when the offense has shown those glimpses you were talking about hockey theyre tied at 14 on Tuesday night at Pittsburgh you lose that game 9157 Alice into the lane nice hesitation goes up and makes it a onepossession game and Im going to say it again its a shame again theyve struggled but uh El Ellis is one of the better scoring guards in the ACC thats a beautiful reverse pivot and then the touch that he has shown that time put on the brakes shot at high up over the defender Applause Joseph into the games 12 seconds to shoot nor Chad omear great low post move your channel here what a boost he has been to this Miami team and I like that recognition by Miami they like that matchup but they get them isolated on the way and on the post and because Miami has four Shooters out on the perimeter really difficult to double has made six of their last eight shots Applause dug themselves in a 10point hole early down 10nothing and clawed back trainer good luck cant connect and a foul called on the ensuing rebound against the Freshman Mike James hes frustrated Applause Music Percy Miller checks in for James Applause ah University Music I like what Percy Miller did right there he denied the ball to Isaiah Wong just trying to slow this Miami offense down but again taking it out of their best player on the court right now its a ball handler uh Isaiah long three up one steps in and hits Isaiah a perfect five for five from the Florida start this game tough once he gets it going again he is one of the most difficult shot makers in college doesnt make a difference what type of Defense youre playing on him if he gets high he is just so difficult to match up against foul called against long off ball hes got 11 of the Hurricanes at early seven point lead Im a screen addicted left in college right here though this is the Improvement improves threepoint shooting been out early working on that and then his play making his ability to get on the offensive glass or from great for others but make no mistake about it that he is one of the best scorers in college right now he is on fire early Louisvilles going to have to try to take him out of his game I like what Hershey Miller tried to do on that last possession tried to deny him the ball but again once he gets it going he is really difficult to stop you see a perfect five for five from the floor 11 points scoring right now not the problem for Louisville theyre six of 11 thats really good for for their standards this season Al Alice right on cue drills a three makes it a fourpoint game after they fell down by 10 in the opening minutes well he is again have been a guy that has been able to score for Louisville Music he also is a guy that can score on all three levels right here though showing an awesome great range again good spacing by Louisville and then thats a deep three by Elle Ellison right now after the hot start for Miami the timeout theyve responded and now they cut this deficit on the road to four Music when you hear Malcolm say Louisville is showing you flashes this season a lot of people look at the record three and 21 oh what flashes is he talking about this is it on the road top 20 team they got down 10nothing early and have continued to fight obviously havent done it consistent enough hence the record but you look at Kenny Payne and certainly a frustrated frustrating first season at the helm of his alma mater but calls that time out after they go down 10nothing and his team has responded on the road against one of the best teams in the ACC yeah and when I walked in here uh for their shoot around again the energy still was the same as it when I saw him the first time uh you again the attention to detail they were going over this they know this is a big opportunity for them on the road I think the biggest thing that has plagued them a couple things with turnovers uh that really has been an issue for them and then defensively theres been breakdowns uh guys just not following the Skyrim report whether its picking up a 3point shooter or hedging on the ball screen but uh they have shown flashes for 20 30 minutes during the time in games that time just about a full 40 and you mentioned the turnovers they turn it over there third of the game Nigel pack cant cash in the other way foreign Music Applause they came into this game and ACC played Louisville 132 assists 205 turnovers and again numbers dont lie its really difficult when you have that lopsided of a margin where you have more turnovers than you do assist its difficult to win at home or on the road and once they clean that up as you see right here they have some guys that were talented enough to score in some length all right all the positions key thing is thats been the theme with Kenny Payne and staff the little things the turnovers and then understanding the defensive assignments and Game Plan on a sixnothing mini run the larger run is 2112 in favor of Louisville theyve fought back in this game cant get the stop there a thunder is slammed from North Chad OMeara what a pickup he has been though for Jim larenaga and staff Applause undersized doesnt make a difference though bigger guys Smart Guys and he is just so powerful were gonna call three second violation on the Freshman Emmanuel okoke Music Jay this guy right here last year Sun Belt Player of the Year and defensive player of the year nor Chad omare I joke with coach laronega and staff and said certainly you dont want any uh football guys around him because hes a guy theres not much body fat on him and he is certainly one of the most powerful players not just in the ACC but in college basketball again Applause they need to check the rip he might have to loosen that one up right there beautiful Wall Street action and pass by Isaiah Wong hard to the hole an immediate answer through Jalen Withers Applause to back Big Time jams for malmir do you go back to him a third time on this possession well I like this matchup again they went to it before but theyre going to do it off of some ball movement this time never getting to the rim Applause Miami once again is made three in a row shooting 65 percent Louisville turns it over thats pretty Applause this right here again Isaiah Wong thats a beautiful pass check the rim of course that old mirror so powerful and but this is the movement of that Miami again makes them so difficult they have four guards out there Jay that can pass shoot and then also make plays off the bounce whether its uh in the midrange or making passes Music Applause Music its packed quick trigger and he drills it from Dave Nigel back his second three of the night and thats an overhelp again youre talking about one of the better threepoint Shooters and the ACC and Nigel back you cant help boss with him uh if thats your assignment uh you have to stay connected to him that time you over helped Wong makes another nice read beautiful pass to the corner Applause trainer Running Out of Time lands two on the timer has to hoist it he does too much on it the follow Jam JJ trainers thank you struggled against Pitt at Pitt zero points in that game hes got four early in that right there elbows Above the Rim great offensive rebound and put back but by trainer really impressed with his length and activity on both ends Harlan Beverly rattles in doesnt drop Miami had made four in a row before that Miss Louisville desperate to get a stop against the Hurricanes team shooting 64 percent from the floor all right four in traffic got it to go against omir and they Rave about oh four or four and thats a big time sealed and I like the post entry pass again its all set up but because of the spacing for Louisville and then again youre going up against the guy thats really strong thats a nice seal and finish Jordan Miller trying to get that left hand free he does and he knocks it down Applause Music Applause heres Hershey Miller Music 110 to shoot lands line drive to the rim but he missed it Applause Music Louisville down 10 early they are battling back against number 2019 Miami on the road Music Auto Owners protects your home Music well somebody should thats simple human sense ask your independent agent if AutoOwners make sense for you weve got a terrific triple header for you tomorrow on the ACC Network at ACC womens basketball starts at noon with North Carolina and Boston College that a top 20 matchup between Florida State and Virginia and Tech at two and the third and final game Syracuse Notre Dame thats it for a loaded slate tomorrow right here on acc Network Malcolm Huckabee Jay alter with you Isaiah Wong L Ellis leading the way great backcourt matchup in this game and credit Louisville showing a lot of fight on the road they are and again uh when theyve executed not turned the ball over theyve had some good ball movement and you said it uh L Ellis uh really scoring the ball early at a high cliff wide open three down Jalen Withers Music Miami and Jay thats what you want when you come out of a timeout I saw them work on that same play add shoot around uh this morning a great execution and then the screen I think thats the undertalked about piece of that the screening and that play really was on point to free up the shooter Al Ellis back to back baskets for Louisville and just like that its a onepoint game he is in his whole back early my goodness midrange game on point thats a tough a little floater that time over the D he made it look easy with one hand Applause favor Ira into the game limited minutes of season for Miami and that one way off the mark Louisville looking for their first lead of the game and they get it through L Ellis a seven nothing Cardinals run in the last minute and Louisville is leading on the road against top 20 Miami Applause the last thing Kenny Payne said to his team when they broke from shoot around this morning and they were in their huddle he said we have an opportunity to knock off a top 20 team lets stay focused and keep the same energy Withers right to the ram through traffic its a ninenothing Louisville run Music who could have predicted this when Miami went out 10 nothing early three and 21 Louisville has battled back to take a threepoint lead Miller cant tie it up it follows the pack he pulls the trigger cant connect from the corner third times the charm Jordan Miller perfect position for the final yeah hes done that a couple of times and again the athleticism not a great block out by Louisville and right now again we got ourselves a game we were on the road Applause playing really well Applause these next three minutes to finish this first half so crucial for this Louisville team Applause to round kicked out to Wong Alice not giving him an inch and thats Wongs first Miss of the night okay the defensive intensity uh for look theyre contesting shots and then theyre blocking out on this last three to four minute stretch thats been a physical game and then the execution on this end really has been good inside Roosevelt wheeler misses the layup foul called against wheeler a frustration foul after the misplayup but Louisville using a 132 run and they have poked in front with 231 to go with his first half Music Auto Owners protects your home Louisville holds the lead and Al Ellis is the reason why Malcolm I mean hes got it going uh really early 15 points three of five from the threepoint line he scored at all three levels he is so quick and then his midrange game that time off the reverse pivot giving it a little bit too small uh but this area right here if he starts knocking down threes and then you have to get up on him he is so explosive and in his ability to raise up over people and score into paint is what makes him a handful you look at what hes done in the last 10 games hes averaging 17 points per game and I think the improved shooting numbers but the biggest thing Kenny Payne said is that his turnover numbers have been down in that stretch had the first meeting earlier this year between these two teams Halal is just one of ten from the floor six turnovers so he has turned that around in a big way and Louisville has the lead with 220 remaining in his first half on the floor you know its funny you can never predict whats going to happen in the ACC so much parity in the League this year obviously a very exciting race atop the ACC Virginia Pitt winning today Miami trying to keep Pace but even a team like Louisville that loses Tuesday night 9157 against Pittsburgh they come out on the road and they have fought this entire first half and similar to how they started the pit games before it kind of fell off after the 10 minute Mark they were making plays like this missed the dunk everything but the Finish from wheeler LL is scooped to the hoop finally Cashes in off the turnover Music s has given them everything you got ourselves a card battle going on and right now Ellis is winning Poplar been quiet hits that three to tie it at 38 Applause Music foreign Applause ers trying to answer this is the three and a foul called on Wheeler Applause will remind you ACC Unity week tips off next Saturday ACC Network basketball doubleheader Pittsburgh trying to stay atop the ACC top game against Virginia Tech at five eastern and then Clemson take it on this Louisville team Music stretch run Begins for the ACC regular season title Klein was telling us Louisville next Saturday honoring the 10year anniversary of the 2013 National Championship team our colleague Luke Hancock will be there with Peyton Siva and the rest of that great Cardinals team that cut down the Nets 10 years ago and what a great run that was and our colleague one of the great guys that guy could flat out shoot it also played for Jim larranega during the George Mason run a lot of history there but right now this team Captain stretches they play the way theyre playing right there its hard to put a finger on yes you can talk about the turnovers of some of the defensive breakdowns but again when theyve not turned the ball over and played with this type of energy on the defensive side their team that has can be scary uh coach Lara Nega talked about that he said we are not looking past this game he knows they have some guys when they get high I can create some problems Music Applause another turnover offensive foul called against Kamari Lance his first Applause and hes poked in front right at the end of the first half taken back the lead and looking for more Applause foreign Applause Music Applause Louisville can take it down to the final shot of the half Applause foreign s great pump fake and he hits the three to make it a onepoint game headed into halftime Applause Music what a first half this was L Ellis scoring making plays Miami is in a fight at home against this Louisville team well we were just talking about Luke Hancock hes in the studio with Joel Berry is not putting together a full 40 lets see if they can close out in the second half Miami with leading at halftime under Jim larenega an impressive 179 and 29 its only a one point lead but hes the Miami team that wants to continue the string wins together as they chase an ACC regular season title foul called Popular to the line Music Jay the other number in that first half but Miami had 10 points off of turnovers now you look at it you say all right thats a lot of points weve only have five turnovers in the first half they average 15 for the season thats been a problem area for them but I think the biggest thing is they were live ball turnovers and Miami turned those in up to threepointers on the other end and got some points and you know again you take away those 10 points in the first half and theyre leaning you come off that huge win against Duke 8158 and then you look ahead perhaps to another big Monday matchup on the road in Chapel Hill you wonder if the Hurricanes had a little bit of a look ahead in that first half and now could be dialed in in the second half Curry trying to answer put hustle it to the rim Miami in transition Nigel pack easy laying oh this is key right here for both teams particularly the Louisville on the road first five minutes of the second half I think hes going to say a lot but to see if theyre going to stick around in this game Applause this right here again imbalance Kenny Payne talked about transition defense against this Miami club that time again not too many guys back for Louisville and giving Miami pretty easy look doing that Applause Music heres Curry five seconds to shoot inside to JJ trainer turn around nice low post move from JJ trainer with the shot clock winding down Ive been impressed with JJ trainer again hes got great length youre not blocking that little jump hook right there and thats a unselfish play or by Curry fine trainer called for the foul trying to defend Isaiah Wong who is really quiet at the end of that first half scoreless in the last 11 minutes after connecting on his first five shot attempts yeah I think its still more meeting with Jim larenega and the staff by him of being more of a facilitator not necessarily hunting for his shots again he had it going early as you can see in the first nine minutes 11 points he was perfect and then credit uh Louisville they took him out of it I said Percy Miller denied him a couple of times trying to take the ball out of his hand again I think thats a good game plan if youre movable and he gets it going let somebody else try to score and that actually worked hard to close out the last 10 minutes of that first half in our conversation with Kenny Payne he said its simple this fan base deserves fight Louisville show that fight in the open in 20 minutes because they keep it going as Miami has the lead at five foul on the floor before the Mike James bucket Applause Music I know its only five points but this is a bit of a danger zone for Louisville right you do such a good job getting back in the game trailing by 10 making it one point at halftime you cant let Miami now start stringing together defensive stops and then cashing in on the other end yeah defensively thats where it all starts for them but he said part of that is is having good offensive possessions where we dont turn it over and thats right on cue now if youre again you dont want to turn the ball over but if youre going to do it obviously dont make it a live ball where you allow Miami to go down and get points in transition with an easy bucket at least this time you get a chance to set some defense up looks like theyre going to Zone removal trying to give Miami a different look keeping out of this Zone you must find the shooting Miller dumps it down low there is again North Shadow there hes been rocking the rim all night and thats all set up Miami to passing but again theyre spread out moved on defense because you have this respect and get out on those Shooters great zone offense by Miami L Ellis a oneman scoring machine he had 17 in the first half poor transition defense wide open three and Wong makes him pay foreign Applause thats not Miami really doing anything spectacular other than running their transition offense you have to recognize the shooters Withers great individual effort Louisville doing a really nice job on the offensive end shooting 59 from the floor they just need stops hot Kenny Payne said it and he said it multiple times uh this afternoon and shoot around you cannot trade Buffett stuff with Miami thats what these two teams are doing right now Poplar Second Chance effort left in short North Chad OMeara foul Applause and this right here again this is how you break down this own beautiful pass by Miller and then omir almost ripped the rim again and thats beautiful body control Music okay I think this guy right here at the line has been really a game changer for Jim Lear Nega and this uh Miami Squad a couple of weeks ago we asked Jim larenega for a player comparison on North Chad OMeara no hesitation Kenneth Faried I dont know where he pulled that name from but its so accurate it is and he said look his pursuit of the basketball on the offensive and defensive blast hes like the only thing Id say just be relentless and he is one of the better rebounders not just in the ACC but in college basketball Applause watch them go up and try to get every rebound okora 4 gathers puts it up and in the stop right now to extend this lead Louisville keeps keeps inching back the Cardinals have made three in a row Music Applause Poplar the blow by offensive foul they say Poplar hooked Music JJ trainer in Louisville basketball trailing by six hanging tough on the road against top 20 Miami well it has been a crazy Saturday in the ACC full of fun finishes are the only place to get you caught up is right after us on nothing but net right here on acc Network Kelsey and the crew will break down all the games from today and tell you about the week to come awesome ACC title race Miami trying to keep Pace atop the ACC with Virginia in Pittsburgh but also nationally Hawk you see that net of 30 how do you think Miamis resume Stacks up when it comes to March yeah I think its really good and you know again I wouldnt be surprised or look they went on a Deep Run last year in the NCAA tournament similar team theres some similarities obviously Isaiah Wong back from that team thats a goal test out the basket Music this is But to answer your question and add on it look they have a a very strong team again they almost played Four guards to go along with OMeara and again their team that can spread you out offensively and shoot the three ball and you take a look at the Quality wins look Virginia Providence Rutgers you know all teams that are a quality teams are going to have some opportunities to add to that as well to closing out this ACC team six quad one wins I think thatll help separate Miamis resume wouldnt be surprised if they sneaked to a three or a four seed Beasley Joseph Off the Bench blown this game open its an 11 Point hurricanes lead largest to the ninth Jim laronega cant believe the call Applause Jay I think this right here has what has changed their defensive press here uh has picked up not happy with that call but I think the thing thats different from last years team to this years Miami team I think their bench is much stronger now again theyve been quiet in this game theyve only really produced Four Points lets take a look after the replay theyre going to add on to the booze but I think theyre a much deeper team of this year this Miami team and Applause Music certainly that is a luxury every coach wants to be able to go at least eight or nine deep into their rotation Music Applause you say Joseph was out of bounds is back on the end line Applause we told you this is the danger zone for Louisville they got down five and now just like that its an 11 point lead for Miami Cardinals fans have seen a similar script All Season just a few minutes that lapse those are the ones you need to make to stay in it and Jalen Withers does just that and theyve worked that play a couple of times now again theyre trying to get a shot off of their actions out of bounds underneath theyve executed beautifully Music Applause all right now are on the move conditions but cant get the Finish got a clean look popper getting in the mix with four or four and Al Alice take another look Applause pretty good Collision but its been a physical game and I think on Miami trying to do the same thing as that Louisville did to them in the first half and theyre trying to deny L Ellis the ball again Joseph is a face guarding L Ellis I like this get the ball out of his hands try to make somebody else score Applause Music Applause offensive foul before a freshman thats the right call and theyre so high on this young man Kenny but painted staff really like him but thats when again hell learn cannot move on the screen that time really youre trying to rebuild some momentum cut into this deficit Applause talk about how Dominion mentioned in the first half Wong and paccar but what you can bring on guys like Bensley Joseph Harmon Beverly so deep in the backboard Applause and the front court its a oneman scoring machine nor Chad ONeal stays perfect on the night six for six after that made in Miami has changed their pick and roll coverage theyre blitzing hard oh theyre digging the ball out of L Alices hands theyre just doubling him making him give it up Amari lands shot clock winding down to one okorafor doesnt realize it and thats a shot clock violation Applause Music Applause and this right here played look at the Seal of five north Shadow if he catches it that deep youre either gonna have to foul him or hes going to get two a beautifully designed play all set up though Miami uh theyre spacing and then the postentry pass was on point all right one into the lane across the handle itll save Miamis way yeah thats pretty good defense by trainer that time against Isaiah Wong hes got great length able to bother him almost came up with a turnover Applause Music Applause a mirror on the move sling to the rim cant finish Applause this will go Louisvilles way Richard Anthony Walker checks in for Jim larenaga Music I think the guys fresh too they go full for pressure Bensley Joseph creates the turnover tomorrows call for a pushoff turnover starting to pile up on Louisville yeah and theres really no need for it again if theyre denying LL is that fine you go grab it and then let him go try to get open on the other end of just another missed opportunity and lost possession Cardinals only had five turnovers the entire first half theyve already picked up five turnovers in the first seven minutes of this house Music Applause heres Wong pullup pops usually he is money from that spot missed it there Applause LL is who is 19 to his name today Applause Lance spinning his way free and connects Ive been impressed both sides that time though lands beautiful footwork on the reverse pivot and finish Applause Music out of space who can make Louisville pay Applause Ellis draws the contact that was so Shifty he knows if he goes to the ball Miami is traffic so hes faking Mikeys gonna go off of that high ball screen and hes just blowing by his Defender where the hell cant get there cut such a Quick Change of Direction Music Applause Ellis beats everybody to the rim and he has 21 thats the speed right there I mean hes coming out hes trying to trap him he just blew by him again he knows hes getting trapped now hes uh rejected the ball screen a couple times that time he just put on the Jets went right down the lane thats a beautiful finish by L Ellis Beverly he cant connect battle through the board omear has a kick out back Applause Music Applause a huge Nigel pack three ignites this Miami team they lead by nine Music exactly not confirmed these people see our kids youll be able to see them when you watch your kids in a room thats actually connecting it matters where you stay Music so a little ACC trivia for everybody theres four active ACC head coaches that were drafted in the NBA two of them in our game tonight Kenny Payne and Jim larenegger the other two Hubert Davis and Tony Bennett I know a lot of people are thinking okay we knew about Kenny Payne obviously won a national championship with Louisville Jim larenega was drafted uh yes he was he was a real a good player at Providence sixth round pick by the Pistons in 1971 back when they had that many rounds and he was a really good player for Providence before that Archbishop Malloy in Queens terrific high school basketball player hes in the Providence College Hall of Fame and he was telling us some great stories about how he used the ball hes got stories for days and uh some of those pictures and photos L had definitely some games with both these guys theyre really good players back in the day before their respective teams going on right here again not too many people thought this game is going to be this close on the road and I think thats the key word hanging around again can they try to put together a 40 minutes that has not been the case all season long desperately need a stop and they cant get one pack wide open it makes the Cardinals pay offense has not been the problem normal is shooting 63 percent from the floor and yet they Trail by nine Alice a friendly role on the road you said it a couple times today mouth and its not good enough to trade buckets its good that theyre scoring they just need to string together some stops yeah ball screens again Miami runs a lot of handoffs so dribble drives uh you have to have a good coverage on that end theyre just giving too many wide open looks to Miami thats where the issue communication is key anytime youre playing against this Miami team I know theres a lot of people still out there processing the fact that Jim larenaga was a great basketball player heres the proof this is in the NIT taking on Louisville score 22 dropped 22 on the Cardinals in the 1971 nit so they made it to Madison Square Garden and eventually lost to North Carolina and he played with a really great player Ernie d one of the alltime greats Providence as well too but again that memory hes definitely have some pretty good stories for us this afternoon L Alice goes into three Miami players and gets it to go wow hes got 25 Im not sure he was looking at the basket on that one degree of difficulty my goodness Applause once again Louisville has tucked the lead in half they trailed by 11 earlier this half now only down five Music step back three contested and he missed it frustrated Jim larranega as Louisvilles clawed their way back into this game Cardinals have made six in a row Applause Music Music and I get back right now tonight the ball through L Ellis to get it to Alice kick out wide open three no good Second Chance opportunity trainer denied Music binsley Joseph behind the back and a hard foul will send Harlan Beverly to the foul line and you cant ask for a better look though on that previous possession hell else dribble Drive pick out right here though beautiful behind the back pass a great Court awareness and then thats a heads up play though uh by Louisville the breakup of the dunk Music Applause now weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so take a picture or a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion posted to your social and you might just see it right here on acc Network government finally connects on a free throw after three straight misses for Miami still a two possession game under nine minutes left to play not a lot because people thought this game would be this close considering well Miami did the Duke on Monday night hurricane trying to turn it on here up the pack legs it up and in that right there and put Miami weve got 18 points off of turnover thats really the story of this game despite Louisville continuing to play really well offensively so when they dont turn it over that has not been the problem just really difficult to hang around in games when youre giving up that many points off the turnovers long feed to Amir and he lost the handle Louisville giving Miami everything they can handle to possession game with under eight to play Music Im your glitch your wife what a great ACC title race it is this year Pittsburgh and Virginia both winning today so Miami trying to keep Pace atop the ACC they thought it would be easy Malcolm Huckabee started this game 10nothing in the opening three minutes at credit Louisville they have just kept chipping away battling in this game making Miami earn this 11th ACC win I think a lot of eyebrows obviously raised at this score right here that its so close but credit uh Louisville they played well uh offensively in that first half LL has got it going but Miami right now again I think the biggest thing for them is uh LL Ellis theyre going to have to control him try to keep him out of the pace Force somebody else to score Cardinals shooting 62 percent from the floor Alice leads the way with 25 has the ball here in attack mode misses the layup after splitting two five on four the other way that was finally hustles back Miller misses the layup Applause Music lobs it inside kicked to the corner Withers left it short only the second time tonight that Louisville has missed backtoback field goals trying to narrow whats a twopossession game under seven to play foul Falls Music Miami already in the bonus so shooting the rest of the way Music one and one coming for Nigel pack Ed with a quick turnaround theyll be in Chapel Hill Monday night but before that matchup with the Tar Heels trying to close out Louisville Applause Music like this again in this situation uh putting a free throw shooter like Nigel pack on the line not a good a foul 88 a percent freethrow shooter and ACC play makes them both Music are shooting 60 from the floor and yet down eight Applause games in trouble foul called you cant expect to shoot much better than 60 on the road against the top 20 teams Music Music Applause only five points Applause Jose in his last 10 games though he has been playing really well for four moves 12 points shooting 44 from the Ford 43 from the threepoint line uh 10 games now Louis the changes up their defense gets a threequarter fourth pressure for Miami long in trouble passes out of it Applause understand the shoe long s up a three cant connect chases it down gets his own Miss off to omear whos fouled but how about the hustle from Isaiah Music 50 50 ball Wong gets his own rebound right here thats a great hustle play awareness not to step out of bounds thats just a tough break for the movement so they got the stops just unable to get that defensively back Music Miami already 14second chance points tonight nor Chad omear looking to add to that Tally from the foulon ACC Unity week tips off a week from today next Saturday here on acc Network Pittsburgh and Virginia Tech gets things started at five eastern time at the Clemson and Louisville at seven Cardinals will be honoring their 2013 National Championship team at the KFC Yum Center a night from tonight a week from tonight right now battling on the road against top 20 Miami fought all night long but Trail by eight trying to close that Gap under five seconds to shoot James turns around puts it up count it plus the foul for the Freshman Mike James thats just excellent body control right here again reverse it take the head concentration thats a big time move uh by Mike James and you can see the strategy right now Miami theyre just getting the ball out of L Alices hands theyre doubling him anytime he gets a ball screen and now theyre going to try to force somebody else to step up and make a play this free throw a sixpoint Miami lead Applause foreign Applause tonight five seconds to shoot Cross Court pass Joseph has to heave missed it and Louisville with a great chance L Ellis finds James open for three misses it got a foul on the ensuing rebound okay Jay thats twice now and this last probably five minutes stretch Ellis has made some really good dreams so much attention that time he kicks it out thats a wide open look for James again they dont make it but thats an excellent read by L Ellison again right here look theres three uh Miami Florida four Miami Defenders around him thats a wide open look all created by LL is drawing so much attention exploring ability and it was making me unselfish play recall the foul against Ruger Poplar who lives off for the Miami bench one and one for L Ellis makes the front end Louisville four of six from the fouling take another look at blur yeah literally in pain on the Miami bench now these numbers though four LL is 27 points efficient 1116 from the floor three a six from the threepoint line is perfect but from the free throw line Applause for North Chad omear hard foul and Roosevelt wheeler thats his fifth the wheeler has fouled out of this game Applause Music Miller has made some nice reads when theyve gotten him the ball anytime Louisville has pressed or phone a zone at Miami Miller has gotten to that freethrow line area and then easy to try to score or make plays for his teammates like he did on that last play Applause so dont be your steps to the line he is a perfect six for six from the foul line tonight and 607 from the floor Music and this right here again uh he gets right to the middle of that pressure and then hes making a read thats a really good decision uh by Miller and again they can beat you so many ways and they have four guys out there of that are very good passers around me has not made a field goal in the last four minutes theyve made Seven free throws to keep the lead at six Louisville not going away Applause a four or four decides to shoot it misses it thats all set up by Joseph he just denied L Ellis the whole time face guarded him Jim larenaga takes a timeout his top 20 Miami team getting tested leading by six Music Louisvilles been hanging on the road with top 20 Miami you would never know by watching them tonight Hawk that there are three and 21 team and we were talking during the break you think it was the early season losses that kind of sent them on this trajectory I absolutely think I think its something thats really not talked about a lot but you look at these first three games for Louisville all one point losses and uncle back for the sound bite that Eric Musselman said about Bellarmine hes like I would not ever schedule that team and you know if they went and maybe uh those three games games that most people think on paper theyre supposed to win then I think its a different tone maybe theyre I think the biggest thing confidence uh but again hard to put your finger on it when you see them play like this at times against the top 10 team with a chance for a threepoint play this is a great action by Miami and then on the offensive glass but Miami trying to close this one out at home update against Louisville Im a screen to talk about nearly enough tonight is how dominant Miami has been in this building this season here at home in an oppressive 130 could be 140 Malcolm and we spoke with Coach laronega about this of the atmosphere of the home court theyve had some great crowds of the fans have been here this place gets rocking and uh this uh home team really has rewarded the fans they have been uh really good at home Applause foreign Applause Music is going to play out every game is unpredictable but that final game of the season against Pittsburgh which could very well decide the ACC regular season title is here at home and undefeated in this building that could be the difference and who wins the ACC Alice Music Off the Mark thats who you want taking the shot though for Louisville he has 27 tonight and credit though Bensley Joseph he made him work for that they face guarded him pretty much uh the entire possession then he has to run off the screen wrong misses the Finish and Louisville just one for six from three Longs called for the foul the home fans cant believe it he thought he picked Alices pocket take another look and I think Ellis put on the brakes right there yeah thats a heads up move right there again he pumped the brakes yeah he got him with the body again from that angle right there definitely uh hit him with the body certainly impacted him losing the ball again you like the effort but thats not a good foul but by Isaiah Wong right there again you dont want to put to Louisville on the line and stop the clock Applause foreign Applause Music 1117 field goals Applause I am again I like the adjustment they are making him work and then theyre just denying him the ball Applause on contact no call back a deep three he buries him Applause foreign Applause Music and Miami a 10point lead with under 2 30 to play and Jay that was a fatigued shot that was probably uh one of the worst shots in the second half by L Ellis mainly because of the fatigue hes had to work so hard to get open otherwise again from the logo oh but Elmos Got It Again rolled around didnt drop Applause Withers nothing but the bottom of the net cuts it to seven timeout Kenny Payne and thats their two minutes of play Music well step aside Nigel pack Music seven point lead well points off turnovers will likely end up being the difference in this game it really is and again its unfortunate because the Louisville has done some really good things positive things on the road against this top 20 opponent but again Ill go back to the earlier comment look its the elephant in the room its the thing that really has plagued uh them all season long with the turnover numbers Music and yet this game not over yet Louisville at 3 and 21 on the season theyve hung all night long on the road against top 20 Miami Hurricanes and Juan trying to put them away Isaiah Wong now has 21 on the night thats a great read by Isaiah Wong again could have easily settled for that first three little head fake defense running out action easy pullup jumper for him all right Miami takes it away we were just talking about points off turnovers how about two more on an alleyoop Music Applause s and drills the three for Louisville Applause Music credit the Cardinals fight well this right here but the problem beautiful transition offense off the turnover uh for Miami Music and Beverly with the flush Jay back to the previous though confession uh for Louisville their last one if they could bottle that up right there LL is breaking down the defense defense and then kicking it out to wide open shooters so thats a formula for them again when theyre doing that not turning over it but on the other end of the breakdowns defensively communication and then you look at the wide open looks that theyve given up in these last five minutes off the turnovers really just tough Its the 20 points off turnovers that is so killer for Louisville a team that their previous season High field goal percentage 54 percent theyre well over that at 57 tonight you shoot 57 percent yet youre down eight Applause Music Applause great press break over here slows it down and is fouled out three Miami players including omir 12 20 or more tonight foreign Music Applause at the foul line 16 of 19 tomorrow right here on acc network of monster triple header basketball Boston College and North Carolina gets things started at noon and then its Florida State Virginia Tech at two and Syracuse Notre Dame at Ford dont want to miss that tomorrow right here on acc Network Howard rolls in for Omar Louisville has to hurry Music Applause called for the foul will send Ellis to the line Music that was with a chance to set a new career high he has 29 tonight 30 the number to be Applause got five assists in this game and probably could have more hes given really his teammates some wide open looks from the threepoint line hes brought so much attention in this game and that is a new career high for Al Ellis 31 points impressive individual effort from him hoping for a miracle of the final 40 seconds use a turnover and said they found Jordan Miller Instagram frustrating for Kenny this team played really well offensively tonight 57 from the floor just didnt get enough defensive stops to pull off the upside yeah that would go along with the turnovers and I think again if you start talking big picture Miami theyre going to be a team that can go on another NCAA tournament run I think others positive for this Miami team of the balance they have four players that average double digits but theyre free throw shooting again the close games out they have very good free throw shooters Jordan Miller on the line close to 90 are from the free throw line so again their team can beat you with so many different uh weapons lsd3 and Miami stood but will prevail now approves a 20 and fives on the season another 20 win season for Jim larenaga and eleven and four in the ACC you take a look at that upcoming schedule Monday quick turnaround on the road in Chapel Hill on big Monday yeah thats going to be a really uh big game two really good back courts and then that matchup of bacon and Norwich had Omer get your popcorn ready that should be a really good battle on the road Applause Music for Louisville your fall to three and twenty two one and 13 and ACC play if you only watch these 40 minutes you would never associate this team with that record as LL was continues to battle and fight Applause Music and youre taking a look at really one of the better individual performances that Ive seen or really all year by Elle Ellis and the ACC 33 points 12 but 20 from the floor its perfect from the free throw line and I think the big thing is you know Jay he made some really good reads uh in the second half where he was in the lane and then throwing Defenders and then kicking it out to his teammates Withers drills to three and Louisville puts up 85 on the road against top 20 Miami but comes up short hurricanes winning pack one over here all score over 20 20 wins now for Jim laronega this Hurricanes team and they stay in this very tight ACC title race Pittsburgh Virginia Miami all winning today that is going to be a fun finish to the regular season to see who wins the ACC for Malcolm
