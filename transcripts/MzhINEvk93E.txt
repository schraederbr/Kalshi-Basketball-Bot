Devils defensively coming off the bench but as a Difference Maker theyll have to do without for the foreseeable future hurricanes and Blue Devils Clarence Armstrong puts a ball in the air and away we go Miami got a freshman Austin Schwarz hell run the offense Lyn kid and common malawat inside kid tried to dump it inside turned it over on the pass for Brandon Johnson seon James and the Blue Devils on the attack offensively Applause malat for Proctor kiple for James now Proctor with 13 to shoot skip pass James thought about it back for can layup girl WD the Miami Hurricane scouted they felt as though Duke would come out with a live play on the first possession they didnt get the LA but they all did give up a lay up early so give the Hurricanes credit for not allowing what Duke normally does however going to have to be tougher on the interior but Thea from Deep missed badly on the three flag his first rebound heres Proctor malok so a play later they get exactly what Miami was expecting and thats the way Kam malawat attacks the basket he is a a tremendous presence on the interior for the Blue Devils normally starts off the game with a powerful dump heres Matthew Cleveland for Brandon Johnson the transfer from East Carolina now Schwarz to the basket and scores Austin Schwarz a freshman from Concord North Carolina couple of North Carolinians on this roster Schwarz and Johnson both in the starting lineup tonight for interim head coach Bill Courtney Miami on the floor losing five straight 12 or their last 13 Proctor Ts up a three n watch and kid battle for it and finally Johnson collects it couple minutes in Blue Devils BYOB basket you see it early Miami wants to feed ly kid they feel as though he can have his way against the sevenfooter of course the experience of Lin kid allows him to be one of the best in the ACC especially in the painted area shooting 65 from the field yep kid out avering 11 and a team High 7 and 1 half rebounds a game for Miami flag who was 11 of 14 from the floor on Saturday missed with a hand follow on shot good and thats another area of Ks game that people underestimate this quick second jump he knows where its coming off and before the other Defenders even recognize that hes already in the air tipping in his own miss here goes Cleveland on the drive and rejected my Music goodness K malawat getting the job done as a decoy he has you have to tag him on the interior you dont want to leave and allow him to get an easy dump so it allows kiple to be able to get an easy one as kiple picks off the inbounds pass lost to handle on the dribble last Touch by the Blue Devils turnover in transition and heres the the other action when you consider malats ability to roll to the rim and Bill Courtneys initial response we talked about this guys we scouted it they knew exactly what was going to happen and still allowed it to go down heres kid about 16 ft away knocks down the jump shot ly kids got four of Miamis first six Cory yeah strong start for ly kid and again if youre Duke Youre Expecting Miamis Best effort coming into this building Duke its everyones best shot and its been a great start already for Lyn kid and the hurricane James flag here at the top skip for kiple triple from the corner got it canle got five dke by three WD you know the coopa flag you know youve heard that he scored 42 points the other day right right did you know he had a career high seven assists heres kid on the jump hook ly kid who had only averaged seven points in his last three games has got six ly kid is ly kid is about his business hes no he is not kidding around no pun actually it was yeah it was kiple another one and the rebound for Johnson Miami going to see if they can find an alley in transition Duke gets back nicely Johnson at three at the front and Mals the rebound flag Proctor on the left side on the drive and couldnt follow it ston McCrae was there defensively the Junior from delr beach has comeing in wearing a number 11 Jersey for Miami heres Brandon Johnson and the three bounds outs gotten decent looks yeah two good looks for Brandon Johnson thats one of the things Bill Courtney talked to us about theyre going to need him to step up and make some shots rattle out three and thatll get us to a timeout almost 5 minutes in Duke by a point great action to start it off Cooper flag being a playmaker facilitator finding coner nipple knocks down the corner three but on the other end ly kid not kidding around here and Cameron Music indor first half number three duke whos won 10 straight has a onepoint lead on Miami court and of course all eyes on Cooper flag coming off an ACC freshman record 42 points on Saturday last time out already about his business early in the first 5 minutes two points two rebounds an assist and a steal so continuing to stuff the stat sheet as hes done all season long James Proctor and have come off the floor Mason Gillis is checked in with Caleb Foster in a Blue Devil turnover freeze Cleveland for a soft Runner and out of bounds it will stay or to go to the Blue Devils the Miami starting lineup brought to you by chits and of course Matthew Cleveland a part of that a senior from Atlanta of course started his college career at Florida State and hes joined by Theus Schwarz Johnson and ly Kidd whos off to a terrific start but is on the bench after picking up his first foul a moment ago yeah ly kid is been a focal point of the offense for the Hurricanes to start this game they feel as though they have an advantage there kiple three KH kiple with eight very quickly but Miami coming out in a Zone on that possession and dangerous to play zone against this dude Blue Devil team especially with conle on the floor substitutions across the board here Kyrie huy has come on the floor for the first time this year for Miami wearing number 15 there he is transfer from Idaho State playing against malawat missed with the jump hook hu he had a long healing return off a preseason hand injury and sees his first action tonight flag Baseline skip out for gilliss three three threes for the Blue Devils in a Bill Courtney timeout John Shire made it very clear to us early today its important to have Cooper flag on the floor with shooting around him weve seen examples of why over the last two position s Applause welcome back to Cameron Indoor Stadium where Duke leaves Miami 15 to8 Duke is without Malik Brown whos out for a significant stretch a key piece of everything that the Blue Devils are doing John Shire called him the connector for this team the toughness is so important that he brings and theyre trying to find a way to replace that hes going to be out and someone else has to step up in his absence especially on defense Valas and minin you know very well you you cant replace what Malik Brown does you can only try to find something new and I believe thats the call for the blue devs throughout this game lets find something new as you see Pat gangba coming in for a Kon Mala watch GBA a highly talented freshman but still getting his feet wet in the college game but his minutes will increase with no Malik Brown available for the Blue Devils its interesting two of the guys John sh specifically mentioned theres Gillis hes the other one and a three for Mason Gillis hes got six off ss bench in a Hur but heres the thing WD the key for the Hurricanes was make sure that they had the tag man that means someone has to get over and be in contact with the roller to the rim thats going to open up opportunities on the perimeter and Duke right now sharing the basketball extremely well finding the shooters boster for flag theres an extra pass kiple again 11 for con kipo bill Courtney needs another timeout its a 12 nothing run by the Blue Devils and now theyve got a 13point advantage Applause Applause well number three duke is roaring here at home its 21 to8 the Blue Devil bench early action Mason Gillis has knocked down some threes and the run the 120 run has been consistent of all threes as Chris Carell former ACC Player of the Year who got his first win at SMU earlier this year as a head coach tapping John Shire on the good to be with you my guy letting him know hey we talked about this in shoot around we talked about this a pregame and were getting exactly what we want on the floor Cory the collaboration of this basketball team myON just mentioned the Malik Brown injury Duke has been good defensively theyre ascending offensively they absolutely ascending offensively because they have a playmaker who is getting comfortable Cooper flag continues to deliver the basketball to his teammates making plays but more importantly Mason Gillis stretches the floor his ability to shoot the basketball his leadership youre talking about a young man who played in the national championship game last season provides that shooting he may play some five tonight for the Blue Devils the kicks for Cleveland Joe Bay now the Freshman Schwarz Cleveland with 10 to shoot back for Al Joe Bay oh nice pass ly kid the dunk hes got eight of Miamis 10 but thats the difference when you see Gung on the floor in comparison to K malow watch malow watch is starting to get comfortable he would have actually tried to recover and blocked that dunk attempt by ly kid gangba is much more of an offensive threat than malat is at this point but defensively hes not standing the same test Qui the flag has one field goal so far in this first half lost it the way up against kids slapped it out of bounds into the Miami Applause bench Miami getting the basketball in this inside as you crack the paint but no one there thats Conan nipple has to come down and take away that opportunity gangba did his job by cutting off the drive thats one kiple has to get down and take away that opportunity for Lincoln 11point lead for the Blue Devils Joe Bay to work a Miami team by the way thats fourth in the a see in field goal per a good talented offensive team Cory but they get overrun seemingly in stretches of 7 to 12 minutes in each game well the struggle for Miami is going to be on the defensive end of the floor as you see Bill Courtney continuing to try to establish link kit on the Block the foul was on gunga as we go to Breaking Cameron Dukes hit their last four shots from the floor on a 122 run in the last three minutes Cory and oh by the way they have held Miami to just five of their first 13 shots well and again its really been all about ly kid whatever hes been able to get going offensively outside of that another turnover for the hurricanes and how about the blue that was putting pressure on on the underneath out of bounds play No One open ends up being a dead ball turnover for Miami so seon James brings it front Court you see flag now the team leader in five categories top 10 in the ACC in all five by the way heres James a triple and he Rings the balling another assist on the 12 three of the year for SE James but Cooper flag attracts so much attention you see the entire Miami defense when he gets the basketball collapsing opening up passing lanes for him hes a willing passer hes a if hes going to make the right play you almost have to force him to be a scorer go get another 42 Caleb Foster heres flag nice pass gunga the catch couldnt finish at The Rim Joe Bay tries to get Miami in a transition Applause up trying to go to Ken he and gunba really battling at the Block Bea now now for Schwarz tend to shoot for Cleveland against Caleb Foster heres Schwarz Jo B bumped and foul by flag first on Cooper flag second on the Blue Devil WD on the offensive end of the floor watch Cooper flag as he gets into the painted area the entire Miami defense seems to be there waiting for him its an easy picking for Cooper he knows where his guyss are going to be spotted because they spaced the floor so well he knows hes going to have his options that time it with seon Applause James kid caught in a double team and almost threw it away James deflected Schwarz the catch and cant finish tried to get the allet to flag Bea hustle play in the back court to keep Duke from being able to Sprint the floor and the hell ball will still go to the blue dos and Bill Courtney at 54 years of age Alexandria Virginia terrific player in the Patriot League at Bucknell and a coaching Journey my man BC let us know early today the hits keep coming he often times he goes out into games and doesnt even know whos going to be available to play theyre playing without a true point guard of course Nigel pack out and the backup Divine the tri is out as well and so not sure when Divine will get back and again the hits keep on coming and the biggest hit having to come here and play against this team not at full Applause strength 182 run the latest Dagger from Isaiah Evans show Tom Slims on the board heres kid against gunga reverses and scores 10 first half points for ly kid but heres the thing WD if you have to work that hard to get a bucket right Duke will live with that twos arent going to hurt him especially when they continue to make threes on this end of the floor Evans thought about it flag for James heres Evans again this one a little deeper gmed out the of the rebound Miami trailing by 15 Schwarz cuts it Loose out of the corner and it rattles in thats the way Schwarz got on the floor early in the season from Miami shooting the basketball and again a capable score from Beyond the threepoint Arc forced play the point guard position right now without the their two primary point guards available yeah nigal Packs been done since December 10th Cory and hes missed the last six and no time table for the return as Evans bombs home another one let me tell you what you cannot do leave him open you cant no no and not even open you cant close out short slim is going to let it fly you know what hes in there for he is absolutely going to let it fly when he gets his opportunities he does even have to have an opportunity to Let It Go turned over on a deflection by James flag into the front Court heres seon James to the basket Cleveland a good job defensively in the recovery from Miami Bea step in two at the left is good thats a guy that Miami needs to get more production from an AllAmerican McDonalds AllAmerican freshman J Bea had a conversation with them pregame let them know hey look these are the guys you played against your entire life nothing new for you and I would love to see him be more aggressive on the offensive end flag right to Johnson in the basket one person we never have to worry about being aggressive is Cooper flag but its not always to score everything he does is aggressive whether its going to get a bucket where its attacking the P the paint and making the right play going after an offensive board whatever it may be Cooper flag is going to be aggressive attacking the rim getting to the free throw line where he was 16 of 17 in his historic performance on Saturday flag for the threepoint trip Cory the thing about flag is the respect level of his teammates its its remarkable this guys been playing 16 tonights his 17th college game and yet he is a leader of this foot of this basketball team he absolutely is but its partly because he plays so hard and he works so hard everyone respects a guy that works hard but Coopers also vocal hes been that way for a very long time hes used to being kind of the the leader of the pack regardless as to who hes amongst hes the guy that everyone looks up to well and in the case tonight hes been as much an assist as a score and Dukes got a 16point lead we went old school went 32bit video game here he plays like a throwback so we may as well throw it back and you talk about back when he was 17 years old and he was putting up good numbers but how about once he turns 18 look at these numbers WD 244 a game of course an ACC record single game freshman record 42 points happened to throw out seven assists in the same game of career high seven assists for him and picking up his third sweep of the ACC rookie of the week and player of the week Awards Blacks got five assists Dukes got 11 assists on 12 made baskets here in this first half and building this 16point Advantage AJ ston McCrae is a transfer from Sanford this is Lyn kid going to work hes been Miamis best offensive weapon and left that on the IR easiest rebound of the night for common malawat and thats all you can do for malawat is to be big on the interior make it difficult for ly kid not allowing him to get good looks ly kid can make tough shots he shown that here already today inside Music malok Mason Gillis has made it happen tonight Cory he really has and Cody Kimbell associate head coach for Miami talked to us about what they had to limit it was the dunks and the lobs from duke which of course gets this crowd going here on the interior and also not turning the basketball over how about thiso good fortunately that Rim has a little give in it WD Mal watch with some force on that possession and one of the things John sh talked to us about was he believes malat is ready to play more minutes and so with Malik Brown out they will have him on the floor for longer stretches than hes played throughout this year a career hot 19 points for him how about KH K nipple hes into double figures now 13 first half points for KH can Music Applause Music Applause nipple Blackman transferred from ston he was a terrific player last year on a team that went to the NCAA tournament out of the Atlantic Sun six to shoot long three for Schwarz bangs off the iron Evans runs it down Gillis heres Applause Proctor 20point Advantage for the Blue Devils Gillis out of the corner the hits keep coming tonight for the Blue Devils we watched Mason Gillis and seon James work out before shoot around today Y and Mason Gillis was locked in he understands how his role will increase without Malik Brown and showing John Shire to be an expert about getting him on the floor even more Schwarz a step back three rebound malw watch Duke is now nine of 13 from behind the line and that ball got slapped away State McCrae touched it last watch how the Blue Devils share the basketball you see cona nipple finding Mason Gillis in the corner but the bench reacting and again this is what you love to see a team that cheers for each other is happy watch each others success even when your best player on the bench standing up cheering on his teammates wow oh my goodness Im not sure if it wasnt going in on Khans lob it it may have been going in however Mala watch with great hands and the ability to be able just to guide that in the basket Im not even sure we need to call that a dunk it was very finesse out front long three rattles out for Blackman another rebound from malawat but its tough shot after tough shot on the offensive end for Miami while the blev are getting exactly what they want on the offensive end K nipple into traffic little scoop and Applause Music score another Miami timeout 14 to nothing run by the Blue Devils 44177 at Cameron late in this first half Applause Applause Music all right Kevin thanks very much good to see coach and Shawn on for the ride tonight final four minutes here at Cameron its been all Duke but look how far now malat is making then kid have to catch the basketball away from the basket beautiful move by kid but trying to get to the rim and finish before the shot blocker can catch up canle leading the blue doubles and scoring in this first half Proctor is scoreless Showtime slim rolls off Evans who has hit two threes in the first half has missed his last two Music Applause heres Brandon Johnson theyve only got seven other points cor it beside Lyn kids 10 points in this first time but heres the thing WD you cant run plays against Duke look at the switch you got a seven footer going out switching you know 25 ft away from the basket great job by Johnson coming in and getting the offensive rebound but you got to have some guys that can absolutely just break down a Defender get into the painted area create an opportunity for themselves or their teammates and without having those type of gods its going to be difficult to beat the Blue Devils especially coming into thisa in early may my God Dicky V switching it up it used to be a Mercedes you were always going to drop the top but now in the 20th year of his Gayla switch it up to the Beamer right now I respect that one the magical events on the basketball calendar every year canle out of the corner fourth three of the half kipples got 18 you know that uh freshman record that uh Cooper flag set three days ago yes sir I do kiple might be making a run at that here already 18 in the first half yeah Cleveland kid the jumps out over GBA is good a dozen for ly kid but the hill is already very very steep for the teams and for the record Duke is a better second half team thats right and so its going to be interesting to see how this plays out when you consider that they will not take their foot off the gas pedal on the defensive end the floor thats what John cire has this year oh flag almost completed this pass but heres the thing it was the right Play Tyrese Proctor was just expecting for Cooper to shoot the basketball so hes already sprinting back on defense had he stayed spacing the floor he would have got a wide open threepoint field goal opportunity which of course has been great for the Blue Devils here tonight of K nipple knocking down believe five of them on his own hes almost outscore the Hurricanes by himself yeah Blackman out front tend to shoot Cleveland out of a double teame and the three from the front is good for Jaylen Blackman one of the very few good clean opportunities that the hurricanes have gotten on the offensive end of the floor was a slow Rotation by the blue doubles and because of that moock will be checking back into the game on the next dead ball heres kiple just going to work here in this first half and another one away rattled off gunga tried to tap it out Miami the long lead kid the catch collects and score smart play by ly kid yep Cooper flag trying to track him down and block the shot the pump gets Cooper in the air and easy bucket for ly kid who whos having himself quite the first half here 21point Blue Devil lead Proctor is scoreless in this first half for canle is knocked flag of three rattles in not everybody else is doing it yep might as well get involved in the action hes been the guy sharing it for the majority of the first half now hes the recipient I keep thinking how well noted a shot it in here on Saturday Dukes got the the same vibe in this opening 20 here tonight yeah they absolutely do no D got off to a late start shooting it though they were down 140 to start the game before they start to get hot Dukes got 11 threes and 17 attempts in the first half and they can finish the frame with another if they choose here flag against Brandon Johnson with 10 seconds kle out heres flag for Pro on the drive two1 with the left hand partially blocked and theres the horn number three duke has been as good as advertised in the first half well Ive always said this is a great and 17 tries and they have got a 24point lead as Miami starts the second half with the ball and you see Miami intent on getting the basketball back into the hands of ly kid if youre Bill Courtney right now do you come come back from 24 down the likelihood Is Not Great especially here on the road but you want to work on things that help you moving forward as we see Jil but they get into the painted area with the nice midrange pull up and you look at the bigger game here for Miami Cory a loss here tonight puts him at 0 and six in the ACC with SMU at Coral Gables on Saturday yeah it doesnt get any easier but when you consider the fact that you can take some things away what did you have success against the best team in the country on his K alos comes up with another put back for him and hes had a strong start to this game as well yeah hes got eight points now on his fourth field goal follow watch is a perfect four for four from the floor along with seven rebounds well eight if you count the follow there yeah and of course had his second double double of the season last time out 19 points which was a career high and 10 rebounds so hes continuing to become more and more comfortable in his minutes all watchs numbers kind of got lost you know just slightly you mean by the Cooper flag assist total no by the Cooper flag scoring total so the three by Miami made by Schwarz is his second of the ball game hes got eight yeah the assist total wasnt bad either yes career hot seven assist for Cooper I dont think anybody was talking about that though no they werent he may blow through that one here this evening as well yeah theres flag on the catch skip for look at the ball movement here again canle back for flag extra pass Proctor skips for James at the sh clock buzzer they took two or three extras huh yeah a little too unselfish right now see passing is contagious when you get guys wanting to share the basketball John shy letting his guys know hey its okay to shoot it of course John Shire was a big time shooter so he would absolutely want to shoot Applause that fire what do you hear from John down there as he talks to his team well the guys as they were coming out they were saying first four first four make sure you maintain the intensity John CH said we have to continue to share the ball he said he wants to keep playing the game the right way but he mentioned Lynn wood and he said we have to do more to slow him down because these are the kinds of things that were going to have to continue to build on especially with Malik Brown out going forward F on kipple I think the Malik Brown scenario John sh I thought was very candid with us today guys about the chemistry of the minutes the players that would be involved and how much Malik Brown means to who they are defensively when hes hethy absolutely Malik Brown is the reason why Duke is so versatile defensively he can blow screens up he can Blitz he can also switch and guard 101 and Malik Brown is probably mostly responsible for the biggest win the Blue Devils have had this year beating number one Auber here on this floor he was the only guy that could come in and slow down Janai broom that allowed the blue was to get that biggest win of the year so with brown out of the lineup for at least a mided time its going to be interesting to see Duke grow Music defensively ESPN should be another great afternoon of womens hoops and the ACC of course is is having an unbelievable year Hannah hadalo playing for NE iy at Notre name Cory oh smokes but I tell you what Olivia miles back youre talking about an elite back court with the two of them fourth field goal for flag hes got 10 21point Blue Devil leag if youre Miami right now lets keep chipping away find things that allow you to be successful of course getting the basketball in this guys hands link kid has been successful for them throughout the evening kid with a right hand fell off the front of rim for malat but how about malat not only defending but still finishing the play off going and getting a defensive rebound canle out of the corner another three 21 now and his eight field goal for KH kiple not sure how he can continue to be open when you get back and get matched up number seven should be absolutely at the top of your list of guys to find along the threepoint line tough shot for Blackman Qui quick Outlet heres flag open floor kle feeling it here up against kid draws the foul second on Lyn kid first of the half on Miami Myron you know kmo played in a mens league that his dad has run for the last 20 years went up against a bunch of former D1 guys D2 guys when he was just 15 years old Ben bruss played at Wisconsin and he was in that league and he said he hip checked k canle early in his career to kind of test him a little bit and he said he was surprised that K kiple came back and contined to fight at that age he said thats what he knew that he had a bright future and that he was a lot tougher than maybe he looked tell you what he is uh hes not far back a number two cor no not at all and you know what Ill take exception to that why is it that K canle doesnt look tough Music Im sure K would say he looks pretty tough tresman from Milwaukee is having quite a night hes got 22 now in the ball Music game Cleveland heres Schwarz kid on the roll and Cleveland with 10 to shoot pushes up a three and the rebound for flag thats another tough shot and then of course Duke finishing the defensive possession with the defensive board flag will spin lost a handle on it malat had a shot at it heres Cleveland Matthew Cleveland splits the two put it up rejected by flag but a whistle and a foul from Clarence Armstrong Its going to be on kiple well I tell you what youre looking at a few guys on this list right now here who had great performances here so far this evening three top 10 mock draft picks and Dukes freshman lineup Applause well you hear all about Cooper flag on Saturday well welcome to Tuesday night and KH canle KH canle putting on an exhibition from Beyond The Arc five of seven shooting to three and got off to an early start and you love at WD when they dont touch the rim most of the time the net is just up there to be something for him to look at as he continues to light it on fire KH can nipple getting the job done 22 points for him still 1537 remaining Matthew Cleveland to the line first point of the night for the senior transfer from Atlanta hes got a pair and here comes Paul Jo to replace Cleveland now if you follow basketball and you follow the ACCC in particular you know that the day after Christmas Jim Lara called it a career 14 seasons in Miami 41 as a head coach and nearly 750 wins now Miami going to stay man here as Caleb Fosters back on the floor for John Shire with almost 5 minutes G second Applause half what a three flag wide open back rim Miss by ston McCrae Applause Austin Schwarz is a freshman Brandon Johnson whos from Raleigh transferred in from East Carolina to Miami and Lyn kids been their best player offensively in this maybe their best player both ends of the floor quite frankly but as a perimeter player playing against the Blue Devils there seems to be no room as we get an opportunity to go back it give our God Jim Lena his flowers of course hired on April 22nd 201 11 the winningest coach in school history at the University of Miami multiple ACC championships three two regular season and one tournament championship and also an elite eight and Final Four along the way the only coach in division one to have 100 conference wins at three separate schools lets get that man in the Hall of Fame yep flag the Miss out of the corner Miami foul and the canes commit the foul on Lyn kit its his Music third and of course Lona we said resigned day after Christmas and Miami has been 0 and four Applause since Foster trying to get on the board strong drive from the ring for Caleb Fosters first B and maybe that can get Caleb Foster to go on 0 for three against noted a last time out thats his first basket of the game and in a different role started out the year as the starting point guard for the Blue Devils seon James taking over that rooll but Duke is going to need Caleb Foster to be able to find his offense for them to be successful this season one of the keys for them to be successful is having everyone involved in the action so the foul is on kiple itll be his third Cory theega retirement brings to mind the storyline of the ACC and you know we we all knew one day this might happen we just didnt know how staggering the departures would be in some respect and the effect that it would have on the league when you consider of course not only the three Hall of Famers and Coach K coach Bayon and coach Williams retiring but also Jim Lena who should be and Tony Bennett who was absolutely on his way on that path so its a different game its a different league right now especially without those five coaches see all those wins and all those NCAA tournament appearances kick out flag of three from the front is good Cooper flag shooting over 50 from three is his shooting coach my guy Ralph getting the credit for Cooper over Christmas break getting back in the gym talked to his mom about it she said he just needed a mental reset to remember who he is and I tell you what he absolutely found out over the break because he has been lights out ever since that ball got deflected away last Touch by seon James and another look here and seon James attacking the paint Cooper flag doing a great job relocating to the spot as we see Mom Kelly holding up her threes and Ralph proud of his work I text Kelly and say wait a minute so now Ralph is cuz Kelly always tells me Cooper gets his game from her and so I said so Ralph is a shooting coach she tells me apparently he is begrudgingly she said it heres a lead for Gillis and Schwarz makes the steal ston McCrae the other way with a triple and it rattles in for Miami AJ ston McCrae another guy that the Hurricanes need to get going again theres a lot of Talent on this Miami team they are playing without a point guard however theres a lot of talent and if they can find a way to get connected and playing together they can make some waves they can get some win in the ACC theres more than enough offensive Talent on this Applause side and turn over here is huy Kyrie huy whos on the floor for the first time this year playing tonight for Miami came up with the loose chain ston McCrae face sline Brandon Johnson here kick out and the long three pounds away for Johnson flag ahead for foster into traffic Caleb Foster and flag with the follow and and almost tapped it home here go the canes the other way now Huey lost it on the dribble Gillis the turnover for Miami and now seon James strong to the basket and thats just his second field goal but John sh uses that word connector that Myan referred to earlier James does so many other things absolutely seon James Malik Brown those are the two guys that John Shire identified as the connectors for this team but you and I watch seon James and Mason Gillis work out pregame I tell you what I wasnt sure if they were work getting ready for a game or getting ready for the NFL combine you talking about two guys who are are definitely mature physically thats going to bring us to a timeout Dukes ball when we come back hey Cory by the way mom and dad watch the throw here and the interception the report card after the game going to be tough Applause here all right Music night N9 minutes gone in this second half Dukes been in firm control almost from the jump Foster couldnt win it at The Rim kick out for Proctor James clutched on one Bo is he he is a load on the bouns theres GBA on the follow for his first basket yeah and gunba getting involved on the offensive end of the floor and thats another area where he can help the Blue Devils just as we saw m watch a number of times coming up with offensive rebounds when guys are driving to the rim the big mans responsibility is to clean up the mess if you take away a shot blocker you get an easy one heres ston McCrae for kid on the Baseline left out short poor to rebound or Patrick GBA 611 freshman hes from Manasses in Northern Virginia part of that talented ball the 16 last year in the Commonwealth also part of the team taking take over peach jam championship team coach by my God J Jones along with Darren Harris on the Duke bench right now Donnie Freeman at Syracuse that team was stacked yep theres Jaylen Blackman they what if Miami could get Blackman going offensively that would help ly kid inside and get Bill Courtney a little bit more of a reliable punch on the perimeter yeah but speaking of reliable punch theyve been able to rely on Matthew Cleveland for the last six games but he hasnt even scored in this game as ganga gets another opportunity soft hands for him around the rim a Applause promising four points for GBA Cory how much of his increased time is going to be driven by points its got to be other things too right no it absolutely be other things its going to be defending its going to be rebounding and of course giving another big body for them to be able to give watch more rest with no one and John sh told us you know with no Malik Brown theyre going to have to find something new and I believe that theyve done that here not only with gunga getting more comfortable but also Mason Gillis on the floor playing smaller with him at the Five Spot and how his SPAC is out the floor with their threepoint shooting yeah heres kid trying to find a pivot and does l kid first points of the second half give him 16 now all on field goals I would say this is the most aggressive Ive ever seen ly kid hes continued to try to be aggressive on the offensive end when hes gotten the basketball in his hands regardless as to whos guarding 27point lead for the blue nles in this 10 game win streak seven of the wins have been by 20 or more James backr Miss and heres Blackman beating Foster to the front Court Z huy on the L for kid and guns but both there to defend him ston McCrae from the corner oh look at Foster challenge for the rebound last Touched By The KES itll go to Duke when we continue tonight ly kid has been the central offensive figure tonight from Miami 16 of their 42 Duke Lee is 27 Music out of gots have not looked back 6942 but only two made threepoint field goals in the second half they did the majority of the damage at the first half made 11 threes early in this game but the defense has continued to be stingy and a foul on Brandon Johnson as Cooper flag with contending for the loose ball in the front Court its been interesting to uh kind of dig in a little bit on the Blue Devils and where they are but and Bill Courtney I really enjoyed our visit talking to him Cory but it also stems back to the fact that bill was there with Jim Lena who did such a great job and the thing we showed a moment ago 140 some NCAA tournament appearances by those guys yeah I mean and again when you think about that but you also considered the 10 national championships between those coaches the countless final fours and so theres a Changing of the Guard you know from the ACC coaches and Bill Courtney put in a tough spot I mean again you know Midway through the season to try to come in and write the ship its a difficult position to be in but he appreciates the way that his guys have continued to fight each and every game yep Isaiah Evans into the front Applause court and kiple back to work here Applause quick look from malawat going to work on Johnson with the left hand oh man he started doing that watch out again we know hes skilled but we havent seen that yet already a double double the second consecutive double double for modat 10 points and 13 rebounds yeah I also wonder if we maybe took for granted how good some of those coaches were guys and just what it takes to get to that level and to be consistent for 5 10 15 20 years I think now that theyre going were seeing what that means and the impact that those coaches made Marv I can tell you right now Im sure that there are some that took it for granted with West dur and I have been in this league for but how how long have you been around now uh in a in a professional role for 30 years professional role for me now 16 but of course 35 years in the ACC we absolutely did not take those guys for granted simply because the Excellence that the ACC has been forever a lot of it of course starts with the great Dean Smith at North Carolina but youve got to give Mike chesi a tremendous amount of credit to me he is on the mount Westmore of college basketball coaching theres the sh clock violation off the air ball by by be so myON I think the other part about this is and you see this from a national perspective John sh has done about as good a job as anybody could have hoped in following Mike Shashi I think we can say the same for Hubert Davis how this works at Miami how this goes at Virginia how this you know ultimately works out at some other spots I I think thats the thing we have to look forward to right Cory I I believe thats the case but when you also consider that its a different landscape nil in the transfer portal changed the game so when you consider what was the ACC its a different standing that you have to look up to that dont follow yeah I I also wonder fellas how many coaches are going to stick around until theyre 65 70 in this landscape you know I dont know what the future is but I talked to a lot of younger coaches who say theyre not going to be lifers theyre not going to do this for 30 years because its so intense right now just to maintain the team but I ask you this question as you say that how many of those coaches will actually have the opportunity in todays game where its you know its a microwave Society so if its not instant success you dont get as long of an opportunity correct thats fair thats a part of it too I I know a coach last year who was in the portal and he hadnt done his Scout yet for a game that night thats how hard it is to do the job today fellas shot rolls off the back iron theres Miamis night in a nutshell Applause Blue Devils 34point lead here slapped away on the turnover lead for ly kid and hell flush it with kmle defending 18 for kid Applause Applause now Cory I Dukes getting ready to win for the 11 time and maybe the eighth time in that 11 straight by 20 or more yeah they theyre actually their scoring margin is plus 20 yeah as Cooper flag now picks up his sixth turnover on the game thats the one thing he has not done extremely well throughout this one but you mentioned that Duke now with the second longest winning streak in the country behind a member of this conference the Big 12 we got a big match up tonight Baylor visiting Arizona but of course Iowa State out of the Big 12 with the longest winning streak in the country at 11 games what a terrific League theyve got again this year front rim Miss by Johnson heres canle on the outlet for Isaiah Evans who it eight for Evans now and how about Four Freshman and a senior a graduate transfer senior on the floor right now playing the five and John experimenting with Mason Gillis and again ly kids going to be able to score over the top of Gillis but hes not going to go through him Mason Gillis as strong as anyone youre going to find on the floor standing his ground up against a guy that has about a 5 in height advantage and a timeout under four break and watch common malater on the follow back after this Music Applause all right Kevin thanks Bo and Jay will standing by in the desert tonight the opportunity to see Caleb love who has success in this building very few people had as much success in this building as Caleb I believe he has three wins here two with North Carolina and another one with Arizona contact technical foul red number two two shots and well play from there so you heard Clarence Armstrong just say dead ball contact technical foul on Brandon Johnson I missed that I think thats what he just said on the yeah thats thats what we talking about I missed it in live action must have happened once we went to we were going to time out so foster h a couple of free throws on that we did see the conversation between Clarence Armstrong and Bill Courtney we knew Bill Courtney was upset about something yeah and it must have been either right as the H right as we went to the break so a technical foul on Brandon Johnson and Duke the ball kick out three at the front Gillis thats the problem when you play a guy like maon gills at the five spot that means that centers are going to have to guard him on the offensive in the floor great design great execution by John sh to be able to get Gillis A look hes actually not having to play the five right now as gunga back on the floor but Gillis has had a great evening from Beyond the har as well three ball for Schwarz is good hes now got 11 in the ball game thats his third triple of the night kids got 20 to leave Miami just six though in this second half meanwhile seemingly everybody but John shs hit a three for the blue dos heres kale Foster trying to add to the total John hit enough nice effort by gumba yeah going after the offensive rebound as we see earlier this is what Absol actually happened okay its the swing through with the right Applause arm the officials going back and watching that after the play once we got to a dead ball and assessing the technical foul on Johnson is Kaya Foster is able to knock down the three ball told you everybodys getting in on it and I think John shs made enough threes to where he doesnt have need to get any tonight I think hes got his fair share and theres going to be a foul I believe on Gillis with 2 minutes and change to go dont forget we hope youll take an opportunity to help folks affected by the California wildfires here as we started 2025 you can donate at redcrossorg ESPN to help the Red Cross respond and help people recover the the video from Southern California is just unbelievable it absolutely is WD I I got married in Malibu and my wife actually sent me a video of what Pacific Coast Highway looks like right now and you can only just keep the you keep everyone there affected in your prayers as my guy Spencer Hub of course from Southern California Im sure thinking a lot about his family and friends back home and JJ reic of course the former Duke star is now the coach of the Lakers he and his family were renting a house in that area and that house has been destroyed you know and I heard JJ talking about that and and again you know him talking about his sons art project and you know the things that you just you cant replace and you know I mean you feel for so many different people going through that this Stager the video that you see from California Paris is going to be fouled on the jump shot by Bea jalils first and thats five six now on Miami and the crowd here not happy about I believe that they are going to go over and look at this one yeah I think so because this one may have been even more than what we saw on the technical foul the wind up from Jalil Bea Y and it looks as though it made contact with the head of Darren Harris as you see the wind up coming here the swipe through and thats a Coss the head the contact above the shoulders could possibly be a flagrant one when the officials come away from the monitor yeah a little more turbulence to the night for Bill Courtney and so Tim clockery and Clarence arm strong are at the table to look at this after review common foul common foul so a couple of free throws for Darren Harris not mad at that at all and again it he was swiping at the basketball he does make contact above the shoulders but I can appreciate the officiating right now coming back with that just being a common foul shoot your two shots and keep playing on yep so Harris will go to the line six six freshman from hearnden Virginia this will be just his 12th and 13th free throw attempts of the year and his first point of the night a young man that is going to be really good at Duke says I got Spencer hubber gets on to the floor the only player on the Duke roster under 65 but of course a fan favorite here amongst the Cameron crazies 21st career game for hover out of Harvard with West Lake in the LA Applause area Matthew Cleveland still without a field goal in this game two points for him at the free throw stripe comes in averaging 20 points per game over his last six Brandon Johnson soft turnaround off the Baseline hes got a half dozen and the crowd whoops it up for hover as we go inside of a minute cam Sheffield and Neil meic are at the table as well for Duke here goes Hub on the drive no kick out for foster three got it and spener makes the right play but the crowd didnt want to see that they wanted to see him get a shot in the air everyone went a until Caleb Foster knocks down down to three getting by God Spencer Hubbert the assist as he attacks the basket off the bounce gets into the paint the nice find at the last minute and Caleb Foster knocking down his second three as everyone up celebrating the dime from Spencer hubber you know you know what I love most what the smallest guy got the biggest number 55 I love it yeah shot clocks off Dukes going to win for an 11th straight time and Cory for an eighth time in that 11 games about 20 plus they have a season High 25 assists and theyre going to win by 35 tonight they have shared the basketball extremely well it started from the opening tip and continue throughout the entire game this is a team thats very well connected on both ends of the floor
