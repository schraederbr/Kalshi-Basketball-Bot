shot of Blake Henson Miss makes Miami the number one seed in the ACC ENT regular season cochampions with Virginia what a game what a season Jay Malcolm thanks very much we welcome you to Little John Coliseum where Clemsons already built an eightpoint lead with Randolph Childress West Durham tigers on senior night Galloway had it fall off the front rim Godfrey the rebound and a last Touch by the Irish and it was out of bounds so itll stay with Clemson the tigers are here at 136 a win assures them of the double by could be the four could be the three depends on what happens by the way with Duke and Carolina ironically but a Clemson win and a Duke win Tigers could be the third seed well theyre coming out with a lot of energy right now on both ends of the floor offensively and defensively there middle Brooks reroute on lasheski had it knocked loose and heres Notre Dame trailing eight with five minutes gone in this first half Notre Dames won the last three meetings between the Irish and the Tigers last years regular season games were very decisive victories for Mike Brays team he coaches his final regular season game tonight three ball from the corner is no good for Ryan Clemsons switching five defensively at some point Notre Dame guarders have got to take advantage and drive it right now I think theyre selling too much for three a little Zone maybe here Galloway tees one up six for Galloway gotta find him he gotta know where he is Im sitting over here with the old coach now huh you go Zone thats one guy you got to know where he is Hammond Baseline the shezewski couldnt finish it on the cleanup here is Hunter leading the tiger charge Music Applause Galloway heres Godfrey terrific looking freshman left it on the rim Middlebrook slapped it out but luccheski and Notre Dame get a crack at it Clemsons doing a better job right now with attacking the paint theyre getting the ball theyre putting so much pressure on the rims and its leading the threes and and offensive reboundski nope too strong with the triple hes the one guy I think provides a matchup the way theyre playing now Tyson three from the corner Galloway delivered the number to him when a dangerous territory early here for the time of course Notre Dame they have to get a little aggressive defensively here Hammond back for warts against middle Brooks somebodys got to make a play off the dribble here s Ryan and he traveled thatll turn it over Brevin Galloways knocked down two threes here in the first nearly seven minutes steps into one here at the top of the key lets it Go cutting it off feeling well getting ready celebrating with his family on senior nights he comes out of the game and gets a break Galloways one of these guys thats had two senior nights one at BC last year and a grad night here at Clemson huh well when you get gifts like that on senior I wouldnt be surprised if he comes back if he could yeah collapsing on a 111 run I gave him crap you know when he was at BC because he had an nil deal with cookie dill and draw oh my goodness this is just this is getting away quick from the Irish first basket for Chase Hunter Clemsons now five of seven from three the ball is moving and bodies are moving Clemsons knocking down shots and better off defending as well back door here is Zona and Matt Zona the 69 junior is fouled on the play itll be against RJ Godfrey itll be his first and the second on the Tigers Balls moving popping Hunter Chase gets in on it Chase hunter gets in on the action these are going to be the first free throws of the year for Matt Zona averages eight minutes a game against the ACC thats the first mistake Clemson made today on the switch did talk on the switch when he was able to get it and throw the foul dont forget weve got a full weekend of Lacrosse for you next Saturday starts at noon presented by Ally terrific match number 16 Notre Dame Kayla trainer and number five Syracuse then we go to the mens card Ohio State visits Notre Dame at two and then Towson and Lars Tiffanys Virginia Cavaliers at four oclock all on acc Network and available on the ESPN app Zona knocks down the free throws stop the Clemson run still a 14 or 15 point lead rather for the Tigers youve got to get some stops here shuffling at the foul line I think hes the X Factor for this group hes the guy on The Scouting Report you dont want to guard you leave him open but right now hes rebounding hes passing and hes knocking down shots when he goes this team is really difficult to stop Works heres Zona in the corner now back to Ryan with 15 to shoot Applause Music Cormac all the way through against Middlebrooks forced it up got the roll tough shot cormack Ryan on the board for the first time you want to see now theyre switching he gets Middlebrook on him beats him off a dribble they got to do more attacking the big guys off the dribble when they get him on the switch stop settling for threes early Applause Music Tyson left side shuffling working into traffic over the top of Luba how about six for Ian shefflin on 33 shooting here early Randolph hes the guy that daring to make plays and so far tonight hes stepping up and hes answering the Bell making plays inside Zona the catch Tyson the rebound Hemingway leads transition cross for shefflin couldnt hang on to it turned over to Hammond unforced error by the Tigers their second turnover Music Applause more Ryan Fall Away and last touched its going to stay with Notre Dame were going to get a timeout strong start for the home team here at Little John tigers have a sense of urgency well get Randalls thoughts coming back in a moment targets are on site Randolph we said sense of urgency Brad Brown now knows it we talked about it with him today his team clearly knows it here are the states Clemsons playing with and I jokingly said this a couple weeks ago their postseason may have started two weeks ago but theyre still in the discussion point right its tonight but its also Greensboro its also other teams right how do you work through this a guy whos the Tigers winningest coach whos been here who knows what the postseason Chase could be like I think you just keep the focus on yourself right now they got to take care of business this is senior night theres a lot of emotion in this game and you got to navigate that theyve come out strong they got to finish this game tonight and then worry about the ACC tournament when they get to Greensboro Ryan the leaner off the window pair of field goals now for Cormac Ryan lose two of five from the floor first Notre Dame player with more than a basket Brians doing a heck of a job because like I said putting pressure on the rim not settling for Gem shots shefflin square is on lashesky Ians got to feel pretty good here six early points make it eight make it eight hes really forcing him to guard him now theyre switching putting smaller guards on him taking them inside and again they dont want to keep a bigger body you want to let the other guys get loose luccheski spinning into traffic offensive foul you mentioned earlier chaplains capable of being the Dirty Work guy and thats what hes doing hes the ultimate glue guy for this group they dont need another score out of that spot they need him doing all the things hes doing so far today here hes doing it on a defensive end sliding his feet putting his chest on the chesky drawing a charge hes offensive rebound hes defensive rebound and taking charges and hes scoring I mean hes doing it all right now for the Tigers and if hes doing all that he makes it tough to beat these guys otter Music Chauncey Wiggins Middlebrooks gives him a second chance Chase Hunter tees one up Middlebrooks will give him nope they will not because Bens going to be whistled for a foul thats what you want out of your backup being coming off the bench created an offensive rebound last possession fighting in there if you dont mind him getting one now hes done his job put a big fella PJ Hall to come back in and how about you swap PJ Hall from Middlebrooks who comes in there and then put PJ hall right back in I mean just two big guys to go get it right I mean its just they got to get more production from the adventure to Clemson I think thats the only thing that concerns you with the team I mean that five is strong production from their bench and its a good sign seeing Hemingway in the game right now yep Alex I think draws the foul trying to stay with Ryan first on Alex Hemingway fourth on Clemson now tough spot here for him first 12 games you see the numbers averaging 10 shooting 50 from three then he has plantar fasciitis step in misses 11 games now hes come back the numbers havent returned but I think you made the point today hes a veteran guy who knows what this league is when you have an injury like that plantar fasciitis its day to day is moment to moment and you dont know he can play today and be out tomorrow so its just you got to be critical of how you use them and when you use them Wiggins are two how about that spot up two from Chauncey Wiggins this week is really comfortable getting to a midrange shot took the first three he didnt go down and its more comfortable getting to that midrange jumping thats his first point in the last five games by the way for the Tigers whose lead is 19 with 11 minutes gone in this first half of Coach Burnell went to his bench earlier you can see the emotions from senior night his older guys came out a lot exuded a lot of the mg early and roll guys have stepped up coming in off the bench have been productive as well PJ hall now one for three Music there is wurtz with Hammond Goodwin Zona and lashesky heres Hammond on the drive and that got pinned to the wall by PJ Hall I think PJ Hall block that with his elbow heres Hunter chase looking for help look at this Wiggins open for the three too strong Notre Dame got away with that Chauncey Wiggins by ways 46 percent on the year from threepoint territory Music didnt communicate on a switch left him open I dont think he want to give anyone dare threes in the corner like that definitely not a guy shooting 46 percent worst deep three from the right Trey works well you were after him today to shoot around a little bit werent you I am Im a huge fan of his I I think hes an excellent shoot he does so many different things just think he needs to be ready to shoot a more aggressive and more assertive I think these guards for another name have to be more aggressive with JJ starting out and works is the secondary ball handler with this group of South Hammond scheplins got his fifth three of the year hes got 11 in the first half hes got his second double figure game and ACC play and Mike Brays got a timeout 19 point lead for the Tigers Music Geico has been offering savings well coaching your final night in the ACC in the regular season you had to work to get here now Friday afternoon Notre Dame boards the plane in South Bend got a little Charter coming to Atlanta right 33 degrees four inches of snowfall wrong they sat on the plane four hours deiced twice and at 7 45 they canceled the flight and went back to campus they flew to Greenville this morning at nine oclock got to the hotel at noon shoot around here little John with me and Randolph at one oclock yeah looks like theyre jump shots a little still in South bending right now they got to get their legs back under him and kind of settle down here its been a long day for these guys and lets see if they can regroup and get back in this game good one trying to get on the board does clean look at a three 44th of the year for Dane Goodwin I mean he needs to be the guy that gets going he has the versatility there like I said to play inside and out we spoke about it in the open so its good for him to get one to go down second three of the night for the Irish Dylan Hunter on the floor for the first time tonight for Clemson with Hunter Tyson PJ Hall Brevin Galloway Music and here is Dylan on the move into the lane and bounced it past Godfrey third turnover on Clemson driving in there trying to make it pass and forced it good one needs to step in and get going need him to be aggressive we talked about that with only six shots got that one to go down lets see if he can keep applying pressure here yeah averaging just eight points in his last three coming into tonight but conference averages nearly 12 a game for the former Golden Bear from Upper Arlington Ohio Zona working on Godfrey got in trouble and tried the Up and Under again and has missed them both 16point lead Dylan Hunter trying to weave in traffic here Music right over the top of a better drive there by Hunter getting put pressure in the rim but he also decided youre looking to score that time I think the first turnover he got last possession drove looking to pass that time he drove looking to score didnt get it its always a good thing good idea to pass the PJ off works and stripped and fouled on the drive Mike Roberts gets RJ Godfrey for his second fifth on Clemson DJ Hall gets it want to clear out you hit a coachs yellow space give him room and again hes so much better when he has space inside the option to back and you win or driving at that time he just pulled up for his midrange shot so Godfrey with two Randolph checks out Chase Hunter is back Music so we get the benefit of both Chase and Dylan Hunter and Hunter Tyson on the floor thats exactly what I was hoping for he messed that up I was really hoping for all of that ha 14 to shoot for the Irish Notre Dame is just five of their first 21 from the floor they hit 49 percent the other night against Pitt I think the number for these guys to score is they got to get the 103s Ryan and the back room Miss recovered by Tyson they were 1027 F kid I think thats the number they need they need to get the 103s and get themselves a chance heres Galloway with Hammond right to it Tyson Chase Hunter got it six for Chase Hunter hey whos going to get to 10 threes is Clemson theyre well on their way in making threes was never an issue with Clemson I think they just do it in so many different ways 21point lead heres luccheski knocks down a triple there you go you got to knock down he opens when the guy that forces matchup problems because of his size teams dont want to switch with him so expecting a half court setting for him to set as many ball screens as possible Music heres Chase Hunter shot fake sets fires left it on the line PJ Hall oh boy took a big time spill ended up against the basket stanchion Music and hes on the soft jog back up the floor as Hunter Tyson gets the rebound of the Notre Dame Miss boy PJ Hall when airborne and landed hard right against the basket support theres Galloway streaking for the basket eight for Galloway as BJ Hall gave thumbs up to the Benchmark was coming in from him I think hes let him know hes okay theyre guys and then theyre ombres Randolph PJ Halls an ombre huh my goods 20point lead warts airball yeah against PJ Hall thats one of those plays you want you want words tray to try to drive them Music for that time and I think he want that one back PJ goes down here hell take the water bottle from trainer Brad Crow how about a look at the uh look at this watch this coming right at you hello in the living room how about that love the effort Applause good thing hes young as if you and I did that well be out for quite some time Middlebrooks taking Van Allen Lube into the rack spins and draws the foul yeah theyre trying to get the Freshman up in space and drive them Lubin commits his first three on the Irish timeout at Tiger Town Clemson up 20 targets Randolph safe to say its senior night but he is shuffling doesnt care its sophomore knife I mean hes five or five from the floor and Anka said hes doing everything else hes rebounding hes taking charges hes moving the ball and get himself some quality PT tonight hes playing well first point for Ben Middlebrooks sophomore from Fort Lauderdale has only played 10 or more minutes twice in the last 10 games for Brownells team again theres been this math in terms of playing time with Hemingway coming back and yeah Applause Middlebrook so has kept the edge and gotten a fresh haircut Applause 22point lead for Clemson heres Van Allen Lubin Clemson has always been tough defensively and On Cue I jinxed him they didnt switch out and form back Ryan made him play with the pullup jump shot Irish leader was six here in this first half Music and turned over by Clemson Carmody throws it down the

many ways because hes doing everything hes blocking shots hes rebounding and Music encouraging signed for the Tigers Galloway almost had that one stripped by good one ends up being Clemsons fifth turnover not her name only turned it over twice in the first half we know the names they dont turn it off they got too many ball handles so theyll find your weakest Defender to initiate their offense

and driving out of the corner Hammond Marcus Hammonds got six he was three times the all M AAC pick with Niagara who played for Greg paulus the former Duke guard he had 85 career starts for the purple

wheelhouse oh I love shooting yes its been noted I love shooting here is Ryan Music Applause away for Goodwin six to shoot theres Marcus Hammond and boy hustle play gets him a second chance Ryan will try and help and does he is heating up from behind the line hes done a great job of scoring inside the paint now he knocks down his second three there yep hes got 16 the lead 20 again and theyre in their 23 Zone there which is dangerous against Clemson because they got so many shooters on the floor they even have Hemingway and hes started the Year were shooting 50 from behind the line himself heres Hunter tend to shoot for the pulloff for his game Randolph May I mean you were as good a pullup jumper as I know hes hes in the zone right hes just watching him play hes moving at his own place then Allen Lubin inside he becomes the fourth tiger in double figure tonight Lubin by the way thats his first basket hes been double figures four times in the last seven you saw him get 198 last week in Winston I did he has been outstanding in the last few games here for Notre Dame its just this game and now theyre behind and they want to play smaller shot back by Hunter the ball got kicked oh and a nice pass shuffling reaches over the top and sets it down with two hands who said he wasnt athletic going on top to finish that one Ryan on the drive hit the side of the glass he gonna run it down

Zona who played just six ball games against the ACC a year ago he has had limited minutes and just credit to him to coming out and staying aggressive being ready to play shuffling skip for Hemingway standing three he is doing it all himself and is making plays with the ball in his hand and without last Touch by the Irish Applause so Cormac Ryan will hit one for Notre Dame and shes playing a horse I mean Ryan comes back knocks one down and did that move by shuffling just prohop through with the reverse layup if hes playing this well anything close to this he makes Clemson a difficult team to beat because hes the one guy that teams would just dare scoring right now sophomore doesnt care if his senior night hes hes having himself a game foreign heres Tyson Hemingway after a triple might be failing it Godfrey Tyson from the tiger paw and PJ the rebound couldnt score against lachesky Godfrey ripped it away and we got a hell ball called by Michael Palau itll gutter Notre Dame Brownell doesnt like it wherever down thinks Godfrey got grabbed on the arm there he doesnt care if theyre up 24 he wants more Applause almost eight minutes gone second half tigers have been in control from the start tonight Music theres Zona and boy matsona is a catchandshoot guy hes got seven its always dangerous winning games like that because you got a guy that hadnt played much and Applause scores when you look at the coastline report manzonas got a career high by the way Music 22point game under 12 to go Applause works Ben Allen Lubin on the hard drive and Hall and Tyson had to decide which one was going to get credit been out of Luminaire was looking to take photo ball inside the Zona who had the Mitch Match but Clemson did a really good job getting in front forced to freshman to try to make a play Music heres Dylan Hunter trying to find a gap 10 to shoot RJ Godfrey all the way through and it rattled out for Applause a really patient move there by Godfrey didnt get it to go down but great job just creating an angle using the remnants protection and going up just couldnt knock it down yep mismatch for lashesky Tyson tried to help and were going to whistle in the foul thatll take us to a timeout 22point lead for the Tigers at home tonight Music it up after Wednesday night the linebacker Lounge for Mike Bray huh it was it looks like hes recovered everythings all good back here tonight I I cannot tell you how much were gonna miss him in the ACC oh absolutely I mean its the relationship he has with geisley would do our job and just people in general just over its been a real treat yeah hes just a great guy theres Les schewski easiest bucket of the night for Notre Dame off a slip screen on the inbounds I mean we went to Russian to see what he does next yeah yeah 29 years as a head coach of course 24 at Notre Dame boy theres plenty of speculation about a guy who said he might just want to take a year off shuffling the rebound of a home miss Clemson trying to reset heres Hunter a little pullup jumper I think got deflected and zone of the rebound great job there about Cormac Ryan who is a really good Defender got through the stream all to the shot by Hunter there Zona and Wiggins going to be called for the foul against luccheski itll be first on the 610 freshman heres another look at the uh inbounds race slip there miscommunication now Clemson defense and I think lashewski gets to slip and dunk Works will put it in play its a 20point Clemson lead with 10 to go Applause Music inside spinning from lacheski and a foul will be called on shefflin itll be his second its the fifth on the tigers partisans not happy thats where liszewski puts it just a tough matchup in the tough cover it gets you guys outside he faces you he loves to drive left spin back to that right hand shuffling got a little body on him that time and so heres Nate at the line a couple of shots one of four at the line two of fives he knocks that down dont forget the ACC Wrestling Championships from NC State on Sunday coverage of the final start at seven Eastern Sean Kenny and Rock Harrison I want to tell you now this league is good at that hosting the event this league is good at a lot of things like basketball as well contrary to popular belief uh contrary to popular belief right yeah I mean ridiculous narrative about the ACC I think were seeing that with an amazing day of basketball today yeah chaplain trying to get at the hall theres a lob and overshot PJ and Clemson turns it over well Virginia winner Georgia Tech by the way wins for the fifth time in the last six games Miles Kelly got 21 in a road win for passengers team at Boston College Virginia Tech a commanding performance Syracuse got 27 and 20 today from Jesse Edwards Randolph 27 points 20 rebounds yeah thats a dominating performance against my Geeks but so many teams are beginning to play well and I dont know if any team in this league right now is playing better than Duke by the way Miami and Pitt have played twice this year total difference in the score is three points a twopoint game today and Coral Gables after a onepoint game earlier this year at Pittsburgh heres Hall rolling on Zona up strong and one for BJ PJ Hall got it there again took his man inside just to create an angle he wants to get back over that left shoulder so he takes your middle spins back Baseline gets the angle Applause Music Val on Sono will be his first lacheskys out Van Allen Lubin checks in Goodwin returns Matt zonas out PJ Hall goes to the line looking for his ninth point of the game yeah hes looking to be the fifth tiger to get the double figures tonight hes also now I think four away from a thousand in his career Music pretty sure theyll leave him in and try to get that you think I would imagine that might be on the list Music tigers are trying to secure a double bond for Greensburg a win tonight would make them the 3C given all the activity today theres a rebound Hall Off to the Races hes got Tyson across for Galloways three ball nope rebound for Hammond Notre Dame trying to flip the floor Maybe Hammond back for works Music Lubin trying to help Trey wurtz Applause back to Lubin slapped off the wall by Hall fourth block of the night for PJ Hall he plays incredibly hard I mean he leaves it all out on the floor and even when its not his night offensively he continues to compete on a defensive end cross pass for Galloway back for Hunter and the rebound for Goodwin with 810 to play Music Works skip out good one of three nope and a battle inside Hunter comes away with a deflection coach burnells telling these guys slow down I think with the Freshman lube and garden I think theyre going to try to get PJ Hall a touch in the post here Music hes flashing their cards tonight arent they Music down low heres Paul then Allen Lubin commits the foul for PJ Hall tonights put quite a dossier together Randolph points rebounds rejections Music Network on a Saturday night were at Clemson okay lets play the little blind resume game with Clemson here right yes you see the net you see their conference records and you see their quad one wins okay now one of these records is Clemson and
