is a good one Morehead without Jerome Morton whos ill tonight we thought he might be in the starting lineup but uh uh not doing its going to be a good game though Larry because this Morehead team theyve got some experience with a bunch of guys the nine newcomers six of those guys have played at least one year have at least one year of experience at four a fouryear College they do and its a good test for the University of r that play two exhibition games but not to the caliber of the level the talent physicality of which more brings theight to itll be a good test for these guys out here today possession here the guard they get miles he turns around its going to be off at James Scott so it will be more head possession just a over 3 seconds left on the shot clock here for the Eagles see what they do here in the inbounds to Brazil fired back over and Hadley with I dont I think he got a piece of it but he just got enough of a of a hand up there that had really kind of altered the shot by bford it did was a great contest and bford is going to be the one hes going to be hunting shots anytime he gets the ball hes going to be a threat to try to put the ball in the basket James Scott a d to start the season for Louisville wow thats a way to start something couldnt ask for a better start couldnt ask for a better start Scott with the slam the assist to Chucky hurn ball short there and a shot from White guards bring it down the floor get it inside Scott goes up and hes going to go to the free throw line great backs here by Terence Edwards going upstairs James Scott for the jam and that is a way to start things off now Scott will go to the line as the cards going into Scott in the first two possessions you really want to get him going because you know hes going to be battle tested today Morhead wants to play through Deontay miles so you want to make sure James is really engaged make sure hes boxing out rebounding so you get to him early get him some easy baskets and get him going for the rest of the game Scott just 44 from the free throw line last year at Charleston as a freshman he misses both of those the cards with a 20 lead here early on Edwards on Clay trayor on white he bodies him up gets some help from Hadley Hadley with the steel but goes back to Morehead and thats going to be a turnover and possession to Louisville and the Louisville bench is into it and the crowd getting into it early on got a great crowd here um Kadir giv up great size down low but battled Javon helped him out able to get his hands in there get the deflection create a turnover Hadley back to hurn he burs going to go over to the right side of the floor here and look and he had Scot there for a second I thought they were going to do it again Edwards the three it goes down in Terrence Edwards he hit six of them in the first exhibition and three of them were from R spot right over there is one thing you know about tan Edwards he can put the ball in the basket he can heat up quickly off to a great start knocking down that first shot of the game five nothing movable with the lead theres a long shot there Steven clay 34 from three last year at Illinois Chicago He drains one Hadley Edwards in the corner Edwards misses that one tayori with the rebound hes looking for for him and Edwards gets it back a spin in the paint the trii goes up he loses it and Morehead comes away with it Brazil the 511 point guard from UC USC Applause Upstate Morehead looking to get it to Miles the big sevenfooter with the hook thats off the Martin and and Larry thats a great job by James Scott right there without foul it was holding his position contesting the shot as he was going up adleys adleys going to get fouled looking at Terence Edwards three up three down getting going early stepen clay God that can score at three different levels turning the answer card struggle from the free throw line in the second exhibition game and Larry the the thing I think I get out of both those exhibitions for Louisville Young Harris 106 to 59 and then spaling 99 to 54 the competition level is is is marketly better tonight first of all but it was just so weird how Louisville did two totally opposite different things there as had he makes the second one it was it was almost like in the second game they were overcompensating for nothing not shooting the three for shooting so many threes in the first game so I think coming out today you want to find that fair balance of taking what the defense gives you whether it be the three or whether it be the drive but you just want to keep them guessing and keep them off balance Scot on Miles again he cuts tries to cut up the Baseline miles this will dish to brur shot clock under five long three prior with the rebound so clay misses that when prior comes away with it and the cards are on the Run Chucky hurn prior from the top of the key he moves big old step there from K prior Scott keeps it alive puts it back in James Scott with four early on the put back L doing a great job of attacking the glass that was something that coach Kelsey made an emphasis of after his two exhibition games he didnt like how these guys rebounded against inferior teams and so doing a great job off to a great start doing J rebound ke with some good defense there heord gets a hand on him theyre going to call the foul on the drive the Cardinals with a 93 lead how about starting it off with a note James Scott hes got four back after this Music posession a proud little tradition since 1969 shop for your new or at the auto grou because HFF definitely has what time is it ladies and gentlemen its time for some free teach Music Music Music 1 2 all Music right welcome back to the KFC Young Center jio here Pat Kel his first game you see he started out as an assistant High School coach went to Wake Forest with skip prer with with with Coach crer left and went to Xavier with Chris ma then left became the head coach Charleston and now CL oy hes the Louisville head coach and theyre off to a good start here when he got hired back in April this is what people were anticipating and this is what people were wanting to see when he came in and took this job people wanted to see excitement and hes just hes delivered on that just just f by the way was on KAS prior Kenny White Jr with the first free throw white an interesting one a senior from Madisonville Kentucky he has spent time at Tennessee Tech Murray State UT Martin and now Morhead so hes getting a good feel for a lot of the uh OBC hes taking full advantage of the portter Corin Johnson right to the basket disch to Waterman this is that one trayor active on the board but that ball was out of balance as he touched it but its a good sign one thing that we saw last in the last exhibition game kadirs tror his energy level was a little bit below what he normally expected you see him today hes super active keeping the ball alive on the offensive glass so thats a good sign for the Lille Cardinals white with it on the move with Trey or steal there by Corin Johnson hes going to go in for the slam Goran Johnson gets his first two of the season I have a feeling were going to see more than two from him yeah talk about a guy that can fill up the stat sheet quickly scoring corn is what they call him 20 points in the last exhibition they gets to Spalding eight points and seven assists in the first one move down the lane there blocked by Waterman that was bro bford blocked by Waterman Johnsons got Applause it Hardman almost stepped out of bounds prior looking for Applause someone PR going right to the basket he is fouled hes going to get two free throws Morhead state in his first season as the head coach Jonathan Maddox he was a Murray State head coach the assistant coach the last couple of years with Steve prom he was on the Morehead St State staff from 2013 to 2022 started as a grad manager was an assistant coach worked his way to be the associate head coach now he is the head coach hes come uh the full circle as you would say man hes paid his dues and rightfully so earned his position to be the head coach of Morhead State Bright Young coach he is going to do a really good job there at Morehead State following up what Preston Spradlin has done and uh I mean you dont have to follow anything up theyve got 90 victories in the last four years Larry I mean thats thats a hard thing to to follow up or 94 victories Im sorry and by the way thats the most of any team in the state of Kentucky its pretty Applause Music Applause Music wild G with the two free throws 13 to five L with lead looking to go back door on R Smith and that Balls deflected Smith comes up with it Waterman to the bucket prer the reverse oh he stepped out of bounds so Louisville looking to attack Larry kind of like what we saw with SP the Spalding game is almost exactly what weve seen so far in the first five and a halfes they are they are putting a lot of pressure on Morhead getting to that paint getting to the rim doing a great job of getting into their secondary breaking if they dont have it setting up and executing sets or state has turned it over two the last three possessions well see what Cardinals can do here K rer is a big time shooter from basket just muscles that one Applause in dont give rain Smith much space and boy he missed all of that one prior there for the rebound but you dont see R Smith miss one like that that that a far off no not too often not too often Ill tell you what J L was doing a great job of controlling the Music rebounder na in the Freshman he missed the second exhibition with the concussion that foul by the way on uh root Seeker you said he is thats a three from the corner R Smith you think that first shot bothered him I think he got upset by that first shot he wanted to get it out of his memory real fast two Shooters on each other out here white looking to drive ball tipped and Bruce comes away with it the Freshman the only freshman on the Cardinal roster laen Johnson James Scott Scott Johnson for the three misses but Scott there for the rebound The Freshman Rose misses and Waterman there for the rebound the Cardinals doing a number on Morhead on the boards right now five offensive rebounds and Smith misses so the carts cant score but theyre doing a number on the on the boards right now 112 on the on the back cour doing a great job getting second chance Music opportunities that missed everything there from Scott and Scott came away with the rebound Johnson with Music it Waterman misses so the cards struggling right now from three you know as soon as we said something about attack the P they started shooting they heard us theyre like hey we dont want those go Louisville for their last four two of nine from three now that foul was on Scott its his first team second but as you know these guys can heat up though you know they shoot they shoot with confidence they shoot open thre so its all the numbers game the numbers usually always average Applause out back door there to Miles a little bit B Miles misses the shot but he was fouled by Scott thats the second on Scott Deontay miles Five Points five rebounds and 36 total block shots last year he started 30 of the 32 games he had previously played a year at Xavier I think whats interesting when you look at moead and all the newcomers and the guys that they had returning the guys that they had returning all combined to average less than 15 points a game so you didnt really know who was going to step up and sort of be their leading score their goto guy so I guess theyre still kind of figuring it out as well miles but you definitely have to start with the big guy inside yeah you definitely do by the way hes from Walton Kentucky up in Northern Kentucky prior misses that one the Cs oh for the last five and from threepoint Music range mov 16 Applause to8 a travel there and its a turnover and well go to the break here cards lead 16 to8 how about Cory Johnson coming at you on opening night Music the college basketball season and the Lal gal with a 16 to8 lead early on here over Morehead State as you see Morehead State Kenny White Jr four points and a rebound the cards five of n early on since then they struggled a bit well see what uh the Cardinals have struggled a bit in the last couple minutes hitting just one of their last seven Larry they have theyve kind of started shooting some threes and theyve gone one for eight in their last eight attempts at the threepoint line so I look for them to kind of get into the paint try to get to the CR line and get some pun his terance Edwards turns the ball over just a second turnover of third turnover of the evening for the cards Scott sophomore from Tampa takes it to the basket he misses and prior with the rebound he is fouled by Scott Scot Trent Scotts first foul the fifth team foul Jason Pryor with five rebounds already PRI and Scott James Scott together Larry nine of Louisvilles 14 rebounds doing a great job of hitting the class Edwards takes it deep and prior F the corner the three for K prior so hey if youre active on one end you get rewarded on the other you do you do find the ball and the ball to find its way in the net guards with some full court pressure Chuck heurn all over Trent Scott Marshall to Miles ep the defensive stalard on this team for Louisville prior comes away with it he steals it down the floor hes going to take it nope hes going to Dish it the Hadley and Javon Hadley with the bucket the Cs on a quick spurt here in both baskets they B get the ball in the paint and they finish Pon doing a great job starting on the defensive end getting the steal finding Javon for the lamb really starting to make his imprint on the game blis on an 81 run Marshall from Deep misses that one miles the big fella gets the rebound back out to Scott R Seager sitting up in the corner theyre trying to trying to get it back over to him blocked by trayor Miles blocked by Hadley the cards with two block shots on the same possession prior to hurn Chucky from the right wing for three cars turning it up on defense an 11 to one run here and they push it out to 248 and the KFC Yum Center has come alive crowds happy with that energy and with that performance the cards on an 111 run Applause out of the timeout were back here the KFC Young cator the Louisville Cardinals on a run Larry oon it was a timeout and then they came out and went on a nice little surge 70 run it all started on defense started with case prior getting a block leading a break hitting Javon for a layup getting another steal just leading the charge getting energy going on the defensive end Morehead in that surge 0 for three a turnover in Louisville with two block shots so defense got it going Brazil with the long three he misses miles there for the rebound and prior B out of off of Applause Miles see on the replay here Jon squaring up knocking down the from the corner great pass here get still leave break give Jabar the layup ja just getting it done on both ends L with it 24 to8 an extended 11 to one run Morehead without a field goal almost 5 minutes Hadley from the corner that one comes up short white comes down with it coach mad getting three new guys in ball tapped Away by white boy Kenny White Jr when he gets that ball hes going one place and thats to the rack and with his left hand hes going to find a way to start right but hes going to come back to that left so Morehead still on that scoring drought 1354 their last field Applause Music goal Chucky heurn no shot but the foul on Brazil thats his second weve got cor Johnson and Chucky heer on the floor together I love this combination with those two guys out there there it is its kind of a ying and yang and corins more offensive minded guy Chuck is more of a defensive minded guy so they kind of balance each other out when theyre on the court so PRI misses it but Terrence Edwards crashing the boards Im not calling them Im not calling him a PT receiver and a Russ Smith but they kind of kind of give you that that flavor a little bit you said ying and yang give you that flavor a little bit bit I wont say who the ying and the Yang is but now Russ never seen a shot he didnt like I think corn can be that way too a little bit yeah especially if he gets going if he get going Terence Edwards misses the free throw CS four for seven from the Applause line good defense again from Applause prior hustle it was heer and Johnson first and then prior with the hustle and Lis will get it the cards lead 24 to8 here on he your first Music Music Music some SC got it e he would not like it so guards with the the ball and the lead R Smith that ball in and out Hadley flying in for the rebound but miles comes away with it Morehead without a field go for the last 6 minutes of like about 30 seconds now well Applause through and its just tenacious defense from the guards L doing a great job of oneonone defense containing the ball and when you contain the ball you dont have to H off as much controlling the glass able to get into your fast break Hadley with the three thats a three ball for Hadley and Javon Hadley with seven so far for the cards he leads the scoring its a balanced attack for Louisville seven assist on nine made field goals and balance scoring with tenacious defense you got to love it it is thats what you love about this group just on a given night anybody can go off and share the ball with each other you can just tell that they enjoy playing with each other white ends that 110 run for Music Louisville 27 to 10 Applause white has six of the 10 points for the Applause Music Eagles f misses that one prior his seventh rebound of the first half and KAS said yeah Im just going to stop here and shoot he misses it Applause we will now five of 17 from three oh quiet came down a little awkwardly there but uh boy he spiked that one into the front row but it just shows you so many things that he could Applause do watch this K prior he goes out that a little bit hes went into the tunnel with the trainer its going to get that ankle looked at prior in his 10 minutes on the floor Five Points seven rebounds two assists a steal and a block shot thats what you call stuff in the stat Sho it is and I mean its just a live body getting it done deflections rebounds pushing the break creating for others you name it hes doing it out here in the game today so that was James Scott that is his third foul I think theyre looking for a contact I dont see it Larry do you I cant see anything Jody that ball that thing could go anywhere well now he got all kind of sweat on the floor when he down looking for Applause it all right so white head to the Applause line Scotts going to come out with those three fouls prior back in the tunnel still good as his ankle looked at so tayori comes in for Applause Music Scott and White makes it 2711 white with seven of the 11 for Morehead as they a little pressure on Louisville here Johnson takes it right to the basket has it Music blocked and then fouls coming down the floor think more here had exact got exactly what they wanted they just want to create a fast shot and try to I think theyre more so trying to find a rhythm for themselves try to maybe speed up the Pace a little bit faster than what they normally have to try to get some offensive rhythm going thats probably not the pace the shot that Louisville wants Johnson Windam misses it tayori flies in for the Applause rebound Johnson into the corner Waterman misses and trayor had it Edwards had it they knocked it out of each others hand but you got to like the going after it you do you do you like the aggressiveness you clap it you know you just wish you could have got it but you know you applaud the effort hord back Music in first time weve seen Cory car Jun Wilson North Carolina for Morhead State 69 250 rain Smith comes away with it hes got trayor with him and its a slam for abubacar trayor his first bucket of the Season r with a great job grabbing the steel throwing it up for a little Showtime eight Cardinals have scored clay with the long three he misses it oh heper had it and got it taken away by Scott awkward shot ball bouncing everywhere its going to be Lal possession Jo Ill be interested to see how many the deflections Chucky hebburn has because while he might not fill up the offensive stat sheet man he just constantly getting his hands on the ball just creating havoc and being a menace for the other teams guards talk about a guy you dont want to bring the ball up the cig against Chuck head going for a walk so thatll be a turnover for the cards the fourth turnover R Smith with the deal how about the love to tayori were Music Applause Music done ladies gentl for our winners tonight are in 114 each of our winers Music I Applause Applause Applause Music Applause are Estate Services its truly the best you can for William Applause Music back here at the KFC y center in Louisville Kentucky Louisville 29 forhead State 11 the first game of the Pat Kelsey era here at the KFC Yum Center Jody ding Larry oit setting Courtside bringing it to you and Larry you know this is the first of the season for the Louisville Cardinals the first game for Pat Kel you see they taking a look at some video there on the sidelines its amazing what you can do nowadays but look at this nonconference games coming up in that big one Saturday number 12 Tennessee here at the Yum Center it gets more and more difficult each game you want to talk about getting right to it Jodie game two you got a top 15 opponent coming into the Young Center I know the fans are excited theyre looking forward to it and if they give great effort like this today it should be a great game Boren Johnson with the steel and the reverse layup and then there you go your Menace Chucky heurn creating a turnover lets watch this one though the steel Waterman gets a deflection and Corin coming right at you knows what to do in open court get downhill and get to the basket so heurn creates the turnover that is turnover number 10 for Morehead State theyre one for their last 16 from the field trayor Smith in the corner another airball for r Smith thats two of them I said you dont see it very often now is he going to come back like he did last time and make a three here real quick I think George Marshall made him get that shot off a little quicker than he was comfortable with yeah the bench the Morhead State bench over there uh applauding What marshall was doing defensively there and thats the difference right between when you play exhibition games and then you start to play against some better athletes that closeout speed is a little bit faster and you have to get that shot off a little bit CL Qui missed there in close R Seager and misses that shot one for their last 17 now trayor right to the basket he misses good defense in the last couple possessions then misses gets his own rebound and its fouled by Applause tror so lets look at this a little bit uh 10 turnovers for Morehead State the cards 22 to 21 now on the boards and Morehead 226 246 without a bucket without any points at all and one for their last 18 Larry yeah well they at the foul line now jayen Windam is going to the line as he knocked his person one down hoping to close out the half with some good momentum and getting things going hopefully for a better second half three for 25 in the first half case Pryor back in there he got his ankle looked at came down a little awkwardly on the uh couple minutes ago but hes back out there Windam makes the two free throws his first two points and its 3113 Applause Smith and hurn prior HB burs going to pull from the top the key and hes going to get fouled he did that once in both of the two exhibition games he continues to draw that foul and hes one of your better de free thr Shooters so what happens in that situation jod is Chucky is using the pick and roll and the defender cannot go under and so the defender has to fight over the screen and when Chucky knows that the defender is fighting over coming behind him he stops on the dime and when he stops on the dime the defender still going trying to get over the screen so he makes contact with Chucky as hes shooting see it a lot in NBA game nowadays Jaylen Brazil that is his third foul of the game from Morehead Terrence Edwards coming in for Johnson he made makes all three of them seven of 10 from the free throw line 21point lead miles just taken away by prior and miles is going to get called for the foul will go to the line being active defensively Applause K Pryor can be died in and locked in on the defensive end as he shown tonight Lou was going to be a hard team to beat so long so athletic got the physicality too that it takes to get that get in there and kind of mix it up defensively he does block shots steals he can guard inside he can guard outside just goes to show how wide his toolbox is when hes out here on the basketball court 26 points and seven rebounds against Spalding seven points and eight rebounds in the first exhibition transfer from USF PR with six points and seven rebounds tonight make it seven and seven for K prior cars doing a much better job job at the foul line today wellsford gets it across the timeline the second four plus minute drought without a field goal for Morehead here in the half white that ones not even close and Edwards collects it and brings it down Hadley in the corner prior Edwards makes the Music move purn to Hadley Hadley against the big guy tries to crafty doesnt get it but gets his own rebound and the cards set it up again R dominating on the offensive glass PR Applause Hatley Edwards beats the shot fly Lo show great patience there not wanting to force the issue wanting to take their time and find a great shot and two points crowd in the KFC Yum Center has come alive again they like what they see in this opening game prer gets his hand on it rsford no Brazil miles up there for it oh and Hadley tries to block it the foul on Hadley will be his first Miles trying to get his team going with the Monster Jam there oh for their last nine and one for 20 to end the half right now for Morehead State Bs defense is just Applause suffocated miles now two for three Chucky he bur steps out and it starts with him he disrupts the point guard everybody else feeds and thrives off the energy that he brings they get in the passing Lanes you get deflexion you get steals next thing you know you get easy opportunities on The Fast Break prior with the eighth rebound of the half and lilles going to call timeout prior gets it right past half court calls timeout we got 35 seconds left after this Music all right back here 35 seconds left Jody dumbing Larry oand and Larry coach Kelce calls the timeout its the first game of the year you work on so many things and I would imagine here they try to set up someone to get a three I would agree with you Jody just a great opportunity for Coach Kelsey to use an ingame practice situation working on situations with his guys that 35 seconds executing what they want to do coming out of a timeout possibly a great two for one situation here if you can get a good shot early on in the play pry will take it out hes got Edwards Waterman Johnson and Hadley Johnson with it looks like theyre going to look the clock and wind it down and take a good shot right at 20 seconds under 10 on the shot clock KAS Edwards he got it the cards draw something up and they get a three to end the half here now theyll try to get one more stop and a miss shot forehead State one for their last 21 in the first half and Louisville with a 414 lead at the break J PRI Applause hurn and theyll start it off the same way in the second half a James Scott slam Scott has six great execution coming out of the pick and roll there Chucky with his head up out of the pick and roll placing the lot perfect for James Scott to throw it down inside spin move there from miles so Miles about the only one that can score for that Larry it a good move from the big fella I was expecting to see that a little bit more early on in the game so its probably something that was talking about at the half to really get itself going toward the basket in his post moves ball tipped deflected and a timeout from Morehead heurn with another deflection 4316 well take a break back to the young center after this Music 3 Applause conratulations Music SE Music Music Music all right back here at the KFC y center our new segment L with Larry and theyre doing it a lot they are as you see Terence Edward C back for James Scott on his first play second he slips necessarily set the screen his man in no mans land Jam Scot open for another Jam James Scott with six Music points Cardinals with a 4316 lead here H Scotts going to pick up his fourth foul there Larry thats a cheap foul thats a foul that you dont want to get that far away from the basket you see K ready to check in for but even though hes a sophomore hes still young hes still learning thats a foul that you want to save him you want to use with a purpose miles with the move on prior and tayori with the big Applause rebound buron Applause Hadley that burn over to Prior misses that one gets his own rebound right back up and he is fouled hell go to the two to the free throw line for two third its miless thirdd foul andine for the seven PR he shoot two PRI four for four from the line in the first half seven points 10 rebounds bounds K doing a great job of just kind of getting things in the natural flow of the game hes not really pressing offensively hes causing Havoc defensively just having an allaround outstanding game hes not shooting it well one of six but hes doing so many other things you dont even really notice that but to your point with that Jody you know thats the sign of a mature player a guy thats an upper classman is he doesnt let his offense dictate his defense his defense is going to be stable he comes up with another steal here PR right to the basket and he is going to get fouled and go back to the free throw line be the first foul on white second so many other ways to affect the game and affect your team without scoring the basketball L second steel but how many deflections between he and Chucky heurn tonight I would count at least 10 10 to 12 each minimum minimum so he makes that one six of seven from the Music line make it seven of eight making free throws is going to be really important for the cards as they have some big games upcoming on their schedule going to be in some close ball games going to have to be able to knock him down theres a slam by gford went right at prior with him on his hip PR doesnt get the dunk but he gets the here you go Larry a couple dunks hit the trampoline throw it down and then the look were not going to talk about what he what he mumbled there PRI right back Ching it off roll on there the foul was on Miles thats his fourth Music foul thats going to be a foul on Hatley prior misses that 12 points and 10 rebounds now for K prior Larry we everybody we all go back and we all go back and forth about as we see priors numbers there 12 points we go back and forth on uh this team who is the best player on this team or maybe the most important player on this team and I think that I think case prior is going to be the biggest key to this team cuz as he goes they youre probably going to go I would agree and you know this was a question that I asked Payton CA one day at practice I said whos whos the key guy for the team whos whos going to emerge as your player and case Pryor was the name that he mentioned he said man hes just a gamer he affects the game in so many ways as you see tonight just defensively offensively hes just a guy thats going to be a key to holding this thing together and determine how far the cards go with this season he a Goen calling the cards Kenny white Morhead already with three field goals in this half its the same amount they had in the entire first half fire easy bucket there Cars come out and run the same play that they ran to start the half score another two points Play Misses Hadley there Edwards Waterman not many guys could make that catch but he could Waterman to the basket no Waterman his first bucket of the season a transfer from BYU puts the cards up 52 20 and Jonathan madx has seen enough he needs another timeout as the Cardinals opening this one up with an 11 to6 run to start the second half and Bon I think this crowd likes what they see they appreciate the energy and effort that these guys are playing with this is what they signed up for whats Waterman Waterman going Baseline with the Up and Under nice English two points Crow and night a good one this Music evening ACC preseason poll rille picks ninth right there and well weve talked before do Carolina Wake Forest Clemson I think after that four you mix those next five even six seven teams in you throw them in a hat and really youre not sure how theyre going to come out and they can come out totally different I think theyre all about the same you do I mean especially with you know the portal being in the college game today so much parody these are preseason polls um the good thing about is that nobody really has expectations for little when you pick somebody to finish n so going into each and every game I think Lou is going to surprise a lot of people in this ACC Morehead with 12 turnovers rille 152 in points off turnovers bellford looking for somebody to help white driving on Waterman hes fouled by Noah Waterman Applause its the first foul on Waterman Waterman said I was standing straight up think he got him a little with the body yeah coach mads doing a great job of putting Kenny White Jr on that left elbow letting him play ISO getting to that left hand drawing a Applause foul if you know a waterman you got to know you know he wants to get back to that left hand at some point even if he starts right he wants to spin back and come to that left hand you got to keep him on his right Applause hand missed the second one Edwards comes away with it a couple cards tip it around Edwards to Hadley in the corner Waterman hes called for a foul there its his second Music number 93 the official was like 93 how do I do that lets see what do I do I got to use two hands got his fingers crossed there new age of college basketball Brazil back in with his three fouls Applause gets it thewi that left elbow again and Waterman called for his third foul in the last Applause minute Waterman really kind of strugging keeping Kenny white off that left hand its a matchup that Morehead likes and they continue to go back to it Kenny white going to the line for two pre throws white the senior for Madisonville 6 and a half points a game last year at UT Martin has spent time at Tennessee Tech and Murray State fin is for Mr basketball when he was at Madisonville his senior year great High School career and you see his college career well traveled very rare that you see somebody to tr transfers within the conference let alone poor Music THS PR over to Johnson try Hadley squares up and he hits it Javon Hadley with his second three ball of the night hes in double figures with 10 showing great patience there Louisville and offense coren Johnson with the back tip almost gets it and theyre going to call the foul on Johnson there a lot of pushing and shoving going on over there were going to take a break Louisville up 5523 Applause Music Music two B Applause Music Applause go e e e all right were back here to Young to case prior lar and hes doing a pretty good job tonight for the Gard he is K PR just putting his fingerprints all over the game you see here defensively creating a steal pushing the break finding Javon for the layup here getting it done blocking shots mixing it up inside doing a great job 14 points 10 rebounds first double double of the season to open up the P Cera Buble with

taks it himself six of their last seven a 70 Run in less than one minute all created by defense all created by defense ORD from the corner ball slapped up off the backboard tayori comes away with it he misses the shot but the foul on white case prior sh time on the break with the just to clean this up that on the miles thing they during the break we were wondering what they were doing over the monitor they took a foul away from Deontay miles and gave it to Steven clay it was on that drive from prior about 3 or 4 minutes ago but theres so much action that happened in between then took him a while to get over to the monitor of the break but miles with just three fouls instead of four one of the one of the keys for tonight jod is Lille just doing a great job of rebounding when you play excellent defense in negates it if you dont rebound the ball but you play great defense you rebound the ball it just puts you in a natural fast break and L was just able to get out and get so many easy transitions I put pressure on the defense to create fouls JY makes one of two 60 23 now for the Applause cards and a foul on Johnson a foul number three Johnson thats his third 17 Johnsons third already seven team fouls on Louisville so this ones going to take a while were going to be at the free throw line for a while Im good Frank Anam Music Applause eBay his first appearance 61 220 a fifth year transfer from Georgia Applause Music tayori with the rebound Scott misses the free throw coren Johnson misses it gets his own rebound right back bounce to trayor he misses it so a couple of a wide open three and an easy shot at the bucket at right at The Rim L will misses yeah cadir wishes he could have that one Applause back e guarding miles help from Applause trayor and hes going to get called for the foul his second Applause foul lots of whistles here in the first uh few minutes of the second half it has been it has been its kind of chopped the game up a little bit kind of taken the Rhythm out of any kind of flow that these two teams are trying to develop 12 fouls in the first part of this half two teams combine lots of free throws and Deontay miles is back at the free throw Applause line and the big fella misses that one and SL to eBay rain Smith I think he thought he was going to lob it and he got caught in between didnt he yeah I thought it was going to be a l too it looked like it the way was going Applause up trayor with the Applause rebound and the foul things are getting a little chippy with Tren Scotties chiring going on with Corin Johnson and now Char Larry when you see theres a they hold a sign up behind the uh behind the uh bench about the kills and the stops on defense theyre at six kills tonight and when you get to that point you know you got a pretty good night on defense it is it is well you can get three stops in a row you can get three stops in a row and just give yourself opportunity to get out in transition because thats the key to any pack Kelsey team you have to get out and transition get those open threes and try to get on the fast break and get some layups and Applause dunks green Smith Music misses 80 run here for Louisville Applause overhead has not scored in little over three minutes theres a threepointer sag from the uh the nii School Mount Vernon Nazarene 2133 career threepointers put back in and slam by Anam eBay thats the way you get an offensive board prank cleaning it up off the glass Music Music Applause foul and H bur thatll be his first thatll be two shots for Marshall Morehead just three for seven from the line in this Applause half L just done a great job of taking more more head out of everything that they wanted to do Music Applause ony Edwards come back in more had a little bit of success trying to go to Kenny White Jr and Deontay miles on the post but not much on today speaking of success you saw that with 90 wins and two OBC conference Champion tournament championships and two OBC regular season championships in the last two years his team picked fifth this year Chucky looking keeping the dribble alive Applause Aly to Music rain Edwards Applause Music misses H some prior getting it done on all accounts Corner three rolling B cards up 6227 Music was its our atex road Serv 1 2 3 6 KFC Yum Center here at the Louisville Cardinals up 6227 you see the 100 point Club entering the season not at Louis James Madison Charleston hung Beach State Wisconsin theyre all here now and you put them all together and uh this is a pretty good first uh first impression tonight of a I guess real impression Larry oon it is you know youre playing against a quality opponent at least a more quality opponent than what you played in your exhibition games even though Louisvilles doing a good job of doing some damage here tonight to Morehead but you know you talking about that that segment right there with 4000 Point scores it just kind of attributes to whats going on tonight when you have a well balanced stat sheet you got Devon with 10 Terence Edwards with 10 KAS with 16 few other guys close to double figures it just speaks to the type of team that coach Kelsey put together when he was in the Applause portal Scott with the bucket hell get the uh free throw attempt on Smith his first James Scott with four fouls coming back in six points and four rebounds in just seven minutes Lille with 13 assists on 21 made buckets and just five turnovers Applause tonight Scott misses that one and Scott got the rebound adley to the bucket turn around and misses but hes going to get a couple fre fre throws a foul on wind with big man ball there 13 of 19 from the three free throw line Larry and uh that was something I think in that second exhibition you kind of had to worry about it a little bit but uh they look better tonight it was it was I think in both even though in the first game you only shot five free throws you were two for five 40 so its definitely something that you want to improve upon like I said when you start to face better opponents and bigger teams on your schedule youre going to need every point that you can get uh to try to come away with those victories 21 of 34 in the Spalding win so Hadley knocks down both of those the cards now 15 of 21 and Javon Hadley with 12 points and thatll be another turnover and Louisville ball turnover number 15 ideally jod you like to be in around that 75 range 80 is a great night if youre shooting that as a team but ideally you want to be around that 75 to to 80 range Hadley his third triple of the night he now has 15 points for the Cardinals Applause Hadley and foul called on Hadley youll see the threepointer here from Hadley its a great catch and shoot squaring it up in a great Rhythm knocks it down at least third again javons going to be that you know I call him three and D guys but he just he just does a little bit of everything brings that toughness hes going to play hardn defense hes going to take open shots hes just going to do things in the natural floor of the game that just come to hes not going to try to go outside of his game hes just going to play hard play tough and knock down open shots Windham will try to make a second free throw the Eagles 5 for 10 in the second half in the free throw line Music eag was trying to slow Louis down here with the the three4 court press thir foul third for Scott seventh team foul so Louisville now on the bonus 24 he shoot one Chucky makes the first and he makes the second he is now five for five from the line eight points and three assists for Chucky hurn Music defensively all over Morehead State wind the ball would say was T by he bur but I dont I didnt think he got it I didnt think he might touched it either yeah I didnt think he might touched it but ball just he said went out off of Applause P move and thatll be lville possession there good good job defensively for Louis as the two guys kind of converged on ORD as he drove for the basket they do made it tough for him did a good job of contesting without fouling without fouling thats the big thing it is Johnson Scott with another dunk he said he likes to dunk everything well guess what guess what hes doing Jody I think were going to think we know whos going to win that dunk competition between TR and James Scott I think its going to be James Scott going away he he heard we like our lobs for Larry segment so hes going to give you a lot to work with as miles puts back the Applause two you shoot a pretty good percentage when you dunk everything you Applause do and another one James Scott at The Rim Applause if Im one of his the guards I know he wants to dunk everything thats what Im going for right exactly Chucky hebburn with his fourth assist of the Applause night miles possession B out off of of Johnson so Morehead possession trayor comes in Kai Ruth comes back in the Freshman played a minute in the first half the only freshman on the roster missed the last exhibition game because of a concussion hes been back for a couple days and getting a little action tonight little taste of it yeah yeah i been really impressed with Kai ruse and the the maturity that he shows D plays well beyond his years just has a kind older game to himori Misses the dunk is like what can I do I missed the layup I missed the dunk Corin Johnson his fourth foul but Jody to go back to the point of were talking about James Scott doing a rim run catching a bunch of lobs that applies so much pressure to the defense because as a defensive man in the pick and roll when youre playing at a disadvantage sometimes you can play the Flight of the ball you can play the chest pass you can play the bounce pass because it takes time for the ball to get to the big Li but when you got a guy that Rim runs you have to physically check him with your body and that makes it a lot tougher because then you cant play because the pass is going Above the Rim two free throws there they get 14 of 20 15 of 23 from the free throw line for Morehead eight of 13 this half Scott to Waterman Applause B batted Away by Miles as were going to go to break with well guess what another dunk James
