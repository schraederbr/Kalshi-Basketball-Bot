here in the ACC nem McLoud another of the newcomers from the transfer portal 74 from Florida State the tallest ever Syracuse basketball player making his debut and an easy sweep of the opening tip the season is underway happy holidays to those of you who celebrate opening day of college basketball season right into nahem on a quick turnar around high percentage you see the size Advantage right there they see it go into it dominate the paint one of the keys to Syracuse win the game today New Hampshire is a guard oriented team led by Clarence Daniels hes off the mark on his first try 66 Jackson Baker 68 theyre to us regular Daniels is a guy whos going to have to have a really good game if New Hampshire even wants to give themselves a chance to be in this game such a great penetrator Daniels an outstanding rebounder saves one for the Wildcats Ahmad Robinson in his UNH debut a little floater cant get on the board just yet orange starters guys that really can go Starling and minz might be the best backourt combo in the ACC Starling and Notre Dame transfer out of Baldwinsville just down the road gets himself to the line uh this is something that Judah and JJ should be able to really excel at getting in the paint drawing the defense and if the Finish isnt there theyll be to draw and kick and hit one of their open teammates for a per jump shot and like I said thats where those guys have to knock those down to be able to keep that spacing on the floor for those guards penetrating Starling and double figure scoring each of the two exhibition games and he profiles like Mintz in a lot of ways can get to the basket against anybody also wants to improve his shot yeah you see his body has a great body hes going to be able to take contact when he gets to the basket hes a guy whos going to really have a lot of opportunities to get to the free throw line and get points that way as well War off to a good first Applause Minute manto Man defense of course pushing Applause out youre good youre good Robinson just 510 and his pass picked off by Bell heres the Applause push and two for Bell will be keeping an eye on scoring early in the shot clocks of priority for both teams you know what Matt thats what Chris Bell has to do to be able to even get more consistent minutes yeah we know he can shoot the ball but youre 67 youre long youre wiry you can get Steals and deflections Bell gets the better of that Collision after the long rebound entangled with Clarence Daniels who gets the foul its in there for Bell right he didnt uh Express himself all the time last year on plays like this but he can mix it up be a better rebounder and playmaker hes a guy who can really shoot the ball but he needs to be able to add a little bit more on the defensive side of the ball and also rebounding hard to overthrow nahem McLoud but Justin Taylor has managed to do that and it is a turnover a minute and a half gone New Hampshire 15 and 15 a year ago coaching change with bill harryan out after an 18year run very successful head coach at a number of stops and you know what thats an interesting match up right there with mlau guard and Daniels you know Daniels is you know can take thehe out on the perimeter and work him right there but nem has to move his feet be active use his length and size Clarence Daniels First Team all America East last year figures to be prominent again this year and Chris Bell off to a hot start hes got five of the oranges on the sideline and an unforced error for UNH in front of Adrien atres bench all those other staff mates retained from coach bims tenure Jerry mcer and Allen Griffin bumped up Brendan stra is new to the program High dribble for Starling Bell the hot hand got away with it for three mlau the clean up tied up by a smaller player in Baker and a foul called on New Hampshires 68 grad student from Phoenix now Matt we know Syracuse has a side size Advantage theyre going to dominate in the paint for guys like nem McLoud going forward when you get the ball that close to the rim just go right up you dont got to dribble the ball and give it chance for the guards to come back in and slap it out go right up youre seven4 youre the biggest guy every time on the floor go up and finish it question here as to whether its a shooting foul apparently not for that reason Eric as youre saying he didnt go right back to it so the orange have a baseline out of Applause bounds Bell doesnt hesitate Robinson on the run out smallest player on the floor with a rebound for Jackson Baker Daniels turn around lays it in you can see his skill right away hes got all four for the wild cats one thing hes really good at is getting offensive rebound bounds push back we saw last year he had 34 and 14 against Boston College hes very very capable moving screen against the oranges and Justin Taylor responsible for a couple of turnovers Taylor was a bright star in the uh exhibition games 22 points total in the two Nathan Davis eightyear run at buckell before moving on to uh UNH twotime Patriot league coach of the Year very good in his first four years especially in Leon PA this is coachs first year at New Hampshire but hes hes played in plenty of these games against big competition hes there nothing new for him Daniels clearly the focal point w to foul Malik Brown just into the game for the orange strong defense there and Starling off the pullup cant connect on the spin out mince is in the way of Ahmad Robinson foul on Judah Min is his first Music played an eventful three minutes here keep an eye on Adrien arrey and hes been a head coach in other scenarios summer tours and that type of thing but this is different this is different I mean this is Syracuse basketball you know obviously from taking over for Coach beheim you know after 47 years its going to be you know obviously some ups and downs but I think like we talked about with Coach hes going to have these guys by yeah okay mince on the Breakaway and stuff and thats what hes capable of doing getting steals getting in the lane that manto man defense is going to see a lot of those deflections and a lot of Fast Break buckets Daniels will be a high usage player for un8 for good reason unable to connect from long range here last year out 40 from threepoint range foul on the entry here mod Robinson picks up his first Im Matt we talked about in that last exhibition game Judah going to the line almost 20 times going into ACC play hes probably not going to go to line 20 times but he has to be careful with the flopping yeah thatll get around work with the same officials got a couple regular ACC officials here foul Lin uper good for mint shrugging off the defender four early points for Mintz in his sophomore campaign and on the floor steals it away Starling starts the break right to the cup off the rim and Taylor rings the bell you already see the manto man pressure resoling in turnovers and easy buckets on the other end Robinson in among the trees kick out for Woodyard two strong Brown a good rebounder in his area orange looking to put the hammer down early in this game see if Justin Taylor can get it heated up I really like Taylor strong big can shoot the ball get to the rim rebound and defend as fast a start as youd want less than 5 minutes in theuse of 13 long range for Naim Miller offensive rebound Baker for a new chance this team will take a lot of Threes all of these players are perimeter capable Robinson looking for the better set turns down the ball screen and Chris Bell blocks it on the take into the Applause basket well the ORS are getting anything they want here early creating it in the transition game defense to offense and two for year two very cool of Adrien ay to let us into the locker room pregame on this historic night push the ball that message got through push the ball play defensive rebound it doesnt get is simple simpler than that those are the things that they have to do and I like what he said lets worry about us if we could buy in execute to what we need to do then we have to live with the results late shot clock Baseline out of bounds here for UNH off a block shot from Chris Bell got Christian Moore back up point guard in the game for the first time and maybe an illadvised pass going to Daniels but a little late for him to do anything with it yeah Christian Moore hes a guy whos going to come in look to score and look to make plays for his teammates but they have to get Daniels going if they want to have any type of chance to get back in this game eight nothing Run for the orange Kad Copeland in the game for the first time as a wingman on the left and mince Clos line by Moore just forces so much from the defense thats among the ways he draws so many fouls you know what he just puts so much pressure on you going downhill he hes able to be creative with his finishes his his body Maneuvers he he has such good body control at The Rim thats what makes him one of the best guards in the country Starling can handle it as well trying to get Bell going Mo the rebound lence Daniels goes to work look at copelan wall him off but Daniels equal to the task this time half dozen points for him hes the only New Hampshire player to score just under six minutes gone Copeland very impressive preseason for him and right to the rim with the left I tell you what Matt he he just looks like hes having fun every time I watch him out on this court hes just having a good time youd love to see that with players more may Rush that against Mintz Starling takes it down with the pedal down stripped and should be a shooting foul oh let Jones says lets take it underneath so non shooting foul on this case both teams figure to substitute a bunch New Hampshire will Coach Davis told us Ill have 10 guys in at the 14minute Mark not quite but not far off behind the back or not behind the back but a back door cut and Copeland has it knocked out of bounds and the way these two teams play Mad theyre getting up and down theyre playing fast theyre going to have a lot of bodies coming off the bench Starling a Creator Kyle cuff gets his first action mince on the pullup and its spit out rebound to Paul gakar interesting story well traveled from Perth Australia to the University of New Hampshire quick touch for Rex Sunderland DD POS there with the quick touch as well Italian national shot clock at seven Moore shot off by Starling nearly a turnover now it is two on one Copeland with the twoand stuck timeout taken by New Hampshires Nathan Davis leor putting the pressure on from the jump this is Syracuse basketball getting up and down Bader Copeland among those thats a Creator this time off the deflection by Mint getting out and moving and this style of play a lot of fun for these guys Copeland so skilled in a number of different ways calls his own number in this game yeah like we said hes just out there having fun hes a super talented kid hes 67 can handle the ball has great vision obviously he has to improve his consistency on his jump shot but hes a guy who can make plays like that and when were making plays like that getting up and down you see 11 fast break points Z for New Hampshire that Syracuse basketball getting out in transition getting easy buckets getting open threes if we can do that the times that were able to you know go against defense in the half quarter make it a little bit easier going forward in the game ker Copeland a year ago saw action in 20 of the 32 games averaging only about 9 minutes per when hes in there he shows the ability to stuff the stat sheet but did not really have the staying power a year ago to uh earn considerable playing time and he has seen an Avenue here to where he can really contribute hes also versatile defensively plays he guard multiple positions and you see him guarding the fourman right now well hes as tall as anybody that UNH is going to feature tonight yeah more to poser again the shot clock dwindling for Rex Sunderland gakar two on the timer poked away hes in trouble gakar misses badley you see the activity hands theyre active theyre running theyre getting out Kyle cuff off the Copeland feed another newcomer transferred from Kansas hes a Kyle Lowry looking guy nice big strong body athletic hes going to get up and play pressured man hes going to push the ball hes going to look to make plays nearly a steal mint scambled more to make him pay cant convert thing is whoever gets the rebound can start the break anybody on the FL Starling Look Away pass to Copeland and he may have stepped on the Baseline got pushed by davd poser so another New Hampshire foul on the defensive end but a fun style of play for the orangs so far Peter Cary to see his first action when we come back A Tale of Two first year coaches here different backgrounds Adrian atrey a longtime assistant to his college coach and taking over at a major program both about the same age Nathan Davis has been around the block eight years at buckell he doesnt seem too stressed out about anything thats going on here this is old hat for him just a new location yeah it it was a good meeting with him at shoot around earlier this morning he hes such a lowkey guy and he knew coming in here was going to be a challenge he knew that you know they they had the size Advantage Syracuse had the side advantage and it was going to be tough rebounding and keeping these guards in front but like you said this isnt his first rodeo hes going to have these guys coming in here and playing hard and you know thats all you can ask and well see what happens from there so they had a couple nice exhibitions against uh Sienna and Monmouth feeling pretty good about where they are foul at the other end Kyle cuff a little handsy figure that Cirus will foul more typically Zone defenses uh dont get called for quite as many fouls as teams that are out pushing in manto man yeah when youre pressing up youre going to get some hand check fouls youre going to get some fouls when theyre driving by in the lane but thats where these big guys have to be in help they have to rotate they have to be there to be a presence and block shots good deflection Ahad Robinson back in Wood Yard 33 in blue a Val perzo transfer now we see some zone out of cuse with the Baseline out of bounds that has been common place so far through the early part of the Year count in the exhibition game shot clock again spinning down and Kyle cuff with that extension from the top of the zone and thats one of the things thats been missing a little bit here and there there uh with the Zone defenses that length and Applause aggressiveness that one hits with a thud from the Jackson Baker Miss orangs again quickly in the transition game and JJ Starling doesnt mess around we heard it in the in the pregame coach arrey saying we got to push the pace we got to get up I think every time they got a rebound we didnt see him slow it down one time these guys are looking to push the pace get easy buckets D POS there reaching and they got Starling with his hand in the cookie jar he thought he had picked one away again for another easy deuce and this one whistled as Peter Cary had the other part of the sandwich on the defense there you know Matt I really like this guard Trio that they have in right now even with with cuff JJ and Judah these guys are athletic they can move and they can really make stuff happen on the floor looks like theyre willing to gamble on Steels confident that somebodys got him on the other Applause side three in the timer here Woodyard nope and its still just Clarence Daniels that scored for New Hampshire were nearly a quarter of the way through the Music game I think going in with New Hampshire knew it was going to be a challenge they were going to struggle but Peter carry off the pretty feed from JJ Starling Matt early in the exhibition we saw JJ versus Damon handled the ball exclusively in that game and he looked like a he was solid at the point guard position there he is making another play Robinson got In Too Deep the orangs looking to push again mince and Starling interchangeable in some respects mince hellbent this time to get a shot up hell have to earn it at at the line you see jjl yeah great pass to Peter C he he had eight assists in the first game against Damon you know he showed that he can handle the ball he showed that he can push Judah off to the two and they can play off of each other I I think thats going to be crucial going forward in the season sometimes Judah is getting pressured now you can get the pressure off and hand it to JJ and let Judah kind of play off the or play the two positions so them being able to play off each other make plays for each other is crucial going into this season especially in ACC play second free throw for Mintz is very short Subs each way both teams playing lots of people in this opening half I tell you what we C these deflections man they it seems like they have at least 15 deflections right now yeah just moving the basketball is proven difficult for UNH Clarence Daniels against McLoud gets around around him awkward shot Rebound with the shot clock not resetting Baker against the big fella out to Robinson for three first points for anybody other than Clarence Daniels Ahmad Robinson out of West Texas College as his first major one points 74 does for you just stand it in the paint being a presence 28 to9 Syracuse I administ remaining in the first half minz on the post up against Robinson draws a foul and one for Judah mint he just toyed with the smaller Robinson there got him on his back and has a chance at a threepoint play I tell you what it it looks like his body is improved hes getting stronger and I dont think people really understand the footwork that you have to have to be able to get into it Bey on balance and then hit that shot with the contact Judah minz from what Ive seen this year or last year and now a little bit of this year his footwork is Elite probably some of the best footwork in the country and when you do go at the very highest level and you have these NBA tryouts and camps clearly theyre grading on a high uh curve and standard to see that type of thing so uh that experience will pay off big time for Mintz who leads all scorers at this Applause stage Daniels again turned away again and the or start the break three on two its cup strip going up hell head to the line with a foul on UNH you know Matt we talk about successful Syracuse teams and and you go back to the teams that were really good in transition you know going back to the national championship year with GMAC and Melo then even going into the years with Johnny Flynn and Paul Harris those are the teams that really had success that could get out and push the ball and then have the athletes to be able to play on the other end as well th this team right here looks like you know they have the athletes they have the depth they have the athleticism to really improve as the season goes on and then be able to create turnovers and get easy buckets and transition small sample size of course Weve Only Just Begun but its fun to see the ability to pass and get out and move and whoever winds up with the ball in the transition game on the defensive end can make a play and thats what guard oriented teams can do but theyre not lacking in size obviously especially in this case against a mid major program like UNH Naim Miller goes begging and Taylor nearly threw it away its Dior Davis and theyre going to take a look at the shot clock confusion as to uh whether that was reset properly and just another thing for the viewers if you see now you see the hesitation from the shooters of New Hampshire and thats just the presence these guys running out getting hands up now theyre hesitating instead of going right into the jump shot which changes the whole flow of their offense shot clock put back up and into the back court for Dior Applause Davis back door cut Daniels has some skill on the lefthander finishes again eight points of the 11 for UNH go to Clarence Daniels average a double double last year early shot there for cuff doesnt fall UNH again in the lane this time Dior Davis his first points is a wild cat transfer from Ellsworth Community College doing a good job pushing the pace we talked to Coach Davis earlier he said they want to push the pace now they got to get in the paint get some touches and then be able to finish or kick it out for open shots threw that pass a little too far trying to go into McLoud wishful thinking UNH able to recover and start the break with Davis cuff down to the seat of his pants to get it Cloud couldnt squeeze the Rock tough to throw a pass from the top of the key you got to get an angle on Applause that Hampshire again late in the shot clock and an extra step for Naim Miller for the turnover so New Hampshire starting to get a little success of late but it has been Syracuse early in the shot clock doing the damage so far close to 60 from the field early big lead against New Hampshire in the first ever meeting between the programs welcome back everybody Courtside here at the D Tory ball is with us with Eric dandorf as well talking orange United Tory the preferred Collective of Syracuse Athletics and its taken a minute to kind of get this uh settled and organized and uh youre hitting it full boore with orange United the place for people to connect to make a difference in nil absolutely so we weve been um I just got here a few months ago and its exciting to get here during this time cuz you know I was a student athlete you knew too so uh nil is a super important part about what we do uh and coming in being the nil guy per say uh its exciting to help our student athletes out and it its all about competitive competitive Excellence its all about competive exence Eric you know from your time what just a little more might have made a difference right for guys and obviously its been a major Game Changer across the college sports landscape right now yeah absolutely I I wish I had anal back then what whats one thing you really want the student athletes to benefit from this nil Collective here at Syracuse you you know I I went to school here I got two degrees here and and and my big thing is um I want them to come out of this with a business mindset this thing is is a business no matter what you do it youre an entrepreneur you get to understand and learn from some of the greatest people uh some of the greatest business Minds here in Syracuse uh so I want them to understand its more than just getting a couple of dollars its its really understanding how to be an entrepreneur and how to uh be a business with yourself Judah JJ Starling in this case with two more as we visit with former Syracuse defensive lineman now Deputy ad Tory ball the idea of orange United is twofold not only to make an impact for the players you talk about build their own brand come out of here with the idea that uh they are a businessman right and W man to as well to find a way to go out and make an impact regardless of what it is they do after Sports absolutely so uh with with orange United uh who just came on as our preferred Collective we its all teachable moments and our student athletes are coming out and theyre being able to be entrepreneurs in the in the greatest sense but theres also an element of of support that our community can bring to us uh orange United has a crowdsourcing method so so fans can uh help and and you know even if its as simple as 10 a month uh so so thats the where we think willll see success with this community the 10 can go a little farther right now at the moment there is a matching program that is being run through the middle of next month so through December 11th so the idea is people subscribe so their 10 20 50 a month can be doubled here by some other generous participants absolutely we have some Anonymous generous donors that came in and said hey if if we can get this thing off the ground and we can get you know the community to buy in well match uh dollar for dooll after uh they any subscriber that we get uh so thats exciting for us and we we think you know this 500000 campaign in 50 days can turn into a million dollars we we are very hopeful orange United SL memberships and you can go there and you can earmark your money to the cause that uh suits you best and I think one of the things that uh the fans probably want to hear about Tory from yours perspective is it doesnt have to be the hugest you know mountains of money here that uh you get the most attention that you read about and see about because if you build a a wide base uh with your donations to a collective then you can make an impact long run absolutely so so Im going to be honest Im not giving 100000 but I can give 25 a month uh to help support our student athletes and you know over over a year that that turns 2 300 uh it might seem small to some but you know we get 10000 Syracuse basketball strong uh giving 25 a month that that turns into 3 million really really quickly which is something that you know every school in the ACC is vying for right were were buying for the same players were were vying for you know the same attention and if we can be successful inil um from a competitive standpoint well be really good you can say what you want about it as Sunderland has the pick and the Breakaway Chris Bell whff his attempt to block it but what this has done in know among the outcomes of nil being introduced into college sports is that fans now donors alumni they are empowered to make a difference in the competitive nature of your team and thats not uh all they get out of it yeah so so from a from a you know as a subscriber you get you know meet and greets with the team you get exclusive content um all you you know being a member its its not just about you giving money its what you know the university what our athletes will give back uh and thats content exclusive you know meet and greets and and meet meet and greets with the coaches and the players all right Tory thanks for your time best of luck with it okay thank you I appreciate you guys that great J Tory ball former orangeman and orange United head here among others Deputy ad if youd like to donate to Orange United you see it right there orange unitedcom membership from more and to uh make a difference here certainly Eric we talked day in and day out about the changes that the transfer portal and name image and likeness have made to college sports its entirely different youre not that old man but things have really changed you would have been an incredible nil spokesperson and all all of the things you do now in our community I know you would have been doing as a student athlete if it was permitted back then and you know what Matt I love doing this but I dont know if I would have been doing it I I might have been a couple million strong at the nil but but like you said its its totally different just the competition the whole landscape of college basketball has changed football all sports just because of the nil you see smaller schools they could get one big booster and now you know they get a couple big players now theyre competing so its I I know they still have to figure some stuff out its I guess i Ive heard things its still kind of like the Wild Wild West out there but you know I think these schools are going to navigate and figure out what works best for them and um you know everybodys going to be better for IT hand check there mince has been drawing fouls of every stripe so far in this game Rex Sunderland the latest guilty party for the Wildcats its the orange by4 with four to go in the Music first New Hampshire starting to feel a little more comfortable as cut the Syracuse lead to 14 orange coming off of a dis appointing season break even in conference last year stunning last second loss to Wake Forest the harshness of it all that wound up being coach beheim last game and really big wins are what have been absent in the last year or so and uh something they can set out to change this year Eric yeah I mean I think last year it was it was a young Team guys were still trying to figure out where they fit in figure out what their role is now they have a year under their belt theyre a little bit more clear on what they have to do offensively and defensively I think you know with red he just brings in a little bit more you know he relates to the guys a little bit more guys are are are willing to buy in a little bit more not saying they didnt do that with Coach beheim but I I just think red does a really great job of of getting guys to play and buy in and you know last year finishing was a big key I think we were in the games a lot but we just you know down the stretch a couple knucklehead plays turnovers decision making uh and again thats you know being a Freshman so this year being a sophomore having a year under your belt going into those same games those same situations now you know what to do it is a sophomore oriented team for the starting five sophomores Kyle cuff off the pass to midcourt called for the personal foul we so intent on this defensive end to try to get something going to spark early and easy offense thats how they got off to a great start in the first 10 minutes and change you know Matt you know going forward in the season obviously its early against New Hampshire but one thing that is really going to hinder the Orange is turning the basketball over we have to be able to take care of the basketball from the guard position you know to the forward position catching the ball being strong with the ball going up thats one thing that I could see turning the basketball over especially being not not a heavy veteran team but you know taking care of the ball is super important for this team going forward dcus had its share of empty trips lately the orangs are going on more than 3 minutes without scoring as Clarence Daniels the lefthander bangs down two free throws what a star he can be in the America East this year hes the only player in college basketball last year to average a double double which is impressive enough but to do that while shooting making better than a third of his threes he knocked down 40 from threepoint range and we heard coach Davis talk about him in uh in shoo around that he you know he had a chance to transfer and go elsewhere but you know he was a guy who really liked his teammates they had great camaraderie last year and then you know going into this year he he was ready to compete and and win some games at a high level what a effort for the offensive rebound and at the end Copeland on the Baseline otherwise he is saving another opportunity off the JJ Starling Miss look at this effort this stuff doesnt show up on the stat sheet we need guys like this get on the ground get dirty get physical you need those type of plays if youre going to win games especially down Music stretch seeing pickup in the back court for the first time Moore weaves his way through the Press defense easy jumper there for Naim Miller and an official timeout off the basket the first points from Miller in D1 little easy here bince thought he had support right thats a miscommunication defensively thats just a miscommunication but on judahs end you cant quit on the play you got to keep going and try to get back in front off that whistle Peter KY back in a New Englander against University of New Applause Hampshire hanging to fire again this time doesnt get a whistle on the breakout its Baker to Sunderland tell UNH is a little more comfortable here a Miss by Miller and New Hampshire getting back better as Music well Min it was a threepoint attempt Line Drive doesnt go more and a late whistle that the fans dont agree with and red ay going quickly to the bench as mince picks up his third personal team foul eight so Atri went right to uh Kyle cuff to pop off the bench to replace Miss now the thing the thing with Judah is in in the half court we know he can get to a spot but he has to try to find the shots where theyre not difficult every single time you know going into the second half after you taking three four five of those difficult shots youre tired coming down now you got to be able to get out in transition get those easy buckets and then drive and kick and make it easi as as possible on yourself so with mince out Copeland some of the ball handling duties out there with cuff and Starling Starling a three little short oh cuff should have gotten it down and eventually does showing that athleticism second jump right kind of hanging in the air and going back up Moore finding it tough going here tonight cuff the rebound I like cuff I like his energy I like his physicality hes not afraid to attack Copeland on second effort just keeping things alive this is where the long arms and legs that the orange are featuring virtually with every player out there making it very disruptive and heres my thing Matt when Syracuse isnt able to get out in transition when they have to play in the half court can they get those looks where theyre easy and open and not have contested to the basket finish every single time well to your point with Judah minz maybe you can find something else Syracuse is going to have to figure that out in half court you cant go into ACC play having those type of shots every single time at the rim and expect to win games you have to have some easy buckets at The Rim you have to have some drive and kicks and then obviously you have to be able to get out and transition Daniels clearly the focal point uses a screener here pick and pop hes got it see any good there he is 34 and 18 against Boston College last season hes more than capable hes going to make some money playing basketball I dont know if its going to be NBA but hell play somewhere and make a lot of money five outside the threepoint Arc for the orange right Applause now Starling draws contact and two at the line for JJ foul on Christian Moore you know weve been talking about Judo a lot and and we mentioned JJ obviously but I I think hes just a a a key player going forward in this season for Syracuse hes a guy who can take a lot of pressure off of JJ and you see his body he has the NBA body he hes ready to go in that lane and take that contact and I think he with an improved jump shot you know being able to score on all three levels you know he hes a guy that could really turn some heads in ACC I know he wasnt on any allconference teams but hes a guy who has allconference talent certainly one of the top freshman in the League last year playing on an otherwise veteran Notre Dame team makes both the former Baldwinsville B back home he kind of did the home thing twice right he went to a A postgrad or a prep school in Indiana and therefore he was close to South Bend gave a year to Mike Bray and now a true homecoming for Starin pretty cool to have your family be here and watch you every game shot clock off New Hampshire going for the last Applause one and Daniels in screen back to him left of the lane good move by D Dan in the final second of the half Clarence Daniels a stud for the University of New Hampshire keeping them in contact at w andh throughout the season all he did last year was lead him in scoring rebounding blocks and steals is as good as there is certainly in the America East and a lot of the mid major leagues heres a little foot fake and he fires from the free throw line off the mark in the first possession of the second Applause half opening game of the season throughout college basketball Syracuse got off to a scorching start has not been able to sustain it and the lead has been trimmed to 12 by visiting UNH both teams coming off Seasons where they were around 500 a year ago Clarence Daniels an aggressive take to the basket hes got 17 and you see that the advantage hes going to have with nem bringing him out on the perimeter and just driving right by he has a good job of using his body to help protecting the ball in the Finish Jud Min picked up by the taller Baker on the switch knew that was short all along and Baker recovers for the rebound heres my thing with Judah I you can get yours whenever these early minutes in the first and second half lets see if we can get our teammates going Oh Daniels is going he has been apart from his teammates hes scored more than half the New Hampshire points Daniels alone has not been stopped yet and he could be a problem if the orange dont get back to scoring heres a clear path for Taylor Taylor Adrien autri its all about when you talk about coaching and you move from the associate head coach to the head coach position its not just suggestions anymore its decisions that means halftime adjustments coaching him all the way through 40 minutes and and Coach Audrey is ready for it like we said hes been a he was an assistant 12 years before that he was three years at Virginia Tech under coach Seth Greenberg and then obviously under coach Jim beheim coach knows what to expect from his guys he knows what to say in the pregame in the halftime and he knows how to get these guys to buy Applause in called to play for the next possession there quick gesture to Jud Min Hampshire goes to work again with Clarence Daniels get out of the way and Daniels a early wedgie Im telling you the way the basketballs are made there are more wedgies now than ever before right you love that those Nike basketballs theyre beautiful they have a very soft cover easy to yeah easy to dribble easy to handle Im not a fan of the wedge though no who Applause is JJ Starling his first points of the half and hes a versatile guy offensively with that big body he can get down there and use it to be able to get closer to the rim against those smaller guards theres been a wedgie in each of the games so far three of them on jump shots one was on a Kyle cuff dunk he jammed it into the bracket thir hanging in here as a 12point game New Hampshire knows that its bread is buttered with Clarence Daniels you can see how he had 34 and a road win at Boston College last year well you see the sub that coach arrey had to make he took theim out and now we see Malik Brown guarding him whos a little bit more you know mobile and and moving his feet but Daniels made up his mind hes going to go ahead and take over this game when he gets the ball face up hes going to attack if you give him a little space he might Jab off and hit that midrange jump shot this guy is a player man its no question about it he we talked about earlier hes going to make him some money playing I dont know NBA overseas wherever it is but in this conference hes probably the top player if not top two or three in the conference what a story itll be gets to professional basketball hes from the Minneapolis area played at a very small school Montana State Billings for a couple years then at Lake Region state which is in North Dakota youre a big Royals fan I know threepointer is front rimen in for Judah Mintz and we heard coach the game for him Coach Davis at shootter around told that you know Daniels is the type of guy whos up 5 six in the morning getting shots up before everyone else and its showing good take there by Ahmad Robinson loving to play here on the big stage a Newark New Jersey area player getting to the Dome and playing a above his size what it what it must what a treat it must be for a guy like Nathan Davis to take over a program able to retain the best player and see the example that he sets said he was up doing yoga Daniels this morning at 730 it makes it a lot easier when your best player is setting the tone for everybody else to buy into to what coach is trying to teach Syracuse has not put away New Hampshire yet New Hampshire program that is yet to make its first NCAA tournament appearance the late years under Bill haran kind of capped out at 15 wins theyve done that three of the last four years see Syracuse starting to settle for jump shots instead of what what is their strength get the basket Domin not Copeland strength he made just one a year ago but here hes able to make something happen at the defensive end Bell he is a shooter Brown couldnt keep it alive and New Hampshire could make this a single digit game from the corner now the weak side rebound off the Miller Miss and hes taken down f is on Daniels and Matt going back a couple plays to the Judah minf Im looking at Coach arrey and hes not afraid to take out his best player if hes making a mistake and tell him what hes done wrong you know a couple times we watched Judah just let the guy just drive right by a guy with his athletic ability his Mobility to be able to stay in front that should never happen he has to a guy that hes a guy thats has to set the tone offensively and also defensively as well coach red letting him know Starling steps into one all these guards are going to have to shoot at a higher clip mince and Starling both were about 30 threepoint Shooters last year New Hampshire they do most of their work around the threepoint line Daniels may be the lone interior presence again Syracuse spreads the floor matt I think thats one question mark for Syracuse going into the season do we have consistent shooters that can help us space the floor for our guards to be able to penetrate and get in the paint from way out there its down the middle for Baker first points of the day for Jackson Baker and it forces an Adrien ay timeout so New Hampshires made it a little close for comfort now an eightpoint game the latest threepoint Connection by Jackson Baker autrey in the orange trying to stop currently on the bench but hes among the ACs and the nations best selected today to the Nate Smith watch list I mean hes a guy that had a great freshman year probably one of the best freshman in the country last year entered the draft just to get some feedback came back knows what he have to work on but like we said he has to be a problem on both ends of the floor I think offensively obviously we know what he can do but defensively hes a guy if hes active he can stay in front and really cause Havoc for that opposing point guard and list there on the Nay Smith award watch the class of the ACC PJ Hall and Clemson Armond bake got back for another year at UNC Kyle filipowski is D the preseason Player of the Year good play there by Ahmad Robinson blocking a shot from behind New Hampshire starting to smell it a little bit huh they got they got kind they see when your best player is playing like that everybody else comes in yeah they know theyre getting what they need from Clarence Daniels 19 points for him the others coming along and the orange have not yet put away the wild cats in the first ever meeting between the two Applause Music for Applause SC Applause Applause Music w pregame he wants to get some things done early in the shot clock theyve been better at that of late six of their points in the first five minutes of the half have come in early offense yeah they havent quit you see you see them running the floor the guys are cutting to the basket get paint touches and then when you cut to the basket suck the defense in that opens up the perimeter for those open looks a little more aggressive to close what was once a 23o deficit now down to eight Syracuse could use a basket missed their last five theyve gone more than two minutes without scoring Copeland to turnover its two onone with Starling hustling back Sunderland turned it down Robinson on the push may have been fouled and he BS it in it is a Sixpoint game New Hampshire doing a great job of Walling up on the defensive side of the ball and now you see the guards Fearless going to the rim attacking using their body finishing at The Rim i imagine the nervousness is creeping in on that bench over there now have a big lead and theyre not exactly chiseling the plaque just yet for Adrien rris first career head coaching Victory big trip here to cut the deficit in half Baker runs the rim and Copeland recovers the rebound you know what bad I think these are the situations we want to see these these guys in and see how theyre going to react see what players are going to step up see what lineups work Syracuse Kyle cuff stops the bleeding a little Applause bit Dior Davis nearly a turnover sometimes New Hampshire looks like they play maybe a little fast theyve got three at the scores table right Applause now Robinson in amongst the taller players coughs it up Copeland starts the break three on two and copelan out of control its a block though foul against UNH giveing up here Matt thats one of those plays where you have to make a decision by the free throw line either youre going or youre making the drop off you get too deep like that then you get in a situation that happens and your teammates need to know where youre going right Subs each way and I think too for you know both teams New Hampshire and Syracuse you know when you have young guys decision making is is a thing that comes you know with experience especially for a guy like uh a quader you know freshman year showing some promise now coming into his second year we want to see that jump in the decisionmaking category heres kader copelan at the line fascinating to see what kind of role Copeland has keep in mind Benny Williams unavailable at the moment suspended for a violation of Team rules going into the second of two exhibition games and its thought to be a shortterm thing but hes not back just yet orang has scored the last five to swell the lead back to 11 Sunderland a nice action there but Taylor sticks with him big shot for Moore startling up in the air for the rebound its out of bounds for the wild cats and I do have to say this mat you know Kudos is the coach Davis because he has his guys composed and and even when they miss some shots or turnover they go right back into their stuff and execute so they can get a good shot both coaches I think are aware of the volume of possessions that theyre going to get so sometimes any individual one isnt going to be your best but if you keep at it you want to win in the volume game and you want to make most of every single possession that you get you want to be as efficient as you can Curry takes a stumble bodys hitting the floor Daniels goes down and a block is Applause called he is active in that middle so Peter kry couldnt stay in front here they got their feet tied up and this year in college basketball almost all of these fouls are going to be against defensive players for that work around the restricted area Clarence Daniels to the line on the carry foul and Daniels just doing what he does in every single game you know it doesnt matter if its Syracuse or if youre playing against in conference against baton hes getting his lunch pal hes going out there and hes going to work hes doing what he does hes getting to the free throw line hes being active around the rim hes facing up giving himself a chance to hit the midrange or drive all the way 14 double doubles last year hes pretty shy in the rebounding Department tonight misses the second of two free throws but Daniels is the first 20po scorer in the game hes got 21 all together Copeland off the fake online but too strong Copeland just one of nine from distance last year and is yet to find the stroke in the opening game of the season entry feet tough a long guard knocked it away but turned it over himself carry hangs back Taylor trying to bring some semblance here of uh sanity to the proceedings again this is what Judah Min on the bench so youre looking at other primary ball handlers and creators like Starling cuff and Copeland Starling rolled it around almost stuck on the rim again carry had to have the patience to bring it down Copeland for cuff wide open to settle him they need to settle down somebody needs to come in and settle Syracuse theyre all looking for the kill shot in this game but is Yet to Come Syracuse leads by 10 with 12 minutes to go t flat footed held his ground but official Les Jones has a foul its on Kyle cuff yeah you see him right here you know the guards are just forcing the issue theyre getting downhill theyre making you get into their body now you see him getting to the free throw line Dior Davis to the line New York City product in his first career division one game and we got to think Matt these guys this is check that no right Davis in his first game here you goad this is a once in alifetime chance for these guys to be able to play in the dome they want to be able to go out and say that they did some work in in the D absolutely that always adds a little spring in the step of uh visiting players that are up for the challenge as you know Eric the hardest part typically for people whove never played here at all is getting used to the depth perception uh the basket is so far away from the stands and the wall but once theyve got that dialed in they look to step up big on one of the largest stages in the game Davis makes bolt and checks out see if uh New Hampshire looks to pick up the defensive pressure Applause here Malik Brown out there to reverse the ball and set screens see if Taylor can get going hes fouled and he pures it a chance at a fourpoint play for Justin Taylor we talked about Justin Taylor you know early hes a guy who can really come in and make shots and be effective on both ends of the floor Justin Taylors first three of the Season would have been good at the State Fair its down to heavily favored in that one bring back the Asia Fair one of the most dynamic scorers in all of college basketball little roster turnover as well as Justin Taylor converts on the first fourpoint play of the season Applause oh off the fake hand off the wheel to the basket and Robinson could not finish and Jud Min has been on the bench for much of the last few minutes with three fouls so Copeland Starling and cuff run of the show behind the head to Brown who got In Too Deep un contested rebound for Daniels May Miller hasnt scored this half Brown pokes the ball out of bounds now one thing Matt Syracuse can do offensively is go at Daniels on the defensive end make him work a little bit now its a little bit harder when he comes back offensively to make a move or get or get a shot off you got to make him work on the other end of the floor as well the correction on the mins foul count four not three here we go thus explaining his extended absence here lead was cut to six currently a Music dozen Daniels again finding his way to the basket copelan boards the Miss for the orange another late decision by Copeland thats just what we mentioned creates a turnover and a foul at the other end foul is on JJ Starling second foul on Starling thats twice now where Copeland maybe gotten in over his head without uh a plan in mind just going just just dribbling with no purpose just getting in there getting too deep and then turning around where you dont have anything you just throw unnecessary pass Naim Miller transer from Edinburgh in Pennsylvania gets his first point of the half began his college career at Mount St Marys couple of Seasons at the mount and both are good at the line hes been quiet hes a guy that can really fill it up out there in the Music perimeter again five out along the perimeter for the Music CES Brown trying to get to work in the paint Starling on the step back line drive and Copeland had a defender on his back foul on the rebounding effort goes against un and that Im just looking at Syracuse right now I just think theyre playing two two side to side instead of getting downhill with it fourth on Daniels thats a big development as hes got to exit at 1023 remaining whatever hope of a comeback or really tightening this game up for New Hampshire you figure rests on the shoulders of Daniels and what did we just say say The Possession before Daniels needs to be attacked on the defensive end and there you go now hes out of the game Starin taking his time finally gets it in to Justin Taylor step back of his own lost the defender but missed the shot see what UNH can do with Daniels on the bench Robinson didnt want to pull it there fast ball for Sunderland hes got it Syracuse getting caught in no mans land playing in between you got to decide youre going to go or you going to stay Sunderland matches his career high with Five Points Taylor looking to answer drops the triple his second of the Applause game Baker thought about again a dpat check he is hit from well above the top of the key turnover a little extra dribbling for Miller Taylor bounce speed for brown great look from Taylor great look from Taylor thats what you need it a a guy not named judim Min coming in and give you a little bit of um two hand Jam brings the time out by Nathan Davis of New Hampshire Justin Taylor on the bounce pass paying it off for the big fell on the run to the rim so 12point game what does Adrien atrey H to see in this final quarter here where again it looked like this could have been completely blow the doors off in the first 10 minutes and in the middle 20 you can say New Hampshire in some respects outplayed the orange I think the biggest thing is just effort are you guys going to continue to play hard when stuff is going bad when you face a little bit adversity when you turn the ball over when youre missing shots when the other teams making shots coach alrey just wants to see his guys continue to play hard play with effort and play with energy yeah were the more talented Syracuse is the more talented team theyre the bigger team but if youre not going to play hard and youre going to let these guys get up and down theyre going to show that they belong here and thats what theyre doing right now Music back to action in a 12point Music game spinning move there by Trey Woodyard and he rings the bell for the first time in the game that was a tough decisive move right to the rim spin finish with the left over P Jud Min back with that timeout this is how teams are going to play Syracuse when they know theyre not hitting the open jump shots theyre going to play boxes and elbows and make these guys drive into another defensive player and then work Syracuse is going to have to be able to knock down open shots to get them out of that defense Baker the foul so Malik Brown trying to create something inside one interesting chess piece he is last season worked his way into a parttime starting role made Seven starts the average 20 minutes a game the or most gifted rebounders and as a freshman made an impact somewhat of a surprise too I think to for everyone for him to come in and do what he did as a freshman Brown makes both see who New Hampshire can count on with Daniels on the bench and I think this is its good for Coach Davis in in New Hampshire to see what they could do without their best player on the court because this is a situation that obviously they dont want to be in but going forward it might be there short lived he just sent to the scores table mince top of the key3 he knew it was off all the way away pursued the rebound late Brown nearly a steal you can tell that UNH doesnt feel like theyve got great places to turn absent Daniels long jumpers there pure from the corner for Naim Miller his second three of the game Matt I I have to say Judah Mintz at least four or five times has just let his offensive player drive right by him and create a shot or an opportunity at The Rim hes much better than that defensively penetrating kick now hes looking to post up Robinson into a double team he does draw the foul here second Defender coming over two at the line for Mintz when we return here Judah minz just back in the game playing with foul trouble on his own right look to see if the orange could put away Music UNH earlier in the program orange United is the preferred Collective of Syracuse Athletics most importantly right now and most urg ently there is a matching campaign going on through December 11th so check it out at Orange unitedcom you want your dollars to directly impact student athletes and the strength and quality and depth of the teams orange unitedcom its the place for you Judah minz had been on the bench and on ice for a minute he goes to the line excellent free throw shooter cooled off a little bit at the end of last year to about 75 he gets the line a lot thats one of the easy ways to score Eric he makes it awfully hard on himself yeah I mean you know Jud is an outstanding player but he needs to make the game easier just let it come to him you see as he gets to the Lane its a lot of contested and hard finishes at The Rim hes a guy who could get in there and make it easy on himself uses speed get into that midrange pullup or just go in there and draw a couple and then kick it make it easier for you and your teammates hell draw a lot of attention from every defensive scheme the orange face this year shot clock at five as UNH spreads it out got to hurry with Robinson long rebound run down by Chris Music Bell now heres a chance for Syracuse really to execute in the half court mince calls a play and then scraps it it looks like Taylor down the alley draws the contact that gets him to the line it may have fouled out Dan it is so Daniels is out that is a huge blow to The Wilds huge and you know what a great job from Judah Mintz noticing that Taylor had Daniels guarded him and then you know Daniels got caught top side on Taylor he had the angle to the rim and a great job of attacking so in the final 7 Minutes New Hampshires best player and one of the best in the American East is watching like the rest of us so Syracuse at the moment leads by 10 well see where this one winds up Taylor yet to find the range there did convert on the fourpoint play first game in early season for everybody right you know what these Justin Taylor Chris Bell these are guys who are really going to have to have a big impact on this team space in the floor we talked about you know the lack of Shooters on the Syracuse team these guys are two guys that really have to be able to fill it out fill it up excuse me on the Music Applause perimeter Zone here is forcing New Hampshire to spread it out running at him is Malik Brown and its another chance at a fourpoint play this time for the Wildcats my goodness pretty good defensive stand apart from this as brown out of control on the close out well you see what happened is beld and didnt bump quick enough and then he you know Brown was under the rim and he had the long close out which he tried to make up for and you got to communicate in the zone that was Bells bump he should have just been on that and kept Brown down a Miller cannot convert the fourpoint play you still see it in your Le the rotations and youre thinking about that right its like its like nothing I I know it like the back of my hand M too strong from the dotted line but Brown sticks with it and Applause scores Robinson looking over his options quick moving into Baker he been pretty quiet in this game out outside of the one very deep three he hit early this this half mince runs right by him switch hands shot no but a another trip to the line for Judah Min I tell you I think if he becomes the NBA logo its going to be him on the ground just going to be a little silhouette like a like a murder scene I mean that thats where he spends his time I hope he has a great brand someday and a sneaker and a clothing line and the whole thing the logo is going to be a silhouette of him laying down yeah I you know what and I dont think people understand how difficult call that was to even get that shot off going off the same foot with the left hand I I mean we do we do need to see him make it a little bit easier for himself and his teammates but I tell you what this kid is so talented being able to get to the rim and and you know create opportunities like that where you the figures to lead the conference in fouls drawn this year I put him up there with tius battle as another player that was just incredible ible at putting pressure on the defense that way getting to the rim and to the line definitely in that category no question Johnny Flynn who another guy that comes to mind just explosive being able to get to the rim timeout taken by Nathan Davis while New Hampshire gets itself organized orange have one more Dome game actually two more before heading to Hawaii they play Wednesday against kesas here and Colgate comes in on a two game winning streak in the series next week the Dome schedule repete with bangers again LSU is in in the first ever ACC SEC Challenge and then you know its a gauntlet in the ACC starting with the conference opener in Pittsburgh its not going to get any easier from here are they taking us to Maui or whats going on with that are we going the petition is in well put our seat on the plane Im ready right now two two of them for us right one of us is going and its the not the person seated to the right thats all right well be thinking about you yeah Music exactly Ill get one of those little umbrellas for you to bring back 12point Syracuse leads led by more than 20 in the first half on the push to the basket Woodyard and a foul maybe an offensive foul lets see lets jum says dont score the goal and hes got Kyle cuff with the foul cuffs fourth I mean thats just by thats just a rip blow BL you know cuff he was laid on the help coming across when you see that rip right away Kyle he has to go ahead and get meet him outside of the paint and get that charge he was late and then thats the and one so Woodard able to get it done jumper here from the corner and another whistle my God this one comes at 543 remaining to fad Robinson he keeps the pressure on thats one thing I will say about he he keeps the pressure going downhill to the rim and thats hard to guard all game long guess what mince is back at the line where hes been collecting his male made 139 free throws last year the second exhibition game Wednesday of last week he threw 10 fouls in the game had 16 free throws so thats a thats a way to get easy baskets he might take a bruising on the floor along the way hes scoring into line with Music ease anticipated the pass into Woodyard Brown broke it up still loose to the floor Woodard recovers for New Hampshire shot clock at nine for Robinson out of his range and Copeland stretches for the board and I like this lineup this is a good lineup with Malik at the five were mobile were versatile they can push the pace jumper off the spin by Mintz no good off the glass and Applause rim play called from the New Hampshire Ben Baker off the elbow little surpris baker he averaged six points a game last year its not giving him more than that tonight jumper from the corner Sunderland too strong good rebound for Woodyard ground ties him up and the arrow favors the wild cats Matt I really like what weve been seeing from W I know he used to transfer from Vanderbilt I believe VPO Valpo Valpo he I mean hes just a guy coming in playing hard you see the two straight line drives he had one good move where he spun into the left hand hes just playing hard going after the ball being aggressive played last year for UNH started half the games in which he played down the middle of the lane Bank Shot is good for Ahmad Robinson great body control lefthanded finish great drive to the rim well now theyre getting going what Nathan Davis theyre showing how they want to play 48 shooting in the second half because theyve had high percentage and high quality shots either open threes or get it to the cup one thing that coach Davis stressed was what shot selection he he is going to pound it into his guys heads that we need to get good looks and good opportunities meanwhile Taylor hits from the midrange but last year New Hampshire was near the very bottom in college basketball at field goal shooting less than 40 as a team for the season theyre twoo shooting shoting was a very subpar missed there back into baker has it poked out by Brown active hands again from the Syracuse defense you can see how difficult it is at times to rebound out of the Zone mince picked up on the switch instead plays it back above the perimeter and a foul on Brown screening for Taylor Brown picks up his third the orange got a little bog down there theres the smirk of a head coach whos going to work the officials now from a different position orange by Music 11 has his first win as a head coach at this school for Adrian arrey would be his first ever Nathan Davis won nearly 130 games at buckell Justin Taylor has come alive in the second half for the or yeah I think hes a guy who can really earn some big time minutes you know Chris Bell is a starter but I think Justin Taylor just being a big physical presence on both ends of the floor you see him knocking down some jumpers and also he can put down put the ball down the ground as well and I think really where he can help out is defensively and rebounding the basketball too 66 Taylor tends to elevate higher than the Block Jackson Baker a decent shooter at 68 for UNH down to Woodyard again and Clarence Davis has fouled out for the wild cats played about four minutes without him now Robinson the drop off for Baker thats that weak side on the zone you got to be able to come over and help and close that cutter interesting theyre staying with the Zone down the Music stretch un has not shown tremendous uh deep shooting proficiency yet in this game theyve made a couple back door pass here copelan to Brown great Music extra Miller Off the Mark seems like kind of a last Stitch effort there for New Hampshire and the orange look to put it away here as we approach the twominute remaining mark Music Ms top of the key Ms with a thud just five threepointers made in the game for the orange cup was back in position my goodness how hard is it to draw a charge in the college basketball this year I mean hes above the arc weve got to see this again yeah I mean thats techbot right I mean he was there he was there you got to give it up for cuff giving up his body he seems like that type of guy cuff picks up his Applause fifth a Miller with a pair of free throws for Applause Music un cus got that fire in him here fouls out after an 8point night you know cuffs is a guy whos whos going to see a lot of time this year I think you know obviously backing up JJ and Judah but hes a guy who come in and bringing a lot of energy especially on that defensive side of the ball giving up his body pressuring the ball bringing it up the court I like what cuffs been doing time out Adrien ay to navigate the final minute 43 then it is on to Wednesday night here in the dome kishis comes over from the Western New York just 10 wins a year ago for kishis but uh everybody starting the season fresh looking forward to that long time series Syracuse and fishus back in the day played plenty do a meet here Wednesday night at Seven a game you can see right here on acc Network extra New Hampshires next game is against Curry Im not sure whether thats Stafford D or the seasoning that theyll be playing you know Orange right now in position to put this one away that box doesnt tell the whole story Eric the orange look like were going to put up huge numbers in the first few minutes of this game but that pace was hard to sustain you know what man I mean besides you know the first 8 to 10 minutes of the first half and New Hampshire has done a pretty good job of fighting through the adversity you know withstanding the runs and I think Syracuses energy hasnt been where it needs to be for much of the game play called out of the timeout was for Judah minz all the way to the basket great move noticing no helps side on that spun right off mince gets to 20 points last year did that nine times in a freshman season kicks this one out of bounds tell you what Matt just from from being a player and having that experience its funny when you score a basket and then you come down on the defensive side of the ball you have a little bit more energy its just its just how it is you know human nature human nature feeling a little bit better about yourself I dont think mince lacks for confidence in any facet of his life in game not at all Robinson to Ward do they press for threes here Robinson floater is good regardless of the result I Im impressed with Coach Davis in New Hampshire of how theyve you know continued to play hard continue to play through the adversity and and theyve been right there throughout the whole game besides those first few Music minutes Copeland an extra step in the lane coaches this one over the front of the rim 10 points for Copeland matches his career high score 10 just before Christmas last year against Pittsburgh just juggling the ball on the sideline and out off of Syracuse see New Hampshire assistant Jimmy Allen recently the head coach at army he and Coach Davis go back decades Robinson left alone left it short set it up for more also short big Collision there with no whistle final 10 seconds knuckle floater doesnt go and that will do it New Hampshire puts in the lightest of scares in the second half and congratulations to Adrien ay bleeds Orange and now has his first win as Syracuse head coach
