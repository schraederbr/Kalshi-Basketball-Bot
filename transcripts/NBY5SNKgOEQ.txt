on the sideline to start cam not in the starting five for the first time this season he started all 35 games last year was that shoot around today and cam was not with the first five wondered if that might uh continue to tonight and cam will begin the game on the bench its a new look for the deakes tonight the Strutton deak on these brand spanking new white jerseys wake and James Madison and this is Freeman the former Ohio Valley Conference Player of the Year at Morehead State hes a guy the deakes are going to have to mark closely hes a veteran player he played at three different schools nail playing in his fourth can score a lot of different ways as you mention the OBC play a year year ago Lake Forest last played against Boston College 10 days ago Hunter Salis finds the spot the elbow comes up short and was last Touch by wake as Jam yub ball in that game against BC stand the decks obviously came back they Trail by 10 early let it the half one by six they only shot 13 threes thats the fewest threepoint attempts in the Steve Forbes era in Winston Salem now this is obviously a Wake Forest team that has been struggling from Beyond The Arc all season long inside its the big man Elijah hutkins ever for nothing Dukes two things real quickly one yes theyre number 15 in the ACC in threepoint baskets made theyve got to find a way to get some balls to fall for him that could have been one he doesnt second thing keep an eye on a match up that we just saw Xavier Brown Hut Brown H is a very good inside player he too was a rookie of the year to another conference and thats going to be a nice match up tonight I think with and Fon Reed scored inside early Fon Reed with a bump of a foul about 30 feet from the basket picks up his first Evan to further that point Wake Forest not shooting the basketball well this season how bad 41 worst in the ACC right now they got to score the basketball if not from the perimeter theyve got to go inside thats read is so important tonight and and Spillers AJ Smith working on Spillers and Spillers up to the task defensively swats it away and then a bad pass by wake picked off by Ricks Ricks gives it to the corner off the side of the backboard for brown in the rebound for w Applause Forest Deeks return to ACC play this Saturday at Clemson match up against the top 25 Tigers step back three Davin Cosby knocks it down deavin Cosby stepping in the lineup lately knocked him down threes with a lot of comfort thats big his 22nd threepoint basket made of the Season particularly in the wake of what happened against BC started but only played about 3 minutes and 40 seconds they knock it off to a good start did not see the floor again theres Rick Up and Under yeah Ricks is one these guys theyre long theyre athletic at 67 played in Morehead State with coach for that average about seven he can do a lot of things with the basketball theyre very versatile basketball team and they force a lot of turnovers stripped inside Fon Reed turns it over Ricks left wide open knocks it down this is not the type of team in James Madison that you want to get behind W for us theyve Le in every basketball game they played in this year theyre a front running team if they get the lead they sense blood theyre going after thats a big three AMU has started four of six look at the spacing hands are down back cut easy basket there got to be more intense on the defensive end thats a better job there but you leave a St here you cant leave these perimeter guys in they take too many threes EV and they knock them down in their last five out of the last six ball games theyre 60 of 160 from threepoint Applause land Dukes are coached by Preston Spradlin he was the head coach at Morehead State LED Morehead to a 94 and 40 record over the past four years twotime ovc coach of the year and Preston Spradlin was a young Nia ball player at Alice Lloyd College he used to work the University of Tennessee camps when Steve Forbes was an assistant in Knoxville so hes known coach Forbes literally for about two decades and hes going to be 38 years old later this Applause month can wake snap out of its early Funk the Deeks one for three with two turnovers good digging pressure from Brown he knocks it out of Applause bounds ball goes into the post to read does he try to make an initial move are they going to drop back and he read the defender there was helps side defense there he came with a double team hes got it recognized four vers Z clocks winding down Reed doesnt realize it gets it off finds the rim and the Ricochet fortuitously gives Hunter Salis an easy Deuce a way to get Salis going today attack the offensive glass M hor has got to be able to hold her own rebounding against this James manison team Applause watch The Duke shoot around today they practice for a purpose theyre six and four they havent won on the road yet this year but theyre coming off one of their best performances of the season in their last game which also was 10 days ago inside Elija hutkins Everett scores again the GU that Ed that pass there AJ Smith 21 I really like watching him play hes solid scores about eight or nine points the ball game rebounds and commit Place third member of our broadcast team tonight Madison little hey Madison well guys Bryce Lindsay assuming a new role this season he told me its taken some adjustment hes used to being that guy in his previous stops always getting the green light but now hes the sixth man and he told me his coaching staff his teammates and steing a lot of confidence in him in that role and guys I think its working 14 points Off the Bench thats is average the only player in the country to do so yeah Lindsay just checked in for the Dukes CH freshman from Baltimore scored 18 in the big win over Utah Valley 10 days ago great start for J ball complex announced he was stepping down it was an incredibly emotional press conference for the athletic director John Curry the Wake Forest University president Dr Wy and plenty of Tears shed by Dave as well and uh hes going to hang around Winston Salem so he wont be a stranger but its certainly the end of an era and arguably the best in Wake football history C HRI Off the Bench doesnt take him long to make an impact needed Ill say one thing and Im going to keep moving class class class Dave CLW thank you coach for all you did for Wake Force University so many of Lindsay knocks down the three thats what he can do as Madison mentioned right off the bench quick offense and a 147 lead appropriately its a football score stand yeah it is hey number two threepoint shooter in the conference there a streaky guy can get hot in a second ironically the guys will come off the bench score and thats thats something everybody wants to see K making some baskets confident elbow jumper from Parker has really struggled 28 from the floor 21 from three no other way to say it its been a miserable start to Parker sophomore season but he said hes had slumps before hes going to keep shooting work his way through it playing good defense is one way to get back into it that was pretty good D but way could not secure the offensive rebound fresh clock for the Dukes to work withing the paint too many times getting inside Lindley hesitation flipping it up high former ACC player Evie danana could not finish it the former NC State and Georgia Tech contributor now wearing JMU purple gives it back to Wake Forest Steve Forbes in year five looking for his 80th win at the Helm of the Music program wake 33 and one at home against nonconference foes dating back to before Steve was here December of 2018 Hunter Salis talk about getting the ball in the paint area H sales does it really well taking his time got into a little rhythm getting about 12T away and making that little midrange jumper floats over the top well the decks have certainly made an adjustment from where they were early in the season shooting 253 35 threes a game seven of their first 10 shots tonight have been twos Brown doesnt get the bounce Spillers Rises for the rebound quickly gets it to Sal good rebound by Spillers DS one for three Beyond The Arc so far once again Salas finds his spot he can make that shot with the best of him he rises over you gets right in the paint about 10 or 12 ft away very tough to defend he does it well six0 mini Run for the dicks from 147 a onepoint game Churchill a bass Hedges on the screen Luke Anderson and it poked away but a reach in foul called on Parker Frederickson watch Sal get in the and then Elevate about right the ACC logo its very hard to defend because he can go by weve seen the explosive dunks throughout his career and you said you said something they made the adjustment yeah if youre not making the three and I know that goes against a lot of philosophies and people keep shooting threes you need baskets two is working too didnt play some good defense and right now weight plays better defense and getting better looks offensively in their half court set hes chatting about shot sele earlier today with Preston scrin because his team has also taken 30 35 43s in a game this year he said hes okay with teams with his team taking 33s he says he wants to make or rebound 60 of his threes thats his goal stick back from Taylor wouldnt go and a tie up the arrow will give it to the DS but heres a great kicker about that he doesnt mind him taking free because he knows his guys are following shots theyre a plus seven in the rebounding margin theyre the number one team in the conference rebounding they they so that thats a tradeoff I dont have a problem with you taking threes because if you miss Im going to get the rebound and put it back in give me a basket they dont come away empty little possessions Tyler Johnson into the game for Steve fors to your point stand theyve got rebounded eight of their 10 opponents so far this year theyre first in the Sun Belt as you said 43rd in the country out of the 355 division one basketball teams give me a team that can rebound hold teams under 70 points per game Force more turnovers and you have Assist hey I I you know Ill take that dukee Harris into the game as well looking for aass inside deflected be for his ball nice job Hillside defense hon getting his hand in there just just get its Johnson hildr Harris Salis and aass smaller Qui the line up here tough shot wont go aass keeps it alive Hunter Salis makes a move sandwiched by Defenders gets it to Harris Tyler Johnson into the lane turns it over up ahead the Syracuse transfer Justin Taylor wake was fortunate that wasnt an n one Justin Taylor a guy another one of those transfers unsung hero at his team doesnt take a lot of Threes but plays really hard and just fits whatever they need to do offensively or Music defensively oh de turned it over again hildr looking for a foul Freeman picks it Lindsay shoots it Smith on the glass keeps chance opportunity Lindsay finds a wide open Pocket it in Wake did not do a great job in getting back on defense slows the ball reverses a shot and you get the rebound and the end inside F got to do a better job getting back and keeping balls in play both teams have four offensive rebounds in the first nine minutes of this game Salis little Fade Away AJ Smiths down the rebound purple jerseys around the B Freeman pulls the trigger and buries another three just trying to tell you this is what they do inside touches outside Mark Freeman the number 12 threepoint shooter in the conference 17 on the season and hes hes fluid too hes a solid player JMU responds to wake 60 run with a 70 Spurt of their own largest lead of the game so far for the Dukes Tyler Johnson rejected in the corner thats the first block of the season for Mark Freeman whos doing it at both ends of the floor how about the Syracuse transfer Justin Taylor he started every game for the orange last year coming off the bench for the Dukes and making a Music difference well he made some connections hes done a good job hes learned the craft in 37 years old hes the head coach of the JMU dukes and despite only one returning player from last year they were picked second in the Sun Belt what a run they had last year 32 and four they whooped Wisconsin in the opening round of the NCAA tournament remember watching that game they had the Badgers beat the first four minutes the next four minutes and all 40 minutes overall great thing you mentioned earlier got that St and hunger I worked in Camp so many college coaches so many coaches started off work all the things just get your to learn the business and continue so hes a great success story hes going to continue so its a tie yes it is itll be jamu ball underneath with 15 to shoot I know were focused on this game stand but a quick update for the folks out there 9 Minutes in in Charlotte Florida 25 North Carolina 10 Gators are legit there another ACC ACC match up too bring it up somebody got says got a great League this year somebody got say its the best year of SEC basketball its ever been there you go at The Rim wasnt sure if he was going to be able to elevate and finish it or Lay It Off The Glass but its a nice pick and roll in the score you need more baskets like that for Wake Forest that opens up the perimeter game Sal going downhill finish it with Spillers team the decks are going to see on Saturday also has an SEC opponent tonight Clemson vers South Carolina thats always good paleto State Showdown Hutchins Everett banging with Spillers doubled by Harris kick out Taylor Harris goes down and get called for the Applause foul he was leaning before the contact was made watch this theres a back cut boom catch it and the lint at six seven Spillers to be able to fish watch this watchs the position there inside inside reaching theres a drive get your feet there see theres contact contact was high you never Square no problem with the call left side of your screen Roger SS is having a conversation with M Shaw court side today is the 42nd game that Roger SS has worked in 44 days so far this season its kind of a slacker he took two days off can you believe it one of the best officials in all of basketball at any level abass kicks it out for Harris dukee a little uncertain gives it away and hes fortunate that J us Xavier Brown stepped on the sideline before the at the last timeout wake had six field goes it were six of 14 four turnovers no assists so why do you bring that up well if you got no assist that means youre doing all your offensive work either on the glass or either youre doing it in oneonone situation which also means youre not getting any movement that pick and roll you just saw soon fin the first time we saw real offensive move got to move the basketball got to move that was the first assist of the game Sal thats why I brought it up Sal Killers second assist on a pass from Salis to cam Hil who knocks down just his sixth threepointer of the Season tries up where he left off the other week but came into this ball game five out of 30 from the three lines got to shoot the ball better when the opportunity com oh Spillers fls it away and then he could have picked it up and instead he smacks it up gives it to the Dukes yeah I think he was trying to get it off the player watch this theres a little movement a lot of spacing that time you see the finish the extended follow through you like to see that yeah ice water AG okay fine get back on defense then I like it but lets go Im what have you done for me L guy right there thats good to see the ball going to basket cam Hil fan or weight fan looking High and a foul called at the rim with danana what do they got I think theyre going to call basket interference and go they count to basket hes a bunk theyre going to look at this okay so yeah yeah thats yeah go to any call we reviewed at the next media timeout I dont know still the ball the ball yeah I think so for this angle look like it was look he got his hand on the Music ball see it did go in so why does it not go in well he might have got a piece of it before it hit the glass is what but the ball was above the cinder he was trying to dck it I thought it was to the side of the cylinder but well take another look when we can Frederickson brings it back to hildr same spot he just made the three going to work on the dribble shot man gets the foul on Rick the thir yeah Dans a shot blocker matched up against Reed and continue to bring the ball in closer to Reed that gives you an opportunity to block the shot that time they bailed out couple of two offensive plays the last couple possessions been very fortunate for w for the turnover there wasnt a turnover in that play there to get pick up a foul if youre Wake Forest youve got to get some floor balance but just keep going youre not going to get The Knockout shot right now it starts on the defensive side for the DS today the2 game of Cam HR demon Deacon career he started 74 of them but coming off the bench tonight for the first time since he was a sophomore hes got a quick six Off the Bench six points in eight minutes for cam lets see what you get out of this offensively for JM theyve got a lot of guys that can step away from the basket make plays Freeman lost it on the dribble danana picks it up gets it Smith Applause AJ was two for three from three last time out after going one for 14 before that in the previous nine games I like him hes solid fund thats a big block here by Spillers spillers not the guy defensively that you want to attack if Ws opponent no not strong enough in the post not long enough couldnt leap high Applause enough F watches his Defender go down and then earn a trip to the hows on danana time out on the floor Hil free throws when we come back I said you were right dont push your Lu hey hey Im just trying to Im trying to help you Im trying to confirm Im not going to talk about stuff I dont know about much when was the last time you were Above the Rim St loer the afternoon you have a ladder no I was look at this got to make some free throws got to get to the line make some easy points thing about play we just looked at that was a Music 10 going inside we yep going ins size they get you some good things from Madison te Justin Taylor started the first five games of the Season hes been coming off the bench ever since he hasnt scored a lot but hes got four in the first half tonight yeah only a about four in these two years in Music Syracuse I just I love everything about his game watched him a few times app stage saw him again in the NIT last year when wake and app played but hes just he just makes hes another one of those guys places and you know was an awestin P for a year two at se Hall hes a solid seven foot Cosby makes the good if youre not un able to score weight this F this plays right into jmus hands lot of cont Applause Applause number one on Cosby watch this inside so theres pushed there two times first one was more blatant than the second one was but nevertheless one right there there has been less contact not called to foul no question about more contct we saw it in the last couple possessions down on this other end yeah five minutes to play in the first half l too strong salus caral The Rebound with one arm good long rebound but JMU does a great job of getting back on defense seven rebounds so far in the ball game for Hunter Salis Churchill a bass quick Churchill a bass with authority watch this watch the spit Bo right there got him on the back door he hes got him hes gone and you know watch this again boom there he is nice post move drop step get the defender on your here finish strong with authority and get the foul now can you make the free throw only two points in his last four ball games okay do take away from that move DS back within one wake has not trailed in this game since falling behind four nothing theyve trailed by as many as you by as many as eight EXC a chance for one at the other end butson ever just took his time in the post let the contact created boom bang again theres the same spin hesitation gets the defender off his feet and then the soft touch and gets the pass you got a nice touch he made 24 31 at the three throw line and and hes got a ability to pass the basketball weve already seen in the High poster so another active B but you got to find a way to Def Salis gets to his spot cant finish steals the rebound away and then gets it to Cosby Cosby going glass oh thats a great job by Cosby to get his bance first and foremost Elevate and use the window and knock it Applause in five first half points for Davin Cosby hutkins Everett over a bass for two big guys like this thing right there they like that little bumping grinding there hit me bang me put it in the basket nine first half points for Elijah Hutchins Everett pin and double figures each of the last four for the Dukes looks like hes on his way again tonight nice efficient game against both East Tennessee and Jacksonville State Dallass three is off rebounded by Applause Freeman Mark Freemans played a lot of basketball he scored a lot of points theres nothing he hasnt seen takes advantage of the defensive breakdown Im going to say this one time and Im let it go you got to stop the basketball he did a great job getting back got stop the ball Frederickson bumped from behind by Freeman he gets the call Freeman you just talked about he could score been a lot Madison leading wake for is 322 6 251 to play in the first half lets send it over to Madison well guys both teams coming in into this one off 10day breaks and both teams told me theres pros and cons to that the con being we dont have that momentum and Fon Reed told me the pro well theyve gotten in the lab and theyve put in some work the focus for the Demon Deacons has been rebounding over the last week and theyre winning the rebound battle so far about on track for their average of 344 rebounds so far but Steve Forbes telling his team on the sidelines we want more thanks Madison yeah the decks with a plus three rebounding Edge against a very good JMU Squad in that department you know the other thing thats scary about this T of year weve talked about it before there you know you had exams you know you got another game W crimson its just a very crazy time coaches you talk about you know other things that go off court but this has always been a scary time get you ready to play and there with players with teams playing more conference games before you get away from the holidays you know its got to take every day and focus and lo in and play well or try to any college basketball teams have a lot of time to practice before the season they they had practic over the summer and you know September October but once the season started C Forbes told me a shoot around today they had like you know 10 games with only 15 practices mixed in in the heart of the semester its much different than it was you know my day after the BC game they practiced Tuesday Wednesday Thursday they took Friday off practiced Saturday Sunday did a double session earlier this week yeah but that M fatigue its all the other things are been going around you so yeah you got to kind of get locked in been away from the court for 10 days play so Applause okay play the game you got inside the Reed working on hutkins Everett rebound control by Brown how best got the ball the b boom made a quick move big Fells holding a little too long and then trying to develop and again youre going against another seven footer make the easier Play Taylor to the basket Spillers contest the shot ahead to hriff trailing Salis nope J Ball Stan what do you think is going on with this team from Beyond The Ark Imma make this real easy they aint making shots okay they aint making shots but now why and is theyre good Shooters they just just not that shot we had a great angle it just never was on line never had a chance never hes rushing you want to make shots just relax and play basketball I mean it its a historically poor start to the season and we talked about it the early the first couple ball games you know C Michigan know its okay to get better travel called before the shot wake enter the night this evening 348th in the nation out of 355 teams that are ranked wakes one of 46 teams in the country thats under 30 there are 18 teams in the country that are currently over 40 Mak 73 quter so far this season and again that was a good look to S head just never was L chance Salis gets to the basket that was a good and again I I Im Im just you know Im a firm believer that you can get your better perimeter shots if youre able to go inside and then kick it outside if you do El help you get a shot inside and score off like Sal you got to get points oh good defense poked away Reed on the floor knocks it to Cosby dangerous pass Sal jugles it keeps it alive in front of the JMU bench possession a goes away a wake also EV shot clock and game clock just about in sync about a 1 second difference wake pulls it out looking for the last Music shot best playmaker with the ball high double in the single roll Salis looking for space creates some G scor Hunter Salis gets Wake Within one at the break may have cramped up a little bit too on his left leg and looking at him Hunters getting stretched out right now by hriff lets go to Madison little onepoint game here at the TR Coliseum second half about to begin leading scores for the two teams Elijah Hutchin Everett with nine Hunter Salis two rebounds shy of a double double hes got 10 and eight and just as we expected coming in this is going to be a tough battle for the home team JMU successful program 32 wins last year new coach new roster but similar purpose what did Preston Spradlin think about the first half Madison little just talked to him Madison What did Coach have to say yeah Evan he told me the Dukes need to do a better job protecting the paint he said they had good halfcourt defense but they need to to finish possessions and limit offensive rebounding thats something that coach WBS was focusing on coming into this game so the des doing a good job with that its interesting JMU only had one turnover the first 17 minutes of the first half but they turned it over three times in the last three minutes C HRI starts the second half and he is getting to the free throw line a ton lately for the there a quick move nice way to start your half get the ball inside paint quick move goes inside you get the basket great would you go to free throw line so well see how much activity we going to get a h seven points on two or four shooting for cam second foul on Ricks first tie since the score was z0 so technically this is the first tie of the game wake has not LED until now lets see if they do a better J own ball defense help side defense Help The Help in other words if somebodys driving is that second guys going to be able to come over and stop the basketball and then can you finish it by getting rebound see they clear on side got a foul on before the shot didnt even get a chance to tell you it cleared the whole side out so you had a post there and just let those two big guys and you talked about at the beginning of the ball game I thought that match up would be very very interesting clear out side top picks up a foul read number two on Fon Reed the thir W has done a nice job lately get D pass away but not allowing James Madison to pass and cut and move the ball freely theyre theyre theyre having to take their time and what theyre doing offensively execute H slowed them down a big start to the Freeman picked up by Applause Salis finds a little space knocks down a three got caught on the switch stepped under it he recognized that goes over the top and Freeman buries a three 10 points for Mark Freeman red shirt senior from Applause Memphis watch this go stagger this follows a guy and not able to get over you got to step over the top of that time Salis as supposed to going under but because of the communication when the dribble took off to the top of the key lost track of him he Bears it fourth three of the night for JMU theyve made double digit thre seven times in 10 games Reed the third cant Applause connect Tas goes over the screen this time big hedge as well that leaves Ricks open he comes up short Sal has his ninth rebound Salis Coast to Coast does it himself nice job by Salis takes it down gets to his spot and then just slows up elevates and scores that leg is okay from the there 35 all 12 and nine for Hunter just the second ever meeting between the Dukes and the Applause deakes Hutchin Everett smothered by Reed rejected by Reed good job officia that time did not fail to shoot her out freericks in open look leaves the crowd disappointed agains now two of 11 from Beyond The Arc Hutchin ever great spot fou by Spillers a moment AG go Hutchin ever had the ball inside was struggling didnt have his balance and didnt call the foul that time his reach watch this jump stop and then Elevate thats pretty thats some pretty basketball right there might not show up in the highlight real necessary 6 and 11 but I tell you what thats the kind of play you got to have let me ask you a serious question you coached in the ACC I did Sal life go ahead if your your players are struggling and having a shooting slump what do you say to them as a coach you keep teaching you show it to a m field you go for in practice and you just a repetition and sooner or later players at this level are going to make the shot it may not happen it may not happen to this summer I dont know but you just keep working you keep going over fundamentals you look at the shot you break it down especially today with all the tape and all the evaluations but the one thing you have to do and I Ill say this about anything you have to remain confident well its definitely become a mental thing now read confident stroke but dead end off theet doesnt get the roll it didnt go in but it had good rotation nice back did Im not mad about that you was just talks get back off the Trap Freeman flips it inside tough catch But A Better Block might have got a foul that time Reed swats danana ELR over to Salis inside to Reed F count it I love it I love it big guys fighting through pressure a pass like it too big guy Club watch this goes inside and then the lob just might have got that left hand doesnt matter its a good block by the big and you come back inside watch this turn turn to the defender take away the block the shot block go right into him and then finish strong with the play you love every bit of what you saw post defense post offense first M field goal of the night for Fon Reed the thir that last thing were talking about to end that point you have to continue to stay confident and just remind them hey do this follow through extend dont be a lazy shoo that didnt go in but it looked good let me just follow up with something Im not try give you a hard time Im digging for your Insight I know you know ball give Ill give it to you how do you have confidence when youre 5 for 30 from three like cam is or your 9 for 42 like Parker is how do you maintain that confidence Im going to tell him as a play as a player Im going to keep working and be ticked off as a coach Im going to say okay heres what we got to do the next ones going to fall is the next one no no it was short it was it was short you guys have to go back and look at why was it but you just have to continue to say heres what what you dont want to do heres what I dont want to do as a player or as a coach I dont want to say okay you aint making them dont shoot Forbes had his hands on his head kind of a state of disbelief frustrating its its very its its like putty its like those little three foot four foot puts sometimes you know sometimes they go in sometimes it dont you just got to keep working you got to have confidence next ones going to fall you work at it Freeman going to the rim t two for Mark Applause Freeman I know with a guy like Hil I would like to see him go to the free throw line hes been getting there lately stumbles on a wet spot and turns it over Id like to see him go to the free throw line to get the confidence a to see the ball go through the basket just its just every Shooters gone through but you just got to sometimes St your way out but you work on your fundamentals you work your mechs and its a constant Evolution cat another block by Reed from behind on Huts side defense good hildre for two we talked about it at the beginning of the half clear down too big guys down in the quarter nobody sees it there they do he can tonight 12 points 10 rebounds three assists just one turnover and his 115 College basketball game its his first career Collegiate double double look at that line six of 11 and and only two threepoint basket threepoint shots attempted I like the fact that hes not trying to settle for the threepointer hes getting inside where hes very very comfortable in Elevate what a great job hes doing on the glast getting some offensive rebounds a couple foot backs again hes going to need every bit of that a little bit more wait for us to get away from the Dukes this afternoon this evening whatever is night time quick update from Charlotte told you that Florida was up 2510 on Carolina its now a twoo game in the second half tar Hills have come back we got a good one here as well weake protecting the rim inside Salis the block that time on AJ Smith coming back bich effect though hild driff missed the layup but hell get to the line again for his seventh and eighth free throw attempts of the night I think Madison has an update on Elijah Hutchins Everett what you got Madison well guys he was on the sidelines with the trainer getting extra hydration they were massaging that left calf muscle there was Ice involved and now hes been escorted back to the locker room un certain if he will return appreciate the update Madison thank you we forget Stan that cam hildr was the first player to make the leap to a high major D1 program in the US from the United Kingdom education basketball system there not a lot of British college basketball players yeah that youre very true let me let me say something real quick did you notice he followed through on that in that free throw the first one he pushed it and it ended up goes in and hes in the lane the second he stayed there thats what Im talking about getting the Rhythm and SLE ball baset excellent defense from hild that time on Freeman Spillers cleans up the glass Salis gets a screen from Reed right there Salis to the pass KCK the Steve Forbes and M Shaw both like that take from Hunter goes inside gets there feels him out bump contact play through the contact one more time Elevate and score repeat repeat repeat bam thats so easy and thats a PO job defensively by James Madison first allowed him to get in the paint that easy and secondly not stopping the dribble make him pick it up and take a a more contested jump shot that just shows again the athleticism and the ability of Hunter Sal 7 Wake Forest run Dees with their largest lead of the night not see the fluid offense out of the duch youre not taking the three Big Fellas back in the game he can be a facilitator dont forget he cant take jump shots from there better movement theyll get something out of this if theyre patient hin Ze is back in the ball game hes swarm by two L Defenders and he turns it over good job of the double team Spillers came late got the and did not foul into double I think the basketball was all wet HFF was like this is gross wiped it off on his jersey when he got Applause it slippery basketball hild driff coming off the bench tonight for the first time this season hes been a Difference Maker but he turns it over there and a foul and transition goes on Spillers he wasnt as dry as we thought he was actually call it on Cosby my mistake his second few minutes hes back on the sideline so apparently hes got to get some more work on that leg get some perimeter players in gu if we havent talked a lot about tonight got the ball right there by again hes been very active inside tonight hes been that seven footer guy goes inside big F is not tonight nice block for SC up down fourth block for E Reed the third Reed on the floor lot of contact loose ball finds danana that could have been a back court violation no reset three comes up

of the Baseline dud everything yest tonight why not he blocked shots he scored into paint made a little jump hook he cleans up the floor what we ask you to do be Versa do a lot of things if you do a lot of things that keep your around you only do one thing they might get rid of but you know four blocks three points two rebounds one mop and 20 seconds of mopping for what a wonderful night H open it down you see the follow through did you see the extension that time on the jump shot yeah re talking about that too great job get some momentum going you make it by knocking some shots down stay confident keep working a shot a fall pry soon and if it does the DS will take the lead hand back and he wants the shot now watch this follow through youre looking at the ball but watch this follow through this is what Im talking about about playing through the shot get there extend look at it finish in the same spot literally and look at the extension in the ball through that was the shot that you want to Mark okay this is what I want my jump shot to look like nine times out of 10 eight times out of 10 going to go in thats what we were talking about finish high and follow through I was fortunate to be here at the do for Wake shooter around today came was shooting just like that earlier this afternoon hes two for three from Beyond The Arc tonight after going 5 for 30 the previous 11 ball game shooting is also about muscle memory and repetition and if you do things correctly what we said fundamental still theres another rejection at the rib you to fouled on the stick back blocks for Spillers too I think is it four and four for for re four for Spillers watch this block gets off his feet so quickly thats a good block yeah nothing wrong with that youre right Stan both Spillers and Reed each have four blocks a piece Evie danana about to shoot his fourth and fifth free throw attempts of the Season remembered one it played in inst state for a few years also started his GE Tech long athletic not a big score but can play solid around the rim hes also known as a shot block on his he had some big moments for Kevin ke never could stay in the rotation but sometimes theyre missing somebody andana would step up Churchill laass pulls in the rebound after a couple free throw misses from eie consistency out of him has been the big thing right there go to free line not able to knock those down des 10 run over the last three plus minutes big possession spacing good right now keep your eye on Salis where it is s on the Baseline block to the corner Cosby connects nice job there move the basketball got touches everybody was moving in Rhythm to get a score ns enthusiasm the better you play on the defensive end your offense gets better and then your defense gets better again watch this James Madison needs a basket its Ricks in Rhythm go I like get Ricks I really Applause do but youre an affable guy and you like almost everybody well when you play hard you play with some enthusiasm you do the right things Im going like it you just love the game of basketball yeah but I like it played well and correctly I hear you you know its just like Broadcasting you work hard to get things happen for shot clock at eight Salis makes a move on Brown hesitation gets his man in the air stays with it throws it up no good a bass on the glass Salis third attempt the CH hter Sal this is a James Madison team thats outrebounded all the opponents except for one and the game that they did not do they only lost that margin by two today they have been dominated especially in the last last 15 minutes of this game by Wake Forest good defensive pressure again from Salis and AAS both Hunter yes 19 for Salis de by 13 23 and9 since half time and look at the enthusiasm of this Wake Forest basketball team is bouncing their step right now on the defensive Side Des contageous 17 three in the last five minutes foul going on hildr Hunter Alis came back to Wake Forest his talent was hyped cool Cal collected hes leading the way tonight lets review trying to look at something you remember about the 1028 Mark first half James Madison had seven assists and one turnover Stats come back to me now and theyve got what nine assists and seven turnovers and that just shows you how the defense is picked up and that 11 rebounds by S let you know theyre doing some work on the other end Steve Forbes acknowledged to Madison at halftime that JMU came out with a little bit more crispness to him but Davin Cosby continues the second half onslaught and way clearly upped their defensive intensity about 23 of the way through that first half and has carried it here into the second DAV Cosby continu his streak he scored a three and 10 of 12 ball gam this season and getting good looks taking it Taking what the offense CL have work something and get it on the other side Tas flips it to Reed Cosby fakes the three hildr pulls it back outside into the fourth quarter of this basketball game on a Tuesday night eight days before Christmas to the corner Cosby Spillers keeps it alive Cosby another try gets his own rebound takes it Baseline someone lost the sneaker and Cosby scores who shoe is that thats Fon Reeds right sneaker so what else can Fon Reed do for you rebounds block shots shoes come off if it doesnt matter keep playing thats what you do gets an assist for that give him an Music assist one thing I know about it when a lot of people going to be able to put the shoe on thats 17 big fella has been active not picking up silly fouls you seen a guy loses shoe you dont usually see as plays continuing another guy on the other team pick up the shoe and throw it out of bound to make sure no one steps on yeah I see that Florida game a couple of years ago Florida I think Florida LSU big p leag change in Sp yeah AJ Smith youre talking football yes I do remember that Ive seen players you throw Applause Sho Dukes have gone ice cold look at look at the physicality you seen out a weight touching bodies three into the corner Taylor contested three at the buzzer wont go Cosby quickest to the ball and the great thing about it you did all that Reb duk for their last feeding Spillers Trayvon blocked from behind by Ricks up ahead Xavier Brown I talked about zavier Brown in a few minutes that was a huge basket they were five and0 Jes Madison when they shot over 45 this season 6 and0 when they scored 70 but doesnt look like theyre going to get there tonight its going to be hard you get Music 7 Salis discards Taylor Smith gets away with a push off on Reed and basketball Karma means its w for his ball Anderson Back AJ Smith to the bench Anderson Florida Southern Mar level of basketball belt Florida Southern was up here Im not sure if it was womens basketball or Men actually the women practice here uh Thanksgiving that Thanksgiving Wednesday nice TI Big Time program down there by the way for right recket Anon Reed righty Applause hook under control tonight everything you do mopping the floor the blocking shots let your shoe fall off the tough looks I love your game tonight Mr re still waiting pop some pop DS have done a really good job on Freeman other than going under the screen that left him open for three decks have bottled up jmus spark wake by 18 after they trail to the half as he is now back then eons response was something along the lines of heck yeah guessing thats not exactly what he said but I appreciate it Madison and a nice bounce back game for Cosby after he sat on the bench for about 36 minutes against Boston College doing out of high school Range as another number 16 shooting guard in the country went down to Alabama now a little closer to home and everybodys excited to see what hes going to Applause do one of the couple Richmond natives on this Deacon Squad seven points for to go with four blocks Anderson for three wheres that been all night Mr Anderson you sound like an agent hes asking asking the for a friend you take your time now dont dont foreen thing let the offense come to you and youll get shots or fouls Salis kicks it Reed nope Spillers tips it outside Sal tracks it down great hustle and Reed makes that shot if he if he had not faded if he stepped into the shot remember what we talked about when he if he steps into the shot hes your spot your pose he makes that but he faded back it was short give Spillers the rebound for the tip its his ninth of the Night Hunter S Beats theot Block C Applause stop wakes got 34 points in the second half still have over five minutes to play on the floor BS on hild stand hang on well watch Im not going anywhere but watch this gets inside gets under control see look at the elevator see how push up and finish it yeah hes exciting he should be because hes previous play is under review Great Looks officials are going to review the previous play so Roger SS Lee Cassel AJ Des over the monitor after review we got one right tonight Roger s told me before the game he might want to do TV sometime hed be good on TV kind of a little tie up right there count the basket for three go ahead stands out most to you about the second half for Wake for do you feel like they figured something out this could be a turning point I think yeah and you know what it was activity I Im going worry about the ex no you can run boom boom boom its activity they were aggressive offensively aggressive defensively got in passing Lanes became more physical found the basketball rhm Maybe wore off some of R from missing last days play but yeah thats thats what theyve done they just turned it up not even right look at defensive St everybodys moving on the basketball you may score but you had to work another excellent defensive possession but wake cannot get the rebound and the loose ball last Touch by the D early in the game wake did and would have waited for somebody to get that rebound Dam everybodys going after the basketball everybodys doing something see there you go spers the deflection in the steel deacons by the way plus 12 on the glass tonight plus 19 where it counts Reed for emphasis makes it a 21 Point wait Forest Music lead as far as all around basketball games this is probably F reach best Applause Music game lsay been relatively quiet from the edge of the W comes up short and theres the 12th rebound of the night and a baseball pass ahead for hilden I think Hunter will be out of Eligibility but he could be a quarterback with the pass like that transfer portal you final year someplace the way its going take the time H Salis gets inside of all the purple jerseys but then had it po go its been a long time since you see the transition layup James Madison rainbow nice transition three Anderson Preston bradin takes a time out with 3 51 to go we will take it they have dominated the paint Salis is going inside and scor anytime he wants and on the other side they rebounds and that nine block shots but interesting enough 7 to 21 shooting and you know we havent talked at much at all about Bryce linday one of the top scorers in the country and comes off the bench and scores thats a good defensive set for Freeman fou from behind by h smart play by Freeman to kind of draw that foul but you dont want to thats a play if your H you got just kind of Let It Go just Let it you know contest a little bit dont get that close where hes going to turn around but it is what it is so you play but youre right though the defensive side of this thing and the numbers that you just talked about thats got to make coach for so excited so guys this is the blueprint for us to win basketball CLS in the ACC have to ever since November 13th W Forest has been without Omaha beloo who the Deeks expected to be one of their key contributors as Ste Forbes earlier this afternoon how Omahas doing said hes doing good hes no longer in the cast on his foot he was riding the bike that Sho around today shooting some free throws still hasnt done anything basketball related sure would be nice if Wake could get him back by mid January so hes ready for the two game stretch here at the Joel January 21st against Carolina January 25th against Duke big two games for the de resume big two games and if you play like you played in the second half tonight then theyll be real real important other Carolina D Saturday is a big game too question about it Ricks hey before I forget about it think about oh think about the the church Abyss drop step dunk how that change the energy of the basketball game sure did you know Spillers just grabbed his 10 you think about Omaha you know you think about okay fine you give me plays like that everybody makes a contribution we help us win a game popping around Spillers with his 11th rebound Hunter Salis for three first three of the night for Hunter hes got 24 and 12 with five assists to boot Shooters are finding Rhythm and putting their hand as they say in the basket they get the elevation shots are floating its really nice thats a good shot there Luke Anderson can stroke it well you can tell it sometimes by form and finish good shot by Anderson third three of the second half for Anderson Dukes within 16 time out Liberty Mutual customized my car insurance so I saved hundreds with the money I saved W there and then the first visit from the Stanford Cardinal on acc game wake has two games this year against the cardinal Corner three Spillers rattles in and out Spillers slides like hes going down a bowling Applause Alle nice skting he got up quick I like it was cool got twool points for that got to be careful theres a wet spot in the middle of the floor for sure Lindsay bumped by HTH Applause again fourth foul on cam and a couple free throws here for Bryce Lindsay the Texas transfer you know if I was strepping moing the floor like that Id be a little afraid right now to go out there because e Reed did such a steal it from yeah thats right after Reed took like bam he was quick about it lets talk about wake Fours big picture for a moment lets talk about the nonconference marquee win against Michigan neutral sight losses to Xavier Florida Texas Sanam all really strong teams wake hasnt had a bad loss yet the concern coming into tonight was they hadnt really played well in any of their 11 games they played good enough to win against you know be a Minnesota team slog of a game they they didnt raise they right now the committee didnt have a eyebrows because of get if the shots can start falling which is a huge H maybe this team can live up to expectations picked third in the ACC preseason poll shots left take that from Hunter I mean this is this this could be the night everything is in Rhythm theres no rush on those shots just get up extend finish follow through it goes in and if its missed youre able to get the rebound this is good this is good but today you got to keep this up Anderson finally missed one rebound for Reed Hunter Salas now 27 points 12 rebounds five assists one turnover its been one of if not the best game of his demon Deacon career yeah hes had a couple of games where he scored the reports but just a total effort of what hes been able to do hes playing like the allaman tonight but everybodys made a contribution this win you know what Im saying I mean I dont leave him out but after re had a great job playing inside DJs ready to jam yeah Thompson over ERS comes up short Anderson on the glass puts it back up and in shot clock is off with 20 seconds left you got Remember You Got What 11 new players in this CH Madison team theyre still learning each other too theyre going to be aont youre going to be a tough out in Sunday an emotional day in Winston Salem as the demon Deacon Nation said goodbye to Dave Clawson fans showered in with praise in the first half and W mens basketball rolling in the second half des never LED in the first half they dominate the second and defeat James Madison 7558 its all ACC play coming up starting Saturday at Clemson all right its time to go now the exam is over its time to play I like the effort I like how they played the final 30 minutes of this basketball game this is wait fors team I think youre going to hear some things about you got to play every ball game and James Madison you you got nothing to be ashamed of youre good basketball team its going to get better and better 27 points for Hunter Salis 18 points for cam hriff 13 points for Davin Cosby and wake winon by 17 cut like more hope you have a very happy holiday season always a pleasure being
