two sevenfooters that Malcolm just talked about we are underway those are the two guys to watch tonight post and read its Boston College that starts with the ball the Eagles playing in just their second game in 22 days you take a look at the starting five clell Harris coming off a season High 29 Points he misfires to start the contest and thats going to be key in this one thats the first thing Earl Grant talked about when we spoke with him uh how his team would get into Rhythm after such a long layoff Wake Forest though coming into this game playing as good as anybody in college basketball and big reason because of Aton Reed who opens the scoring they are undefeated since Reeds return a seven game win streak which is the longest since 2009 for the Demon Deacons Zachary lines up a three and buries Applause it thats going to key number I think for Boston College in their stretch where theyve won some games theyve been over 40 from the threepoint line excellent little find that time but and a broken play by Quinton post sales tried to answer from three Off the Mark right into Post in the post where he loves it going against another sevenfooter another NBA Prospect couldnt finish on the foul I think and thats key right there Salis gets the foul and the bucket on the other end Hunter Salis you cant run your transition offense any better off of a miss right here Wake Forest to keyj they stayed home they dont double off a post and then right here ball touches the floor one time throw ahead thats a beautiful transition offense by Wake Forest and when we spoke with Steve Forbes he said the key with Boston College defending them if you can stay home manto man against Quinton post thats going to be key Tas completes the threepoint play you look at what Steve Forbes has done with Wake Forest since hes come in as head coach he brings in a scoring guard through the transer portal Alis Williams Tyree applebe now Hunter Salis backto back 20po games for Salis who is really in fine form right now pull up pop nothing but the bottom of the net for Claude L Harris but hes coming off a game against Lehigh where he had 29 Points and made Seven threes his up game one of the best in the ACC very good off the two feet that reminds me of you a shoot around well Ill tell you what I dont have the lift like that anymore but he is fun to watch and both these teams really do an excellent job spacing the floor offensively Fon Reed going right into post dangerous with his left hand goes up missed it Tapped Out Falls to Salis who triggers a three thats an airball thats a good close out that time by Boston College again wake force a team that makes eight threes a Applause game Reed showing off the range he can make it from there that time his Applause fires Prince of League Bay lost the handle Alice finds hildr who slows things down read the trailer hoopy Miller pull up hop the floater doesnt fall errl Grant wants to slow things down because in the opening three minutes this is a pace that suits Wake Forest more he said look we want to play in the 70s and that right there beautiful play by Miller and in their win against Virginia Tech Wake Forest they have 23 points off of turnovers Jay thats going to be key in this one right here can Boston pallet handle the pressure that Wake Forest is going to put on them no we asked Wake Forest head coach whats been the key to the seven straight wins he said defense a league Bay contested jumper but gets it to go and thats the area of his game Earl Grant and staff they deserve a lot of credit theyre working with him on that right there his jump shot thats a beautiful elevation under control right into Rhythm ildis hits it from Applause three and we saw cam hris working on that same exact curl play in shooter round thats way too much airspace by Boston College he is going to make them pay got to be better communication on that screen amongst The Bigs post foot on the line they rule it a two but showing off the range in front of some NBA Scouts tonight and thats really what makes him attractive again hes a sevenfooter yes he can block yes he can score down low but his ability to spread the floor with his threepoint shooting ability is going to be huge stolen away Harris up top looking for a leag bay deflected by Salis who does so well in the transition game Carr lines up the cant Applause connect post going to work right to the rim draws the foul hell be at the line when we come back well cam hilen showing off the range we got a tight one early on Wake Forest t one tight game early and already an outstanding big man back battle taking place uh we featured this in our open right here Fon Reed nice turnaround jumper over that left shoulder and then on the other end Quinton po stepping out on the perimeter uh this is going to be a fun matchup I think whoever gains the advantage in this matchup right here is going to be the team probably to win this game right now though I like what Boston College is doing Jay theyre putting post on okay the block isolating him and forcing a decision by Wake Forest do you stay single coverage or do you come double off of Applause him the post ties it at 10 take a look at these two teams their resumés in nonconference play they enter tonight both nine and three this is a huge resume win for two teams that really want to get over that hump and make the NCAA tournament absolutely and I think in particular uh in the case of Boston College you got to take care of Home Port again its so difficult these coaches talk about winning on the road in conference play but certainly you got to take care of Home Fort back door wide open and Salah slams it home and thats all set up a boopy Miller with a beautiful back door pass overplay and thats a pinpoint pass right here uh by Miller again look at the timing on this haris turns his head for a second you cannot execute a back door play any better they go right back to post hands off for Harris triple team kicks it out post to three Applause money I said it Brad Stevens uh in the building right here along with some other NBA execs thats a sevenfooter again thats going to be his bread and butter at the next level his ability to be a pick and pop guy thats very difficult to match up against when you help off of him he can step back beyond the NBA range now hes in the ACC Player of the Year conversation for good reason getting it done on defense there no rebound though Keller couldnt put home the offensive board and then Wake Forest commits the frustration foul Applause underneath and Earl Grant has designed an offense we spoke with Steve Forbes about this where they move post where theyll put him on the Block theyll put him at the high post sometimes theyll even use him to relieve pressure when teams are pressing again hes a versatile big that can do a lot of things very difficult matchup we were curious how these two teams would come out tonight because Boston College they havent played since December 21st this is just their second game in 22 days wake for us meanwhile they just played Saturday and they won 8663 to Virginia Tech but there is no rust for Boston College right now Mal and that was again the question mark coming into this one Grant said it right first thing when I asked him keys to the game he said look I dont know how my teams going to respond after this long layoff I think hes probably happy now almost 8 minutes into this game and so far so good a fourpoint lead on the back of Quinton post who swipes it away here post who scored the last nine for the Eagles getting it done on both ends a league Bay cant connect Al is trying to spin his way free Chaz Kelly commits the foul a lot of talk about Wake Forest winning streak early Malcolm but how about the Eagles the last six games finding something yeah both these teams have been playing well I think the key number though for Boston College we talked talk about it 40 from the threepoint line it just opens up the whole floor for a player like Quinton post when guys like Harris guys like Jaden Jacker knocking down threes theyve shot the ball really well from Beyond The Arc Alis draws the foul again been a difficult matchup for BC tonight Hunter Salis you mentioned the seven game win streak for the demon deons the longest since 2009 C Forbes has been rebuilding this program the last handful of Seasons this is the most talented roster hes had and hes done an outstanding job and every year it seems like he finds a Hidden Gem offensive foul cam hildr is livid patris makes the call lets see if he sold it right here again when that first PMP yeah again from that angle right there now again we got a veteran officing officiating crew B Smith Matt Potter Pat Driscoll combined five final fours theyre right there in position to make that call very physical matchup jump ball and thats just great individual defense by Keller again holding ground right here not going for the head fake and then Walling up thats great post defense comes up with the jump ball possession now for Wake Applause Music Force everything going through Salis right now for the Demon Deacons fading away missed it and interesting Jay both teams really not crashing guys on the offensive glass Zachary step back three in and out no good Mighty the offensive rebound muscles it back in and Steve Forbes and staff livid they felt like that was offensive goal tending hes still barking at the refs now from our angle couldnt tell whether or not that was still in the cylinder turnover atin College couldnt finish it on the the other end but they have held the demon Deacon scoreless over the last three minutes Hill tonight Brad Stevens president of basketball operations for the Celtics and obviously legendary Boston Globe columnist Bob Ryan many people know our colleague at ESPN and around the horn contributor and those who have it a chat pregame and its no surprise Brad Stevens is here because theres a lot of NBA Talent potential NBA Talent on the floor Wake Forest Hunter Dallas and Fon Reed but for Boston College Winston post has drawn a lot of tension from NBA Scouts this year he really has and I think youre right absolutely on the court a lot of guys are going to be playing at the next level whether its in the NBA or overseas somewhere so certainly no surprise to see Brad Stevens and also other NBA EXs at these games pretty nice for Stevens that its right at your backyard to have a player like Quinton post nice scoop to the hoop Mason Manson and Boston College on a 9 nothing run and Boston College has done a nice job in transition but thats the area right there they got to be careful uh speaking with the staff at Sho around they said we must have a really good transition defense wake for is one of the better teams pushing ahead wake make or Miss Parker Frederickson a much needed three Jaden Zachary answers on the offensive end that time they decide to post Z up and again hes got a size advantage against Music Applause Miller shot clock under Applause 10 heres Salis Frederickson Wants It Wide Open HS it again Parker Frederickson backto back threes and thats a breakdown by Boston College again a shot clock winding down theres a switch inexplicably they just leave Rickson Music alone right here though in transition Boston College mat him with the beautiful finish at left hand and then here breakdown wideopen three and thats just a too easy wake for us again a team that shoots the ball really well from the threepoint line Frederickson The Freshman from Bigsby Oklahoma and what a freshman year he is having when he was a high school senior he went to the final four and won the State Farm High School ThreePoint Shootout and Steve Forbes has recruited him to shoot threes and whats he done tonight made two in two minutes on the floor and he said hes one of the best Shooters Ive ever signed and hes a guy that as you said scored over 2100 points in high school and he is going to have a very nice career playing in this Steve forb system thats a friendly system for threepoint shooters for sure and theyre without deari Monsanto right now hes usually the top guy from three Fon Reed going to Quinton post passes out of the double team oopy Miller in attack mode fading away hits it beautiful footwork the turnaround jumper and Im putting him at the top of my all name team boy Miller Thats A big Time turnaround Applause jumper Zachary pull up pop he cant connect and a foul called on boopy Miller who tried to box out Quinton post well right here to look at this reverse pivot off one foot and thats just a great footwork into paint and again hes a guy uh another guy Steve Forbes again just uh seems like he finds guys and they just excel in his system just picked up his second foul so comes out of the game post too much on it that time and with Miller out of the game expect Salis to handle the ball primarily for Wake Forest this has been the game within the game Reed and post swiped Away by Harris Saturday afternoon right here on acc Network you dont want to miss this triple header our first one of 2024 Virginia NC State tips things off at two Eastern then its Virginia Tech at Florida State at 4 Duke at Notre Dame is the night cap at 6 love the conference play is here Malcolm it is here in full swing and got a good one tonight here heres Reed couldnt hammer it home post got in front of it BC going the other way a league Bay with a wreck attack that right there is all set up by Quinton post defense the block on Reed sets up the transition bucket and prin of League Bay with the rim rocker and Jay again look at this right here Quinton post showing off the defense and then on the other end Prince of League Bay they might need to check the rim my goodness showing off the Hops and strength thats a big time finish off of the defensive play by Quinton post twohanded thats a grown man Jam right there by Prince elik Bay and Boston College theyve got some juice tonight we didnt know how they would come out with such a long layoff but a really good Wake Forest team in their building Demon Deacons a seven game win streak and DC has been the better team so far in this first half and I think a couple of things one theyve kept Wake Forest out of transition thats key and then post has got the hot start to go along with them I think really slowing this game down and getting the ball to their best player Quinton post makes it look so easy well I think now youre wake youre going to have to go and double Steve forb said look were going to try to start the game off without doubling Quinton post I think right now theyre going to have to send somebody if not double at least try to dig and show like youre helping salz count it plus the foul Hunter sales the eagles with 11 and hes doing a little bit everything right now okay hes showing off the threepoint shooting ability thats why the NBA Scouts are here in the post check it off the thing thats really impressed me this right here his defense he came into this game leading Boston College 25 Blocks hes got two in this game put that number up to 27 hes doing it on both ends of the court and weve talked about it all first half Quinton post against Fon Reed and right now its post with 11 Reed just with two Alice completes the threepoint play fourpoint game under eight minutes left in this first half its been back and forth this is the game we expected two nine and three teams in conference play they both feel like this is a game they need to have and this is right here though J the importance of having Quinton post a team like Way Forest thats pressing manto man Quinton post is playing a point guard relieving pressure against the Applause guards shot clock down to eight Harris step back three got it claudell Harris drills it from deep and I said at the beginning hes got one of the better pullups in the ACC that right there on full display thats a step back three shot clock winding Applause Music down heres hildr in attack mode bounces it nobody home well right here again look at this step back body control shot clock winding down Harris we said it coming off a game where he put up 29 Points and made Seven threes vers Lehi that right there is a tough step back three with the shot clock winding down Wake Forest with six first half turnovers meanwhile Boston College has controlled this first half theyve made their last three shots five of their last seven every time Wake Forest gets within a one score game BC has a punch to keep this cushion little sky hook doesnt Applause fall Salis the floater Off the Mark its not a bad look by Salis just a little short on that floater he got into the lane and just unable to convert on the short floater this communication there between post and Applause Zachary Sunday afternoon right here on acc Network it is a quadruple header tips off with a terrific matchup number three against number 13 NC State at Virginia Tech the Georgia Tech app hit to follow dont miss the night cap Florida State and Clemson at BC at Syracuse loaded slate on Sunday offensive Applause foul and thats twice now Jaden Zachary again he may not be their best in terms of score but I think hes the heart and soul of this team and he sets the tone defensively thats twice now but hes been able to change the possession for Boston College with his defense and thats now seven first half turnovers for Wake Forest Steve Forbes team that comes in one of the hottest teams in all of college basketball seven straight wins for the first time since 2009 and he at Quinton post and Boston College leading by nine well Jay again that time they put him at the top of the key the other time they put him down low on the Block so theyre moving him putting him in different spots and the help is not coming for Wake force and hes just going to work the post has dominated Reed so far tonight Reed trying to answer misses it Music again post already with 13 draws the foul and Jay hes getting it done on both ends but again right here they put him at the top of the key no help and then right here defensively again him and Reed have been battling all night he holds ground and then gets a contest forces him into a tough turnaround and Brad Stevens has to be pleased with what hes seen so far from the sevenfooter Quinton post not only is he shooting the ball well but I think the defensive presence and his ability to defend really has been impressive iive in this game a 10point lead largest of the night for BC Wake Forest has fallen into another scoring drought they went 4 minutes and 20 seconds without a bucket earlier now 3 minutes without a score here Music trailing by 10 oopy Miller Off the Bench thats exactly what Wake Forest needed he had sat with two fouls thats the spark he is so tough that time change of Direction a break him down and then thats a tough floater in traffic Jaden Zachary off to mlon Ls up the three cant connect offensive rebound post Matson triggers a triple another offensive board Boston College a third opportunity here and they give it away bopy Miller swiped it pulls up from three cant hit it falls to Frederickson another opportunity for Wake Forest Music here ker one wide open and he makes Boston College pay and thats a nice change of four Wake Forest to cut this deficit to Applause Music five squeezed into Zachary a beautiful pass from post and what theyre trying to do right now with Jaden Zachary theyre just trying to post him up that time he makes a nice basket cut and thats a nice pass by Clinton Applause post Eller a deep three hes got range boopy Miller and thats on Quinton post right there hes got to be up the show on that high ball screen boopy Miller comes off clean gets a wide open look from Beyond The Arc and just like that Wake Forest back within four Zachary looking for the immediate answer perfect placement Devin mton and mlon has done really good work on the offensive and defensive glass for Boston Applause College the foul called on mcglockton reaching on car hoopy Miller bringing Wake Forest back in at two possession game with a little more than two minutes left to this for sixpoint lead with a little more than two minutes left to this first half last time these two teams saw each other Boston College won a thriller down in Winston Salem and for St Forbes he wants nothing to do with the Eagles because they have been a real thorn in Wake side each of the last two years Wake Forest has been right on the bubble at the end of the season and that bubble has been burst by Boston College well it seems like its been a tough matchup for them certainly though in this game right here I think its going to come down to the matchups in particular how wake continues to defend Quinton post when hes in the game but that guy right there I tell you Ive been so impressed with his Game Hunter Salis has been playing great for Wake Forest now the demon Deacon shooting well 50 from the floor but theyve turned it over seven times tlor is already hit one three tonight misses that one Applause short heres Jaden Zachary and off to Mighty trying to muscle it draws the foul instead thats the key word he was just trying to bulldoze his way down there again right here nice footwork spin move and then it goes up yeah it gets hit right across the face but if you take a look at the numbers right now Jay for this I think the big one that jumps out fast break points thats something Earl Grant talked about wanted to keep Wake Forest out of transition right now 5 to four in favor of wake acpm with Mark Packer and Taylor tanning bomb every weekday Monday to Friday at 4 eastern time you do not want to miss it and coming up on the halftime report plenty of good games going on around the ACC and Mark and Taylor will surely talk about it tomorrow football season is over it is all Hoops on acc PM right now blocking foul called blell Harris not happy about it thats his second foul Salis has already got 10 points in this first half talked about what hes done his last three games averaging close to 20 points per game close to 50 from the threepoint line and over 56 from the Applause floor makes the front end of the one and one you know if youre Steve Forbes if you can get this to a one possession game or closer in the final minute youll feel pretty good about this first half considering you trailed by as many as 10 absolutely again theyve withstood that initial surge of from Boston College they got a double digigit lead and youre absolutely right theyve cut this thing theyve backed down to single digits and a big reason why this guy at the line Jay so impressed with his allaround game excellent Defender but his ability to attack the paint really has been impressive and they tag Salis for the Applause foul and the pressure again thats going to be a theme were going to watch a wake Force theyre not really trapping theyre just playing hard physical full court manto man and thats something they were able to do against uh their last time out against Virginia Tech they were able to turn them over to the tune of 23 points off a turnovers not sure what theyre looking I think there might be either blood or yeah that was Andrew Carr who had to go over to the demonac sideline he was nowhere near the action so something must have happened off ball with Carr have not seen much of Donald hand Jr tonight but hes been very good Off the Bench take a look at the last four games in particular and thats been key uh in their run Boston College their bench production exposure staff has talked about Music that heres Andrew Carr hes been quiet in this first half Frederickson hes had the hot hand that rims out no Applause Music Applause good po swans it mlon couldnt squeeze it through Wake Forest in hold for one final shot in this first Applause half hild with five goes to work trying to call his own number to the hole no good Salis nearly with the follow flush Boston College of Applause Music four mton wide open three buries it Devin mlon and BC picks up where they left off and thats a great start beautiful action that time and mton only a 26 threepoint shooter coming into this one thats a wideopen three off of excellent ball movement and again the ball went left to right this time Harris draws two and then the kick back out and thats a beautiful start if youre Earl Grant and Boston College heres booby Miller he was the spark plug in the first half dumps it down low the Reed who muscles it home and thats a beautiful find by Miller again nice action both teams coming out executing at a high level on the offensive end to start this second half Miller brought much needed energy Off the Bench Wake Forest was trailing by 10 he sat for a lot of that first first half with two fouls came back in got W Florest back in the game before the break a league Bay in attack mode it doesnt Applause fall Dem and deacons entered tonight one of the hottest teams in college basketball on a seven game win streak longest streak in program history since 2009 and poopy doesnt want it to end Big Time basket and Miller puts Wake Forest in a one possession game look how quick he gets into his shot again hes Shifty but then he just gets you off balance and then raises up into his jumper that is tough to defend Zachary lost the handle but they said cam hildr was on the line when he stripped it away so it stays BC ball this fine right here again all set set up by Miller no communication on the back end for Boston College nice little lob pass by Boy Miller iller has been the Catalyst for Wake winon post who has it here has been the goto guy rejected by Reed Miller up ahead Salis acrobatic the catch and finish and Wake Forest is back within one you cannot run transition any better again Earl Grants talked about this maker miss you have to be on point when it comes to your transition defense Boston College sleeping that time they get a wide open the Demon Deacons on a six nothing run Nayer pull up pop hits it boopy Miller fires Wake Forest in front for the first time since it was 121 thats not bad de thats just another tough pullup jumper and uh he is going right at claudell here swatted out heres Harris trying to answer missed it hildr lost the handle bounced out of bounds it was off Wake Forest last and we talked about transition points and transition D being the key right here great defense by Reed and then transition offense wake one of the better transition teams in college basketball and then this right here oneonone individual play I talked about his quick release uh bopy Miller uh again one of those guys thats Shifty and then raises up Applause quick Miller has 13 and he has been the Catalyst to this Wake Forest comeback the Demon Deacons trailed by as many as 10 in that first half and now a onepoint Advantage Boston College has fallen into a thre minute scoring drout its allowed Wake Forest to go on an eight nothing run they need to get the ball I think in the hands of Quinton post let him go to work play through him post has it here one onone takes it right to Reed missed it but its tipped in and Boston College ends the scoring drought and takes back the Applause lead kick out three hildr buries it these two teams going punch for punch in the ACC and thats all set up by Hunter Salis un selfish play driple Drive kick it out and that time thats a wide openen three Wake Forest a perfect five for five in this second half and the ball movement and spacing thats been the key in this run of for Wake Forest they got a twopoint lead in Chestnut Music hill with no fees or minimums and no overdraft fees banking with cap to find guys uh that uh put up big numbers for him right here in transition beautiful pass but Ive been impressed with his pullup game again quick release just gets you off balance hes Shifty but the ability to stop on a dime and raise up or to go along with the assist game another great find for Steve Forbes and his staff yeah 13 points five assists and probably most importantly only one turnover tonight Zachary Miss it out of the timeout Wake Forest with all the momentum right now the demon deons a perfect five for five shooting in this second Applause Music half Carrs been quiet tonight scoreless mton thought that went off Carr last Music Salis puts it up and Fon Reed hammers it home and thats a beautiful play again Salis with the find and the rooll they had he set such a good screen they had to help and then the pass was on Applause point and deep three Boston College needed it he missed Demon Deacons on a 132 run over the last four minutes and notice the difference everything uh for Boston College contested jumpers wake theyre getting the ball in the paint and getting higher percentage shots Wake Forest has grabbed control of this game trailed by as many has 10 in the first half transition three and much Applause needed Donald Han Jr delivers the bench production has been pivotal during this four game win streak for the Applause Eagles and right here again uh because Reed sets that screen the help on the backside is not there and Sal again a beautiful pinpoint pass in transition no hand up and thats great confidence by Donald hand come back down after missing a three and pull up again in transition Salas left all alone hell make you Applause pay again it might not show up it wont show up in the Box sports but the screens that F and Reed is setting really are freeing up the Applause shooters and Salis now with 17 mton draws the foul on the other end how has Wake Forest changed the complexion of this game defensively and then look at the screens again theyre at right there again it might be a little thing but when you have bigs that set screens and solid screens like Reed has it freeze up guys like Miller and Salis and hes done a great job and then hes been rewarded after setting those screens and Diving hard to the post again its something that any offense that is based on spacing and motion a lot of ball player moving you have to have bigs that set solid screens and Fon Reed has done a nice job of that in this game Steve Forbes decides to take poopy Miller out with three fouls it was when he was out in the first half that Boston College went on their run to go up by 10 now trailing by Applause Music two heres hildr Dallas from the same spot missed it this time up ahead mlon right to the rack doesnt fall on the floor and a foul called on Fon Reed great Hustle by mton that is great Hustle by mton again to gather his own miss a get back up quick right here again Force shot but then get right back up on the offensive glass they got read for to dive on Saturday afternoon right here on acc Network Conference play continues with a triple head Virginia takes on NC State to tip things off at two Easter then in Tallahassee Florida State takes on Virginia Tech finally its Duke and Notre Dame in South Ben should be a great afternoon of Hoops right here on acc Network back and fourth game here in Chestnut Hill Boston College looking for the lead it was halfway down for hands they got a pretty clean look off out of bounds underneath thats a travel Jaden Zachary trying to use some defense to bring some life to Boston College here and gu right here again he uh Jaden zory uh the defense but right now Wake Forest in their pressure again theyve used Quinton post to break pressure and theyre going to use that again again this is a luxury right here to have a sevenfooter that command a point for you again that has been a big reason why Boston College has not really had an issue with the pressure of Wake Forest and with Fon Reed out of the game with three fouls you have to think Boston College has to go into post even more so now absolutely if Im Earl Grant Im telling them nobody shoots in two Quinton post gets a touch with Fon Reed on the bench D Keller whos in for re right Applause now shot clock down to seven Parker Frederickson quick release nothing but air there Steve Forbes getting creative with the minutes right now because Wake Forest did some foul trouble bopy Miller and Fon Reed who have been the two goto guys in this second half as well as Hunter salz who have certainly been the most consistent player for the Demon Deacons this season and I think Reed is the big one in particular again you have a player like Quinton post lets see what Boston College does here again with Eon Reed on the bench Im trying to run my offense if Im Boston College through Quinton post give him a touch hes got so much size against Zack Keller and yet post camped out Beyond The Arc takes the three and makes the three Clinton post well Earl Grants like I dont care where he touches it as long as he gets a touch now the question is how long does Steve forb stay with Fon Reed on the bench Salis missed it caller couldnt clean up the spill and in transition right to the rack he missed it but draws the foul wied post fire back and forth game led by two stars yeah two leading scorers for both teams respectively Hunter Salis uh this guy though right here Quinton post showing off the NBA range of both guys Jay have been impressive in this game you look at the numbers they put up the number five and six score leading scorer and the ACC have not disappointed tonight they both have been on top of their game 17 points a piece interesting weve said that Wake Forest maybe most important player has been boopy Miller tonight well since he came out of this game with his third foul Boston College on a five nothing run and wake fors 0 for four shooting the ball theyve fallen into a scoring drought of 2 minutes and 32 seconds because of Millers absence and a big reason why hes the one guy that can go along with Salis and get you a bucket when the shot clocks wind it down so right now Boston College picking up the pressure see if they can force a turnover eldr breaks the Press K kicks it out freericks in a three got it Parker Frederickson thats his third three of the night breakdown by Boston College steeve Forbes said he is the best shooter Ive signed C Forbes has been around this game a long time hes seen a lot of good Shooters this feature is bright for this young man right here you cannot leave him open thats a mental breakdown by Boston College back and forth we go in Chestnut Hill 10 lead changes tonight and no signs of slowing down two evenly matched teams both nine and three on the season this would be a big win for both programs Donald Han Jr not shy fires BC back in front and he has been huge for Boston College but thats his seventh point right now hes knocked down threes but also been aggressive attacking the basket and has six of his seven in this second half and right here again just a Attack Mode again dont settle for a jumper so much attention on Quinton post and thats a beautiful finish hes so strong again guy coming off had battled some injuries and having him back healthy in the lineup has been huge for Boston College he has a lot of confidence Donald Han Jr I mean he when he gets that ball you know his thoughts are Im going to the rack well I think the big thing is is his health again uh he starting again to get back to that 100 Mark and certainly a huge asset for Coach Grant and staff to come on Off the Bench and both teams after made shots going full core pressure in the second Music half typically thatll raise the tempo of a game which would favor Wake Forest Post open for three cant connect offensive rebound keeps it alive a league Bay cleans up The Spill the Boston College 10 offensive rebounds to five first wake for as theyve done a great job creating some Second Chance Applause opportunities Music and called for the foul there and this is just great work on the offensive glass again weve talked about the numbers offensive rebounding advantage to Boston College in this game and big reason why too Fon Reed with that foul trouble hes back in the game now of four Wake Forest Ry Miller stays on Steve forbess bench both Eden Miller with three fouls 10 minutes left in regulation Andrew Carr scoreless tonight missed Applause Music another Kelly right to the rack missed it Frederickson the trailer hot hand couldnt knock it down and thats a break for or Boston College again in transition uh you got to be communicating in that situation you cannot leave frerick that wide open Zachary this to both of these teams getting good looks just cant connect hildr hits that one and its a big three cam hildr delivers Wake Forest back in front we have had nine second half lead Applause Music changes Kelly looking for another lead change and a foul called on the rebound El leite Bay pushed off and Jay whats happening in transition Boston College right here again you have to be up if youre the big no help poor communication and then uh hris gets a wide open look thats just a simple dribble hand hand off and that should not happen if youre Boston College and booby Miller back into the game for Wake Forest Demon Deacons leading by two inside the car who draws the foul Le B giving up three or four inches in that Applause matchup and thats his fourth and theyre really trying to establish car and Boston College again if youre a prince of League Bay you cannot let him catch the ball in the post there again you got to work your way around or try to push him out and if hes catching the ball with two feet underneath the basket thats going to be a bucket hildr muscles it home Steve Forbes takes a timeout his team with the momentum right now a fourpoint lead in what has been a fun back and forth game in the ACC with no fees or minimums and no got the momentum right now transition defense that was going to be key in this game earol Grant talked to us about it poor in this last five minute stretch right here one of the better Shooters in the ACC leave him open Simple handoff no communication uh the big Prince of League Bay in this case needs to be up there hedging or talking no communication wide open three that six free points you gave Wake Forest one of the better transition teams because you didnt communicate in your transition D that needs to change in this last 835 minute stretch for Boston College Boston College had built a 10point first half lead wake for now leads by Applause four winon post whos been quiet in this second half for his Applause standards adson step back three got it Mason Manson drills it from deep and Steve Forbes not happy at all again thats a breakdown by Wake Forest uh Matson one of the better threepoint shooters for Boston College cannot give him that much airace and Wake Forest turns it over on the other end fun finish brewing in Chestnut hill now the at the break we had the hot dog fan talk and you know thats me dropping the dog youre obviously not that hungry because theres a lack of boxing out or a sense of urgency to grab that hot dog right there man we need to work on uh your blocking out ability much like Quinton post on that play I was fouled there was an over the back back to basketball where we have a terrific game onepoint game back and forth 14 lead changes nine in this second half in a game two nine and three teams both feel like they desperately need to win if they have hopes of March Madness again Quinton post relieving de Applause pressure uh when Wake Forest picks up full Applause court nadson this to poked away but Miller there to scoop it up he lost the handle it falls to Reed heres bopy Miller in attack mode draws the foul Sunday afternoon right here on acc Network you dont want to miss it noon Eastern Time a top 13 matchup NC State at Virginia Tech in womens basketball gets a quadruple header started that is going to be a great day of Hoops right here on acc Network the night cap Boston College at at number 25 Syracuse poopy Miller at the line for one and Applause one makes the front end now how important has bopy Miller been for Steve Forbes tonight great and I think uh his ability to make free throws going to be key uh to close out this game right now Wake Forest in the bonus and he is so quick so Shifty I have a feeling hes going to have some opportunities to get to the free throw line again though wa Force after the make picking up full Applause court ildr holding his face as he hustles back at transition defense feed to post whos fouled and again its been a physical game all along right here yeah he tried to again at that angle theyve been banging around all game both teams physical wellplayed game in bopy Miller has committed his fourth foul has to come out of this game with more than seven minutes left in regulation that is a big deal for a Wake Forest team that has leaned on Millers energy tonight on the road youre absolutely right the way hes controlled the tempo and pace of this game but when hes in there too important for him to pick up that foul and you look at at Miller on the court plus 10 when hes out of the game Wake Forest a minus 8 they need him on the Applause court the Demon Deacons clinging to a onepoint lead seven minutes left in this ACC battle Salis back door slams it home Hunter Salis a rim rocker and thats twice now in this game hunter Salis theyre overplaying him he makes another beautiful back door cut and what a find pass on point and he almost took off the rim again mcglockton trying to answer and he does count it plus the foul my goodness both these teams playing at a high level Zachary beautiful find m glockton degree of difficulty off the chart with that finish and then on the other end a beautiful back door cut and rim rocker as you said thats a beautiful play by Hunter Salis all set up though by their spacing the glockton nine points in this second half missed the foul shot there would have tied it at Applause 66 not much to se seate these two teams theyve come in with nine and three records respective impressive winning streaks only one can keep that winning streak alive inside Fon Reed the hoop and the harm what an answer by Reed inside and thats how youre supposed to seal if youre a big be big uh come across the lane and own the paint watch him seal the smaller player thats two guards on him and one thats a beautiful find and set play by Wake Forest and Reed who has struggled tonight going up against Quinton post that time didnt have post on him and he capitalizes and again because he sets good screens a Boston College that time Im not sure why they switched put a guard on him and he did exactly what hes supposed to do Dive Right Down to the Applause post Madson on the Move couldnt finish it Applause ildr the floater Perfect Touch and Wake Forest extends the lead to six and they got Boston College so spread out right now uh because theyre afraid of the threepoint shooting again theyre opening up some driving Lanes if Im Boston College again you to settle down 526 to go no need to set uh shoot a quick three run your offense and then get a high percentage look deep three off the mark and a foul called on the rebound itll stay Boston College ball well look at the spacing of Wake Forest right here again excellent spacing and then theyre opening up driving lanes for their guards and wings thats a tough Runner by hildr but again its all set up because theyre running their offense and then theyre getting good spacing on their half court sets and thats four fouls on Andrew Carr so the foul trouble continues for the Demon Deacons bopy Miller four fouls Carr four fouls epon Reed has three Steve Forbes has done a nice job of really managing this game with the foul trouble again work guys in and out but certainly to close this game out theyre going to need bopy Miller on the Applause floor ildr has had a hot hand in this second half 10 of his 14 have come in the second half Applause Alis all the way to the rim missed it Reed there to clean up the spill oh he has been impressive in this last five to six minute stretch he has been huge on both ends for Wake Applause Forest Post in attack mode cant connect tipped away it will stay Boston College ball trailing by Music six heres post shot clock down to two Harris has to heave and he missed it a broken possession for Boston College and wakes out some good defens of possessions that might have been their best right there they gave Boston College nothing uh in a form of dribble drives and then they forced a deep contested three with the shot clock winding down four minutes remaining in regulation Applause this game has been back and forth all night long but Wake Forest has their largest lead of the night Applause here whistle before the made basket by Reed on the floor the Demon Deacons have made six of their last seven they lead by six with 349 Music left Auto Owners insures your car because sometimes Fon Reed a double double tonight and Malcolm a lot of that production has come in this second half well this is the reason why hes such a big pickup for Steve Forbes and Wake Forest the Gonzaga transfer he has been huge in the second half nine points six rebounds but I think the biggest thing his presence uh he gives them something that Steve Forbes and them have not had in his era theyve always had some really good guards Alis Williams Jake laravia they had some good guards and wings but Reed gives them a post presence and a guy that can get it done for you on both ends of the Court uh he has been huge for Bost for Wake course in this second half Reed missed the first seven games of this season waiting on the NCAA to approve his transfer waiver from Gonzaga since he has come into the lineup Wake Forest is undefeated in fact theyve won each game by 10 or more a seven game win streak that was put to the test tonight here in Chestnut Hill Boston College led by as many as 10 now they Trail by eight they need this three desperately Harris missfires kept in by Reed great Hustle by Fon Reed and hildr finish es coast to coast and Wake Forest leads by 10 uh he is one of the more difficult shot makers a cam HRI in particular in transition or when hes attacking my goodness thats a difficult Euro in traffic Wake Forest is shooting 65 in this second half Harris desperately needed that and gets it 3 minutes to go BC trailing by seven Applause Salis through the back door again that time R well by Boston College and they said it went off Salis last so its BC ball and Reed again with the save and then in transition look at this Euro thats beautiful right there by cam hildr but I think a key substitution right now boy Miller back into the game 242 to go sevenpoint lead certainly he cannot pick up his fifth foul again it looks like if they run some clock Boston College is going to have to be forced to Applause foul DC had missed their last six shots before that Harris make Harris left wide open now backto back makes for Harris in BC only down by five and inexplicably again they leave a cwell Harris again a breakdown by Wake Forest heres bopy Miller playing with four fouls shot clock down to seven Miller and now hildr step back three missed it under two minutes left Boston College has life Harris count it plus the foul Claud Dale Harris just when you want to say thats a bad shot not so fast cladwell Harris almost from the logo and one fourpoint play and my goodness he has caught fire this is a guy coming off a 29point performance against Lei where he made seven threes and that one right there contested and deep Claude Al Harris on an individual eight nothing run over the last minute and 11 he has singlehandedly brought BC back into this game Wake Forest clinging to a twopoint lead Miller in attack mode so trusty poopy Miller delivers Im going to tell you right now Kevin bopy Miller his midrange game is lethal Shifty and then his ability to break you down off the bounce and then raise up some of the best Ive seen all year my goodness we got ourselves a ball game wake still up four what a fun back and forth game in the ACC Malcolm hucke J alter with you minute 31 remaining boy Miller the Difference Maker how are you going to stop this right here Im changing directions and then Im raising up on you uh that has been uh really the one area Boston College has had no answer for uh boy Millers ability to break you down off the bounce and then raise up DC down the stretch has leaned on claudell Harris hes got the last eight points for the Eagles has it here Harris off to post qunon post on the drive and a foul called Fon Reed cant believe it and its a smart play again if youre Boston College you dont need a three again theres over a minute left in the game thats a heads up play uh by Quinton post again if a three comes off a dribble Drive kick out or a pin down where gu open thats fine minute seven left in the game youre only down four certainly do not need to shoot contested threes although by the way claudell haris has been shooting them it might not be a bad strategy well think about this Boston College trailing by 10 under 3 minutes to go youre thinking this one has gotten away for them and then claudell Harris with three contested shots makes them all and Steve Forbes and Wake Forest having to earn every minute of this potential win and thats simply what a lot of teams uh it comes down to your Playmakers at the end of game who is going to be able to go out and get you a bucket forget about running plays manto man uh can you match up against my guy one possession game cam hildr missed the layup Harris rips it Applause away Harris the hot hand pull a pop got it claw Dell Harris has taken over well his midrange game we talked about bopy Miller claudell Harriss raise up game right back at you my goodness 10 seconds separating the shot clock from the game clock Wake Forest clinging to a onepoint lead heres poopy Miller in attack mode kick out car for three its good thats why you have boopy Miller back in the game and he is so key that is all said up by Kevin poopy Miller driple Drive kick it out for a wideopen three wait up Music four I loved everything that I heard about chime I just didnt know how it would work tonight until this made three to put the Demon Deacons up four dribble penetration kills you in that situation right there again thats an overh heelp but what do you do with uh Kevin bopy Miller creating havit with his ability to get into the lane now again you cant leave a guy that wide open thats a breakdown but its all set up because of boopy Millers AB ability to get into the paint and this has been uh the story of the second half Miller shift get into the paint draw three Defenders and you cant be any more wide open than that right there this game has been back and forth nine lead changes in this second half Steve Forbes has managed this game masterfully foul trouble for his team and yet they have found a way to stay in front 117 left on the clock DC with the ball trailing by four stolen away hildr that should seal it for Wake Forest and cam hildr again heads up play come up with the steal and it has been a complete team of performance everybody has TI in bopy Miller Reed uh Hunter Salis Steve Forbes has got to be pleased with how his team gutted out a performance
