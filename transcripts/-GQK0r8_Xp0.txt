for coach Brownell Lee Cassell AJ Desai Adam Flor are officials and we are underway Clemson controls the tip in the home white North Alabama in the road BLACK and immediately picked off on the entry pass Here comes Canon Jefferson running the point for North Alabama This is a big lineup on the floor for Clemson with three guys over 610 cheering And for North Alabama while they dont have that type of size they do have a handful of guys between 66 and 68 as that three goes down for Kevin Dovichic One of the strengths of Clemson early is that they have eight guys that average between 6 and 12 points So when Brad Brownell says its by team and by committee thats exactly what its been early on A little bit of a change in the starting lineup tonight for Brad Brownell Buckner in Welling in And coming off the bench tonight will be Porter and Godfrey I think one of the numbers you look for are points in the paint for Clemson with that size and with their post up ability but also all three bigs can shoot the three Dante Bakis preseason allconerence player one of two on the roster Dovich Davidson tapped it Welling corrals So two possessions for North Alabama and Clemson doubles the block both times So you know the double team is coming Theres Dylan Hunter the lone returner for Clemson this year who had any playing experience last season as Buckner rims out a three That would make him one for 13 And Id rather see him make that three out of off a a play off the two feet in a paint or a kick out from the perimeter to the perimeter Alice Howell off the back iron Rebound Wen Very good skilled bigs for Brad Brown Now thats a nice effort down low by Welling last years whack defensive player of the year at Utah Valley Well you mentioned it earlier today to me at shootaround You cant remember a time under Brad Brownells tenure that Clemson has had this many skilled bigs Hes always had good skilled bigs right from PJ Hall to cheering Chase Hunter up at the point who they had played with them for six years was his point guard who understood how to get the ball inside But uh these three guys can really shoot it and so that changes the space on the floor with some pick and pop action The Kovich with a chance at an and one This is a very strong identity of North Alabama It is getting to the free throw line driving it to the paint And one of the ways they can neutralize some of the size for Clemson is using their speed on the perimeter to try to get Clemson in some closeouts just like that so they can go off the bounce That was the one thing that Brad Brownell pointed to in the loss to Georgetown All the fouls particularly in the second half Georgetown cheering was plus 11 in free throw attempts in DC on Saturday Well when you win 27 games last year and you win 18 in the ACC youre doing something really right with your habits And thats where Clemson was last year And thats where you expect them to be again this year Pick seventh in the league applause and cheering and a very improved ACC Ive yet to see the leading scoreer Cornelius Williams touch the ball Here he is on the low block Doubled immediately Dovich and the rebound Godfrey back at Clemson after a year at Georgia Porter will get two shots Porter just puts it in another gear in transition And when you see the defender backpedaling you go right at their hip And thats exactly what he did to get to the line only shooter Well this North Alabama team returns 10 players from last year However only one of them started That was Williams Bakas was their sixth man and hes off the mark with a wild spinner So they too like Clemson Still trying to figure themselves out a little bit Wall a three applause Welcome those of you joining us on ACC Network after a thriller in Raleigh NC State with a win over VCU Matt Schumaga the Hall of Famer Debbie Antelli with you Clemson back home after a loss to Georgetown and taking on a stout North Alabama team Debbie who was picked to win their league this year This is a North Alabama team that is good off the bounce that likes to get to the free throw line will look to attack closeouts and a really good offensive rebounding team And Clemson has been pounding it in the paint early cheering doing a nice job of establishing their front line RJ Godfrey back after a season at Georgia was part of their Elite 8 run at Clemson two years ago coming off the bench cheering Back door feed to Jefferson Theres Bacus one of two preseason allconerence players for North Alabama Wallen the rebound Porter a transfer with the ball number one in white Very high volume scorer for Middle Tennessee but also good distributor And Zack Foster his fifth made three of the season Fourstar freshman out of the Atlanta area You got high hopes for him I mean he is an athletic long perimeter player Come on Tigers Clemson Tigers have hit five out of the last seven shots Largest lead of the game at eight Foster tag with a foul and we will take the break with him back from Little John Coliseum after this getting the basketball outleted up the floor so they can quickly get into their transition Hes got depth Hes got talent And this is by committee and he continues to preach that about his team Hes got eight guys that average between 12 and six points So theyve got some balance Theyve got some versatility and theyve got some interchangeable size inside out Most roster turnover in his 16 season tenure at Clemson Meanwhile North Alabama going to the bench for the first time tonight Heres Washington cheering The Kovich has got to go Two on the timer Hit his first three Hes 0 for three since Here comes Foster Spin cycle What a feed Thompson rejected on a beautiful block by Graham Howard cheering I can see my reflection Not a great threepoint shooting team Debbie and yet theyve launched a handful early You got to play inside out force Clemson into some closeouts and then try to drive it This is a very good team free throw ratewise that gets to the line about 14 of their possessions Porter fouled and the bucket and he is headed back to the free throw line Justin Porter is physically strong and knows how to use his leverage to the bucket You cant knock him off his line Look at the focus and the concentration on the finish and hes got that explosive first step as well Allconference USA last year led Middle Tennessee State in minutes scoring and threepoint field goals But tonight hes been thinking one thing and thats get downhill Cornelius Williams their leading scoreer averaging a double double has yet to take a shot attempt tonight cheering Wheres number two in black The coach cheats rejected by Thompson Shot clock did not reset Two to go Bakus the offensive rebound Oh nice pee Beautifully done There is Williams right on Q And thats his shot chart 66 in the paint He has not taken a shot outside the paint all season Williams Godfrey meanwhile three for three and all of his shots have come right around the rim Yeah Clemson taking advantage of their size their depth on their front line and theyre getting points in the paint quite easily against this North Alabama defense Theyve got 14 of their 19 in the paint Late in the timer again catch and shoot Bacas theyre now one for eight from three Bacas off the offensive rebound lays it in Thats backtoback baskets off their offensive rebounding Thats part of their identity as well Clemson doing a good job defending the first shot They got to defend the glass Dylan Hunter tries a three Tapped around to Thompson Godfrey wide open lane in a twohand jam RJ Godfrey 230 lbs Looks like one muscle out there Thats called get out of the way Already eight points for Godfrey who did not start tonight Part of a little starting five shake up by Brad Brownell but he got him into the game quickly and he has delivered Well he doesnt want RJ in early foul trouble Porter had it stripped by Tank Washington 10 years overall as a head coach Most wins in program history Yes And hes an excellent teacher and I Im one that around the ACC for as long as Ive been around on the mens side as well as the womens You run into just good people and good dudes And that would be how I define Brad Brown now And he is an excellent teacher And I think thats one of the greatest compliments you actually can give a coach Well he does come from a basketball playing state something you know a whole lot about D3 at the Paul from Southern Indiana You know he was a shooter Oh yeah he got him up just like North Alabamas been doing in this game And they are now one for 10 from downtown 10 of their 17 shots are threes And that has not been their game this year When theyve been successful theyve been getting downhill and getting to the free throw line Well Clemson is doing a really good job of making them play outside the paint Theyre forcing those shots And right now Clemsons dictating those shots for North Alabama Oh great zip That was rejected underneath Good hustle And now North Alabama on the break Jefferson coughed it up Three on two Buckner with a full head of steam Backto back hustle plays by Dallas Howell The dive on the floor to keep possession and then he saves it off a Clemson player on the baseline Well Tony Puhol is no stranger to upsets handful of years ago they beat their first SEC program ever going on the road and taking down Old Miss That was in December of 2022 Had Mississippi State on the ropes in their opener ninepoint lead at the under 16 timeout cheering Good D by Clemson Again these are the kind of habits that coach Brownell is looking for right Force a tough two Everything is contested right now by Clemsons defense Heres a three from Thomas cheering Knocks it in 69 freshman long and athletic Another fourstar brought in by Brad Brownell I think hes going to get some significant minutes Like this freshman class for coach Brownell is excellent Jefferson through the bump floats it in Playing in a bigger role this season after hes come off the bench each of the last two years That seems to be a theme for Tony Puhols team this year Guys stepping up into bigger roles Buckner short Welling fighting for the rebound And its on the floor against North Alabama Jamal Allbritain His first stepping catch Catch and shoot Beautifully done Good footwork Feet under his shoulders Thats just his third triple of the season Catch and shoot Porter Thats a shot theyd like seeing him take though Well hes coming off some pin down action and and hes got excellent footwork He was a volume shooter and scorer last year at Middle Tennessee Deep three Jefferson No Davidson fighting for the rebound And Clemson really doing a good job protecting inside out Foster a three Got it cheering His second Tigers now three for nine from distance cheering off all Britain and an over and back Well give it back to Clemson when we return All Tigers right now in the first half Big picture I mean its more than just uh ball screen offense and pick and roll defense you know Its the its the whole package Sent a couple of those guys on that screen to the NBA still playing in the league right now PJ Hall of course Tyson Hunter after the offensive rebound Catch and shoot Porter off the mark Well I just look at the way he develops point guards as well I mean right now Ace Buckner and Dylan Hunter combined 5 to one assist turnover ratio in the early part of the season Theyve made really good decisions cheering Now turnovers have been an issue this year for North Alabama Thats their fourth of the first half They have a negative assist to turnover ratio so far They were minus three coming into the game on the season and theyre not shooting the three well and theyre not in any sort of rhythm And part of that is because coach Puhol has been playing his starters over 30 minutes He told us he had to get the other guys in Theyre showing a 131 here here when he gets some of his starters back in trying to get you know build habits as well with his team to get ready for their conference Its 131s a good change defensively here Good float by Godfrey off the mark Welling but the look was there The other thing is because they havent been able to get stops Clemsons only missed nine shots so far in the game they havent been able to get anything easy in transition either Theyre forced to play against a set defense by Clemson which is very good Bod zips it inside Bach has had it blocked by Welling Heres Foster through contact Thomas lines up a triple Backto back triples for the freshman Hes on a mini 6o run by himself Meanwhile a threeminut scoring drought for the Lions Good back door feed Patton lays it in with a reverse Yeah Pattons got a different speed about him Hes got some quickness Scored over 1700 points in high school A little heat check there by Thomas Godfrey to Foster And now Clemson finding its stroke from beyond the arc I think this is the balance on offense that Brad Romeell was talking about and it starts with their rim protection inside with their size As you bring it in the paint you better play off two feet and be ready to make a play If you over penetrate theyve got shot blockers at the rim and it leads to transition going the other way Aron King to do they wave it off Foul on the floor I think thats what North Alabama needs to do to get back in this is theyve got to look to drive it hard try to play in the gaps try to draw some help kick and then play out against a closeout Attack or close out Heres cheering Cornelius Williams averaging a double double Led the Ace Sun with 11 double doubles last year Still just one shot attempt Hes not a threat outside the paint All his scoring comes inside like that Thats where hes a threat on the glass with his length Foster Oh yeah money coast to coast and lays it off to Carter Welling Timeout called because of poor transition defense by North Alabama What a drop off at the rim Clemson Brad Brownell talked about it He feels like on the whole this season Debbie the ACC is going to be much better from top to bottom I dont think theres any question theyve already shown it North Carolina has beaten Kansas Theres been some other really good nonconference wins NC State with a big win over VCU You know Kansas is going to play Duke and NC State later on in the season So theres plenty of opportunities for the ACC And then of course the ACC SEC challenge looming and everybody in the ACC feeling some type of way after the way it all went down last year Opportunity to regain some respect Wallen wide open Boy Foster is fun in the open court with a basketball And you can just tell by the coaching staffs reaction to that three by North Alabama that that is not anywhere near the game plan nor anything that they worked on today in shootound They are 1 for12 from distance Foul on North Alabama And theyve only been to the free throw line one time Thats good defense by Clemson Look at the hustle by Buckner A dogged competitor like his father Greg Buckner whose jersey hangs in the rafters here at Little John Coliseum Greg Buckner assistant coach with the Milwaukee Bucks right now You can tell hes a coachs kid Saturday morning 10 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be live from Atlanta for a massive top 25 showdown in college football Not just because of the ACC championship race but because of the playoff implications for Georgia Tech They have to win that game against Pit to stay in the hunt And of course the next top 25 CFP revealed tomorrow night on ESPN Its a great time of year for sports isnt it Everythings going on right now Good football good hoops Cornelius Williams still just two shot attempts King bumped floated no good Wallen with a rebound Been a lot of one and done tonight for North Alabama Oh good seal And a foul on King his second and the fifth on the team So much versatility with the bigs for Clemson with their pick and pop ability The duck in ability right here of Nick Davidson drawing a foul They lost so much down low from last year Ian Shefflin of course Victor Lockin Wiggins Dallas Howell catch and shoot Thats a three He should be shooting Hes the one threepoint threat for them that can make threes That is the first made three by North Alabama since the opening attempt of the game Hes a 43 threepoint shooter He made three in the first half against ETSU That was their last game with range The lefty last year Dallas Howell only played in three games because he tore his ACL and seven months later hes in summer workouts and rehab one of the elder statesmen on the floor tonight along with Dylan Hunter who left it short there Tap out Buckner So much newness for these two teams Nice to have two vets And you could throw RJ Godfrey into the mix there as well because while he is technically a transfer hes been here before Two years already under Brad Brownell including a trip to the Elite Eight Sometimes you dont know how good you got it right I mean it certainly RJ had a great experience here at Clemson Went helped take a team to an Elite 8 spent a year at Georgia went to the NCAA tournament Now hes back Considers Brad Brownell like a father figure to him Theres a player down for North Alabama and it is their leading scorer and rebounder Cornelius Williams who started gripping his ankle the minute he hit the hardwood Yeah thats that doesnt look like that feels good Now Cornelius Williams Tony Puhol told us had every opportunity to leave in the offseason with the season he had last year An allconerence player a guy who could be a conference player of the year type this season but because of the success he had there last year the culture under Tony Puhol it was actually Cornelius Williamss mother who convinced him to stay in Florence Alabama Youre not going anywhere son Youre staying here with Coach Puhol Hes continues to develop him He led the league in rebounding last year Hes long and athletic Hes going to have a good season Lets hope that that uh ankle is not too bad Hopefully just a quick tape job and hell be ready to go We will keep you a breast of his status as the game unfolds 90 seconds left in the first half under 10 to shoot Hunter knifing rejected by Al Britain like climbing the ladder there with that length off the bench Al Britain does a great job of timing this Dylans probably wishing he had dunked that down on Saturday I think they have played a terrific game plan defensively They protected inside out They limited the touches of Cornelius Williams They started doubling the block to begin the game and then they move the ball well on the offensive end Those are all great qualities of a Brad Brownell team as they splash in another triple Wow what a shot by Wallen whos been their best threepoint shooter so far this year Was 0 for two tonight until that bomb I mean help and recover high hands protecting inside out cheering Bakus thats a tough two Wrong take He was their sixth man last year and along with Cornelius Williams one of two preseason allconerence players for North Alabama 20point game Less than 60 seconds to go in the opening half 131 again by North Alabama Played a couple of possessions of this early Open three Buckner got it cheering They have been red hot tonight from distance Their seventh made three cheering and shooting over 40 from downtown Howell Shot clock turned off Final 12 seconds of the opening half I love how quickly they get up the floor into their transition offense Look for a quick hitter Quick one is not run your stuff Hunter with two Step back three And the first half comes to a close with Clemson shooting nearly 50 Controlled the glass controlled the tempo Cornelius Williams not out on the floor nor is he on the bench at the moment went down with that ankle late in the first half We will keep you posted if he returns Carter Welling had his pocket picked Heres Dovichic in a flash Right hand wont go and the tap back is good by Albrittain whos been excellent tonight off the bench really has not played much so far this season averaging three minutes and three games played as Buckners good off the window They go dribble drive offense that possession and Buckner going right is highly efficient much more efficient than going left in the midrange Efficiency was the name of the game in the first half for Clemson 50 from the floor almost 40 from three and they forced a lot of one and dones on the defensive end Well coming into the game Buckner was four for four on the right side of the floor in his midrange game and 11 for 14 at the rim Little dribble handoff action He turns a corner Welling doing a nice job Excuse Welling clearing out a little space inside Brad Brownell told us that sometimes Ace Buckners a little too eager but youd rather have a guy that you have to slow down than somebody you have to convince to speed up Hes just wants to be on the floor that badly after watching as a student of the game last year The Kovichies good from distance and hes in double figures with 10 Godfrey a three of energy and execution and if youre just playing to the scoreboard that is not going to be good enough for Brad Brownell up 20 and he had fire in his eyes so he knows whats coming in league play these guys Oh three of their four games played this year have been victories by 20 plus points as Howell hits a three his second They had that lone road test over the weekend against Georgetown It was a game in which they led by three at the half Back and forth affair in the second half but Brad Brownell was displeased with the defensive effort over the final 20 minutes of that game Well they fouled too muchized right They fouled too much and they allowed Georgetown to the line and KJ Lewis himself shot 14 free throws The Kovich No tracked down by Buckner You dont want to give a team like North Alabama any momentum or energy They are picked to win their league You know theyre talented You know theyre well coached and well prepared Welling up against Brockus Fouled by Dovichic I mean you have to call displacement at some point When you put two hands on a guy and push him that should be a foul even in the post when youre back to the basket Thats his first team Welling coming off 14 points five boards three assists two blocks a steal and a partridge in a pair tree against Georgetown on Saturday Meanwhile this Wednesday night our womens basketball double header is a very interesting one Instate showdown NC State music and Coastal Then Louisville hosts Morehead State Louisville of course you saw yesterday Debbie right here at Little John Coliseum picked up a nice win against Clemson Jeff Walls 489 wins at the University of Louisville Hed been doing it a long time Yeah hes good And you know what Sean Poppy the womens coach here is getting it going as well Youre not going to be sleeping on Clemson I can tell you that They can shoot it and they can play with great balance Already a better start shooting from distance this half than last half for North Alabama Theyve cut it to 15 Welling fouled and hes going back to the line That time it was all Britain his second Let me say NC State on the womens side has played um incredibly tough schedule early Tennessee Southern Cal and TCU all ranked teams Three of those could very well be in the NCA Yeah Westmore is a Hall of Famer Hes going to be a Hall of Famer Theyre going to be fine applause for the title number one quarter number Lets see if Brad B picks up a little fullcourt pressure here cuz uh you want to keep some energy and momentum with your team Yeah theyre going to pick up fullcourt manto man I like it Theyve been outscored 11 to five over the opening three and a half minutes of the second half Lot of winners on this North Alabama roster Not just the guys who are back from last year who won a regular season championship but everybody knew that Tony Puhol brought in either won a state championship in high school or a conference championship at their previous school be at the Jo level or someone else Its the DNA that hes created in his culture in Florence Alabama Well as you mentioned earlier they were just one a few possessions short of winning the ASON tournament last year which would have put them in the NCAA They did go and play in the NIT which was their first appearance and hes transitioned them from D2 to D1 So thats not easy uh an easy process either Under 10 to shoot here Howell jarded loose Foster with five deep three Lan Wallen with a rebound Roll replace Porter scrappy wins it back 15 to shoot Godfrey draws a foul Three straight trips to the foul line for Clemson Godfrey will get two when we return I think uh its what I said earlier about the total package like its basketball its pick and roll its ball screen coverage its all that but theres much more to it Sometimes in the landscape of where we are in college sports we forget about that part Its still important These are still young men trying to figure out what theyre going to do with the rest of their lives And its not Polyiana to say that Its really important If you have a young man thats this age you know what Im talking about 12 points five boards two assists for Godfrey Brad Brownell a relationships first coach And you hear that from everybody former players current players coaches around the league and beyond who know his program And I think if youre reading between the lines and that quote by RJ Godfrey thats really what hes getting at talking about the philosophies of life and how he may have taken that for granted his first two years on campus Not this year Six to shoot for North Alabama here Still without Cornelius Williams Thats blocked by Godfrey Here comes Porter Pitch back Foster Porter knifing and draws a foul Being so good at attacking in transition Right The lane opens up and he drives it hard to get to the rim Clemson only shot four for five from the free throw line in the first half Theyve already been there more in the first five minutes of this second half Maybe that was a point of emphasis for Bradell at the halftime break There is Cornelius Williams wearing street clothes and regular sneakers Dont expect to see him at all the rest of the night Had four points four boards their leading scorer and rebounder And you know what Matt I love that hes sitting up there with the coaches I mean at this point in the game sit with the coaches continue the IQ process of learning understand the value that you have but why youre important on the floor as well through the coachs eyes Again this team picked to win the Atlantic Sun Conference won the regular season last year just two years after becoming a fully eligible division one program You talked about Tony Puhol sort of ushering this team into the division one era and in very short order has made them a perennial favorite in that conference Yeah we had a great conversation with them this morning at shootound What a dedicated servant to the game I mean incredibly passionate Grew up in the Miami area Talking about Shaky Rodriguez and all the wonderful guys through that coaching tree I think this young man is going to start getting more playing time Cortez Graham Howard the 65 freshman Hes a true point guard with size Now we talked about Tony Puhol recruiting winners Certainly Graham Howard fits that as Porter launches a three and knocks it in Some fullcourt pressure here from Clemson Dovichic spins draws contact of the shooting variety It will go against the freshman Chase Thompson music Check that It went against Butter Johnson Porter with the three which has fallen for Clemson all night tonight They have been uber efficient from the floor Would have loved to have seen a couple more of these threes go down Saturday It would have helped Capital One Arena screaming cheering The go team is big Good ball movement They got three sides and they get the dunk Thats the way you execute late Take it late into the clock applause Again the balance for Clemson Its not going to be one guy Its going to be by committee keeping that 20point lead here in the second half Godfrey now up to 14 on six of seven from the floor Theyve defended exceptionally well tonight holding UNA under 40 from the floor Theres a foul One of the other habits is assisted basket 61 coming into the game They get a couple of sides They get roll replace They get p baseline penetration They get middle penetration and a drop off for a dunk Doesnt get any better than that Thats going to be one on film tomorrow that Coach Brownell is going to love showing his team Thats one thing theyve been very good at so far in the season albeit just five games in sharing the basketball averaging over 17 assists per game And you talked about scoring by committee which hasnt necessarily been their mo over the last few years Theyve had very established goto scorers They didnt have anybody named in the preseason all ACC team No they did not Foster rebound Butter Johnson the UAB transfer almost had it picked Back out to Porter 15 to shoot Porter floater short and the rebound coraled by Kadar Bod King a fade away Thats a tough shot Good defense Better offense Father Daryl King played at Kansas State the ball Oh my goodness Im telling you he can play How about that shot This young man has a lot of skill to unlock at Clemson He can shoot it He can initiate on the offensive end He can keep the ball in front Just when you get in a rhythm you move the ball you get good ball movement you got to read the D and just stay with it That early timeout definitely uh helped Clemson change their body language Brad Brownell is basically on the floor right now Still coaching hard Up 20 two to shoot And hell like that defensive possession A shot clock violation Its been all Tigers tonight for Clemson 18 15 here in the second And thats why you see Brad Brownell continuing to emphasize the things that are important for not just finishing off the game here but he sees the bigger vision about whats coming for them with the remainder of their schedule including West Virginia next in the Charleston Classic and then of course the 18 game ACC schedule the remainder of their nonconference slate is among the toughest certainly in this conference and maybe nationally Were talking BYU Alabama You mentioned West Virginia Theyll also have the winner of either Georgia or Xavier in that tournament And these are some big games coming up down the road for Brad Brownells team that frankly felt like they left a little to be desired in the second half against Georgetown I mean that feels like an NCAA tournament schedule Uh four out of the five of those Um look the last five years Brad Brownell 16 wins 17 23 24 27 The last five years every year theyve gotten a little bit better Thats impressive They are coming off the winningest threeyear period in program history In many respects this has been the golden era of Clemson mens basketball And the man at the center of it all has been Brad Brownell And since the 201718 season they are fourth in the ACC in wins behind blueb blood programs Heres Dylan Hunter Buckner with 10 Davidson a three Offensive rebounds piling up in the second half for Clemson Inside feed Davidson fouled on the entry pass and itll stay here Much better post feed right there Nice job of getting shape shaped up inside by Davidson The other thing Brad Brownells teams have done is exceed preseason polls And his counterpart tonight Tony Puhol told us something funny about preseason polls Debbie Anteneelli you want to know what he said Yeah tell me I know what he said He said If you want to know what polls are good for just ask a dog I tend to agree particularly in todays era of college basketball where theres so many new players transfers freshman you name it How on earth can you even pick one through 18 I really dont know I dont think you should pick one through 18 I think you should pick the top five that you think are going to be the best And part of the reason why UNA is picked to win the preseason is because they got 10 guys back from last year Where do you hear of that anymoreic D1 roster right Exactly Thats a credit to Tony P Yes it is That speaks directly to the character cuz he told us its not about NIL They dont have any money Its about relationships and the good stuff that still remains a very important part of college hoops and why we even play First points tonight for Dylan Hunter King open three hits from the top of the key and still North Alabama leading the second half scoring Plus four against the Tigers since the halftime break They made two threes in the first half Theyve made five here in the second Bod left hand finishes Well you knew Tony Tony Puhs team would come in here and and compete and fight And so did Brad Brownell Hes calling another timeout Thats two timeouts that hes had been forced to call because his team is not in rhythm and not executing on the same page Kennedy Dixon what an incredible ambassador for the game What a great ambassador for Clemson I never heard anyone ever say a negative thing about Barbara And to put into context what she did as a player scoring over 3100 points nobody on the mens side in the ACC has ever scored 3000 points The leading scoreer in the history of the ACC is Tyler Hanssbro at North Carolina 2872 points And I will add that our great friend and colleague Randolph Childris is on this list at number 18 He scored 2200 points at Wake Forest in his career So it just puts it in context Theres been a lot of great players on the womens side in the ACC And its long overdue and uh longtime basketball coach and the most successful coach on the womens side here Jim Davis Could not be more pleased and thrilled for Barbara and her family She will be recognized postumously in June in Knoxville Got to her playing career Spent 31 years on campus here at Clemson in the athletic department in various roles Patton shuffle pass Boy that was nifty Thread the needle to tank Washington Its not just getting inside the Clemson defense Its the cut behind the defense into his vision Double on RJ Godfrey This is out of the Brad Brownell timeout Porter rims out a three Theyve been outscored 279 in the second half with North Alabama shooting above 50 In the midst of a 70 run of the Lions Im sure there was something about toughness grip competitiveness discussed in that last time out Please shut up Godfrey blocked and last touch by Tank Washington Watch Brillan Patton shifty gets the shift the the switch Davidson having a hard time keeping him in front And this is just a great cut on the backside of the defense by Tank Washington You would never know that North Alabama is down 6449 with the way theyre playing and the way Tony Poohole continues to encourage competitiveness with 6 minutes and change left in this half And there you go A steal by Bod Coast to Coast left it off the rim and Albritain hit the ground hard Hes a little slow to get up but a great effort and drew a foul At 700 this morning when we were here for shootound with Clemson one of the things that Brad Brownell told us is the reason why he wanted to play this game He knew they would be good They had 10 players coming back He knew theyd be prepared He knew Tony Pos would be competitive And both coaches showed incredible respect for each other in our conversations with them separately And this is what you get You want to see some adversity in your nonconference schedule And youre going to see plenty of that forward based on what we showed you that coach Brownell has coming forward with his his schedule So you got to dig in right here Building habits Matt Its all about the habits Hey you made it this time One of the things that stood out to me in particular in our conversation with Tony was he said I know Brad Brownells team is going to challenge us in ways that we will not be challenged all year by any other team I hope we can do the same for him because ultimately thats what these games are about first three weeks of the season And Id say they have done that for Clemson here in the second half WELLING OH YEAH two hand flush He is now in double figures with 11 Wow look at that quickness They go clear out Patton oneonone This might get him going This might wake him up a little full speed ahead Carter Welling did not play at all this summer No basketball related activities Had a foot injury that required surgery Didnt return to activity until September You know what Matt You get those older guys and they dont need that preseason stuff They just need to play laughter when the lights come on They dont want to be pushing tractors and rolling tires up a hill They just want to ball when the time comes Forget about all that Hes already done all that Whats popping into my mind right now is the Allen Iverson quote Were talking about practice Well theyre going to have a good practice tomorrow No doubt about that And theyre and theyve played such a a really good first 20 minutes Now you got to figure out how to sustain it But you know you got to give credit to North Alabama for challenging Clemson Welling No rebound All Britain saved it And Wellings going to get tagged with a foul No Check that Its Wallen Well does foul on this play You know I think theres a lot of positives for Brad Brownell It is a 14point game right here And and I like the fullcourt press right here I I like them trying to keep the foot on the gas like dont back off and you cant play to the scoreboard in the nonconference particularly knowing what youve got coming up down the pipe We talked about it earlier in this half but theyve got the Charleston Classic starting Friday November 21st Wallen shuffle extra pass and it rims out Wallen right place right time That was great ball movement by the Tigers I actually think the possessions that Clemson has picked up fullcourt man and have pressed have have really gotten him going on the offensive end as well Sometimes you can change the rhythm of your offense by the way you play defense RJ 17 Caught on a switch No problem for Welling He sends it back Im telling you I like the 610 bigs that Brad has The ability to pick and pop to guard in their ball screen coverage if they have to switch or extend on the perimeter I think hes got a lot of good pieces that is only going to continue to get better And I I love a big that can shoot it like that The stretch ability screaming not just stretch and shoot threes Matt but have what I call that hybrid stretch which is a player that has size that can make decisions with the basketball facing up not just pick and pop Reentry to Godfrey Doubled Foster a three Godfrey the rebound See when Foster makes that pass and relocates and he sees his man go double hes got to be ready to catch and shoot or make a play as soon as the ball gets in his hands Welling fighting for the board Wins it back Third opportunity for Clemson Three seconds Porter a step back Drew Iron Welling was fouled He will get two shots Clemson winning the battle of the boards in the game and particularly in the second half Boy since fourth and fifth grade playing with my kids and know how much he loves the game Its great to see a young man like that get an opportunity to live out his dream and continue to stay in the game Now Tony Puhol could not have been more complimentary of him this morning when we got a chance to talk with the North Alabama head coach And this is a program that expects to win a lot of games this year Not only were they picked to win the conference but they returned 10 players from a a season in which they were just one game away from dancing in March And Matt think about how well theyve played in the second half without Cornelius Williams whos the anchor of everything that they do offensively and defensively They have outscored Clemson 3225 in the second half Under five to shoot Bacus doubled got out of it with a right hand and dropped it down They trail by as many as 23 in this game And with their efforts in the second half have had it hovering around 14 Okay this is a little thing but when you make a shooter drop their hands they usually dont make it Its true Thats an Antonyelli nugget right there Hunter hits his second three of the second half He was 0 for five in the game prior to his last two made buckets I think Dylan Hunter plays his role so well Hes tremendous on the ball Hes got an excellent assist turnover ratio And what Brad Brownil Nip wants from him most is to run the team And you see him right here bringing the guys together right now He doesnt have to be his big brother Chase But he can be Dylan and be very successful this season in leading this group Nice inside out passing And this is the seventh consecutive year with a Hunter on the on the team What are they going to do when he graduates Pretty cool Of course their mom was Brandy Henderson was a great player at the University of Georgia for Andy Landers Im sure if Brys not here shes listening has the best career assist to turnover ratio in Clemson history at the moment 3 to one and hes played a lot of meaningful basketball They really missed him last year in the postseason Broke his hand in the ACC quarterfinal Did not have him in the first round of the big dance Well a big part of their story last year on their 27 wins and 18 in the league which is a record Yes Both records Right He started they they played Duke they won they won eight in a row and then he got hurt He I think a broken hand Was it broken hand Yep Yeah He was instrumental to that run they made late last season which included multiple top 10 wins Hes had a couple of nice threes here in the second half Here he is with the basketball Wallen pays off the extra pass Thats good ball movement applause Theres some really good film for tomorrow I I think I think Clemsons first 20 minutes defensively was outstanding They kept the ball out of the paint They forced a lot of long threes They kept UNA off the free throw line In the first half UNA had one free throw attempt for a team thats lived at the line over the first four games of the season and a 30se second timeout on the floor We will step aside one last time from Clemson music Well they decided not to take a break So here we go Final 50 seconds of the game here at Little John Coliseum Clemson has dominated this game for large stretches There was a spurt here in the second half where UNA cut the deficit to 14 but each time its gotten to 14 Brad Brownells group has extended the lead back out And now RJ Godfrey King makes them both So Coach Brownell is sitting now Youre going to see him go towards the baseline and he says something to the official and I believe that was Lee Cassell on the base Well hes been chirping a little bit over there on the second half Its a veteran coach with a veteran official Im sure there must have been some conversation before cheering Well hes been trying to light a fire in his guys the entire second half Its something that he talked to us about sustained effort sustained intensity for all 40 minutes Well 45 points in the first half was good They held North Alabama to 22 points Lots of stuff to build on West Virginia Friday night Next HUNTER OH YES UPSTAIRS cheering Zack Foster applause cheering cheering Wow He gets up He has had an impressive game Zack Foster the fourstar recruit the freshman the true freshman cheering He knew exactly where the baseline camera was after that alley And its back to 20 And that will do it Clemson with a dominant performance Tony Puhols team with an admirable effort and intensity in the
