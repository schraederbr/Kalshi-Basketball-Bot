cheering Welcome to CW Courtside Saturday presented by All State Youre in good hands The opening moments of the matchup this afternoon between SMU on the road to take on the Syracuse Orange inside the dome See Yigatollu has the lone basket so far in our game Tom Wormy along with Mike Jaminsky the allAmerican from Duke and our outstanding CW production crew on CW Courtzside Saturday Donnie Freemans at the free throw line for the Orange Fight I I had a little flashback there Syracuse started in a zone I was looking for Jim Beahheim over on the sideline Take a look at the starting lineup Donnie Freeman from leading scoreer for the team Almost 18 points per game JJ Starling second leading scorer in the senior from nearby Baldwinville New York playing in his 110th game cheering in his career Remember he started at Notre Dame and then transferred to the Orange program SMU is 17 and seven six and five in conference play Boopy Miller the senior from Chicago Illinois and a captain on this team Leads him in scoring over 19 points per game and that is sixth best in the ACC Washington over top of the defender Kyle You know its interesting Syracuse playing zone Really wary about SMUs ability to score inside the threepoint line and thats where their first two baskets have come from Despite the defense both of these teams average about 20 attempts per game from beyond the arc as Stling hits the midrange jumper Both of these teams really dont rely on the three a whole lot I mean theyre in the bottom four of the ACC as far as threepoint field goal attempts SMU just has a better percentage Will be Miller for three Kyle goes high for the rebound It goes out of bounds and that is off the orange which scored a victory in the dome earlier this week Mike that was on Wednesday against Cal It took double overtime 107 to 100 for the victory for Adrien Autry in Syracuse Yeah and could have sealed the victory with some free throw shooting in regulation but much needed win for them You fights off the double team over Kyle You know we saw them against Pit last Saturday and they got the same kind of start They went inside the Yugatola and he really kept them afloat in that first half Foul is called SMU coming off a win at home against Notre Dame on Tuesday 8981 Now they did make 13 threes in that game 46 from beyond the arc There you see the uh in thats in the country everybody 633 Although uh the guy at the line is pretty solid I was going to wait till after that one went in before I said that But yeah no Nathan George a guy whos going to have the ball in his hands a lot of the time especially at the end of the game 81 Coming off a 14point performance the win against Cal in double overtime for Nate George Spent two years in the Georgia Tech program before coming to Syracuse New York All tied up at six in the early stages inside the dome the home of Orange Basketball since 1980 And the first time that SMU has seen this floor where head coach Andy Enfield has never been here even though hes had a very long career as an assistant in head coach coaching college and in the NBA ranks Shot clock is down to seven Washington fires and its Freeman Kings catch and release Might have grazed the rim Miller on the run Thats a straightaway three ball and it is money for the Mustangs from Cory Washington Yeah good percentage shooter from there And that you know the thing about thing about Boopy Miller gets the ball over half court so much they have a lot of time in their offense to work Not much goes off that 30 second shot clock Four of six shooting so far for SMU They are third in the conference 50 from the floor as the shot clock goes inside of 10 Yeah they are one they are maybe the elite shooting team in the conference Freeman Freeman has got I mean hes got a size again Hes got his position Hes going to be able to shoot over the top of whoevers guarding him Washington turns around at the elbow Not the touch he was looking for on that shot Well why thats where theyre trying to probe the zone You put a guy at the high post right there on the free throw line Collision as Freeman was driving to the rim Both he and Washington hit the deck Washington number three Yeah I just you know in that one he never got he never got set never got in front of him You know I it might have Freeman did lower his shoulder but uh before the shot went up So Washington has to go to the bench for the Mustangs His second personal foul here in the first half on the inbounds Kyle able to gather over for two Yeah William Kyle the third has been a really good pickup for this program and through the portal Had a terrific game I I thought against Cal One of the premier shot blockers in the country Transfer from South Dakota State You get high for the rebound Starling comes away with it Got bumped by Miller It goes out of bounds And that is SMU basketball Audrey an outstanding playing career here for the Orange as well in the early 90s Played in 121 career games and played in three NCAA tournaments Syracuse trying to get back to that tournament for the first time since 2021 Interesting That time Syracuse showed zone early but then switched to man and man manto man Deron Pierre was able to get it back and then hits the backboard in the shots Hes been really good for SMU Starling trying to create and the foul was called Tony Henderson Brian Okonnell Anthony Eid in charge of the action this afternoon You know and this would be you know Stling can stay aggressive Theyve gotten one foul on Boopy Miller already To pick up a second one would be huge Theyve already got Washington with two Orange worked the baseline to Kings and he rattles home a free ball from the corner pocket Another guy who has been a really good pickup in the portal from Oregon State Somehow that shot goes in Wow It was BJ Edwards Looked like it might have been deflected and a foul was called And this was from it was from behind too And Edwards now hes hes capable It looked like it just after release the contact took place Great concentration by Edwards but he is capable of big numbers And hes already had a triple double this year As a matter of fact Nate George picked up the foul for the Orange Yeah In December Mike late December against Cal State Fullerton triple double And then November 21st against Arkansas State 24 points 13 assists and 10 steels Yeah One with steals one with And the Steels was the first in ACC history to have a triple double with steals and a turnover Edwards weak side crash from Walters He cheering threw it away George the bounce pass Freeman the catch Foul on his way to the rack Its a great catch on the pass by Freeman Mike Yeah Well Walters with that risky pass You throw it out towards half court and youre just starting the fast break And uh this sophomore really special Donnie Freeman solid You know we tal we put a graphic up about team free throw shooting but he is one of the guys whos solid at the line Hes had his moments but overall pretty good 75 from the stripe for the body of work for the sophomore from Washington DC Next week CW courtside Saturday returns with the campus double header First Florida State looks for the upset as they visit number 20 Clemson And then number 24 Louisville looks to continue its climb up the ACC standings hosting Georgia Tech Its CW Courtside Saturday Double header next Saturday starting at 12 Eastern 900 am Pacific Its only on the CW Its on Saturday Thats why we call it Mike CW courtside Saturday I knew there was a reason for that How about that Yeah Just Thanks for illumination Thrilled to be back at the dome with my broadcast partner Mike Jaminsky our annual return Thats Tombos over the top And hes a guy I think that can really be a help in the last third of this season as things unwind Hes a big body and Andy Enfield going big with him and Yigatola out on the floor at the same time Tombs is a freshman from Amarillo Texas Kyle the kick into the corner Freeman comes storming out of there and cant get the angle on the square Miller to bring the hustle back and knocked cheering it away Wow thats a great play by Freeman Not just not sulking over the miss SMU steals it right back Edward stepped around the defender AND A TIP FOLLOW coming out of nowhere Pierre Uh thats just teammates not giving up or or conceding a layup that you think is going to be automatic couple times now that Syracuse has chased down that initial break but uh Pier right there with the offensive rebound Now Mike hes a transfer from Jacksonville State and last year in Conference USA he was the player of the year in addition to the SMU lineup this season The foul was called as Kyle ended up in basketball Heres the look You get Yugatola coming over and then Kyle just coming in from behind So Pierre just picked up his second foul and has to go to the bench now I mean SMU is one foul away from putting Syracuse in the bonus early See lets see Lets see if that happens If Syracuse can capitalize with their free throws Diane Anthony has joined the lineup for the Orange Staking out some turf in the corner and a foul was called as Nate George was driving Diane Anthony almost nine points per game for the freshman from Brooklyn New York And the son of the freshman who took him to a national championship back in 2003 for Coach Beheim Nelo Anthony the Nay Smith Hall of Famer So is coach Beheim for that matter And we hope Mike Jaminsky will be added to that list Hes a candidate and hes got my vote And it didnt even cost me a whole lot with a couple grand laughter number I want to get in on that NIL too Mike Come on laughter May Smith image and likeness Love it 47 years as the head coach of the Orange for Coach Beheim Yeah arguably one of the top 10 of all time And uh Im hoping they take away that asterisk on the wins Just ridiculous Couple of free throws for George who had 14 points in the win against Cal He did struggle from threepoint distance was just 105 for the Orange in that win against the Bears As a team they made only six threes but still won the game in double overtime Data doubled and triple teamed Fumbled it He got it right back Couldnt handle the pass Out of bounds and to the orange Yeah I think you could tell he had great he he he had he had great position inside but um nice hands from behind We did highlight the struggles from the free throw line for the Orange Well seven of their 14 points Mike so far have come from the free throw line got seven of eight shooting So I mean if that continues in the half its going to be a huge asset Anthony with 10 on the shot clock Into the corner Betsy Miller on the entry Quick double from Freeman Sadique White into the game as well for the Orange Number zero and a foul called Foul number 11 Nate George picked up the foul for the Orange The visiting Yes Many thanks and all the best to Herm Frasier and John Wild Hack Herm by the way won two medals at the Olympics in track and field and served Syracuse so well and honorably Out of bounds were going to stay at this end of the floor Georgia Georgia remember 76 Olympics Actually a teammate of mine Tate Armstrong was a member of that basketball team Coach Jean Smith Carmelo Anthony won three gold medals as an Olympian Coach Beheim as an assistant for Coach K as Yutolo scores Hes been getting great position in Yigatola I me and you know that time a little more concentration on catching the ball You know what SMU really wants to do is just keep people in front and not let them drive Syracuse hasnt had a field goal in about four minutes Mike And the shot clock is down to three for Freeman cheering into the corner WHITES HE BEATS the clock or did he Theyre going to have a look at it Or did he The jury is out They took it right down to the wire with the kick to the corner by Syracuse For Sadique White who by the way Mike has only made four threepointers all season Number 10 J2 stepping in for the Mustangs It looks like it looks like it got out of his hand This is a better look Yeah Oh its close but I think it got I think it its going to count How about the composure by White as Ce Ye told all 7 foot two of them is charging at him in the corner Well and plus the thing in that in that situation you dont change your shot because of the clock I mean you you go through your normal delivery If you beat the clock fine If you dont fine But its when you rush your shot that youre going to miss And uh he showed good good concentration Uh you know what you said with a big body bearing down on him Yeah Boy a little bit closer in this angle The call on the floor of a threepoint basket is confirmed We get the confirmation That was then that was as close as it gets He had 10 points in the win against Cal this week Six players for the Orange got to double digits The double overtime win against the Cal Bears on Wednesday And the Orange 11 and four on their home floor three and three in conference play inside the dome Tombs double team Anthony Eids all over it and calls a foul Just a an interesting move by Andy Anfield with Washington with the foul issues playing Tombs alongside Yugato Its a its a big four or five combination and Tombs is usually his backup SMUs won four of its last six two in a row Up and under Yeah just a lapse defensively there on that inbounds play Edwards received the ball and everybody left him He looked a little surprised that he had that much daylight Yeah Went to the other side of the rim and curled it in Hes the third leading scorer this season for SMU Just over 13 points per game DJ Edwards Betsy And everything that Syracuse has done against this zone has been out on the perimeter They havent been able to get inside at all Iu let the defender fly on by and Betsy and he lays it in calmly He showed great strides and improvement like the last year to this Yeah And hes doing again he hes a a little undersized front line wise especially with uh Kyle out of the lineup or out of the not on the floor Go deep has eight points and hes four for four from the floor George loops it in too strong off the glass but White who rips it away and preserves the possession to Anthony Freeman Anthony there to collect Shot clock is at five for George High arcing shot is too strong Iu feeds it to Miller up ahead ONeal for a jam double fisted Well he just took off on the jump shot I mean with those two big guys inside you figure youre going to get the rebound And uh ONeal released was way ahead of everybody 20 of the 24 points for the Mustangs in the first half In the paint Donnie Freeman in the paint for the Orange Yeah thats a thats a great shot for him to catch in that zone and try to inside Like I said hes going to be able to shoot over the top of some people ONeal Jr cheering Betsy the clearance Freeman pounds it into the floor applause and cheering I toldu picks up the foul for SMU despite the protest His first personal first on the sophomore from Instambul Turkey Hes eight points already in this game Three rebounds Hes not going to win that are you Hes one of the best rebounders in the league Mike Six in the conference Over eight per game for Yazaldo Well and you know you look at what this state of affairs that we are in college basketball that Andy Enfield was able to keep a core of players from last year Uh you know Yigato Boopy Miller Edwards and then fill in around those guys Tomorrow CW Womens Hoops is back as Virginia heads out west to take on Stanford in a thrilling ACC matchup CW womens hoops Virginia Stanford tomorrow 2 pm Eastern 1100 am Pacific Its only on the CW Indie Enfield didnt want that second foul on so they take him out And but you know if they got tunes to slide over now Freeman comes out of the game Syracuse is nine of 10 from the free throw line of the first half point Yeah I mean you know good for them that taking advantage of the the bonus situation White blocked the shot from Miller It went out of bounds and its Mustangs basketball Just their second year in the conference for SMU Wonderful addition They come in with a record of 17 and seven Theyre six and five in ACC play Most recently wins at home against Notre Dame and on the road at Pit That that foul on Betsy He just they his man was trying to come off a screen and he had him in a he had him in an arm lock Tombs size advantage against Starling trying to muscle him up off the glass for Tombs Pretty solid I mean I I think his offense has really gotten you know improved Plus he recognized the mismatch that time A fivepoint game as we approached the 8minute threshold in the first half Teams have met twice Both of those games happened last year SMU eliminated Syracuse from the ACC tournament last season and beat him in Dallas as well Fumbled by Betsy and taken back by SMU and now Miller Yeah I mean Sadique White is just not the same presence inside obviously that Freeman is Pierre turning around right into Sadique White who picks up the foul for the Orange number his trek through the college basketball landscape Mike over the years Yeah um you know was at Wake Forest had a good uh good stretch there and uh really solid last year and Indie Enfield able to keep him in the on in the fold cheering This program made it to the NIT last year after winning 24 games in their first year in the ACC They finished sixth in the regular season As I mentioned they beat Syracuse in the second round and then lost in the quarters to Clemson by just three in Charlotte which is the destination once again midMarch for the ACC tournament Always love seeing that tournament come back to Charlotte Mike yeah I know its its been a its been a good home And then the following year back up to Greensboro which is my old stomping grounds Coach Autry not pleased with that last sequence as the ball goes back to SMU and he goes to the bench for Freeman inside up on the glass Fight for the loose ball Freeman went to the deck with Cory Washington and a foul called Still only 16 foul Second personal deep foul number six Second personal foul on Donnie Freeman Well and and here you know the thing I mean he just came back in the game Matter of fact he came running out of the locker room went past the bench checked in came in and uh you know good job by SMU to go right at him Geron Pierre second on the team in scoring almost 18 per game Tombs cleaning up the mess Well we we talked about SMU and their shooting ability They are also an excellent offensive rebounding team Would you put those two together a high percentage and a high offensive rebound you you can score a lot of points 48 shooting in the first half for SMU Starling hits a roadblock Safety valve Anthony got it right back Lets it fly Kyle Freeman fouled It looked like ONeal at the tail end coming in to contest Freeman ONeal Father Germaine senior 18 years in the NBA Mike a sixtime allstar Allstar festivities this weekend in the NBA Coach Autry has to love this looking up and seeing number one at the free throw line again Well and you know for Anfield hes just over there because hes got to try to massage his lineup into the second half and not get not have anybody real foul trouble Second year for coach Enfield on the bench for SMU shephering this program into the ACC I remember last year did their first AC misses Cream had been solid at the free throw line up to that point but last year doing their first ACC game ever against Virginia regular season and then the the football team played in the in the championship in Charlotte that night flights from cheering Dallas to Charlotte Miss from the corner Pierre three ball for the Mustangs Yeah theres the offensive rebound and kick out I mean thats a great time to get a good look at a three How about SMUs first game in the ACC this year Mike A home win against North Carolina Three rattles out for Kings And they did as good a job that game on Caleb Wilson as anybody that Ive seen ONeal strong drive Kyle ends up with it Anthony has not really looked for his shot at all so far in his screaming time on the floor Shot clock at 10 Five and a half minutes to go in the first half Seven on seven ONeal on Anthony Kai and Anthony will come out of the game So will ONeal Jr Yeah hes just Nate George is going to log some serious minutes as the season winds on down because they theyve got its got to have him on the floor and you know again its just Hoopy Miller coming out of the game because of hes got one foul and Andy Enfield maybe get him in the last couple minutes of this half but trying to save that Pile lost it on the bounce Edwards kept it alive SMU just dominating both backboards early on 191 applause Its also 13 nothing in second chance points Although the Mustangs turn it over and back to the Orange Kings creating space and hitting and its a three ball right in front of SMU Yeah hit a jump shot there earlier and you know it just nothing has been easy for Syracuse in this game Theyve gotten not much out in transition Theyve had to work against that zone in the half court Knocked it away teams got it back just inside the free throw line with a soft bounce and roll Number 10 for SMU has been a big factor in the first half Yeah nice soft touch If anything hes he was behind defensively early on in the year but thats improved especially on ball screens outside He has been terrific so far in this game Eight points in the first half for twos And now George George All net for George and a three You could totally seen a couple of threes shot right at close range Turn around tomb Same spot almost Mike Yeah No that that that is the soft spot in in that zone and the guys that theyre getting the ball to are really being productive But you know we talk about wins and this is a this is a big game for SMU This is a quad one opportunity for the Mustangs So even you know man that shows you how good the league is this year Syracuse with that record still up in the Met rankings high enough to make this a quad one game SMU 34 Freeman swoops in and scores And thats you know hes the guy who can create that type of offense And uh you know so far SMU did not have a matchup for him and even with the zone he beats it Nine points for Freeman in the first half Igatulu against Kyle Yeah you see Kyle gets him out of the lane a little farther on the catch applause Offensive foul called on Yigatu And uh that just shows you the respect or the confidence and he just mans up inside and too many uh too many dribbles and you know good call right there Two personal fouls You can out of the game He and Tombs have combined for 18 points and nine of 10 shooting in the first half for SMU This is George King shovels to Freeman cheering First down Freeman Three assist double digits for the 15th time this season for Freeman who missed nine games earlier in the year with a foot injury Kyle once again defending against Tounes has to kick it back out Boopy Miller on the baseline does not get the ball Freeman skies for the board And how about Kyle and his defense on first on Yigatola then that time on Tombs Hes the one guy one guy they have to answer inside George dribbling display and he beats everybody to the rim and a timeout on the floor cheering Mustangs has led by as many as Mike 0 for three from the floor Hasnt scored Hes got four assists in the game He really hasnt forced his offense much And know they theyve had success inside so theyve been going with that Pierre back to the basket now trying to drive it on baseline Pass the tight quarters to Freeman the rebound cheering Stling up top Got it back somehow and Kyle was fouled cheering This last four minutes with Syracuse getting back in the game more bounce in their game Looking ahead theyre finally starting to get out on the floor That would have been a tough one You know Kyle did a good job of just coming up with that and getting themselves to the free throw line Booby Miller picked up his second personal foul trying to stop Kyle from scoring I mean that that two under a personal foul may be more important than the zero right there cheering and applause Miller is the leading scoreer for SMU without a point in the first half William Kyle the third at the free throw line The senior 15 points in the win against Cal this week Not bad for 49 from the line Yeah I tell you this uh whatever whatever practice routine Syracuse had at the free throw line they should keep that for the rest of the year cheering It is an eight nothing Orange run to close it to two inside of a minute and a half to go in the first half Shot clock at six for Edwards All kinds of dribbling Tons got it away SMU got it right back with Washington Yeah And theyve got two guys on the floor for SMU with two fouls And uh you know you go in and try on the offensive glass its its a risk for sure Final minute of the first half THE RUNNERS FROM FREEMAN KYLE HAS IT Stling deflected by Washington trying to get it back Starling diving for it out of bounds who was fighting with Miller and the officials indicate Mustangs basketball Well its been interesting too that uh you know with this surge on the offensive end Syracuse has been cheering much more active Theres the look and you dont see that although uh Syracuse fans maybe a flashback to off of Syracuse is under further block to save the national championship game Yeah thats off Boopy Wait a second You must have indisputable video evidence to overturn the call Mike which on the court was Mustangs basketball 2003 the win against Kansas Mike that you referenced at the Superdome 8178 By the way Carmemelllo had 20 points He was the most outstanding player of the Final Four Terry McMaro was pretty good too as a freshman Yeah not bad 18 points in that game So the officials are taking a look at this Yeah I mean that look its off It looks like looks like Millers the last one to touch it Syracuse ball Yeah 11 seconds on the shot clock Good call Su successful challenge from Adrien Red Autry and his coaching staff Hes 48 and 42 in his third year as the head coach Andy Enfield second year He is 41 and 18 All right They did Syracuse ball but only 11 on the shot clock Five on the shot clock cheering Freeman has to fight for that pass Turns and fires Not a sense of urgency on that out of bounds play Miller tried to drop it off Pierre missed cheering Well defended by the Orange Shot clock is off 22 seconds to go in our first half of play on CW courtside Saturday The lead for SMU Mike was as big as 12 in the first half Well surprisingly the advantage for Syracuse has been the free throw line in the first half I mean theyre 11 of 14 which is outstanding Kings the miss on the three Pierre trying to get it away and thatll do it for the first 20 minutes Yeah I mean you look at the eye test Tom and you say man Syra SMU is really dominating this game but its a fourpoint game Just two made threes in the first half Thats going to loom large as well I thought you meant like the late 1970s when you were rocking at the Final Four and almost won a national championship against Kentucky in 78 No I got rid of Did I miss something Well I just got rid of all that polyester and all the and and the and the ties and the all that stuffs gone Moth got to it Freeman I will say youre looking sharp in your Johnny O pullover Love Johnny providing the outfitting for our broadcast teams on CW court Saturday Thats a twisting attempt from Edwards and Niglo picks up a a meaningless foul and right away Tombs is going to come in off the bench Thats three on Yigola and that was just that was completely unnecessary He had eight points in the first half Mike did not miss a shot Four for four from the floor and he is on the infield bench right now applause Orange closed on that 82 run over the last 3 minutes and 44 seconds Stling Yeah And what do you do You get You can throw out of there That big body attack the rim Great job Starling who had just two points in the first half as the second leading scorer on the Orange roster Jones had it knocked away Kyle and now Freeman clutching his lower leg on the baseline Just got tangled up with Kyle a little bit Hes retying his shoe Also we talked about one of the best shot blockers not not only in the ACC but in the country getting that just before its apex Six blocks for the Orange in this game 27 a game Thats big time and hes not an imposing physical guy although weve seen him play some great mantoman defense on the post cheering DJ Edwards Edwards hits a three for SMU This is similar to last weekend that the perimeter game for SMU really started to catch up and catch on fire and they theyre going to need that with Yukatola out of the game Starling the entry in Freeman in the paint Turn around Tough shots for Freeman again They need the guys that he has playing him He caught that in a great position He just played over the top Miller was driving Starling fouls him on the baseline Donnie Freeman 49 from the floor on the season for the sophomore Edwards on the inbounds from Miller trying to get into the box scor and get his first points and its Miller Yeah And you got to think hes going to be pretty close to his average by the end of this game But um you know to his credit and he he was just concerned with running the team early on not looking for his offense Miller now with 148 career threepointers trying to carve through the Orange D Little pass inside and a dribble from Tombs cheering and he was fouled on the look by Edwards and to be more specific the no look pass from Edwards Well and see this is the luxury that Andy Enfield has that you got and foul issues but the way Tombs have been playing latter half of the season you feel good with him out on the floor Tombs had a double double in the home win against Virginia Tech It was a Boopy Miller half court shot to beat the Hookies Watch as contestants spell their way to glory or disaster Catch an all new episode of Scrabble hosted by Craig Ferguson this Thursday 87 central right here on the CW GL Very good You advance in the second round Mr J That might have been a double word score too Glad my Duke education came in there Makes himself good for something Kings in the corner George to Freeman Freeman fouled in the act of shooting despite the protest from BJ Edwards DJ Edwards only his second personal foul but still one that was unnecessary I mean Edwards is not going to block a jump shot by Freeman So all you need to do there is bother it and get a body on him and block him off the glass Five of eight from the line for Freeman Add another applause Donnie Freeman with a 27point performance at Georgia Tech His careerh high just wish he could stay healthy for a whole year Um you know injury kept him out of his freshman year and missed that time early on this year but he has a special talent Washington he he actually was a guy who was very effective there early on in this game before he picked up his second foul Starling show and go Raymond up on the rim with tunes and it comes to Miller Drops it off Pierre Swoops cheering in and drops it in for the Mustangs Boy they really change hands quickly and actually keep up with Poopy Miller and Adrian wants a timeout The lead is now 10 for SMU Well step aside the Melo Anthony practice facility and basketball center Infamous last game being Georgetown there Mike you had to go there Yeah Hey I went national championship All right Anthony with the foul as Pierre was driving Syracuse couldnt keep it alive at the other other end of the court And uh also that um SMU early in this half has really gotten out in transition and started running the basketball It has been Mike a big weekend in this building culminating this afternoon after a couple of huge highprofile lacrosse games yesterday The women losing to number one North Carolina the men defeating number one Maryland They hadnt beaten them in 17 years Washington spins on the block and Kyle denies it Talk about hes got long arms and great timing inside with his blocks Freeman lines it up and knocks it down Hes okay from three 33 And I tell you if youre Andy Enfield you dont mind him taking that shot rather than getting inside But he answers Yeah Cookie Miller in that first half Hes got his average in assist with six His average in rebounds with three Now hes coming Now hes going to be more of a scorer Two of three on threepoint tries for Poopy Miller And now five of 12 as a team from threepoint real estate for SMU Freeman lost it Right to Kyle series of moves Not enough on it Freeman had to take it away That was Washington Miller downshifting against Kings Lightning fast Hoopy Miller and a foul on the play First its Kyle with his second block of the game as a leading shot blocker in the ACC And then Donnie Freeman hitting the Russ Millers at the free throw line First attempts of the afternoon for Miller He and his teammates five of eight from the floor to start the second half cheering Started the first half 406 from the floor Thats an 87 free throw shooter Mike third best in the ACC Ruby Miller which is so valuable Well I mean he hes obviously going to be dominating the ball in endgame situations so you cant foul him You know if you have a guy like that whos a liability of the free throw line that puts your team in a tough situation into the corner for Cayenne Anthony Kings grabs it Goes right back to the threepoint line George That was a little early in contested Syracuse now five of 17 on threepointers and theyve got it back with George Freeman has a three on his resume in this game and he draws the foul in the paint Cory Washington took an elbow up high and thats what hes talking about I mean he caught it up in his neck or his face Transfer from Witchah State has his third personal foul playing in his 113th career game Theres a lot of experience on that SMU roster So now youre going to start in the infield has start juggling guys with three fouls Digital coming back in Hes just got to be smarter than he was picking up that first foul in the second half He had eight points in the first half Hes back into the game Anthony takes a look down FINDS THE SPOT AND HITS IT IN FRONT OF HIS own bench Actually took the dribble down looked down to make sure it was a three And uh looking for a shot a little bit more in this second half was passing the ball in the first half but hes been active here First points of the game for Cayenne Anthony with a threepointer His 15th made three of the season Yeah and it was uh and this was almost 5 seconds Uh George just got it out Good bail out in the corner and nice finish Quick close on Edwards Yollu battles Freeman Knocked it away Foul committed White was in the neighborhood as well for the Orange The third one on Freeman I think they gave it to Well the indication was Kyle but hes not on the floor So Gigatola at the free throw line and hes the one of the few SMU guys who struggles at the line cheering Despite the miss theyre good as a team Mike 76 is third in the ACC Like I say you know across the board theyre very good at the line He is the one at 58 that struggles So they just made the announcement They assessed the foul to Freeman and thats his third Yeah thats what I thought the call was Freeman and White were in the neighborhood and they gave it to Freeman His third personal foul One of two You could from the free throw line Halftime lead was four for SMU Anthony cut off by the defending of Edwards Freeman works the baseline Lost the handle to Pierre Head of steam Foul call prior to the shot by Edwards And right now its Syracuse that has team fouls building up Thats their six So SMU getting poised to get into the bonus early So thats the second on white Miller trying to get around Freeman Gave it up Tombs Thats a I tell you what for a big guy thats a tough shot Dead in front of the rim Uh shooting that little floater Takes a little touch George for three Rattles out Tombs pulls it in The rebound for the Mustangs Three in the shot clock Six of 19 for the Orange on threes Long rebound Nate George Potential numerical advantage Trying to do it himself Put it up top for Freeman Catch and gather George got the bounce Tough shot too I mean that was really good defense by Miller He kept him in front George with a slight height advantage able to score over the top 11 points now for Nate George Edwards on the drive Freeman came in late Juu doing two on the work on the offensive glass Freeman Kings the lefthander ripping the ropes for the Orange I tell you he hes been their best answer from behind the arc Thats his third of the game Three for six now cheering Hes got 160 threes in his career as Freeman volleyballs that one Went up and grabbed it contacted a foul and it looks like its going to be against the Mustangs SMUs only turned it over five times Syracuse seven turnovers So well played in that regard from both teams Betsy catch and release Kyle foul on Miller Yep Thats going to be foul on number three Cory Washington Im Cory Washington Foul t number four Fourth on Washington Well theyve had that rotation and theyre four or five guys with Washington Tombs and Yigatu Officials are at
