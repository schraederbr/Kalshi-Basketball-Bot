hand off Cruz with seven Pull up Jays Zion Cruz is strong Thomas applause out and running Malik Thomas a pure scorer cheering Cant find it No call I mean what a hard take to the basket though by Thomas He was able to push the pressure in transition Wasnt able to get it to fall And on the other end of the floor a missed layup down low Shaking off some rust early to open the college basketball season And a whistle goes against Zion Cruz his first the senior from Trent New Jersey One of the few guys on this Rider team that knows the program Well he scored in double figures 16 times last season Was named to the Allac third team Yeah hes the goto guy for Ryder Rich Bagot said We need a we need a bucket Were going to go to Zion Cruz just about every time And with the fact that Ryder is in a zone right now you see Lewis is the one who is able to attack the gap on the left hand side of the floor and gets UVA on the boards first in this game And now we have the opportunity to see this fullcourt pressure by the Hoops Its one of the seven transfers Sam Lewis hes in from Toledo Other end Burton hands off Dio Loose ball picked up by the Cavs in transition cheering whistle and a foul against McCabe That was Sam Lewis going up Hell have two at the line Coach ODM describes Sam Lewis as a physical wing You can see that the activity on defense helps UVA get out and jumpstart that offense And what a take to the basket He was trying to slam that one home And you got to love a guy who was willing to go for it Yeah Would have been in front of the band and this crowd would have lost it All right Sam Lewis second team all MAC at Toledo He led the MAC in threepoint shooting percentage 444 Tai and he started in all 33 games last music year for Toledo His careerh high is 23 points He was able to do that twice and you see it in the film A pure knockdown shooter You remember he played at Simeon Academy on the south side of Chicago Same school as Dererick Rose They get the offensive board Hall thought didnt Hell have another chance here Back down low to D Ritter Got to get it off Tess hands off Oh a denial underneath by Cole McKe headed the other way Ryder has been extremely active in this zone defense You see them doubling down on the post when D Ritter caught the ball and then the rotation on the backside was beautiful The way that McCabe was able to go up and get the block shot cheering Fullourt pressure There it is Cruz grabs and breaks Antoine Wilson Flash Burton has emerged as a leader of this rider group with nine pullup J Flash has two And what a bucket by Flash Just the sophomore but you can see the confidence within him where he was able to clear out the floor and go for it Ditter pushing will shoot You already see that pace is completely different from years past Well yeah After a made basket UVA is looking to push the ball up the floor Its not too much walking the basketball up by any means And thats the emphasis that Ryan ODM is trying to run for his team ODM in his first season at the helm of Virginia cheering from VCU Ta Ritter misses the front end UVA has missed a ton of free throws Lets take a look at Tessa Ritter Well Tess 69 freshman from Belgium Hes been able to fill it up when he music was overseas Belgium rookie of the year six man of the year and big man of the year in 2023 And they call him the tank And we see why Hes able to get HIS OWN REBOUND OFF THE MISS SER you called it Spinning inside and scoring Hes a 22yearold freshman and thats the age of college basketball were in Flash Burton who scored the first bucket for Ryder cant score the second Pulled in by Gruno Hall transition TREY You got to love it Called his own number as a point guard Now Hall is known for getting the offense going Hes an assist guy but that time he was feeling very confident at the top of the key for the pull up Remember on that Sweet 16 team with BYU just a year ago brings experience as does many on this UVA team Ton of newcomers 12 of them for the Whos Wilson in trouble on offense Oh what a bucket Up and under Thats way to stick with it if youre Wilson where he was able to establish his pivot foot and keep it going OH ITS GRUMLO ON THE SLAM UNDERNEATH THE NEW BRAND IS OUT early for UVA And you got to love it the sevenfooter running the floor with authority and having his hands ready to catch and go straight up with it for the slam 12 points in the exhibition against Villanovavva Uh player to watch for Virginia Were under 16 minutes Ryder controlling down five Flash Burton confident He is denied by Ta Ritter And this is headed the other way Already showing the length Ta Ritter the Whos Andrew with the lead in the season opener Ryder misses on the other end Lewis pushing reset with Chance Mallerie A new crew in here with Jakari White Back to Mallerie And the ball movement so far for UVA I think has been one of the most fascinating things Almost everyone has gotten a touch each time down the floor Dater scores What about the footwork on the inside back to the basket big cheering took his time was patient and was able to use his spin move and soft touch around the basket to drop the layup in Theyre going to get Chance Mallerie on the whistle there And thats what comes along with pressing up right Its a little bit of give or take when you look at it But the freshman from Charlottesville Virginia youll take it in knowing that hes playing the right way trying to be aggressive on the defense Went to high school just less than a mile away from John Paul Jones Arena Keinskas gets it over to McCabe cheering Ryder with 13 Zion Cruz pullup jumper is no good What an offensive board keeping it alive for the Bronx cheering Thats Shamani Fuller down there And then its Kevin Scott throwing the foul And if youre UVA they have to have the assertiveness right You cant always out jump your opponent Something that they worked on with great detail and shoot around earlier was putting a body on somebody You got to box out the man first and then go and pursue the basketball And thats how Ryder was able to get a Oboard just now McCabe one of the few returners on this Rider team gets it to Fuller First season with the program Hand off Wilson has a step Oh applause Enso says Not in my house And the timing on that block was impeccable The big guy stayed low then rose up high to send that one Two out of bounds And another look at that big time block Was at Kentucky for a couple years Last stop was Kansas State His third spot for his final year Triple right side Thats no good Pulled in by Yugo underneath D Ritter whos been a star early Dishes They work to White Triple right side Not their offensive board White one of the best threepoint shooters that this team got Oh Yugo says Why not Thats not there And the whistle is going to be against Reich How about that cheering That is 510 Chance Mallerie I was going to say and who got to the ball first in the last two possessions Mallerie hes able to rise up at just 510 the smallest guy out there on the floor able to get not one but two offensive rebounds to save it for his squad Coach we asked Coach ODM we is he really 510 He smiled He he looked at us said Yeah he is I mean I think one of my favorite things that he complimented Mallerie on He said hes the best nail guy that hes ever coached And that says a lot about a young man who hasnt even played a full game under him yet Jakari Whites going to be shooting three from the stripe He was fouled on the wing And that was team foul number five on Ryder They get Davis Binham there And you know if youre Ryder that doesnt necessarily happen if they finished a possession with a rebound And that is a place in where they havent found success in this game 14th year for Kevin Bagot twotime MAC coach of the year stops at JMU Howard UNMBC and joined the staff at Ryder as an assistant back in 06 First ones good Its the first free throw made by Virginia Theyre one for five Sakari White goes two for two so far Saturday morning at 10 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be here in Charlottesville to get you ready for another full day of football with a 2hour pregame show Theyll have game previews along with expert analysis and featured stories all here on the ACC Network and the allnew ESPN app White three for three Its a 10point lead early for Virginia cheering Ty whats been the difference I would say the difference has been the offensive rebounding thus far Second chance opportunities for UVA have helped them build this lead that they have here in the first half cheering Look at the intensity by coach Ryan ODM on the sideline Hes telling his guys Keep giving up Its a whistle Its against Yeah I think they got Gertrude whos fresh into the game Elijah Gertrude Well remember hes been a head coach a few times before and had that success at VCU Most recently Utah State for a couple of years before that UNMBC knocked off UVA in that infamous game in Charlottesville Infamous four Cavaliier fans back in 2018 in the first round of the NCAA tournament Thats Burton Short corner and one for Flash Burton I mean and thats a a tough shot for him to knock down You never want to foul a jump shooter And for Flash Burton he comes off the dribble the handoff Hes able to go back over the screen rise up kept his follow through and one count the bucket Now he comes up a little gimpy here Well see if he can complete the threepoint play Hes having a word with Bill Cington Hell shoot it Flash Burton 20 points in the exhibition against Rowan cheering Coach Bagot called him a gamer And as a rookie just last year he scored in double figures 13 times And you can see the sophomore from Philly his confidence continues to rise Yeah theyre going to lean on him a lot this year Score cut in half now Ryder down seven cheering How shifty is Chance Mallerie huh Oh yeah Hes got a tight handle Hes looking to get you out of your boots when hes dribbling that rock On Enzo I love the play by Odeno and the way that hes able to use his body to shield off his defender And when you stand at 7 foot tall sometimes your body is your best weapon that you have out there on the floor UVA bigs are going to be a problem this year Tony Enso has quote NBA instincts underneath be the whos rim protector this year 13 to shoot for Ryder Down nine Flash Burton who has been the guy for him so far Drive kick Turns it over Malik Thomas to Mallalerie One more to White The sharpshooter No good Oh theres cheering Mallerie for two The effort the hustle the energy by the freshman Hes playing like he has something to lose out there His instincts to get his hands on the basketball and near the basketball have been super incredible cheering Got to be chills for Chance Mallerie Grew up here in Charlottesville Went to high school less than a mile away Making plays like that Getting the crowd amped Burton to quiet him Got it That was a parking lot three for Burton Burton is having himself quite the first half here cheering Well well say it again for people who are just joining us Chance Mallerie was the pick by several of these Virginia players to stand out Their sleeper pick early in the season Thomas driving with 12 with contact Not their whistle Itll stay with 1131 to go in the first Chance Mallerie the hometown kid making plays at JPJ music Five threepoint attempts Thought it was interesting too Thats the guys he wanted to recruit that could PLAY IN THAT SYSTEM Thats down for Test Ritter Hes got six And thats just activity around the glass teammate misses it but there to follow up on the play cheering The pressure applied Keep Jinskas across the timeline Flash Burton has eight of the teams 10 points for Ryder Hes got the basketball Not a whole lot in this possession for Ryder Theyre letting cheering the shot clock get pretty dark and allowing for Flash to go to work Kisses it off the glass So its got to be Flash They push again UVA goes to Thomas Not there Pulled in McCabe Thatll be a jump Possession arrow to Virginia How about flash burden tie Hes been so aggressive on the attack Patient Patient Doesnt have the first option but is able to spin Hey its nearly what its 700 Banks not open but it was open for Flash Burton on that drive right there to the basket 10 points already four for seven from the field He has been the offense for Ryder Remember last year had that gamewinning pass to take down Sienna in the opening round of the MAC tournament Its not there This whistle I believe is going to be against Tesa Ritter Yeah Calling him for the push off down low Said that he cleared the space on Dio who was going for the rebound had clear position to get it Not totally a bad thing You want your guys crashing music the glass and then on a foul like that UVA has the opportunity to set up this fullcourt defensive pressure 15 foul against Virginia Ryder has six Bonus will ensue soon cheering Ryders emerging star this year Flash Burton with the basketball The sophomore from Philly Its Keinskas down low Short corner Don Hall Nice play defensively CUTTING CRUZ INSIDE SCORING Riner cuts it to six How about Kevin able to keep his dribble in the corner Did not panic when he was trapped and able to find Cruz on the cut THOMAS THE ANSWER cheering BULL TIME UVA They needed that triple bad They were one for seven from deep up until that point where Thomas was able to drill it in for his first points at the hoop First of many Hes now one for four from the floor Remember was top 25 in division one scoring last year Cruz fade away Jay not there Pulled in by Grunlow Martin Carrer controlling Just entered Grunlo triple from the key Its one place Virginia has struggled a bit from the threepoint line Just two made out of nine attempts Entry pass Second foul now against Tess Ritter If youre Ditter you cant get caught behind the post player Thats how he picked up that foul right there By that time you see the entry passes coming in He should have just showed his hands and backed off and seeing that that basketball was going to make it into the post one way or another So that is his second personal foul Hes going to have to be careful going forward Hes been a massive impact early I think coach Odum is repeating what you just mentioned on our broadcast for certain I mean as someone who you want to keep out there on the floor you cant pick up Philly silly fouls like that Inbound Dio Muhammad on his fifth school in five years is denied Nice defense there by Grimlow Hall in transition Lewis has a step on the corner and hell shoot two And you talk about that step by Lewis Its very quick off the rip He wasted no time seeing that he had a seam on the baseline drive Didnt find success with scoring it necessarily but a trip to the free throw line for Lewis where he was 0 for two earlier in the game We will see if hes able to cash in on these ones And after this game switch over to ACC Network where Ryan Conwell and the 11th ranked Louisville host South Carolina State Well wrap up the night with nothing but net crew at 11 Eastern And what a way to tip off the season on ACC Network and the ESPN app 2414 Virginia on top in Charlottesville Kevin D Dominico Tikira Carter Thanks for hanging out with us on college basketball opening night a national holiday laughter No it most certainly is Now this is the smallest lineup that I think weve seen so far for UVA on the floor Very guard heavy here as Jakari White has just checked back into the game Johan Grunlow the sevenfooter is on there but yeah guard heavy as you mentioned Burton in trouble at the key Nice deep from Jakari White cheering finds refuge and Wilson Its back to Cruz with five Got to get one off Zion Cruz preseason third team on Mac goes strong there and an offensive board Flash whos been the guy Hell shoot three Thats twice now that hes been fouled in the midst of shooting a jump shot And that starts with Dio right saving the play and getting another second chance opportunity for Ryder And exactly as we see it here Thomas gets Burton as hes rising up into the air right on the arm And so another opportunity for him to continue to add on to his evening where Burton already has 10 points to lead all scorers You mentioned Dio thats his second offensive board And Dio hes been able cheering to beat UVA to the boards because his feet arent arent stopping down there Been applause and cheering he has been very active Burton misses the first of three Flash Burton 10 points So the teams 14 from Philly The sophomore hits the second Last year he took over as the starting point guard for the final 10 games of the season Said this year he settled into a leadership role The lights arent as bright for number 11 Well I think one of the most impressive things about Flash Burton as a rookie last season he cheering was 15th in the MAC in assist to turnover ratio So that means one he values the basketball and understood the importance of when he was out there he had to take care of his minutes and the possessions that he was getting Its a great point emerging here in 2025 Hall from the corner gets nothing there Itll stay with Virginia up eight Thats a tough shot by Hall He was coming off the curl in the corner He never seemed to be fully set He was leaning a bit on that threepoint shot Seemed as though he was rushed Coach Odum told us today Paul still learning how to score on his own able to dish the ball like no one else in the country White step back triple offensive board Lewis the Toledo transfer all the way back to Thomas Thats a foul every time Antoine Wilson is who they get Thats seven on Ryder And so now UVA theyll have to take advantage of this The next 810 left in this first half here they will be going to the strike due to the fact that theyre now in the bonus So well see Does the style of play change here And understanding that they have an opportunity to get trips to the free throw line Malik Thomas hits the first Heres more on Malik Thomas the grad student from San Francisco Well he was named to the preseason Jerry West award one of 20 players for the best shooting guard in the country And you talk about what hes been able to do A natural threelevel scorer and he was one of the best I would say that UVA could get out of the transfer portal where he averaged nearly 20 points per game last year in San Francisco and has emerged as quote the leader we need says coach ODM cheering hits both lead back to 10 Zion Cruz just two points relatively quiet one for five from the floor Its been his guard counterpart Flash Burton taking care of business A tough call against McCabe applause He gets whistled 755 to go UVA up 10 music music Welcome back to Charlottesville 2616 your score and the foul against Cole McCabe has been upgraded to a flagrant touch Yeah McCabe on the wing He was trying to swing through create the space elbows above the shoulder got Malik Thomas right across the face holding his jaw on the rip through reverses it and he knocked Malik Thomas off of his ground And so I think that was a great call by the refs identifying going in reviewing it And so Malik Thomas here well actually double foul So McCabe is going to the free throw line to shoot Hold on a second Cole McCabe is shooting and they actually whistled Malik Thomas cheering Well get you answers here in a moment Yes this is this is so they get Malik Thomas on a foul Heres another look So Malik Thomas pushes up has two hands on the ball Called it a cylinder foul for Thomas intruding on the space of the cave So he actually was the one stepping up to the free throw line to shoot Hes able to knock down both of them Interesting Well they went back and forth there A long decision long deliberation and uh thats the result UVA with the basketball Mallerie the answer Not there Fernlo the Oboard swing Thomas inside up and under Trying to put the spin on it Hell shoot A tough take to the basket by Thomas And the result of that is 10 offensive rebounds for UVA They have been very heads up when it comes to crashing the boards Thomas is able to put his head down go to the right flip it up Cant get the bucket to go But another trip to the free throw line here where UVA is shooting their 12th and 13th attempts at the free throw line So that is a place where they have been living in this game to start UVA now just seven for 12 though from the stripe Thomas good three for three and and if Im UVA thats a formula continue to attack knowing that youre going to be in the bonus the rest of the way you knock down your free throws it gives you that opportunity to press up that pressure applied cheering Mallerie checking Burton McCabe kicks Cruz Triple is there Zion Cruz Zion Cruz Hes had a tough time getting it going but that time nothing but net from the outside The answer from Lewis In and out Pulled in by Burton Ryder down seven with the basketball Burton has 12 of the teams 21 Double team Skip pass Picked off by White JAKARI WATCH OUT HES whistled by McCabe who is pumped up but got a piece of Jakari White The North Dakota State transfer Elite anticipation by Jakari White to jump into the passing lane and come up with that one It only took him four dribbles to get up the floor and take flight to the basket for UVA Again another trip to the free throw line And Jakari White hes been nothing but the Energizer Bunny coming off of the bench here Jakari White the ground transfer from North Dakota State The man has made the Summit League defensive team in music 2023 Last season averaged 17 points per game was able to light it up from the outside music as a 40 threepoint shooter And Im loving what Im seeing out of him so far in this game with his activity on the defensive end on the floor and his knack for getting down on the offensive end quickly but wasnt able to make his pair of free throws Bruno is fouled inside Hell shoot quickly back to Jakari White An incredible finisher and and I think he made a good point defensively last year was one of the better defenders on the perimeter in the Summit League and youve already seen that against Ryder today He has a level of instincts that is elite Uh theres no better way to put it about him and he plays very fast Hes quick on his feet Bruno has been a surprise too A pleasant one for Virginia They lead by eight Johan the seven foot freshman from Germany chose to come to UVA because of the tradition of winning He said this program this coaching staff can turn me in to an NBA talent Knocks down both I would say thats for sure He also said he was excited about playing in a big gym with a lot of fans but were already seeing that here in the season opener Yeah hes getting it Great crowd John Paul Jones Arena holds just under cheering 15000 Youre definitely above 10 tonight A great crowd for the season opener Thats White checking Cruz work corner Binham doesnt catch the rim but an offensive board and a strong one from Caleb Smith Hell shoot two There has to be more assertiveness by when the shot goes up for Ryder that UVA they have to block out Now granted theyve only given up four offensive rebounds but seeing that Ryder has a total of 11 in this game thats veering towards more than half of the boards that they have being offensive And so as soon as a shot goes up UVA they have to block out And thats a part of what has been keeping Ryder in this game is the opportunities that theyve been able to get on the boards Test Ditter back in for Sam Lewis Six points for Ditter today Three for four from the floor three offensive boards Thats the status circle there Keinska comes in as well Back end for Smith cheering Its going to sound crazy but Ryder has a Georgia to Rider pipeline Caleb Smith is part of it Hes from Atlanta and a JCO product Went to Pratt Garden City gets a big pair there UVA only up seven This guys been a force underneath The take kicks on Rollins And if aint broke no need to fix it If youre UVA continue to pound the basketball on the inside Ryder has yet to have an answer for the bigs down low When they get the ball they possess patience back to the basket and able to turn and face Whistle on that press Lets take a look at the ner bucket When he gets to that right shoulder it has been game over Able to elevate over top Such a soft touch around the basket for Derritter cheering Khan Grunlo got a piece of that See who they credit that with Keinskas hits the first after the foul against Chance Mallerie who was whistled for his second That was during the press Fuller enters And we have to talk about the big difference maker in this game when it comes to the stripe Now Ryder is eight for nine from the free throw line misses that one But UVA theyve had 17 opportunities at the strike but theyve only cashed in 10 The Jinx is very real time 544 to go They work it Derritter White whos lethal from three comes up short I think Cruz got a piece and a defensive board from the Bronx Ryder pushing entry Fuller didnt get to him Bruno deflection Bruno he was able to just show his hands able to easily tap over top without breaking his plane of verticality on the defensive end of the floor Where two always flash Burton short corner cheering whistle and a foul called I think they got Don Hall Yeah his first Ryder has been living at the free throw line in these past couple possessions and Burton has been solid from for them from the stripe Hes currently three for four Theyre shooting 80 as a team And thats a way to generate points with the clock stop You continue to find ways to get to the free throw line and make sure that youre cashing in cheering Burton misses the first Well during shootound today coach Bagot was pretty candid about the team struggles during the shoot around during the practice the walkth through He said We need to be much better tonight at seven And theyre hanging in there with the preseason top five team in the ACC Theyve been very competitive Uh theyve been talking on the floor which I think has helped Theyve been also switching from zone to man defense and so theyve been giving UVA different looks Doesnt matter for the river What a move Driving down the floor middle of the lane and again getting to that spin Hes now up to 10 points Projected second round pick in the NBA draft Went to college because hey maybe theres more earning potential Well were seeing it already Dejinskas to Fuller at the key Stop Go inside The trees are down there He stepped on the baseline applause cheering That was excellent defense by UVA on that possession to move their feet be very active One thing Ryder has been doing consistently is refusing the ball screens So what do you do when you refuse the ball screens You got to be able to get low and laterally slide Great possession for UVA in showing that cheering entry Der Hes got 12 No answer for the big guy thus far Hes showed that he can score off the dribble creating for himself but also being able to move without the basketball in his hands and allowing for his teammates to find him Big four minutes coming up here for Ryder Trying to hang in there stay in the game into the second half Lion Cruz was a preseason cheering all player but he gets it to Flash Burton whos outperforming him today trying to draw the foul Didnt get it They push the pace to Hall Skip Grunlow seeking entry The BYU transfer Hall works inside That was off of Ryder 331 to go Ta Ritter is a presence early The 69 22yearold freshman showing off his move music Ryder is challenging the out of bounds call at the 331 mark All right So this is new to college basketball here in 202526 And lets take a look at the new rules here So if this challenge is successful for Ryder they will get another but that is it If it is unsuccessful they forfeit their challenges Will not have another And theyre challenging here the out of bounds call Takira Yeah And well get a look at the out ofbounds call As you see you can challenge at any time the out ofbounds play And so within that Ryder theyre currently down by 11 points I think coach thought this was a good stopping point if theyre able to win this challenge and they might actually It looks like the ball is grasping out of bounds as it was making its way over to Jakari White by Hall Hes on the baseline puts two hands on the basketball to try to get it to Jakari White Now the original play was that the basketball was touched by McNeel What Im seeing here is that Hall on the baseline drive to the left You see the ball bouncing the rotation boom boom boom By the end in the hash mark it looks like the basketball touches out of bounds And so I think this is going to be a successful challenge call here by Ryder and it should be going the other way So I think that was a a good heads up call by the coaches over there on the Rider sideline This isnt as a brilliant of an angle as weve seen of them But those first two angles I think I think Im pretty right here Were going to write it down if Im going to be one and with this new challenge rule that we have in college basketball cuz it definitely looks like the ball after we do the call on the floor will be reversed Look at that Ball will be right Ryder will retain the one remaining charge for the game anyway and will not be charged to timeout Ty one for one Come on Give me some pound Give me some pound Put the stripes on her Dont do all that now I dont want to ever ref They have a very uh what do we call the the refing job I would say it is both bittersweet Its a lot that comes along with being a ref Bill Cington Anthony Eids Randall Wells on the call But Ill have to say job well done by Ryder to be able to identify that they wanted to look at that one being down by 11 points here with 331 left to go in the first half and now they have a chance to cut it to a single digit game You can also use that time as a timeout right Oh correct And Im pretty sure that they did that It took quite some time for the refs and theyre still discussing something over there but to go and review it So they were trying to reset the shot clock as were about to get back into the ball game So they do reset the shot clock 30 on it and Ryder gets a break Trying to cut it back to single digits Jamir McNeel the freshman whos helping with the teams ball handling this year Its improved because of that man right there Number five with it Cruz working against White Get space Lets pull up Jay Get him going Zion Cruz Hes got seven That play starts with Dio though What a screen He completely wiped out Cruzs man He was able to pull up at the free throw line No one in sight Pure jump shot Yeah that was Jakari White who took a hit You can tell Thomas for three Strong offensive board Jakari White Hall Hell try one Thats strong as well Third chance Thats been the fail save But back to Thomas No good How about a fourth chance Jakari White for three cheering Pulled in by Dio Wow cheering Ryder trails by nine Burton gets tangled up and the possession arrow is to Ryder Well going into halftime one thing Ryder will be talking about the offensive rebounds UVA has 14 of them in this game They have more offensive rebounds than defensive Just not able to capitalize on them though because they have been short with the three ball Something that coach Bagot talked to us about during shootound Cannot let them get too many offensive rebounds Thats happening Ryder still staying in it down nine Flash Burton has been the guy that continues Hes got the seven Flash Burton has such a pure pullup jump shot and every time that he sees daylight hes ready to pull Hes got 15 cheering And Ryder theyre sticking true to this zone due to the fact that the Whos theyre just 11 from the outside It hasnt been a factor for them this threepoint shooting Taste of the old medicine for Virginia No good for Grunlow HELL TAKE NC AND SLAM IT HOME Oh no Coach Bagot hes not happy But what a slam And were going to head to timeout here as UVA is up 3829 music music Johan Grimlow has been an impact player for UVA so far throughout their first game The 7 foot freshman Look at this tie Now would you believe that hes a rookie the way hes able to follow up put it on the Riders head They were down low trying to stop and be ri protectors Not today for the freshman 7footer That one got him hyped as hes talking to the camera the crowd I dont know who but man what a way to put an emphasis on the game when his team needed a basket desperately right there from Germany He played on the German U8 team and was a force in the middle Four blocks per game is what he averaged cheering Here comes Virginias defense Watch out below with Paul applause and cheering Such an unselfish play by Mallalerie Guardto guard on the break Able to get down the floor with the quickness Hall with the lay Flash Burton with the basketball Hes got 15 of the teams 29 Left side Cruz who has seven Big possession for Ryder Smith turns the corner will stop the clock and shoot two UVAs defense meanwhile on display early Ty Well its the way that theyre jumping into the passing lanes being first to get out and then the pass in transition from Mallerie to Hall Easy buckets in transition are key And that music is on display The fastness the pace the quickness in which coach ODM desires his team to play with Virginia five steals Chance Mallerie got two of them First one good from Caleb Smith Hes got three points and UVA they found themselves in this fouling position because every ball handler for Ryder has been in attack zone specifically off of curls and they have been late to recover on these curls and then its resulting in the guard trailing the play a big man having to step up in their place and so thats something that theyll have to adjust in the second half Mallerie with speed will shoot off the foul against Cruz and just had a step coming downhill Now he looked like Flash And Im talking about the Marco character on that one The way that he was able to just be so speedy down the floor I blinked and he was already at the basket laughter What a cool story Chance Mallerie Remember he committed to Tony Bennett initially decommitted when Tony Bennett retired ODM kind of had to rerecruit this guy and he was able to do so ODM said its its hard to describe what this guy brings to the team because its so many different things Chance Mallerie the freshman Well certainly I think the best word that coach used for the freshman music is unique Smallest on the floor but has a tight handle plays very physical and another person who can step up music and hit the three ball We havent seen it here just yet but he has that in his bag and is able to catch it at the free throw line And man I have loved the type of aggression that Mallerie has played with cheering thus far Got four points Chose to stay home over Tennessee Villainova Virginia Tech Vanderbilt Clemson Miami List goes on and on This is Smith Big touch Scores How about Caleb Smith Yeah hes been very cheering good down the stretch here for Ryder in the first half finding ways to get to the basket Two possessions ago able to go to the free throw line that time getting a paint touch able to score the teardrop Mallerie can just about take this thing down cheering and go with 11 Don Hall kicks Mallerie He stepped out Yeah With 43 chance Mallerie turns it over and Ryder will have a chance to cut it to single digits Have to advance the ball Well G them Im trying to get the ball and the hands of Flash Burton who leads all scorers in this game with 15 See if we can make some magic happen applause 29 now That was off of White Probably better positioning now but not enough time especially with the fullourt pressure that UVA is putting on here Itll be Smith from half court to strong Adrenaline rubbing high in this building tonight Today has been such a big part of the offense Back underway Tyra Carter Kevin Dmenico with you 4232 Virginia on top and the first foul had charged to McCabe Well the fouls definitely racked up in the first half and its carrying over to the second already for Ryder Thats their 13th foul of the game but McCabe thats four personal fouls for him So hes going to have to come out and not even a minute has ticked off the clock here Well hes in the game right now Theres a three ball from the far corner and its an offensive board from Thomas You remember McCabe sat a lot of the first half Hes a big part of this team He sat because of those fouls Theres Derritter dropping off for the other big and its Grunlo who will shoot And Dio picked up that foul right there And hes known for being a rim protector trying to contest at the rim But that was just a little too much right there Drop coverage breaks the plane of verticality and thats an easy foul to call I would say nearly every single time for the refs That has been a a point of struggle for Virginia so far Theyre 12 of 20 from the free throw line and theyre up 10 right now right They make even half of these free throws Were looking at maybe a 14 16 point game here and so they have to focus and I can imagine at their next practice its going to be tons of free throw shooting to come Flash Burton with the basketball Hes the star for Ryder in the first half 15 points leading all scorers Ta Ritter has 12 Hes second headed the other way Moving screen by Fuller You have to wait for the guard and its usually a twoway street right there but have to be set before you move on the screen And so Fuller hes not even cheering fully making a fuss of it because he knew that he was not set Don Hall right side to Lewis Malik Thomas relatively quiet so far Seven points averaged 20 at San Francisco was top 25 division one last year This is down low to THE FRESHMAN GRUNLOW OH PUTS IT IN And Gruno he was able to make cheering something out of nothing with that possession The ball they never saw a reversal with it It stayed on the left side of the floor the entirety of that possession Yet once they got that post test they were able to find success Ryder stagnant offensive early in the second half Got five to shoot Burtons got to go Burtons got to go right now cheering Runs out of time That is the first shot clock violation that weve seen in this game with that pressure defense by Virginia Thomas He knew that he could not give Flash Burton any room to breathe If he did he was going to be able to get a shot off Great heads up pressure defense by UVA Ryan ODM knows what this crowd brings when a shot clock violation comes Talked about this earlier at shootound He said You get a shot clock violation theyll get up for you First of the day right there Open look Thomas on the offensive end continue to struggle from deep going to stay Virginia two for 20 for Yeah And you dont get a cleaner threepoint look than Thomas had right there on the wing The ball head went to the top of the key back to Thomas where he was completely set Not a defender in sight You just got to be ready to knock it down Two for 21 Thomas one for five Don Hall one for four This to improve that percentage Lewis led THE MAC IN THREEPOINT SHOOTING percentage last year at Toledo What an addition for coach ODM Most certainly in the corner off the baseline inbounds play was just ready to catch and shoot the basketball Miscommunication and its all Virginia second half And Dio hes telling Flash Burn if youre going to MAKE THAT JUMP PASS Im set foot Throw it up Im going to get it at the rim And if not Flash he has struggled to start the second half after having 15 points in the first half I would have liked to see him take the floater in the lane right at the ACC logo These are things you learn right And thats one of the goals for coach Bagot today is to compete show your toughness and learn a little bit about your team Dinner Oh he can do it all Thats from the short corner applause Coach Bagot hes going to take a time out here before this game gets far too gone and out ahead But the atmosphere its jumping in Charlottesville as Virginia is leading this thing Coach ODM said pregame we want our defense to be suffocating music It was a couple possessions ago And look at the pressure defense by Malik Thomas Hes all up in the grill of Flash Burton Give me that And that gets the crowd on their feet Head taps across the board They know what to do when theres a shot clock violation as the first of the game Virginia leading by 18 applying that press regardless Thats Keinskas breaking it Check by Hall McCabe playing with four cheering Hand off Cruz Triple from the key Catches nothing Hes going to hear it from this crowd And even though Cruz air ball on that possession something UVA has to continue to be disciplined on is not allowing for him to even get that shot A lot of space by Thomas as he went through the screenhandoff where Cruz was allowed to get the basketball back So theres a twoway street of some learning there but also ending the possession with the air ball going out of bounds UVA has already scored eight quick points in the second half After that McCabe is out Flash Burton back in Leading score Hall has a step kicks Thomas triple right side Thats strong Its pulled in by a leaping Cruz Ryder trying to steady the waters The entry and a foul ono Well Enso again when UVA players get caught trying to defend from behind it has resulted in a foul call more times than not You want to try to front or or let them catch and play straight up First look for Helterhoff leads to a trap Its Burton finding a cutting Smith up and under Shooting two coming up And Im almost shocked there that Smith decided to go second side It seemed as though the left was a clear path to a easy layup but nonetheless able to draw the foul Flash Burton able to break the trap finding Smith on the opposite side of the floor He goes up and under and gets smacked right on the head on the way up Caleb Smith has found his way to the line a couple of times tonight cheering Three for four from the stripe cheering Shooting at the band They impacted that time Yeah its a little different when youre on the side of the floor where you got the band in your face Theyre holding up trumpets and all types of instruments trying to cause some disruption cheering And there it is Smith goes 0 for two A rare 0 for two for Ryder Blocking foul on the other end Smith pushing in And its charged to Keinska One of three scholarship freshman on this team What do you think Yeah hes moving He was never fully set or had established position and Lewis was able to just dip his shoulder and use his frame to draw the foul 1610 to go second half Virginia was off to a bit of a slow start Led by 10 at the half Theyve extended things here in the second half Theyre going to get Flash Burton here Its going to be his first Ryder already up to five team fouls Inbound to Thomas Corner Hall D Ritter turnaround Jay off the mark cheering Helterhoff finds Burton in transition Flash to Caleb Smith cheering Helterhoff says why not from the keep Well short Theyll get another chance Burton on the drive Cant finish Hauled in by Nitter And thats a a great take to the basket by Burton but he got up in there with the trees and adjusted it and down the floor Wow Ditter trying to go coast to coast This is Smith who throws it off of Thomas with 1515 to go Up and down the floor they go UVA of old is gone music 5032 Virginia on top of Ryder Its opening night in college basketball Thanks for hanging out with us Kevin Denico and Taikira Carter Pass inside Oh that was off of Cruz Its headed the other way The 10th turnover of the game for Ryder and its been such a difference maker UVA has 15 points off of turnovers here And then in this game as a whole Virginia has only committed two turnovers themselves So they have found theirelves really valuing the basketball Important for first year head coach Ryan ODM and impressive Mallerie swings Lewis Nice defense by Ryder with seven to shoot Wheres the bailout Its going to have to come from Lewis cheering Oh yeah thats definitely a foul Wow Oh Cash coach is not happy You play 28 seconds of nearly I would say great defense and then cheering at the very last second commits a foul on a threepoint shooter like Lewis to go to the free throw line And again thats another learning point early in the season If youre going to play defense with intensity like that you got to have awareness of the shot clock So the whistle was against Chris Keinskas His third foul Second one good from Lewis Its the freshman one of three scholarship freshman on this Rider team Another newcomer one of the many 10 newcomers on this Rider team cheering put it back again And Ditter he helps bail out Lewis who was only to make one of those three free throw attempts First to the basketball up and in for a layup cheering Burton for three cheering air ball but an offensive board with five to shoot Smith turning shooting getting fouled by Lewis St Louis is whistled Thats his second Well Lewis he bit on the up fake from Smith So at first he had solid defense going for him and then Smith hit him with a little bit of a up fake hesitation and thats where Lewis was no longer disciplined What do you make of Caleb Smiths game Hes been impressive Jo Yeah Caleb Smith hes been able to find ways to score whether at the free throw line moves without the basketball in his hands very well And I think that has to be a special characteristic from a Jo player like himself coming in and being adaptable Yeah these are the kind of things you learn in your season opener on the road against a power four cheering team if youre coach Baggy This is one thing he wanted to learn about guys like Caleb Smith from Garden City Community College cheering And the road ahead it continues to be tough for Ryder Theyre going to play against Ruckers Texas in 2025 national runners up in Houston So they have a schedule thats going to be full of and then off the pitch Gertru straight to the basket and one These fans have been waiting to hear this guys name Elijah Gertrude Torres ACL was out all last year Great to see him scoring a tough bucket Red shirted due to that injury Sideline for the whole season Strong man And I mean the the the free throws this is continuing Im Im a little in awe of how they havent been able to capitalize as a team Yeah theyre 14 to 25 and it is a coachs dream to even get to the free throw line 25 times in a single cheering game with 13 minutes still left to go here or a little over 13 in the second half Rejection inside Ugo again deep three nothing there Ryders going to get a break Hit up Yeah theyre going to Its going to be Ryders ball out of bounds cheering Shot clock should have reset Bagot making sure that thats the call Yeah the ball definitely hit the rim No protest from EBA The protest here is Odum He Hes mad He wants his team to get those extra or its not even extra but you you got to finish the possession with the basketball Ninth offensive board for the Bronx Burton controlling Had 15 in the first half nothing in the second half Zion Cruz empty on that one Corner triple no good Thats Antoine Wilson Thats last touch by UVA Riders going to keep it And another play where Ryder ends the possession with getting their hands on the ball Make that their 10th or 11th actually offensive rebound in this game cheering Helterhoff hand off Burton turns the corner Pull up Jay Nylon continues to roll Hes got 17 We havent said Flash Burtons name for quite a while in the second half Well thats because thats his first points here for Virginia Its the North Dakota State transfer Jakari White swinging to Elijah Gertrude Hall has been greedy from three How about White from the corner cheering Big time threepoint make by Jakari White who was able to float into the corner with ease And again well have to continue to emphasize the fact that he can knock it down from the outside with no issues 0 for five before that shot Whites got six Its all UVA in half two cheering He can do it defensively too Watch out below Jakari White cheering Thank you cheering cheering Well now theyre up 25 because music they have had so much more assertiveness of getting proper ball movement Everybody gets music a touch on this possession The ball goes from left to right getting it back to the left where Jakari music White is able to knock down the threepoint shot So they were able to balloon this lead to 25 points due to the unselfish play Not taking the very early shot but looking to get that great shot with ball movement Yeah good stuff Ty That UVAs outscored Ryder 18 to3 in the second half And you kind of seen why Yeah I think for this team theyve settled in more and although they want to shoot more threes generating the threepoint shot has come in different looks in the second half just due to not taking those tray balls so early into the shot clock Wilson on the dribble drive He turns it over Oh Enzo Now its White WHO HAD THE THREE BEFORE THE TIMEOUT OH CANT FIND THE TWO THERE IS THAT NOT basket interference Goodness Somehow sneaks out Entry Shimani Fuller Cant finish but a nice move This will stay I think they get White How close was this to going down Jakari White is able to cross over from left to right Everybodys playing at the rim Okay Yeah In and out Maybe not I thought Wilson had pulled down on the net and that was what caused the ball to pop out Miscommunication Game one error Ryder commits another turnover And thats their 13th of the game And anytime that I used to throw the ball like that just straight out of bounds towards our coach used to ask me Do you want to come and sit next to me over here with that type of Is that what youre trying to tell me laughter Well I think its the massive contrast between turnovers Ryder turned it over 13 times in their exhibition UVAs only turned it over twice tonight Yeah they have done such a great job of treating that basketball like its gold And when you have gold and you have rubies and you have pearls you take care of it Mallerie catches drives lobs Grunlo comes down with it He is harassed and fouled by he had Fuller there But you give it up to the big man because not at any point of him grabbing that basketball did he bring it down Had he brought the basketball down it would have been game over where the little guards would have came in there and wrapped it up and we would have potentially saw a jump ball So thats just strong for him Saturday morning at 1000 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be here in Charlottesville to get you ready for another full day of football with a 2hour pregame show Theyll have game previews along with expert analysis and featured stories all here on the ACC network in the allnew ESPN app Big news for UVA and UVA football continue to rise Theres college football playoff talk in Charlottesville Offensive board yet again leads to a Thomas look Mallerie whos it going to be How about Hall from three Just shy This is pulled in by Caleb Smith whos had a good game Yeah and Im not mad at that shot Three passes to get it to Hall for the opportunity on the outside and then solid defense to retain the possession transition Thomas met with a double team and thats excellent defense from Ryder tying him up It was able to double down low get the ball back and well see if they can generate some offense on this possession which has been very hard to come by for the Bronx in the second half Mallerie The intensity somehow that stays in Ryder holds on with Smith Foul line extended 15 to shoot Crowds loving it Theyre used to this cheering Are they ever used to this circus shot cheering from Kajinsk is no good And it starts with the defense by the rookie Mallerie AND THEN A THREEPOINTER DOWN YOU BET applause WHAT HASNT RITTER SHOWN IN THIS cheering GAME knocking down the three 19 POINTS FOR the freshman The Whos have come alive in the second half Trey music ball up top music music Stay for Virginia Theyre on a 9 nothing run in the last 2 minutes 44 seconds The big men have been doing it all night specifically in the second half Its been a freshman freshman collision here for the Cavaliers 19 points for Gritter 10 points for Grunlow It has been nothing but efficiency for the big guys and they have been playing off of one another Thats a special duo brewing Well if youre a Virginia fan I think it can take a lot of solace in the success of the bigs and the guard play will come along Its a hard foul delivered by Don Hall Again I think its worth repeating here for Virginia Just struggled from deep right five of 26 tonight That will come along but your bigs its such a good sign for whats to come in ACC play And Kevin our anticipation tonight was to see the guard play really jump off the page especially seeing that Thomas had led the Cavaliers in the exhibition game against Villanova but a different story And I think that speaks to matchups right Ryder is a smaller team and so theyre taking advantage of what their bigs can do on the down low One of their stretch guys Deon Tillis out tonight I think its opening some doors for those freshman banks Most certainly Yeah 6435 Ryder has struggled to say the least in the second half Smith cheering denied Gertrude making the play applause Where to next How about the freshman Mallerie cheering AND MALLERIE SAW A LITTLE BIT OF DAYLIGHT JUST enough for him to take applause one dribble His defender dropped back and able to drop the three and he is a player that gets going his motor off of the excitement of the atmosphere the crowd as a whole You can see he gets hype every time something good happens I think hes just having fun Hes been in this crowd so many times as a fan Grew up in Charlottesville went to high school less than a mile away and this is just its fun for him Almost certainly Tess taking it down the floor They reset with Hall to the corner for Gertrude Gallon transfer from BYU They swing Mallerie Oh he wants another cheering applause I love it Hits the triple on the left side of the floor He says Hey how about I try one on the right His confidence is rising with each possession and then right back at it on the defensive end of the floor where hes trying to cause havoc cheering Selected by his teammates as the sleeper pick to explode game one cheering Boy is he ever in the second half Hes got 10 on two threes Well I say no sleeper here And if so you guys better wake up He woke the fans up in the second half They got two to shoot Smith on the drive Excellent defense by Grunlow The pace on display Kirk Trude is strong More pace cheering AB Kulibali and rejected and a foul called the whistle Love how coach ODM was able to get him to recommmit to this school It just shows the love in which he has for the place that he grew up in Charlottesville Virginia Yeah Was committed to Tony Bennett Of course Bennett retires ODM convinces him cheering to recommit One for two for Ryder Hall entry Ditter spinning scoring And what a pass from Hall to find Ditter ducking in down low Its been an impressive opening game for the freshman where hes now up to 21 points 14 field goal attempts for him Most impressive part of this game I would say the fact that he is always ready to receive the basketball and then when he gets it hes decisive in his moves and what hes going to do with the rock in his hands cheering He just got whistled for a foul He cant believe it And I think he might have a case This is on the other end Derritter open You see the flash on the baseline His hands were ready He has been able to get to the spin back to the middle of the floor shoot the hook on either side And I love the fact that hes able to juice himself up at any moment in this game Now hes going to exit and go to the bench I dont think its going to be the last that we see of him with 635 left to go But man something special has come of Gritter cheering with this UVA program already Yeah you can tell this fan base loves him And he loves the rim Yeah cheering I think you make a good point right there He has been the emerging player for UVA today He has such a knack for the basketball and it comes with not desing himself on the inside Hes playing up to I would say his ability and potential already 22yearold freshman from Belgium a top international pro prospect for college basketball teams this year Lewis is going to shoot too Lewis was able to keep his footing not rise too soon yet when he was able to get up in the air draw the foul and hes been to the free throw line already seven times in this game Yet hes only been able to connect on two of them Part of the struggles Eva now 16 of 28 from the strike And sometimes that comes along with it when youre missing free throws early in the game Its like a domino effect of bad It trickles down to the team I think weve seen a better adjustment from the free throw line for this squad in the second half where theyre taking their time knocking it down cheering Contagious like a bad flu Oh man it is flu season All right too McNeel hands off Helterhoff Thats Williams with the ball getting it to the corner Just nothing coming of this offense for Ryder And four to shoot Helterhoff Turn around Jay is shy from the short corner If youre just joining us the second half is as lopsided as weve seen 326 UVAs outscored rider Itll continue cheering That has been a beautiful display of basketball with that possession where Hall we see guard big hand off GET IT BACK PUT IT down low Grun though able to kiss it off the glass I dont know if hes saying too small or count that with the finger movement It doesnt matter That is such cheering a proficient way to score around the basket when you get your point guard to able to facilitate down low to the roller Or was he doing 67 I I dont know Oh thats the new trick I like to call myself auntie sometimes and auntie dont really know that one as well Yeah Uncle Jason Sure Sure laughter cheering Helterhoff with 13 cheering looking for a cutting Williams who turns the corner finds Kulibali baseline The true freshman Its Helterhoff to finish Well a much needed basket to stop the bleeding Mal Yeah Mallalerie I think got fouled there on the touch and go They get Davis Bham Virginia in the double bonus A chance Mallerie was the catalyst midway through the second half 10 points hit a couple of threes back to back Yeah hes just been having a lot of fun out there I think what Ive enjoyed the most is watching him play so fast I mean hes hes very quick with the basketball in his hands and quick when it comes to deciding am I going to score or am I going to pass to somebody else as well his decision making has been so pure in this game So to come along with the fact that Mallerie has 11 points he has also been secure in taking care of the basketball with only one turnover that is a dream for a freshman whos playing the point guard position Well we asked coach ODM what was the biggest challenge in the off season in his first season as head coach at UVA and he said getting these getting these guys together We have 12 newcomers so helping them learn how to play together Thomas on the drive Empty with the follow Odeno applause Odeno Hes a lob threat All right And even though that wasnt a lob the fact that hes able to hang around the basket and see it come off the rim get up there the sevenfooter That was as easy as its going to come for him when it comes to putting that ball through the hoop Transfer from Kansas State Spent two seasons at Kentucky before that one of the many transfers the seventh on this Virginia team But I told Coach Odm I said Youve done such a good job at getting this team to play together early of course in 2025 And he said No its all thanks to these players Theyve taken it upon themselves to come together cheering I think this is a a group WHO SO FAR and this is just from interpretation right But they like each other and thats half the battle when youre playing on a team where theyre smiling on the bench right now and I would be too if I was up 79 to 41 But uh playing for each other is what makes I would say a team that could be good cheering uphalt themselves to being great You want to win for one another Thomas His pass stolen away McNeel other end He scores and snaps the scoring drought for Ryder Jamir McNeel out of Cap May Courthouse New Jersey with a quick bucket And so theres still things for a Ryder to be able to try to emphasize in this game and one of them is getting down the floor quickly so that they can put points on the board Ends up in the hands of Wilson on the drive Hell shoot two cheering And there goes that transition again for Ryder And well see those two on the other side of our break Ryan ODM hes cheering done a phenomenal job at all of his stops in college basketball And this has to feel so sweet as a former UVA ball boy for their home games when he was younger From ball boy to head coach What a story His dad was an assistant from 82 to 89 He spent grades 3 through 10 here in Charlottesville Well you heard it Learned to love the game here Virginia basketball Theyve exploded in the second half outscored Ryder 3711 And this was a first for them seeing Jakari White coming out of the timeout bringing the basketball up and then just straight attack mode where we saw more and more of that in the second half for the Cavaliers There wasnt really a nature for settling for shots Shot the three much better really struggled actually in the first half Were two for 20 at one point from beyond the ark Ugo nothing on the first senior from Nigeria 75 wingspan That would have given him the fifth longest at the NBA combine Crazy and he has used his body well to be a rim protector so far in this game Showing his arms on defense and then offensively as well He serves as a big target down low cheering Kulabali the freshman from Philly had a couple options to play across the country Wanted to stay as close as possible to home play it right Hes got the basketball at four AD driving has it stripped away by Lewis cheering whos got it now Back to Gertrude working oneonone against Telisandro Spinning no offensive board White sharpshooter scores When the reset is yourself getting your getting the rebound and able to take a couple dribbles We saw the shiftiness that came along with that threepoint shot White has been fun to watch here as well in his debut with the Cavaliers Itll be McNeel to shoot Another guy who can be a force in MAC play for this Rider team cheering Averaged 20 per game his senior season in high school just a year ago Adds that ball handling ability for this Rider team that helped him in the first half Breaking the press Williams back in for Ryder cheering applause And how about Carter Lane cheering Just one of the three returners for this UVA team from Charlottesville able to get some run here just due to the fact that UVA was able cheering to blow this one completely open in the second half Part of that St hands Bellefield conglomerate Gertrude empty on the bunny McNeel hands off Delisandro whos a Charlottesville native went to Fork Union and Wilson on the tough bucket That was a very nice job going to the basket for Wilson and having body control where he was able to shoot the ball off the glass quite easily Lewis fade away Jay is down Might see a timeout here soon from coach Odum to get some of those substitutes in waiting on the bench One of them is kid Owen Wilson who had that last bucket is rejected Oh just long for Gertrude Yeah overthrew him But still that only marks the fifth turnover for UVA cheering All right there he is Owen ODM the son of Ryan ODM team captain in high school moved all around was born in Blackburg when his dad was coaching at Virginia Tech And we can mark this as just another full circle moment here for coach Ryan ODM able to get his son in there And what a special night for coach ODM and UVA for Rider This may lead to more questions but there were signs Delisandro from deep No good Stolen away McNeel and theyre going to count it Thatll be goalending I would say for Ryder they just lost their scoring scheme in the second half However I give them a lot of credit because what we did not see from them is a die attitude They continued to play hard diving on the floor for loose balls I would say uh picking each other up in the midst of adversity going up against UVA And so though the score is not reflective of that they played really hard in this first game of the season And and what did coach Bagot tell us during shoot around today He said Our goal tonight is to play as hard as we can Yeah And I think they can put a check mark on that And theyve seen a number of guys check into the game and there it wasnt drop off in the category of toughness AND THERE IT cheering IS OWEN ODM FOR A PAIR applause Full circle night for head coach cheering Brian Odum His kid scores in his first win at UVA back home Man what a moment cheering Delandro THE CHARLOTTESVILLE NATIVE HITS the deep three for a silver lining
