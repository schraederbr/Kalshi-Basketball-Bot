season this year with the ACC Tournament of the postseason fast approaching the last time these two teams took the floor in Cameron it was reys pakmans threepointer in the dying seconds that gave Virginia a win in the next meeting though Kyle filipowski 20point game LED Duke to the ACC tournament Championship two of the top three teams in the ACC this year only behind North Carolina which will come to this building one week from today this is a heck of an appetizer course before that Feast good evening welcome to Cameron Kevin Brown CH chrisen delighted to be with you it is always a joy when Virginia and Duke get together The Last 5 Years these two programs have been the class of the ACC and its an extra Joy when it happens in this building look we could talk about players and maybe set up some of the game but the reality is youve got to deal with everything else this is Duke in Cameron in March oh boy right and because of of all these things right because of the atmosphere the environment that unmissable and irrefutable Aura surrounding the program its not just about playmaking its not just about your scheme and your execution it really comes down to having the considerable Poise required to be able to manage the things that you feel and look we feel it too as broadcasters we feel what players are going to feel I think this Duke program theyre fan base they take great pride in their greatness theyre not going to be comfortable coming in here if youre UVA but if theres one guy that gets it its Reese beatman Last Time Out game winner hes the only one on the UVA roster that has ever played here going to need Poise and a solid start for Tony bet to feel comfortable they open this building in 1940 a 3627 win over Princeton 1133 games later it is Virginia and Duke on the second day of March 2024 the Cavaliers start with the ball in a game officiated by Brian oconnell Lamar Simpson and Brent Hampton Jacob Groves back in the start starting lineup today for Virginia which has beakman controlling searching for Groves and giving it to him in the dying moments of the shot clock as Groves elevates and scores opening the game with a long two for UVA as we look at the Duke starting five the guards McCain roach and Proctor no Caleb Foster who is out for a second straight game with a right foot injury and there is Mark Mitchell getting to the line a chance for three on the opening Blue Devil possession and I I would say good start for Virginia you know tough possession didnt have much going Groves hits a good shot but on the other end so many actions to cover and so many weapons to deal with John shy told us shoot around they were going to involve Mark Mitchell early because when he scores we win he scores the first three for Duke off the foul against Groves well they win when McCain goes for 35 as well well so just down the road from Chapel Hill guys welcome to Durham Duke in Virginia the only time in the regular season this year points on the first possessions for both teams a basket by Jake Groves who then fouled Mark Mitchell for n one opportunity UVA and Duke meeting 179 between these two national champion programs as Kyle filipowski takes the ball down the floor off and Isaac McNeely Miss he tries to get post position on Jordan Miner he Ducks inside he misses he grabs his own rebound and scores thats big I like the initial surge because what it did was it negated a double so he was able to get that initial surge all the way to the block no doubles coming 101 ISO situation I the favor good offense Virginia Cavaliers at 218 third in the ACC at 12 and6 a bubble team in the field according to Joel lardy Groves off the mark from three filipowski with a rebound and Duke has a quick numbers Advantage here Miner comes back to defend filipowski has the switch on beatman and takes advantage thats going to be a great challenge for UVA is really stopping getting back in transition off of missed shots Virginia is always better frankly gosh every team in college basketball is better off of a main shot where you get your defense back and get set they may be dramatically so though the slowest Tempo team in America and they get a basket from Ryan Dunn on the lob from Reese pakman and Dunns got to be active in terms of his cutting and reading because Dukes is sagging off of him considerably to the point where that sagging Defender might help up on the basketball too much dun has to see and read the play he could be active and get himself an easy 20 points with back cuts Blue Devils the accs best offensive team I said easy 20 points yeah you had an easy 20 time again at Pitman High School yeah exactly Proctor little Oopsy Daisy tyres Proctor in the lane and Duke has scored on its opening four possessions against the third best scoring defense in America I think theres playmaking that is obvious but what you dont see is great spacing spacing allows Playmakers to make plays and Duke so far to start this game great spacing on the offensive end pakmans lob to Miner failed this time and Duke with the ball looking to make it five for five Mitchel backs it out to filipowski Proctor roach McCain the guards again if youre just joining us no Caleb Foster out with a right foot injury for Duke hell be out for some time according to jot Shire inside Mitchell from filipowski hes drilled by Dunn more free throws coming up for Mark Mitchell well the Last 5 Years Virginia irginia and Duke are tied at top the composite ACC standings at 67 and 28 theyre second and third in the League this year Duke the second highest scoring offense the most efficient offense in the ACC Virginia the third best scoring defense in the country and that bottom line number under John shy Duke is 30 and2 at home last time Virginia was in this building was the year before John shy took over they won that game two years ago February 7th 2022 on a ree and three with 11 to go sophomore Mark Mitchell 13 Point per game score has an early five Duke has great balance and a lot of that balance comes from a good action but B good spacy when you just play read and react option oriented offense its really not going to be about one guy or the other their balance is makes him so dangerous Virginia with the first substitution Andrew roie and he immediately throws it into the the Duke bench and look at the fans like what what a torturous place to play you step into the game and youre like let me just feel this out a bit right you felt everything walking off the bus and warming up and you turn it over and youve got to hear it from the faithful for opposing teams there may be no greater House of Horrors in college basketball than CERN Indoor Stadium 523rd consecutive sellout here and this is what Duke does to you up seven in the first Music 406 so beautiful today I dont always know what Im going to get with this team with your stability it almost becomes something where people are like ah were bored with stable right we expect championships and sometimes its your success that that elevates those expectations to an unreasonable level now should everybody play for a championship every single year yeah yeah sort of I mean realistically speaking though it aint that easy and the landscape has since changed where its going to get even harder for a place like UVA that maybe isnt the uh traction that some high level transfers want I think its going to be a challenge for Tony Bennett and hes probably going to have to adapt Mitchell Stuffs the shot attempt have done Virginia ball with four to shoot like how you play is has become one of your your greatest recruiters like kids want to know that they could come and in a way be showcased thats an easy oh it was an easy one and then D missed it he missed two in fact and beatman nearly had a third assist filipowski against the Freshman Blake buan terrific find for Proctor all set up by Mitchell cting Mitchell cting to the basket on on the filipowski drive just drug defense down flattened everybody to the point where filipowski could make that pass good to get Proctor going open from three you get Proctor roach and McCain shooting the three game gets really easy they are one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the country Duke they were well near the bottom last year ranking in the 200s nationally beakman off the spin beakman front of the rim no Virginia is two for n with two turnovers Duke is 5 for seven without a turnover Mitchell there you go and there is the first turnover a travel against Mark Mitchell poke it into action like this is a good find by Philip theres the cut right look at the defense freezes you cut across the face of a Defender they cant help but to at least watch you its like the Beehive effect in micro mini soccer they just follow the ball it it still happens at this level so if you could face cut somebody and hes a secondary Defender even not yours that Defender likely flows with you duke with two 7 nothing runs in the game Virginia looking to cut into that with mcneel a terrific shooter beakman that was kicked by filipowski reset the shot clock to 24 Virginia and one of the things for Duke too is is when you watch him you watch him shoot around in practice what you look for is like the improvements on the defensive end are they physical or are they you know about your rotations or is it about your communication which then goes back to that other point which is continuity something John shy talked about earlier this year when I had them against Louisville talked about the continuity dealing with injuries and and helping guys find continuity with one another its something you need to develop the more they play together the better they get at communicating the better they communicate the better defensively you get Caleb Fosters out again today theyve had some nagging injuries here and there have not been full strength for much of the year as beakman wraps around and scores his first basket see the graphic there it been about a third of the games this year Duke has been without a starter tyres Proctor was in the concussion protocol a couple of games ago Mark Mitchells missed a couple of games no major season ending injury but theyve had problem establishing a lineup and John sh said establishing role definition yep Philipi going to work on Buchanan and he muscles it in with the left an early six for filipowski who is putting his stamp down on this young Virginia front line well and you look at that you say well kind of a noncommittal dig down maybe noncommittal double well its hard to overcommit when you have shoot threepoint Shooters around the perimeter and a great playmaker and passer in Philipi you can and maybe could have taken a step further there floated it long a rebound for tyres Proctor slashing into the lane heres Philip psky for Applause three pretty sure I was calling that one before Tony bet it welcome to Cameron Virginia see home quote Explorer lets you easily compare home out of it UV is going to stay in Chase mode if UVA is in Chase mode going to be a long night trying to be on the first Blue Devil to lead Duke in points backto back years since Demarcus Nelson did it no 708 yeah thats the players whove scored a th000 points in two years the Millennium right that adds to the AA right the history its Coach K Court the dominance over the last few decades and youre not just playing against the players on the floor its almost like youre playing against the history of players that have come before these guys and I think that all adds to what makes this play special Reese beakman at the other end a chance for threepoint play filipowski picks up his first foul and thats a good response out of the timeout now Reese beakman tough Drive hes a physical guy he understands what it takes to win at this level not just play at this level question is can you find some stability in this game thats hard to do when Dukes off to the start they are all nine Virginia points either scored or assisted by beakman so far hes put in five set up the other two coming off a big game Wednesday in the win of Applause BC roach Proctor took a little bump off the hands of Mitchell Dukes second turnover The Bump by Proctor hes got one dribble theres no helps side there it it was just a bad angle drive if he can just gather himself with strength take one extra power dribble go up theres no help coming over and and thats Mitchell on the outside if theyre not leaving Mitchell youre going to have layup City or win at the foul line Ds got Sean Stewart on the floor for the first time TJ power as well 269 freshman John shy has been playing much bigger the last couple of games without Caleb Foster as Philip psky on the deck squirted it to Roach little Tick Tac to with steart fans are ruthless and I love it mcneel of three well short off the right hand of Buchanan this arena is the world leader in layouts for broadcasters yeah youre right I even did it thats a record hey uh tic tac toe is this what you called it maybe a little ping pong give and go what do we want to call it either way transitions been a problem and Duke continues to roll Music there they are not combined Dukes going to try to make it two for two for John Sher they got a big game next Saturday of course when UNC comes to town right now Joel lardi says five teams in in the ACC four teams are within a game of fourth place Clemson Wake Syracuse and pit that double by with the ACC tournament 10 days away in Washington DC those five teams by the way Carolina Duke Clemson Virginia and Wake Forest which is one of the last teams in right now weaks leading by nine at Virginia Tech which would be a terrific win for Steve Forbes group heres Jeremy roach first Miss three of the game for Duke and its right into the hands of Stewart a freshman from windir Florida hes got a couple of buckets times the worst misses are the easiest offensive rebounds I say sometimes I mean a lot of times part of the reason the threepoint shot is becomes such a revolutionary concept you get more offensive rebounds when you miss them but its also the movement and the spacing right its really hard to box out when theres so much space to cover on the floor thats not going to work Dante Harriss first shot is one hed like to forget filipowski from Proctor in the lane Philipi theres just particularly in transition where the defense def is really scrambling to get set see the ball contain the basketball theres not really much of an answer for Kyle filipowski in space theres no double and theres really no dig down because of his ability to pass filipowski singlehandedly outscoring Virginia right now and Duke with 16 of its 25 in the paint Blue Devils have missed three shots mcne is fouled from it appeared behind the arc wait for the from Brian oconnell and looks like he says a two shot foul only three a three did he signal three yeah his foot was over the line over the line or behind the line no the right foot was on the line it was over line shot Stewart with the foul I mean look we are like kind of Birds eyee view we we probably should be able to see this I saw one official throw three fingers up another throw two do you want me to go on my rant about reviews is that a good time for that I have a promo card in front of me so I dont know if were going to do that now or between free throws itd be a great thing for UVA right now right just a little review reset you may have time read your promo all right hey coming up next here at ESPN John its a Sonic Blockbuster Tuscaloosa the top two teams of the SEC number four Tennessee number 14 Alabama volunteers won by 20 in the first match up Dan J and Jess will have a call right after this game here on ASN how how many three attempts for Alabama over under 30 what do you think I mean when I saw 50 or 52 the other day I was looking for like loopholes in the NCA rulebook to find eligibility like thats awesome like even I think thats crazy yeah space and Pace I guess yeah Let Her Fly they go in Good Luck Stewart terrific f Philips got 13 and Sean Stewart playing really good minutes of freshman in the first half you know theyre getting extended good ball movement east to west spacing good movement and then good read and react offense thats what it is thats a read slip to the basket great find ball never really hit the floor Ryan dun spins right into Philip pasy its knocked away its a Duke takeaway a fourth Virginia turnover they have as many turnovers as made field goals youre rough Im honest I guess Philip pasy posting minor double team came a little bit from Dunn who deflects it proor in the back court with 10 to shoot Ryan Dunn a superb Defender is all over him Proctor with a step back two in and Applause out Georgetown transfer Dante Harris speed stir at the point for UVA with beatman back on the floor and playing off the ball get it off a screen from Miner missed a three rebound Shawn Stewart just think Dukes ball screen action is so difficult to defend with the balance they have and Stuart doing a good job getting to Open Spaces cutting off of it making reads and also making good passes all five involved in the action thats really difficult to defend I dont care how good you are defensively roach tough shot it goes for Jeremy roach who has been a Cavalier Crusher in his career that wasnt bad defense thats just the the way its going first basket for Duke second leading score thats whipped inside to Miner and Stewart takes it off the rim watch for Stewart running the rim now and beatman got back to ward off a possible alleyoop filipowski on the slip deflected pass to the hands of Dante Harris a takeaway for Virginia and then Harris gives it right back with a carry the nations best turnover team has coughed it up five times against this Relentless swarming dominant Duke Blue Devil defense they are up huge at home in the jack in there huh flag pay attention that was well wow well yeah apparently um geography Major John Crispen to my right the history guy not geography is definitely not the Union Jack and theres a reason why Kevin explain it please well first of all Kyle Phil pasks outscoring Virginia just to acknowledge the fine graphic put together by our folks uh John thought the Australian flag was the Union Jack going to break it was not tyres Proctor is from Australia and he plays for Duke so there you go I have one of those like you know broken twoway educations right half Penn State half UCLA I think I just missed that part of school right right yeah they teach flags of the Southern Hemisphere junior year at State College but sophomore year at Westwood obviously heres McCain whos yet to score and Y Duke is 12 for 16 two for three from three ballots three for three from the line ballots Kev they they really when you have so many weapons you can play to individual strengths and its really tough to cover and even Ryan young getting after it down low in a row wow man wow with t of a second remaining on the shot clock young is on the score sheet hes a six Duke player to score in this first half and Duke is five for its last six mcne got a look but it was too clean and a legal screen called against Jordan Miner I mean this is good Poise in a late clock situation its playmaking right and and you look theres two guys covering the basketball you just have to make yourself present and where your pres where you should be present is where you can get a catch Ryan young does that very well time and score he understands hes got to get a shot quick fifth year player started at northwester and this is game 151 in the career for Ryan young and he hasnt played a ton this season but you think itll be a big part for them down the stretch right it was big right there as he gave it to Mitchell for the easy two just watching his eyeballs hes got a good feel for the game right he he saw where two were coming at the basketball and he knew where the second defender came from and Mark Mitchell made the right decision to cut its good basketball thats all that is its an 80 d run theyve had three runs of at least 70 in this game and beakman air balls one from in the paint he may hear about that from a fan or two you think Virginia four for 17 heres TJ power young gets up for the offensive rebound triy its tipped to bman trying to steal a basket on the break and pman cant finish but he will shoot two when you have sobody weapons and when you space really well its hard to keep the ball from moving I mean this is just masterful its all that is Ryan young active eyeballs kind of feeling the game makes the right play Mark Mitchell finishes everybodys involved even the decoys are involved and they dont get enough attention right McCain may not have scored but his Defender not leaving him so in a way you you want to celebrate and reward that just like you reward the outcome of a made basket free throws good for bman Dukes coming off a win over Louisville Wednesday where they had 23 assists on 32 field goals thats their most assists in an ACC game this year eight assists on 14 makes tonight leading by 20 against his good Virginia team at home power freshman TJ power keeps that pivot foot down lot more minutes for him and Stewart in the first half with Caleb Foster out Mitchell again hes got seven in the first half dun deflected it there heres power got it on the rim at the end of the shot clock Mitchell grabs it heres roach and a couple of Miss threes for Duke Virginia yet to hit from three they have yet to really been able to get into their offensive action where where you can establish and figure out whats going to work right whether its the flare screen recre thats a difficult thing to cover this is just throwing the ball around and taking a shot good contest by shot clock should not have reset though and thats why Bren Hampton blows his play dead I go back to that a solid start with good Poise for a team that has only one guy whos ever played here thats a lot to ask and the solid start is not outscoring your opponent by 10 15 points its really just feeling out the game without losing the game and and thats been the biggest challenge what what I would like to see if on Virginia is get into some of the flare screen rescreens right some of your offensive action explore some of the counters within that action based on what Duke is doing defensively and I think Duke has had a good game plan you know Baseline Runners double screens theyre switching out on that good communication flare screen rescreens theyre communicating well there but youve got to explore the secondary options you have within that action to start to attack Duke with confidence you think Isaac m is thinking about any of that right now you to see of waving hands what about Andy cats whos right in front of him look out Phil UPI beakman denied by Mitchell Buchanan no Virginias just tilting at windmills right now they what Don kote okay all right all right sometimes I forget how dorky you are thank you proor McCain had Mitchell alive in the Baseline for a moment McNeely swats it in the a right to Roach back to Proctor good for three raise the Union Jack up high Ty Proctor with a triple oh Kevin Duke is actually at a point where theyre playing for one another not just playing with one another and I think thats thats where you start to see teams come together you start to seek out opportunities for one another move the basketball share it at a high level seems like every bounce is going their way Virginias not hit from the field about 8 and 12 minutes they havent scored in about two and a half McCain with a carry Virginia has scored 13 points Duke has hit 16 shots and heres one of them from Kyle filipowski you got really excited about this when I almost was talking through it how about the windmill Kyle Philip Bowski Duke is just at a point where theyre rolling basketballs fun when everybody gets a chance pit your Billboards thank you John ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by healthcaregov lost medicator chip visit healthcaregov to enroll today Music Applause Applause he guys that about 16 for 24 26 points in the paint going right for Duke right now theyre plus seven on the boards theyre plus three in the turnover margin and not often you see a sevenfooter John with a windmill delivery no this was pretty nice um this just been an impressive start and its really both sides of the ball I think defensively they theyve been really locked in with one another which is important the communication is there their execution in terms of their scheme their game plan its all there theres a Polish to Duke right now that makes them dangerous and people have that conversation well they final four good theres like 30 teams that can make a final four this year that its really about how polished you are and and how antif fragile your success is because I use that term a lot I think success is very fragile these days and youve got to be polished to withstand different schemes different styles and right now dke seems to have that rare threepoint attempt for Ryan Dunn is Off the Mark Virginia has missed its last 10 shots theyve not hit from the field and nine plus minutes and thats really like what Dyan said like thats really fueled the attack the transition part of this is so difficult I dont care how good you are defensively if you cant play with a set defense for most of the game youre going to struggle Proctor deep at the shot clock a deep three and a shot clock violation fifth turnover for Applause Duke re pman with seven of Virginias 13 theyre four for 22 hes hit two field goals hes assisted the other two heres Dunn Dunn gets free a screen for Buchanan and Ryan Dunn smashes the First Virginia field goal in eons in fact since the 1241 Mark so a 10minute drought without a field goal is snapped ferociously by dun and Dunn has to be aggressive if theyre going to Sag off a Dun and hes going to be able to get a catch you youve got to be ready to make your move just as he did on that last possession pipasi bodied up by Buchanan and if you dont youre playing four on five the whole night heres McCain hanging and hitting and the Freshman Jared McCain the likely ACC freshman of the year is on the Applause board Virginia try to string together a couple of good possessions give you something to feel good about going into the locker room that wont be it Groves way off the mark filipowski down the floor mcain just scored a little too far for filipowski will back into Groves is a big advantage on him physically and yet Groves has a block shot only his seventh of the year Well Groves did a good job of anticipating the spin and and his balance is what made that play heres banan around Mitchell Mark Mitchells called for his first foul we mentioned dun and theyre sagging off him a lot hes going to be the guy that its not really going to get passes taken away hes going to be able to get the catch about 15 18 ft but if theyre sagging its going to lead to a close youve got to get your angle on the catch and attack right away hes going to have opportunities with and without the basketball to score because theyre not really covering it tomorrow afternoon womens basketball triple header as the regular season closes for these six teams number one South Carolina still undefeated trying to finish the regular season that way against Tennessee Louisville Notre Dame two top 25 teams in the ACC and then Dukes womens team trying to sweep the season series with UNC all those games on ESPN and the ESPN app Le Buchan at a 52 free throw shooter goes 0 for two first two misses of the game for Virginia five for seven at the line heres a three in the corner McCain to strong and Buchanan grabs a rebound its a uv8 that is 21 and8 they played well this year but when they have gone down theyve often gone down hard as McNeely commits Virginias fourth foul of the half couple of weeks ago they had a loss 7541 at Virginia Tech their first five losses or first six losses of the Season were all by 16 or more so theyve been good in the close games where they can get into their action early they can assert the way they want to play but there are a few teams that struggle playing from behind early as much as Virginia which is the second worst offensive team by efficiency in the 15 years Tony Bennetts been in Charlottesville theres the reason why I said p in a solid start you dont need a great start just a solid start beatman came up to take that that one away what looked like it might be an uncontested dunk for filipowski its Elijah geru The Freshman getting some rare first half playing time for Virginia beakman the switch on filipowski tries to dribble past him draws the second foul on Kyle filipowski so where does Virginia stand right now theyre the six to last team in the field according to Joel lard right now or like in general well he gave us a 345 update so maybe a 650 update they might slip a little bit theyre 46 in the BPI in the net look even if Virginias down big and even if their odds of winning this game are insurmountable as mcne hits a three the second half really matters because the net takes yes margin of Victory into account do you like that do you like that I do I just dont know how much its measured because we dont know what the secret sauce is you can get into that when we come back at 30 to Music cabern 133 to go in the half because you asked a question Ill post to you do you like the margin of Victory matters in terms of selecting NCAA tournament teams no not really I mean I think the conversation like coach Greenberg brought up like the big 12 scheduling their strength is schedule and where they blow a lot of teams out early and then they beat up on each other and and theres like 15 tournament teams there I but I also think like we we use the wrong arguments like oh sportsmanship like toss that out the window like you play to win like the games not over you keep playing I I dont mind teams running it up at times like its not about the sportsmanship issue its just like whats the real point of blowing teams out I I would rather see wins celebrated more because winning is really hard at this level and every team out there at college basketball is going through the process of learning how to win year in year out especially with the portal in nil Virginia couple of fouls to give roach will get stuffed by pakman who spikes it out of bounds with one tenth of a second to go I we just say to be fair to the Big 12 uh they have the best record against other power confers of any power but Im saying you can manipulate the the rules a bit its not taken away from anything I mean this would have to be a tip cant catch and shoot with a t of a second no matter how much Duke tried thats one of the only things Duke didnt do well in the half the fewest points theyve allowed in a half this season Virginia 6 for 26 Duke 17 for 29 wow what a half by John Shys Bunch lets get you to the studio KC and DC to make sense of it all woo next week itll be even crazier if you can believe that when UNC comes to town tonight has been quite the opening course the amuse bu if you will the what do you not know terms do you not know words phrases Dukes up by 22 at the break Virginia hasnt been down this much at the half of 10 years and Kyle filipowski the best player for Duke the fans loving it behind Tony Bennett high five for everybody in blue my my gosh Duke domination Duke destruction it was as thorough as clinical a half as weve seen from the Blue Devils this year they played for one another right and they had fun doing it they had fun dominating the basketball game and thats really something that Duke has historically done right they theyve done a wondrous job of playing good clean basketball kind of putting on a clinic dominating opponents their fans love it they kind of in a way assert their greatness on the game I its been a master class first uh first half for Duke and I I dont know what UVA can do to come back in this game because of the ball movement because of the transition all those other things youre down a significant amount thats not even add it up but the reality is youve just got to play better basketball if your UVA tonights game track brought to by E Trade It has been all Duke up 22 59 for the field 288 in the paint seven Duke players have scored Virginias hit six field goals and Dukes starts with the ball in Philip howski working against Dunn who pokes it away Ryan Dunn who along with ree beakman be the Front Runners for ACC Defensive Player of the Year again this is a Virginia program that obviously hangs its hat on defense under Tony Bennett rarely do they see a half like this a three for the corner is good for Proctor and Duke starts the second half where it left off of the first the other easy way to point it out is one team is facing a set defense and the other is not and thats the greatest Advantage you have if youre Duke right now beakman somehow squirreled it through to Dun Rees beakman LED Virginia with seven only four Cavaliers scored in the half 6 for 26 one made three McNeely leans in left it short the putback is there for mcne hes fouled and hell shoot two now the initial attack in that play almost led to a turnover but the rest of it was good it was good ball movement they were starting to work together getting into actions where they got an open look but ILY just kind of short armed the first attempt but he knew exactly where it was coming off hows the second up Proctor Isaac M tremendous free throw shooter hits the first last time Duke allowed 18 or fewer points in the first half was last season against Virginia in the ACCC title game UVA scored 17 and they have really struggled offensively this year theyre scoring offense is is always down because of the pace at which they play theyre good threepoint shooting team but they dont shoot at a ton theyre 350th in the country in free throw shooting and has been the second worst offensive team for Tony Bennett in his 15 years as Virginias head coach if youre youre not getting to the free throw line youre not the aggressor and youre not working through progressions and options within what you do offensively thats good defense two blocks for D he ties up filipowski on the second and the ACC shot block leader Ryan dun will turn possession over I mean this is just physical play down there good for Ryan Dunn just fighting to to keep ground really thats a tall task but better ball movement is going to make it even tougher to defend and I love that he has just shot that shot good for him theyve been sagging so much at this point youre down what theyre down 23 at the time like Let It Fly uh really hard to have a guy on the floor that youre not respecting as a defense because yeah its five on four advantage defense Ryan DS first made three since January 10th at Georgia Tech I love when people are like hows he so open Im like uh By Design thats why roach tough angle shot off the right foot Jeremy roach a fouryear starter with a terrific finish his two makes today have been pretty difficult jump shots too pman penetrating wraps it around to Jordan Miner meramac transfer bman alone in the corner and backto back threes for Virginia so lets see if Virginia can find a little something called along two actually for bman lets see if Virginia can find something by getting their defense set Duke just has so many options so many weapons good action good ball movement like they had the first half theyre going to be able to pick out their options theres Mitchell who got going early for Duke drives it gets hacked by miner hard foul Jordan Miner second Applause I would argue almost maybe uh that there are more fouls on the dribble than there are even at The Rim I mean thats a hack job but you watch the ball handlers remember we we had the freedom of movement point of emphasis so what do we do we just blew the whistle every other second weve gotten away from that a little bit but theres theres got to be a middle ground where you cant ride the offensive player and check with your elbow with the body easier said than done still physical game but I just think somewhere in between you got to free up the ball handler because were doing a good job of allowing that wall up at The Rim more plays at The Rim good for basketball remember call the first foul was a post principal thats the dumbest thing in the world though call call the first foul in the drive if its I mean but but you got to do it early where you establish what youre going to call it its up to the players to adjust to it pman driving an in the Mitchell re Beakmans got it doz it in Virginia much better offensively to start this half like youre a baseball guy its like a bad if hes bad but consistently bad its up to the the players and the hitters to adjust to it the pitchers to adjust to that bad Strike Zone call the low strike early you better call the low strike in the ninth in exactly McCain catch and shoot and round it out filipowski crashes and its out of bounds off done offensive rebound for Duke with 20 to shoot its good to see Virginia play a little bit more freely on the offensive end just be on the attack get to the free throw line finish at The Rim I mean be the aggressor with absolutely nothing to lose at this point Mitchell inside againsts Miner position for Mark Mitchell and hes the third Blue Devil into double figures I think Duke fans can appreciate the development and maturation of a guy like Mark Mitchell where you know more of a I dont want to say a finesse guy but hes really developed in terms of his ability to manage and handle his body and that contact and finish through it something you have to just to throughout the course of the Season heres a steal off the hands of dun into the hands of Roach here comes bror with a Music jam do you want to make a joke about the Union Jack fan limiting myself to one Virginia is right at its season turnover number which is the smallest such number in division one beakman into filipowski Miner deflects it into the hands of his teammate Andrew Roy loads up a short three and filipowski will guide it out of bounds with Duke leading by 23 I told you I wanted to get this in if the game permitted and I do feel like the game permits it I Ive got to mention the Pitman High School boys basketball team my hometown my nephew Elijah won their South Jersey Championship today guess that means there the state semifinals I dont know how things go anymore Everything Changes too fast but congratulations to Elijah crisman and the boys my boy Ronnie Meers the head coach my dads a volunteer assistant and superintendent so congratulations boys thats fun stuff roach for the basket and Elijah joined the uh crisen thousand Point Club earlier this year too he did he did how many are in that now like five Joe Carly Elijah you my dad heres Buchanan over Philip Pas heres a nice finish for the Freshman Blake panan from cord Delan Idaho part of it is theyre just getting into offensive action the secondary part of it is like look Duke can you bury an opponent I think I think thats important Mitchell into Buchanan trying to do so offensively 40 points in the first half Dukes got a dozen in the first stretch of the second yeah when Duke has gotten set and got their communication going early on the defensive end theyre able to make things happen including this right breakout plays easy dunks at The Rim go get your defense set Duke still has to work and put this Virginia team Music away when are we going to B and Court storming I dont like Court storming never have you dont want 3000 people coming on the court fans dont belong on the court I absolutely feel like it was personal its gotten way out of control how many times does a player have to get into something where they get punched or they get pushed or they get taunted right in their face its a dangerous thing bigest story in college basketball this week wasnt what happened on the court during a game it was what happened on the court after it a week ago Kyle filipowski shaken up by a court Storm from the wake farest students youve been around this game a long time youve seen a lot Id love to know your perspective on the situation and what can be done going forward I think you know me well enough that you know Ill take a contrarian view to that and and you hear all those words a lot of times coaches dont like Court storms because theyre the the ones that get stormed right the upset we get that its Duke its Kentucky we know all about that but the reality is I would rather be a little bit more of a critical thinker than a reactive thinker we do that a lot in college basketball we overreact to a team that plays well theyre the best team in college baskball till they lose no theyre not somebody else right we overreact to a lot and the reality is it is both awesome and dangerous at the same time dont take away something that students will show up for the the hope that they could storm the court against Duke is something that they celebrate dont take that away but make some strides to make it less dangerous for players you got 50 security guards standing around that do very little if not nothing that the students just pile right through take make your 10 best teach them how to build a Flying V and you get those dang players safely off the court but I think thats the middle ground we just get so absolute when things happen we get so recent with our bias to the point where we just want to do away with everything right theres a handshake line altercation well why do we have handshakes no scratch that be a critical thinker and say no learn how to be an adult right why do we want to just eliminate things that we cant manage properly so I would say manage it first and then if they cant be managed cuz or that out of control something else needs to be done but I I I wouldnt I wouldnt go to the very end first right I I would at least start with a process that respects both sides of that which I do think theres two sides of it yeah theres and I appreciate your perspective on this theres fun theres safety can we do both at the same time I think we can as done stuffs it in and gets Virginia back with it 21 sorry for my my my rant well dont be sorry for your honest opinions I I think opinions have changed a week later when it happens in the moment people have a tendency to react and can we think about this can conferences think about this can schools put together a plan as Philip pasy finishes because you can tell students not to do it theyre going to keep doing it yeah Philip pasy having a fantastic game by the way 176 tonight as duke is all over UVA and gets a steal from McCain its McCain lefthanded for his second basket yeah McCains got a real good like stability to his game and when you have stability at a young age youre able to feel the game out differently youre able to grow within the game youre able to establish and kind of Define Your Role along the way and I I think thats the reason why hes been so good guarding McNeely there he forces him into a top two Mitchells got the rebound Duke is plus 10 on the glass but just to cap the point player safety is most important like these are guys that have careers I I respect the heck out of that they have potential they have careers these seasons what these coaches what these players what the staff and even the people that you dont even know exist within a program what they put into this team to to make a winner I you have no idea what goes into it but you look at that at the very bottom three unranked Road hustes this season all Court storming its not going to be a court storming today I feel pretty safe saying that thanks Kevin youre welcome when was the last court storming at Cameron I wonder well look thats part of the aura we expect 85 of the time here 960 and 173 all time I I would love to be the team that says yeah we expect to win but the reality is I played basketball for Penn State so thats not nice but it is true filipowski finishes again he is dominating this front line 19 for filipowski with seven rebounds and a couple of assists to boot when that ball moves east to west filipowski is founding way why hes is to get position inside that position is Seal position for a feet of the post but its also rebounding position where hes been very present Ro throws it right into the hands of Shan Stewart who then loses it back beakman off the steel and beakman will score by the way ree beakman with that steal has just become the alltime leader at the University of Virginia his 223rd career steel he passes oel Wilson CL pass of 84 for the most ever at UVA congratulations to re beakman who won the ACC defensive player of the year last year might well do it again what a fine by filipowski and Stuart could not reward him well bigman has tremendous instincts hes hes also been very well coached and thats a great find for mcne in transition UVA does not get a lot of transition baskets theyre going to take a time out to kind of control this thing slow it down a little bit down 22 okay when you turn around youre going to see some its N9 of 13 shooting four rebound or seven rebounds two assist really that that doesnt say anything about his game his game is so versatile in the sense that you can play through him hes a ball mover defensively hes been much improved from year to year yeah the dunk cool but the reality is and yeah these are big shoes Kyle filipowski has figured out how to win at this level and I wanted to take a step in his shoes it didnt feel so good yeah theres a reason why Im doing this and I guess that that ship would have sailed a long time what is your shoe size Im a 12 very average Kevin Im just average across the board but filipowski I want to finish the point though Philip palowski really gives you a different versatility because you could play Big with him because of his ability to play around the perimeter you can go small and play him as a big I mean theres so many Dynamic lineup options that that John Shire has and a lot of that center around Kyle filipowski theres a three for TJ power The Freshman from shrewbury Massachusetts with his 11th triple of the year now John Shire said of filipowski when your leading scorer when the guy whos been the number one guy in the scouting report for two years is all about winning thats contagious and when you see the way Duke has shared the ball of late yeah you see why its contagious but but winning is not just wanting to win right like everybody wants to win are you willing to do the things that are necessary that put you in the best situation to give you the best the highest percentage chance of winning those are habits thats welcoming accountability all the things that that I know Coach K programs always had which was good habits accountability you know playing for one another the discipline I think thats something the Duke program Still Still showcases turn around for Proctor boy Duke has hit some open shots and Duke has hit some contested shots well there comes a point where youre just playing ball and Duke right now is able to just play ball have fun kind of explore some things including a trap here beakman passes it across the entire length of Durham to set up Groves for a three beakman was six assists to go with 13 points and four rebounds and Jake Groves hits his first from Deep by the way ree beakman now third all time at Virginia in assists he passed Jeff Jones for fourth today so hes moved up to first in the steals list and third in the assist list all time in a decorated career in Charlottesville Cavaliers have a big hole to dig out of here though its all Duke and Durham true story theres nothing more marched than a conference title Chase its the volunteers and the Crimson to the SEC Crown is coming down to the wide experience number four Tennessee number 14 Alabama tonight on ESPN oh boy is that tasty both teams 12 and three tied for first in the SEC by the way dont sleep on South Carolina whos a half game behind those two but the BS and the Crimson Tide have played a lot of close games in recent years and looks at the do so again Dan shman Jay billis J Sims have the call following our game right here on ESPN oh God this place is great its its insane Tay Murray inbounding with a few dozen of his best friends in blue shaking their hands and fingers in his face and one fake baby yes which was just hoisted into the air during the timeout multiple times sure it was tossed cylinder violation oh yeah oh how about it thats the best officiating uh arm gesture the cylinder violation very forceful called by Bren Hampton but it is and and the truth is its probably like holding where you could call it every single play you know holding in football y thank you for clarifying not holding in Polo you much of a polo player chrisen not exactly no like the water kind or ride a horse you strike Mayes more the equestrian yeah totally Murray completely smothered filipowski knocks it away that is a shot clock violation and Duke has turned over Virginia 11 times today again the Cavaliers the fewest turnovers per game in the country at 82 I think the big part of that is is Duke making so many shots and having their defense set right theres a certain confidence you have when youre not chasing the play defensively Philip pasi in the lane leaning into Dunn stepping back on Dunn he draws a foul on Ryan Dunn Kyle Philip pasu will try to pick up a 20point game at the line like I would argue that even that play you could probably call a cylinder violation like its its really hard I just think its when youre trying to rip through and theyre really too close you have to basically not allow the defense to gain an advantage by by getting too close 66 free throw shooter Kyle filipowski who had not shot it quite as well the last couple of weeks turnovers were up but John shy said as before the game look nobody has more assists for us in ACC play than Kyle filipowski he has two tonight to go with 21 points seven rebounds and hes only committed one foul thats been an issue for them this year to early foul trouble against filipowski and this game had a really good flow to it the first half there were only nine fouls total so it was up and down and Duke was able to find a good good Rhythm obviously making shots getting defense set and pretty much all basketball players theyre Rhythm based you shoot a higher percentage when you shoot an in Rhythm jump shot an in Rhythm three its a higher percentage shot and they they just have to continue to work to sustain that for long periods of time off the gerd miss an offensive rebound for Ryan dun whos got nine points six rebounds three blocks tonight he and beakman and McNeely have scored 32 of Virginias 30 n as that shot by Harris hit nothing and the camera crazies make sure he knows it ruthless Id say perfectly ruthless there ruthless and theyre intelligent yeah they know exactly how to get in your head they know youre major they probably know where you had dinner last night they know all the scores of your games and by the way its got to be some kind of a fire safety code how many of them are jammed into the bleachers there Mitchell deflected Away by Dunn his fourth block shot of the game stop trying to ruin all the fun Kevin getting the Fire Marshall involved jeez yeah cuz Im the first person whos ever brought that up John buildings been open since 1940 heres Murray knocked away good play there by Jen Blakes Junior from Somerset New Jersey getting some run inside filipowski miss a dunk 40 points in the paint for Duke the 41st and 42nd just went off the back rib Gertrude Crossing his way over Mitchell and Virginias got called here scoring Dr out of around three minutes for the Cavaliers taking shots is a lot different than running offense and running offense doesnt have to be a set Play Its just get some movement get into some of the actions he you like explore it you talked to Che around about how hard it is to guard the flare screen rescreen Virginia does so well we havent seen them have a lot of success tonight with it I think part of it wow mcain theyre going to count it I think part of it is defense had a good game plan theyve executed and its just been hard but how about mcain not really a guy thats had too much going he gets one to go there its been the Kyle filipowski show filipowski has just been terrific in every way being able to pass the ball play through him man gets everybody involved Dukes just continued to roll d d couldnt help himself Cy oh D yeah thanks DC I love being in studio with d why why is that he keeps it very entertaining threepoint play for McCain like lets just say that theres this whole thing about broadcasters never never lose not the case with d lets only hope we get one more Studio update during todays game by the way uh Wake Forest a week ago as we all know beat Duke storm the court everythings great neot a shot wake farest going to the NCAA tournament wake 0 and2 this week losing at Notre Dame outscore by 20 in the second half against Virginia St thats good news for Virginia Which is also on the bubble and seem to be a little bit ahead of wake farest but the Demon Deacons have a lot of work to do still to be that fifth ACC team and frankly Virginia has a little work to do to be the fourth ACC team in the field young going to work on Groves back rim and its up for grabs its saved by Blakes Stewart smothered and rejected by Jake Groves I think back to that point like is the goal just to make the NCA tournament is the goal to feel good going in into the NCA tournament where you can win some games like just see a lot of teams faltering down the stretch and I dont know how you feel good right you feel confident going into the NCA tournament if you struggle to score right if you cant get stops like if you cant close out an opponent I just think how you feel is going to determine a lot in the NCA tournament cuz teams are still new to one another three for roach Stewart making the most of his is playing time sets up Blakes for another Miss triple Duke is five for 15 from three got a little weird release huh little different Im certainly not judging look at Blakes though fighting for the ball takes it away from beatman blaks waiting for his teammates to join him and roach will hold it with under five to go game of The Dukes led by by as many as 29 Virginia LED at two nothing never since roach spinning roach fading rebound of Dante Harris Dukes missed its last five Virginias W for its last seven beakman makes it one for eight this game has come screeching to a halt offensively well Dukes not on the accelerator theyre going to run some stuff theyre going to get but really the ball is just kind of staying where it is theyre not in attack mode and its fine theyre up big its only 4 minutes and 10 seconds left again Virginia what youre playing for is your efficiency that matters in the net ranking their net ranking is going to take a big dip youd imagine after today down 27 at the under four thats why Reese beakman still out there McNeely done Harris with a three no good rebound tipped out to beatman will drive it into young and he will finish 15 for Ree pakman and Tony B its going to take his third timeout well take it with him come back put a bow on this thing from Cameron indor Stadium Blue Bloods contenders neighbors and Rivals the heels and the Blue Devils lets go they always respond such fire from both the games a marathon year after year it always delivers they are are ready to Applause rock guys we look forward to that the nations number one team player of the game here brought to you by Voya it is Kyle filipowski 21 points N9 of 14 from the field seven rebounds two assists three Steals and even more that goes beyond just his stats everybody got a little jacked up here Kevin why because Spencer Hubbert is in the walk on Guard were in 55 58 157 senior 58 wearing the double nickels is awesome thats right he hit a three against Louisville Wednesday the crowd went bananas TJ power will hit his second three here if they get something that a TJ power down the stretch what a lift that would be AG I agree I I mean just look you get enough on tape what you become as a threat to your opponent so hes another guy that you got to prepare for on the scout number 32 in the country coming out of High School freshman for Massachusetts theres a three for beakman whos up to 18 for UVA I think Beakmans got so much more in terms of his offensive game that we we just almost untapped you see it at times obviously today is a bit of an outlier hubard every time he touches the ball theyre going to lose their minds in the Cameron crazies heres young into the body of groves young find Stewart he finds the rim ferociously Patman fouled by hubard raises his left hand make sure everybody knows he committed the foul lets take a look at the dunk one more time I mean this is just pure vert you know and a and a stinky face at the end I want to do I do want to make the point about hubard right they they cheer and its kind of like oh its great good for him I mean this is a dude that if he went to the IM building hed smoke everybody oh no doubt like I think you underestimate how good WalkOns there are at this level and also by the way these are the people that get you prepared yes every single game theyre studying every other team look I transferred I just sit out of year I loved being the uh the the red shirt whatever though that was something else but no like being the the scout team guy like theres a certain pride in it and thats ultimately what this reward is all about youre rewarding guys that are dedicated to the team but never really get to pay it off and oh by the way theyre pretty good yep power in and out would have been his third three bles out hub no you were rooting for it were you Im Im Im not biased okay I was just setting up the call were you going to go back broadcaster no if I do that I owe Mike Breen a 50 piece true oh look theyre at a double hubt fouled its the fifth against Virginia speaking of Mike Green NBA Saturday Prime Time on ABC Nicole yic in the Nuggets LeBron James nine points away from 40000 his Lakers at home 830 Eastern 730 central ABC NBA countdown starts at all a half hour earlier who Lakers LeBron James Lakers Austin Reeves Lakers as well Jaylen Blakes noow go on the jumper Tracked Down by Harris under 90 seconds to play in a game that has been owned by Duke from start to finish and Dante Harris will shoot two Virginias got one game left in the regular season Georgia Tech a week from today at home which is not a game thats going to give you a quad one or two win you win that game you get a double by into the ACC tournament and they may need to do a little more work there as you look at Virginia now do you see an NCAA tournament team not just tonight do you see an NCAA tournament team on the whole I would like say sometimes MH incrementally but but on a whole no not particularly I I hate I hate to say that it sounds insulting but when you cant create offense I have a tough time thinking youre going to go to the NCA tournament and and win games you youve got to be able to create offense youve got to be able to score enough to be able to get your defense set they were never able to do that they were never able to slow down the attack from Duke I do think they have it in them and and I got to say the week might be the best thing for them sure you know lets lets reboot right unplug it plug it back in 10 seconds later really get to work on some things build confidence throughout the course of the week and focus on the things that theyve done well this year I think thats the thing they have had good games hubard gives it up to Blakes the crowd hates it Neil begovic is in the game hubard down the lane hubard loses it out of bounds uh begovic a grab transfer from Stanford who played four years there whos playing in his 22nd career game is in there as well yeah good reward for these players stford and Duke like hash Im better than well all be working for Neil begovic subday Harris down the lane Leon bond in the game up for RO a deep three and rebounded by St Im glad you made the point about the WalkOns cuz they dont just twiddle their thumbs and sit on the bench these guys are the hardest work workers in the program you know what Kevin theyre also the guys that when youre done playing youre going to call them and ask for a job yep talk about habits and accountability that they know what it takes man theyve done every job Buchanan has a rebound and the shot clock has turned off includes the managers as well absolutely by the way the UVA managers won yesterday uh I do want to mention this before we go the Virginia managers posted on Twitter that they were supposed to play The Duke managers last night they were told last minute the Duke managers had other Friday night plans so they found a bunch of random guys played them in a game and beat them so congratulations to the UVA managers like a win with there spur the moment pickup game I think its its a fair point though cuz we underestimate the value of people that you barely know exists the same thing goes for what we do right there are a bunch of people in a truck or control room that are bringing this to life holding cameras here longer than we are thats right uh yet were the ones you have to tolerate but trust me theres a lot of good people behind what we get to do Sean Jackson Bonnie Riley our producer director Chris Watt who gave me a camera to shoot our walk up the stairs that apparently I didnt do very well well show it next time Jays Morgan everybody in the control room terrific crew here at Duke what a win this is for Duke it is and what a statement of intent going into the final week of the regular season 7348 the final the Blue Devil destroy Virginia in a matchup of the two best teams The Last 5 Years in the ACC its Advantage Duke now in that category 312 at home under John Shire with NC State on the road and UNC at home go boy every Bud Kevin Brown Tennessee Alabama shortly for now back to the studio
