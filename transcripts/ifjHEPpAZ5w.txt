Harris Caderi Copelan Enjoy watching these two guys cuz its going to be hot in here too It sure is We get ready and we are underway here in the LJVM and NC State try with it Alioop to Luba Wake Forest with possession first Getting off to a good start for both teams I think is so very important with Nate Cal Misad in the basketball game today for Wake Forest Itll be interesting to see how they can how efficient they can be offensively Theres the starting lineup with Akids getting the start because of Calmes injured A three from the corner No good by Kovvin which will give NC State the basketball back Itll be interesting to see Akens getting the starting role because as you mentioned Stan with Calmese being injured but opportunities come Well Akens is a solid player and can and can do some things Hes averaging about five points a ball game Summit League freshman of the year last year Local kid from Concourse who understands what this rivalry is about So hes going to have some nerves early starting but hell play well Hes a good athlete Corner three for the pack up by Williams No good Both teams are going to have to create their own enthusiasm early in this basketball game Try to get some baskets Try to get some scores Juke Harris might have been the worst but he didnt get that that time A onehanded rebound pulled in by Darian Williams Back and forth we go Still no score is a floater put up by McNeel Jr No good And the offensive rebound thats been huge for NC State One of the big things about this NC State basketball team Theyre an outstanding rebounding team Williams tucking and jump ball applause which possession arrow to away Forest Theres a starting lineup for the NC State Wolfpack under the direction of the first year Will Wade coming in as the head coach for NC State and Akens cheering Little slip Theyre going to call a foul on Holland Trey Hollowan the transfer from Michigan State A really good own ball defender will try to take you out of your offense You said especially with a guy like Kelseys out of the ball game So the matchups who hes going to guard hes starting off on Acres Harris trying to take a one one v one and pull it back to Spillers Harris will try it from three Too short Good rebound by Spillers Spillers with a put back Still cant find that lid Its stayed tight there on the rim from both teams Almost two minutes have gone by We have got nothing to show for it on the school board Scorvin is a straightaway three by Copeland No good cheering Akens trying to push it will slow it down See its very important for both teams to just play basketball We talked about the weather and all the traveling all worrying about everything outside Just start playing Do what you came to do Play basketball Itll take a few minutes and theyll get going Jill Harris nice little finger roll and started continuing to get better and better Theyre averaging about 20 points a ball game Improved his scoring average almost 14 points from last year to this year and one of the leading scorers in the ACC Really worked hard on his threepoint shot That really helped out Thats a good interception by Kovvin Coven was looking to put a big dunk up Had to pull it back out Three other way by Copeland Kick transition corner three for NC State Nothing but net This is the one thing you cant do if youre Wake Forest is getting that transition game and not pick up perimeter shooters Paul McNeel one of the best threepoint shooters in the conference number two exact 64 threepointers made going into the day Dont want to let him get on a roll Big Swift only one inside as now Swagger goes inside and double teamed and they got a jump ball possession arrow NC State Cooper Swagger the transfer from Val Perezo who came in with some great accolades and just you know getting his feet wet Hes played a lot better the last couple of ball games A much more physical player He needs to be You saw an example there He can put it on the floor and score but got to finish Got to finish Good defensive play by NC State Hasnt become a starter starting for Omaha Belaloo as Belaloo has now entered the ball game for Wake Forest Nick Neil thinking about it as well as Copeland trying to get some help Well use the pick Double team Well done Look at the hops by Kovven Akens looking again Hes been trying to penetrate in but then have to pull it back out to reset Good lob for Baloon Baloo tried to duck under applause NC State really collapsed inside that the paint though Stan Well NC States a a a good team defensive team They average about 71 points a ball game giving up Where they really hurt you is in their transition game You saw a moment ago with McNeel but they converge on the basketball Not really a true shot blocker for them They rank last in the ACC in shot blocks or near the last 16 of 18 teams So theyre not going to block a lot of shots at the rim but theyre not going to let you get to the rim to get the shot blocked Good A good two backtoback good defensive sets by Wolfpack Both teams little cold so far The thing is you want to make sure your percentage is higher than the temperature The baseline is cold but kicks it back out And this last touch though there by Williams but itll be a shot clock violation and were going to go away Not much scoring 32 NC State up top And welcome back to Winston Salem Will Wade first year head coach at NC State coming over from McNe State of course was at LSU whos sent his team seven times to the NCAA tournament and uh has this pack primed for his first year Theyve been outstanding and also even more outstanding on the road Six and two in the ACC 156 overall as coach Steve Forbes with his team 11 and 10 two and six and having to battle some injuries to go along with it starting a point guard Aens Im trying to see how he will deal with the NC State feisty defense Quarter three and knocked in Well a lot has been talked about this year about Darion Williams the preseason ACC player of the year and has had an up and down season but he can certainly score the basketball comes in with great accolades and again one of the reasons why Copelan is so hard to guard and so hard to play against is his penetration his size is 66 and then you find a wing shooter like Darion Williams able to knock that down after the after the dead ball situation for Wake Forest if youre Wake Forest right now youve got to stay close to shooters today penetration cant be allowed and one thing that has to happen offensively and defensively you got to find a way to rebound got to rebound to the digs Another corner three and theyve been dangerous from the corners Williams Well thats when Wake Forest worst nightmare as NC State finds the range on the perimeter Good penetration again Knocks down a shot Isaac Carr has come in for Wake Forest State on a six excuse me 90 run And might be some more turnover by Wake Forest is another corner three from the far side No good Don McNeel Jr NC State second in the conference in threepoint baskets made at 222 going into todays ball game Average of 106 They show you why theyre not hesitant about shots and that guys got to respond Drew Harris all the way to the rim but cant get it to fall 92 our score with NC State on the run shot pulled up and great rebound by Kovven The kick out to Carr Carr just couldnt quite hold it in Isaac Carr gave him some very valuable minutes in that pit ball game Played 29 minutes had a couple of rebounds couple of assists made a basket but just overall hustle and effort merits him more time especially now with Kel Misa in the ball game Harris is being really assertive and hes attacked the rim but Deaks only have two points to show for it And a foul called on the Wolf Pack Well you know that Harris is going to be the number one person on the scouting report again Drives the baseline there Hes got to be able to finish that Creates some contact maybe goes inside Just got the wrist there at the end of the play Alan Luben you know as it picks up that foul again If youre Wake Forest I think one of the things youre going to have to do in transition is beat NC State down the floor Dont let their defense get set and then you can attack that way with numbers And Juke Harris has got to continue to be aggressive and be a slasher Jaylen Cross has come in Good upside for Cross the freshman from Greensboro I I I tell you somebody youve been looking at in the wake bar side of things thats been quiet and I think has got to have a big game today is going to be Spillers cuz Spillers has got to step up and find a way to rebound and score cheering Copeland to add Libs foul on Spillers and coaching staff thinking that was all bulk and he did something laughter called his name He he did that But again it goes back again to to how do you stop this NC State basketball team on the offensive side I dont know that you do because Copeland is so fantastic with the basketball and he gets everybody else involved with what they do that that theyve got perimeter shooters McNeel on one side Williams who can create on his own Abel comes in the ball game The freshman has a fantastic game This is a solid NC State basketball team It only has only going to play seven or eight guys Go 221 after the make 221 press beloo having to go up against two and says thats fun with him Wasnt clean but thats what theyve got to do if you wake for us Beat the pressure and then try to attack and score McNeil Jr thinking about a three Hell try and a touch foul by Carr which will send McNeel Jr to the line for three Paul McNeel Jr has such a quick release Hes a catch and shoot player Comes off a little bit of a screen there and defense just a little too late You pick up the foul and again you you know well say it once and Im only going to one time today since this is like a bonus bonus basketball because earlier and youre stuck in So you dont want to hear it say it all time Say one time Never ever foul a threepoint shooter I know we hadnt done anything together this year so you may not know the rule but never ever foul a threepoint shooter Threepoint shooter was just fouled First free throw good averaging 134 points per game Knocked in the second with And if you didnt know why you dont want to foul threepoint shooter a guy like Paul McNeels a streaky shooter As I said 64 threepointers made going into todays ball game Set the state high school record for points a couple years ago I hate to say it against Ill say league county Everybody dont know where Lee County is Im not going to say that as opposed to town Im not going to say city cuz I know people I got family down there but at 71 in a high school game state record Thats why you dont want to foul a threepoint shooter Let him get on a roll right now Could be bad news 83 defense free throw shooter is cross penetrating looking for the floater Still that lid stays on the rim Sonia just kind of intimidated him out of at that shot You got to finish that 146 as Copeland trying to drive in the corner three Thats worked well for NC State Works well again Real Arsenal You get penetration by Copelan and then you find the open shooter Arsenal that time on the wing Bears a three NC State howling right there with an 11point lead NC State as Stan said off to a how start 176 another run this time a 6 run shooting the ball 40 and holding Wake Forest just a 22 clip from the field well you look at that four out of eight from the three line and NC States not disappointed early on The number one threepoint shooting team by percentage in the ACC comes in a shade under 40 They have not disappointed with some really good leaks looks And if you if youre NC State you keep doing that If you wake for us you got to find a way to stop the ball and then get out and contest the shot Three out of the way by Belaloo Good Belaloo had a nice game against NC State on December 31st Had 18 points and 10 boards Maybe hes feeling some of that red magic right now was a really good look for him Has struggled from the perimeter That was a good shot for Omaha Blue First three of the ball game for Wake Forest 179 Breaks that run by NC State McNail Jr trying to penetrate in the kick out Working in the paint Turnaround Thats no good Wake Forest pulls down the rebound Good job that time by Spillers to get up and contest the shot by Arsenal Carr goes to the juke Harris up and no good Deaks trying to bring in that offensive rebound Trailing by eight here as NC State will throw that one away Able applause I was expecting Arnold to stay there but he did not And that was a turnover for NC State Will turn over and be right back Youre watching Wake Forest in NC State on ACC Network Red early in this basketball game Inside outside penetration knocking down threes NC States four of 11 from the field All four of them been threepoint baskets And you get a great look inside outside great penetration ready to shoot the basketball when it comes your way Arsenal knocks down a three and so does Mike Guy Paul McNeel and Copeland just running a smooth show right now NC State off to a very good start here in Winston Salem Theyre lighting it up from beyond the arc and Wake Forest struggling from the field Three of 11 as they cant quite get that lid off And maybe this trip down will be different as Duke Harris if youre Wake Forest Youve got to have more movement more ball movement more people movement Who got under the basket Hes been big Goes up Contact No call And NC State quickly getting up Got to finish those plays Ty when you get the ball in the paint put two hands on it and finish Very physical this time Williams versus car versus Carr Interesting matchup is Carr but cheering hes on the big stage And Williams drops that one in Plus chance for when one Well Carr did a nice job in working and working may have gotten away that Williams with a little bit of a push off inside but watch this Great move there Bumps him See that See the hand just there for a second there and then able to make the spin move and the strength to finish through contact Darren Williams who was a preseason ACC player of the year has had success everywhere hes been on the freshman team in the Mountain West when he was at Nevada two years at Texas Tech was an all Big 12 performer and has come to NC State and has definitely lived up to expectations has been a big time player 14 points 80 from the free throw line and almost six rebounds a ball game Nine points for Williams Sadikes have grand total of nine points as Akens trying to get past the timeline Again I say the same thing You got to value the basketball No mistakes but you got to move a little bit better Wake Forest is is having a hard time penetrating and NC State very physical right now See that Willers are trying to hold up the ball gives it to Akens as Aken tried to penetrate in completely sealed off Last touch to still bad luck for Wake Forest Give VC State a lot of credit right now They have come out and put a lot of pressure on the perimeter and made it very difficult for for Wake Forest to get involved in any type of offense Deaks have not been able to hit a shot last two minutes and some change Williams on the other hand hes been on fire Turnover Wake Forest quickly trying to push it up the floor Heres Harris and Harris is fouled Harris is arguing that he was in the motion of shooting but a foul is going to be called on Ael So he was on Mattel Forbes trying trying to negotiate the best you can to get that as a a possible and one or a two shot Its a nope on the floor Harris will try it again Step back Bang His ability to play off two feet is one of that improvements that you talked about a moment ago Not only has he gotten a little bigger probably a little taller but his ability not to just try to crash and burn with one foot going in a dunk pull up take a little 10ft jumper and hes mastered that Some nice play by Juke Harris A badly needed basket by Wakes with six points and another corner three drilled by McNill Jr NC State lighting it up from beyond the arc five of nine Will Wade said we talked before the ball game and very gracious with his time and says Hey listen This is another game We just got to come out and do what we do And one of the things that they do is is be very consistent share the basketball Another turnover trying to lob it over the head and into was another turnover and Wake Forest gets it back Harris taking on himself with a teardrop and good Its a hard way to get two points but you got to be creative And again value the ball Check your passes if youre Wake Forest NC State continue to just put pressure on Wake Forest Straightaway three by Hollowan cheering Nothing but that Backto back threes by Halleman Not known as a threepoint shooter all the time Hes made a three in 15 of the 19 games He gave say 16 of the 20 ball games Hes been a very lowkey consistent threepoint shooter Six points for Hollowan And Schwagger will go up draw the contact and he will be in the process of shooting Thats a good job by Swagger that time Kick the ball at the top of the mid post and just attack Make them foul you or score or both Holman charged with a foul Swiggers first one Not so lucky there as the Deacons really need points Swigger a 78 free throw shooter Freshman of the year in the Missouri Valley two years ago all conference last year Carr back in Kovvin back in Swigger with the second one and knocks that one in First point for Swigger 2614 NC State leading Coven number six Scar and Copeland This will be a nice matchup Two physical very good athletes that can make plays on both ends Copeland loves this matchup Kick to the corner Good Its cheering just clockwork now for NC State Well they space you out cheering And the theft the turnover by Wake Forest Thats now five Well they space you out and then they they wait for you to for the double team to come or Copeland beats you off the bounce and youve got shooters around and then and then you get in a oneonone situation where you cant move your feet fast enough Carr has a foul Digs a lot of questions NC State stays hot 2914 Well back here to Winston after this Last count he had seven assists NC State 14 made baskets Well known for how they play on the road They average about 48 shooting And thats 100 alioopa dunk for Luben Well thats communication and you lock in after the timeout you score and then NC State goes back into attack mode and goes 221 and Wake Forest has got to understand okay were in a battle here So you got you got to fight You got to start playing communicating talking executing Drew Harris theres the elbow turnaround He is so so good at that one Hes got 10 but hes working very hard to score Theyre clearing out of side getting the ball in the middle of the floor and Harris is working his magic So dont be surprised if you see double teams pretty soon by NC State Make somebody else beat you 3116 State as Copelan musling her way and then cheering a little bit of a hammer down as Luben makes sure that one will go broke Allen Luben said five games already with 10 rebounds and more It may have that in the first half and Juke continues to get in the paint and elevate Thats been the best offensive weapon for Wake Forest Lubman just kind of alley oops one and then just follows up and goes over and Wake Forest just does not have that rim protector that can kind of keep him out of the lane so he could have a field day today Harris with 12 of the 18 points for Wake Forest Theres no answer Theres no answer right now for stopping Copeland Cars doing the best he can Hes bodying him up but theyre going to have to run a double team on and that that opens up perimeter shooters Good job by NC State finding the weak area and attacking it Spillers from three That finally knocks that one down The Deakons need that one in a major way Badly needed basket by Trayvon Spillers averaging about 11 a ball game Got to get him in the offensive sets Its a good look then 3521 Deaks have hit five of the last five They pull in a rebound and trying to work themselves into a run Isaac Carr a little bit of magician there Nice job by Carr attacking If you block it you block it but if you dont Im going to score And that gets this crowd fired up and hopefully gets this deep basketball team fired up Theyre in a ball game Youve got to make some plays Thats a big one for Carr cheering and applause crowd getting into it Good crowd despite the weather outside Yeah if youre Wake Forest you got to get a stop And then Williams calms things down Its just almost too easy for Williams right now Under five Swagger underneath Its going to be NC State already out of bounds Deacons hitting six of their last seven but on the other hand NC State eight of their last 10 Well NC State did a nice job that time stopping the basketball putting a little pressure on Swagger Hes got to finish that through contact and that and the ball was blocked knocked out of bounds But again you get the ball in the paint you got to find a way to score Going on pull rebound in by Spillers out to the outlet and Juke Harris Wake Force has really tried to get on that counter in the transition but theyve had to pull it back and that ends up in the turnover Arsenal baseline and try to use the glass Well rip by Luben there cleaning it off the glass there 3723 Arsenal applause and cheering Nice little teardrop too Remember remember Terrence Arseno had three successful seasons a part of that final four team at Houston last year So you know hes aggressive You know hes very strong can get the ball in the paint Doesnt mind the physicality You saw a great example there Harris and a good rebound by Kov and the tied up ball Itll be Wake Forest basketball Diggs trailing 3923 Well be right back But NC State had 38 points in the paints but today stay there Lights out from beyond the arc Well balls touching the paint catching paint kicking it out But Finn Allen Luben had a double double You talk about his ability to make plays inside Leads the ACC in field goal percentage by 68 And hes had some really good looks inside And then what perimeter game of NC State NC State using all their weapons right now and and are in good red attack mode So how do you answer if youre Wick Forest Harris having to put this team on his back three Well Duke Harris scoring We talked about Spillers being able to score He knocked down that three a moment ago Got to get Kovven involved a little bit for Wake Forest And lets see what the adjustments are for Wake Forest defensively Looks like Coven is going to guard Copeland this time You know McNeels a threepoint shooter more than anything so you dont worry so much about him perimeter but you got to guard him on the penetration Weve been thinking about there is right now See McNeel Jr Two seconds on the shot clock One presto Just because you know dont mean you can stop it Okay thats Paul McNeel Jr in case you did not know 4226 State has an answer for everything Wake Forest does Omaha Belaloo trying to do a reverse there They got a foul McNeil in December 47 points laughter 11 threepoint baskets The only person ever had that many threepoint baskets NC State history was Rodney Monroe So McNeel when your name is mentioned with Rodney Monroe as a shooter you know youre a pretty darn good shooter Clock winding down Carr did the best he could Car was about 63 Mcneel goes about 65 and a half Hes a great shooter Had it in rhythm Knocked down the threepoint basket NC State living on the threepoint line today McNeel with nine points after that three free throw good by Beloo You know you saw that graphic a moment ago and Omaha Belaloo you know had a big game against NC State on New Years Eve and hes having a pretty good game so far today as far as scoring the ball and and seeing the ball go through the basket So maybe thats going to be the answer on the offensive end other than Jes cheering Hes been in and out of the lineup this year at 68 and consistency has been the main thing but today theyre going to need his inside ability and also to be able to step out and make a few shots Williams backing down Spillers Old ball there by Spillers Not a question about it Spillers is a really solid defensive player Holes position doesnt doesnt let him be physical Doesnt let Williams get physical That allows him no space Shot goes up Goes after the basketball So good defensive play Oh no look pass from from the baseline given by Lubet Isaac Cart Some big minutes Better spacing right now for Wake Forest The twominute mark 4428 Its NC State Now hes a car once again going underneath Nice job by Carr Patience Gets in the paint doesnt panic Head and shoulder fake Uses the glass gets a basket Thats a good play for him His issue has been on the defensive side Theyre just trying to find him and try to work against him Holan this time short applause They like to fight in car juke Thats too short and easily collected by McNeil Jr Works on that shot there shot that too quick in the clock Holland calling for it cheering and then up and under as Copeland says this is too easy Ah thats a Philly special right there A kid from Philadelphia says Hey I learned this in Phil laughter Little hesitation Its a Earl Monroe move just before your time but were in Winston Salem saw some people in that one time NC State by 16 and Wake Forest gifts one right back to him And the turnovers the inability to get second shots and really haunting Wake Lake Forest right now If youre NC State you just continue to run your offense find the open area penetrate kick and shoot McNeil Jr cheering hands continue to stay on fire Hes not bothered by this Hes not bothered at all So you can run somebody at him He can get him off a screen He scored his first couple threes off corner jumpers This time he takes it down off the middle but he catches in rhythm Is a great shooter and does not hesitate It doesnt hurt that hes about 65 66 so he can look over most defenders Nine of 14 for NC State and they lead by 19 They knocked down 19 threes in their win a couple of games ago against Florida State 17 that game against Texas Southern McNeel had 11 of those and theyve had another 19 game against NCCU So they have lit it up to 40 you know in threepoint baskets and youre seeing it today Car and now two short rebound pulled in by Luben 20 of the 21 games that Incs played theyve taken over 20point shots to their own part today Ruben tracks it down 15 second differential between the game clock and the shot clock and a timeout called by Will Wade and the NC State Wolfpack They continue to scorch it shooting 57 from the field but really the story is nine threes nine of 14 a clip of 64 from beyond the ark and they lead big over Wake Forest on the road 4931 So if youre if youre Wake Forest you say okay we just got to continue to guard the ball We got to do a better job calling out screens and you got to say sooner rather than later theyre going to start missing some shots and we got to get the rebound not allow second chance Its a lot not lot you cant do right now And if youre in NC State okay fine lets just run our offense do what we do Were getting shots and if you miss theyre one of the best rebounding teams too So kind of caught between a rock and a hard so to speak right now Its been the week Got to keep playing and McNeil Jr show both team both players with 14 points Theres your screen Beloo trying to see if he could keep that one inbound He last touched it Itll be NC State ball Tried to run a little screen from the top to get McNeel open on the wing and well defended that time by Kovven Blue gets a deflection So 25 on the shot clock You got to be recognized in that And then theres a shot going up Copeland and McNeil Jr if he hit that And Car did a really nice job of contesting without fouling Now you get the last shot position there going to go NC States way we get the second half is being able to jump off Its crucial that Wake Forest can at least go into the locker room with a bucket and thats not in the script But what is in the script is NC State unconscious from beyond a thing to go there with an offensive board And you know some something real quick surprisingly too is Wake Forest has scored 14 points in the paint and a lot of thats been by one of the smallest guys on the court in carly applause whistle I think if youre if youre Wake Forest your thought process is weve got to put more pressure on the basketball Weve got to talk more and find ways to stop I wouldnt be surprised if coach throws out a little zone maybe just to give them a different look and you hope that NC State gets on a little just a three or four possessions where theyre not hitting and Wake Forest capitalizes if youre if youre NC State just keep doing what youre doing Foul was on Coven State setting up their half court offense Step back straightaway three this time Good possession getting the start to transfer from Denver from the Charlotte area and that was just telegraphed on that pass Juke Harris tried to take it right back and yes they do Deakons with numbers back floater Good It was It wasnt the prettiest transition basket Ive ever seen you know but it its effective if youre Wake Forest You got the stop You eventually get a steal on the other side Youre able to get the basket and now you can set your defense up and you just got to slow NC State down Things are happening too easy A timeout on the floor with some equipment issues right Tie the shoe for Williams Only way to slow him down Slow him down right now Tie tie his shoe to the post 4933 So now lets see how much patience NC State has offensively They dont have to try to get all the home run plays move the defense side to side to get a basket or a drive There he goes A corner three and pick up where you left off Williams 17 points for Williams Darren Williams has just shown today what everybody talked about and expected to see out of him scoring the ball He had five threes in the Syracuse game Had six against UNCC Greensboro back early in the season But hes seeing the basket and hes getting the ball in really good places things primarily to Copelan Kovvin tried to find Spillers That was actually a good look and very well read by NC State and a foul on the Packop on Copeland and Copeland has got three and Copeland will take a seat Mark comes in 1837 with Copeland picking up his third foul How will that affect the the NC State offense Who will be the primary ball handler probably be Holman Abel Harris Oh little bit of English at the rim Spun that one in Harris has 17 high hand and then the put back K No could not fault into the hands of Harris A little opportunity right now for Wake Forest Coven He knew he was going to get the contact I dont think he was expecting to hit the deck right there and hes not He is not getting up quite yet Well its a really smart play Run a little slice cut action to get the ball to Covens hands Kovven is as tough as they come The kid from Indianapolis Dad was a former New England Patriots Got some big rings If you dont believe it just shake his hand one day You can see him Watch him drive inside Mcneel not able to match that Theres contact and theres contact after he takes the hard fall of Kov who played his first couple seasons at Purdue Was also a part of the national championship team when Purdue played uh Yukon two seasons ago So come in here and really been a great scoring asset Good to see him if youre a Wake fan get off the floor and also nail get in the scoring column Vertical is something else had that huge shooting game just before Christmas They like his first 13 shots against Queens Ended up with 33 which has been the season high for him and the Zen Two for two there Trying to cut into this NC State lead A little more pressure on the basketball right now by Wake Forest Trying to put them offensively in some difficult positions Good defense there May score off it but its better defense Hand off pop shot got cheering and got it A good job that time by Akens to put pressure on the ball But again youve got to get the to your shooters quicker And NC State probably the best perimeter team Ive seen in a long time as far as getting the shots off under pressure Hollowman three of five from beyond the arc 5537 return fire Good Yeah good look that time again in rhythm offensively Kovvin Coleman with eight Maybe he can be that other answer for Wig Forest Quick catch and shoot And that one went around the world and then Williams Now and think about it A lot of these shots were contested Another day another in a game They may not fall Harris with some space Harris dri There we go Warm inside getting warmer outside I hope 20 laughter for Harris Double digits in in 20 20 in counting Not the shot wheel way that time Harris again Too strong Luben reached up pulled in the rebound And now NC State slow it down a little bit musling inside trying to use the glass and the put back by Luben Luben just got rid of the K I think that was Harris and just goes up strong with one hand and finishes with the other Wow Dominated inside The Charlotte point guard is able to scoop by and lay one in Yeah Sebastian Akens again averaged about 13 points a season at Denver last year and as I mentioned earlier in the day was a Summit League freshman of the year Can score the basketball and again with Cal Mis out of the game you got to find some ways to score on the perimeter Sees that takes advantage and gets the basket Low look pass to the corner three on the way by Ael and pulled in perfectly by Schwigger You get a couple of stops if you wait for us and try to push tempo get an easy basket put some pressure on weight on the NC State defenses Akens Good offensive board by Spillers and put it right back in applause Excellent job that time this last couple of possessions by Wake Forest cheering applause This way you can find this feel that momentum shifting But the thing key for Wake Forest is to keep it that way Well cheering get you get momentum if you get some stops right You get some stops you get some scores The freshman cheering pulled in applause Look like it was blocked by Schweer Akens stops Pops just a little too strong Back of the iron Pulled in by Luben We got a foul on Wake Yeah thats what we not stopped and stopping stopping and state just cant stop popping 60 47 Be right back Were back here Winston Salem Diggs trying to put it on a little run here Make NC State uncomfortable 60 to 47 Theres Duke Caris Another 20 plus game for him And hes got 20 The rest of the team has 27 music He has pushed his game to another level to the fact where coach Forbes says he doesnt even recognize him on film Yeah And and a lot of people are talking about him at the next level gotten bigger gotten stronger 22 ball games this year he scored in double figures And again his ninth game with 20 more So hes been able to score Hes got to get some stops and and for Wake Forest sake hes got to get his teammates involved and get some scoring too Thank goodness for him Luben just most likely that Luben laughter Luben looks so comfortable Just goes inside and gets great percentage and scores there And heres a guy that you know didnt score a lot at North Obviously he played at Carolina and hes going to be at NC State Started his career at Notre Dame But in Vandy his sophomore year his second season he averaged about 12 points a ball game Yeah there you go Yep What What happened What happened there Hit a threepoint shooter and fouled And what are you not supposed to do Not youre not supposed to foul a threepoint shooter ever But uh and Juke Harris just became a threepoint shooter this year right It doesnt matter when he became it happened right now Watch this Oh thats from late comes up late Defender gets there and hits him on the arm And so it doesnt matter if you became one this morning or 20 years ago You dont want to be a defender Dont shoot dont foul him Thats even worse He just became one laughter You know you know its like you dont want the guy to win the lottery Thats your first first time playing right You kidding me I missed the second one But hes got to make those free throws 76 free throw shooting again You see a little more life out of the Wake Force offense now than than youve seen previously and thats a good thing But now theyve got to get some stops and then when youre on offense you got to be able to convert that Be big for Juke to be able to make this free throw and set your defense The largest run Wakeake Force has had was a 50 run They had the lead first bucket of the ball game and since then its been all NC State Show a little nuisance press there after the made free throw And NC State now playing without Copeland So youll see more more passing more movement like that Thats a good good bounce pass down low and a three on the way No good Tried to draw that foul there by Ael but referee swallowed the whistle Coven gets it spinning all ball there Swagger returning and puts that one back in Big big second chance point after that was blocked Great play here Push the basketball Good catch by Kovvin Sonia does a nice job with the block that time but dont give up on the play Cooper Swagger catches the basketball Two hands head and shoulder fake Gets a defender off his feet powers in for the possible threepoint play And if youre Wake Forest this is how you get back in this basketball game Play some defense cheering finish on the other end and then knock down your free throws Schwagger cheering and applause Leanne in converted four points for her for him as the digs within 10 One of the few times where NC States walked the ball up and running their half court set McNeel on the wing fadeaway jumper He knocked it down Thats just He cant Its unguardable Well Arsenal again not a big scoreer only averages about four points a ball game but can make that little midrange jump shot that time off balance Nice shot by him Coven draws the foul And remember how early in the basketball game NC State tried to attack players oneonone and let that oneonone creation become scores for them Well now Wake Forest is doing the same thing trying to isolate Culvin in a situation where hes got his back to the basket can back it down or take that midrange jump shot Digs cut it to 10 and down by 12 But cheering free throws coming First one good by Kovven six points from Miles Coven The Daks are having some success at the free throw line today And in in their last five ball games they have struggled a bit at the free throw line like 56 of 73 from the line And I know thats been a concern of coach Forbes and his staff being able to get those easy baskets easy points Coven converts right there Now youre able to set your defense up that 10point basketball game A lot of time to go in this game applause Digs 13 of 16 from the charity strike so far This is a team in Wake Forest that shoots 76 from the line Fifth best fourth best in the ACC or the Wolf Pack 745 So look at that Digs trying to get on a little rhythm here Down 10 again Isolate Williams Looking this clock down 5 seconds on the shot clock Is Williams fires zoo Short rebound Thats big Great defensive effort that time by Wake Forest Patient as the clock wound down Didnt foul Forced a tough shot got the rebound Harris Valu will walk it over Thought about a handoff to Harris Car thinking baseline pulling it back out Nine eight seconds on the shot clock Juke Harris for three Count it cheering Watched it go in Knew it was gone the moment it left his hands Wake Forest much better offensively in the second half of this game 25 points for Harris Step back No good cheering Digs got away with one because that was they were fortunate that didnt fall Digs on a bit of a run 6457 and Juke Harris putting up 25 points A ball game down seven but NC State with the basketball Copeland back in the game for the Wolfpack Quarter three by Ael and good They just cannot allow anybody in red jerseys that much space Well that was well defended that time by Wake Forest Again Copen just makes such a difference He can see over over defenders He can finally open the area Abel who they really are high on at NC State as a young player buries a three after the timeout Harris fighting his way into the lane nice job Only the fourth offensive rebound for Wake Forest tonight Beloo got kind of stuck in a hard place and calls timeout NC State quickly having a rebuttal after Wake Forest is getting the crowd involved and its now they to music a 10point lead that really continuing to be those sharp shooting pack that has three wins in a row and sit pretty in the ACC standings Caught on the baseline a moment ago to use a timeout Similar situation here Harris is able to get just enough of the baseline to get contact But you look at that 13 threepoint baskets made We said 222 for NC State going into this afternoons basketball game and one of the top threepoint shooting teams in the country And theyve not disappointed Theyve had some really really good looks And it does not happen without a great penetrator Somebodys got the vision And I just I admire watching Copeland the way hes been able to find open shooters and being able to knock them down And Wake Forest hanging in there Hanging in there If you give up dont give up the threes Just make him make twos Wake Forest is is in this game Leads this ball game Harris on his way to a new career high Hes got 27 right now Nine of 16 from the field This is a very important stretch right now Able for three And Able will go home You got to go at the hand and get up and try to catch the basketball off balance Thats an easy one you could draw that foul Akai Mason cheering in the ball game now also for Wake Forest They were trying to get him matched up against that shooter And now on that switch Copeland recognized found a shooter and able cheering who shoots about 83 as a freshman Yeah pretty uh automatic from the free throw line Able two for two with one more coming one of the first players to commit to Will Wade is is able and he you know they really people are rock talking about him as a possible NBA prospect early only as a freshman Its a solid game and you know comes up missing one of those but they dont take a drop off too much on their permission shooting when ables in the ball game A surprising miss lead back to 10 for the pack And if youre late for us you got to continue to go downhill Try to attack your passes Be smart with the basketball and execute Harris Tough shot Very tough shot Fading away too McNeil Jr the sophomore from Rocky North Carolina Belaloo A little chatter with Copelan Beloo is a little bigger at 68 Can move his feet Yeah theres a switch Step back three from this sophomore cheering from Rockingham Give up on the first fake You got to keep your fake keep your feet and its just a hard Its a hard position to put Carr in He doesnt have the size Its nobodys fault McNeel 6566 and McNeil gets rid of the ball so quick Its a hard Its a hard cover 14 threes now for NC State 920 remaining here in this ball game Culvin Diggs continuing to fight Harris continuing to shoot and tipped into the hands as NC State collects And you just see the lack of size that Wake Forest has inside right now Sonia goes about 610 is able to keep that up They got to hold or push away from the ball They got to hold on car They thought they might call a moving screen but they call the foul on Carr The bonus Trying to find a way to run him off that screen You can see hes trying to Thats a good job by Carr to be honest with you to try to fight through that Nice little acting job maybe a little bit by Abel Its okay Always fair on a snowy Saturday afternoon Schweger and Cargo go outs Heres your screen roll action Do they switch No Good job by What a spent He cocked that one back Was able still to get it up off the backboard cheering and a foul on Wake Forest Well that was a nice job by Wake Forest in defending that switching staying on making him get him off the threepoint line What have they not done a good job of moving him off the three line make them drive make him be a twopoint shooter They do that that time but then you dont get the rebound the offensive rebound So half of the defensive set was pretty good cheering free throw no good on the first try Lucy Sier only its only a freshman about 50 So cheering by by the average youre one of those analytic guys and everything like that So he should make this right 50 free throw shooter eight of 16 Should he make this one cheering Well no he didnt make it He didnt make it applause Didnt make it So the numbers were off that time So that was one time we dont understand the list right Hey thats all I got Thats all I got for you right now Car went out Hes got four fouls But keep that in mind if youre Wake Forest If you need someone to foul as this game goes on you want to stretch this game out as much as you possibly can if youre the digs Oh good feed Spillers Oh a lot of contact Yeah it was NC State says well gladly take it Then straight to the rack off the front of the rim Blocked it Belaloo pulls down the rebound The ball dont lie The defender dont lie How about that Belaloo three Count that one cheering Nice play by Belaloo on the rebound Push ahead Find your spot Remember we talked about him being a very good perimeter shooter cheering NC State tries to go down low and a foul called which has the crowd upset Lets take a look here Contact Steps through Got a little bit of the hand Just a little bit Not enough I wouldnt let that play probably knowing me Blue upset after a really good defensive play that that ended with a solid offensive perimeter Theyre going to also take a look at his shot See if he has a three as opposed to two Tough cheering break for Blue on that end And now you go to the guy thats supposedly a 50 free throw shooter Right cheering Well thats true Thats true One of the things that probably the crowd is visibly upset is because the largest run Wake Forest has a 50 run Anytime they try to build up a run its theres a stop of the rhythm Well cheering Im glad the crowd is here and hope they get home safe You know I appreciate them all being here every ball game Be safe going home but you cant listen to the crowd cheering and applause Sier cuz half are going to be happy half are going to be sad They dont listen to the crowd NC States lead back to 12 Will Wade says Hey you made the 50 That trip down Good bit of coaching right there Keeping him excited Akens wanted to uh feed that one to Juke on the near corner Under eight to go Harris top of the key to Belaloo Five seconds on the shot clock Harris thought that one was going to go in and just hit the back of the iron and popped right back up NC States done a really good job of making Wake Forest take jump shots and then collected the rebound Offbalance shot and Copeland Yeah hes got that city game High bounce Hey eight points assist Its a nice game Nice game Averages about 14 points Came forward 133 assists 14 Good feed Beloo Hammer down Omaha Belaloo size and athleticism Hes really using it today Remember he had a huge ball game against NC State back in Jan uh December New Years Eve January 1st December 31st Copy Hollowan baseline Good cheering Hollowman playing with a lot of confidence there Harris runs him off the three line but he takes that 12t jumper and the ability to make that little midrange jump shot Akens definitely the intent was to get the contact Did get it The foul is going to be on Copelan And were going to take our break ourselves as Belaloo still keeping the digs fighting 7763 music as opposed to a 16 shot right there So Omaha Belaloos basket a few moments ago was turned to determined to be a threepointer So the score is now 7764 just for those of you that are keeping score at home or people beside me to the keep and score like yourself Yeah both blue balloons arent adding up Blue with 12 points Drew Harris very close to putting up a new career high Thanks for our crew came in today under cra crazy crazy circumstances Amen And got that Theyve moved heaven and earth and a lot of ice too to get here So J and the guys and ladies thank you so very much for your effort to get this on and and so uh glad they got that shot too Yes many many thanks to a lot of people Great team people here at Coliseum Wake Forest NC State Akens drops two for two Post him up 11point lead for NC State Luben using that size to his benefit Yeah Well he started off about seven feet away from the basket and and then when he lost it and Blue did a nice job of body he just recovers his own shot Not a lot you can do there Was that 10 points for him now Yeah 10 points for Luben 17th double figure ball game The thing thats amazing about Luben hes scores a lot of his points off offensive rebounds He had like 60 offensive boards going in the day There you go applause Spillers was hoping to find Harris in the paint took it himself and got fouled If Im Spillers at 67 68 long athletic Ive got to be very aggressive right now Every every time he touches the basketball especially at the top hes got to go drive attack make them foul you or dunk on them One to two Deaks now 18 of 21 from the free throw line So theyre shooting very well 10 games this year theyve had more free throws made than their opponents Knock down the second one Best way to get back in this game if youre Wake Forest Score with the clocks on Go to the free throw line We need a couple defensive stops right now And if youre in the skate the clock is your friend protect the basketball and get shooters in position to score Theyre inside out Theyre going to isolate now Luben stepped out of bounds Thats a good seal off by Bel It really was It really was similar to what happened on the last possession that that Luben lost the ball and then found it and scored That time held ground held ground and forced a turnover Nice defense by Omaha Blue car getting extended minutes Hes got four fouls on him Harris already with a careerhigh of field goal attempt with 19 Stagger get the ball in Kovvens hand again downhill 10 seconds on the shot clock Carr for three Carr short Really good look that time for Carr Hollerman Tegan fans thought he stepped out of bounds Rodri Harris says Keep it down here Harris got a night got a hand on it just as he drove by and theyre going to take a look at this meal Maybe he didnt And Daks have done everything they can to stay into this contest But NC State has always had a rebuttal This is We see Harris hand touched Hullman as he was driving through and did he hit his hand and that was the impetus for the ball to go out of bounds or did he actually hit the basketball With this new ruling remember now youve got to have a timeout available to make to to go to the look screaming and if you are successful you can keep the time out You you retain it and you retain the uh the challenge But if youre not if you make the mistake clearly Ill wake it and you did not put a coat on as you came out in the snow you will be wet and without Take a look right here lost Lost the time out Lost the challenge No more challenge I appreciate it Well then Rodri has given uh what he has seen and told my partner Stan Luther and its going to well you got you got Mark Shur Michael Kits and and and the legend Roger Harris and he came over and he told me and we were on the same nod and he said thats my quickest challenge ever So hey were part of history again I like that And it was the correct call Wake Forest net with one timeout remaining NC State with three Driving and completed on the easy layup When you space them out its hard to recover sometime And Arsenal again takes the ball puts it on the floor Strong layup there 442 remaining Ws got to find a way to get in their offense quicker Thats Kovvin Eight seconds now 7 seconds on the shot clock Step back three for Juke Harris There it is Hard way to get through high It is It was Its going to be Its a hard way to score three points Hes four of nine from beyond the arc cheering NC State lead to 10 Still stays 10 with a shot from Ael Down 10 Still got a great chance Carr three Harris too short Oh it almost came right back to him May have gotten a little slap on the wrist there by Hullman up ahead Uhoh And bodies on the floor Looked like Spillers had to hold on to the rim so he wouldnt get taken out by his legs Were going to sort sort this out But the fight continues 8371 Well be right back 347 left We got a lot to uh got to figure out here Stan what exactly went on And watch the play here And this is a Duke Harris pass from a moment ago Initially they thought it was a three You can see the toe just on the line Count that basket Now heres a block Thats a block called right there Now why was Spillers not assessed a technical foul You see his teammate on the floor and youve got to give a player in to to come down So thats why there was no technical foul there So its a block which is a basket by Paul and hell go to the free throw line for one on the end of a threepoint play by Mc Paul McNeel Jr Boom There was a lot of stuff You know what Im saying Theres a lot of stuff going but it really wasnt that bad It was really easy with that with that uh three turned into a two Now Juke Harris has tied his return two line block charge Theres a block foul No technical foul cuz the players in there It was easy I mean 14point lead Paying attention today You know what Im saying Love that Harris That ones just a little off to the right That would have been a three And and Wake Forest right now has got to got to find quickness in their offense and find some scores Easy Layups will work as well They got to get some scores and they got to get stops And if youre NC State just keep spacing the floor Finding the guy to match up right now Theyre going to go inside to Luben cheering Long three Boy it must be easy It must be nice at practice boy cuz all you do is go inside outside side to side and shoot My goodness that was well done McNeil Jr now with 23 points Nice little screen at the top cheering Lead to 17 State with the basketball again is Hollowan McNeel Jr is five of seven from three and they had a foul on Kovvin That was really nice They worked the ball inside There wasnt a double team Luben didnt panic Caught the ball and there was a down screen and you get the ball in the shooters hands McNeel and again Ill say it again The thing that you really like about him not only his size but his ability to get rid of the basketball quick Hes got a really quick release a high release and its a beautiful rotation I guess if you scored 71 points in a high school game yeah you can you can knock it down And remember 11 threepoint baskets McN cheering Jr went to Richmond County cheering Richmond No Yeah Known for their football though known for their basketball too Exactly and say Rodney Monroe I had to think about our el the basketball the legend the basketball secretary mean sister Beverly Sparks Im sure Beverlys watching the game someplace in the Raleigh area But that that is Miss NC State basketball right there Im just going to put it out there right now because I can So Bam enjoy the ball game I guess Juke Harris Watch it put that one in cuz he can and careerhigh Yeah but Jukes the only one getting some offensive rebounds And that thats one thing that NC States will really kick themselves over Second chance opportunities and Juke now has his career high There you go Back inside Double Musley against Schwagger And good job by Swagger Very good defense Good time And Coven wants to go straight to the rack Oh look how high he got up We just took off the foul called on NC State No that that was well done in a lot of ways I like the inside position by Luben that time Didnt win the battle in the paint Good block by Swagger and then take it down the other end and a great hustle at the end by Hollowman to get his hand on the basketball but also got a little bit of the arm So really nice if youre really watching basketball If youre not pulling for either team youre just watching the game and enjoying play You had to like that sequence Good defense offensive idea transition basket Stop it make him go to the free throw line Could have a lot of fun on a snowy day laughter Coleman with seven points First free throw Good Coven just never really got in an offensive rhythm today 84 free throw shooter Phenomenal talent too Involved Its different ball game Knock down that well Like I said great bloodlines You know dad and NFL stars Got a sister Theres a big time volleyball player 8974 with 90 seconds remaining And got a foul called Its going to be called on Belaloo They got Belaloo in the front NC State
