six per game long athletic can guard multiple positions one of the best in the ACC Georgia Tech enters this contest 4 and3 overall they are 10 in ACC play 41 this season here at home meanwhile Alabama AM 1 and six searching for their first road win theyve played five games on the road already 0 and five in those contests danana jumping for Georgia Tech and the yellow jackets control the tap this is a young Yellow Jackets team they are long they are tall havent been shooting the ball as well as they had hoped coming in Kellys three in and out its a great Point James you know to to your point they do not shoot the ball that well for the three but I think they have capable Shooters its just about shot selection the starting five for the Bulldogs keep an eye on Omari Peak hes been really good leading the team and scoring the last two games and 13 points just the other night at Vanderbilt piercing the lane shot wont fall for Bryant collects his own Miss and scores on the follow good job on the back boards Alabama and M starting five for George attch a couple of freshman Dongo and George in the lineup for the fourth consecutive Music game extra pass and a three offensive rebound for the yellow jackets in 10 both of these teams average around 13 offensive rebounds per night how big will that be today oh its its huge and team is that big up front but theyre very long and Music athletic pull up from Smith off off the Applause heel Rees an open look and itll go well thats good offense by Georgia Tech finding the open Reeves on ball reversal good job with the spacing as well by Georgia Tech Georgia Tech as I noted 4 and three they have some really nice wins took down Mississippi State took down Duke they have losses to Cincinnati by almost four points they have a loss to UMass L whats been the difference for the yellow jackets from those big wins to those losses well basically its shot selection you know some nights they just will shoot quickly in half court I think theyre just still trying to learn the system and also the insertion of George into the starting lineup I think has really helped Georgia Tech on the follow by Dongo gets it down and Georgia Tech leads by three early what do you like about Georges game you mentioned him just a moment ago you know the the thing about his game is that he pushes the ball hes a natural point guard hes got 11 assists nine turnovers on the season but hes learning the position hes is tough for a freshman to come in and play at the ACC level but hes doing a very good job of getting them out in transition and pushing the pace Georgia Tech Dongo commits a foul theres a look at head coach Damon stoutamyer in his first season he was an assistant for the Boston Celtics the last two years was also a head coach at Pacific from 2011 and was the West Coast Conference coach of the year in 2020 he was there for six seasons down low Williams bumping and scoring for Alabama AM well EJ Williams is a big man down low youve got to do your work early you cannot let him carve out that space right at The Music Rim Reeds dashing Baseline tip in Music no Tim one thing about this Bulldogs team they play with no fear because they play such a tough nonconfidence schedule as they turn it over for the first time they are coached by Otis hu Le Jr in his second season they went 15 and 18 last year 10 and8 in the swack finished fifth preseason picked seventh in this years conference poll coach huls got a lot of experience both professionally and internationally and hes bringing a wealth of knowledge to this program he spent a decade with the NBA China program as Georgia Tech throws it away no nowhere to go and again you leave the floor without a purpose and thats what happens and usually Kelly will take that all the way to the rim and shoot it and thats what Damon STM is telling him shoot it when hes at his best what stands out to you about Miles Kelly well he creates space I I like that he he moves very well without the ball hes hard to guard because hes in constant motion not only up and down in transition but in the half court he does a good job of reading the Applause defense Georgia Tech with a nice defensive rotation Corner threes off the mark from Alabama AMs AC Bryant good effort on the Baseline by nongo hes a very long he does a lot of good things very good looking freshman pulls up from 16 doesnt get the friendly roll yellow jackets have started two for eight from the field over 2 minutes without a point Alabama Ms doing a nice job of getting back in transition making Georgia Tech play against a set Applause defense danana hand off Reeves out on the arc double team and they suffocate the guard on the perimeter and jar it Loose ahead to Smith and one and Alabama AM has grabbed the lead its six to5 early on well turnovers will always kill you that man right there Kno is uh BYO is hes a hes a really hard guy to defend and Scout because he moves around so well hes so long and athletic and at the end of the Duke game he was making play after play went head tohead with Kyle filipowski and uh Nate George really as we said before gets them up Tempo and thats what n damire wants to play he wants to push the ball and thats what George does hes a natural point guard he looks for he looks for Miles Kelly Miles Kelly and him I think fit perfectly together Dongo the big grew up playing soccer so he has great feet he also possesses a 72 Wings span for Georgia Tech in the middle as a rim protector that Duke game Dongo stepped out Made a three early as well so he I youre going to see his game expand as they move forward because Damon stanmire really expressed that to us James that Player Development is so important going to keep emphasizing that on a daily bases I mean all schools do that but I think they really his experience in the pros will help them grow individually Reeves has his second three and that ends a three minute scoring drought for Georgia Tech as they reclaimed the lead Music Music early Applause nine to shoot for Alabama AM clean look from the top wide right and the rebound out of bounds to the yellow Applause jackets Damon St did an outstanding job when he coached that Pacific and he ventured into the NBA and saw him up close and personally quite a bit on the floor working with players at the Boston Celtics and when he left in the middle of you know towards the end of last season a lot of the players were missed him because he he really gave them he was a really good individual players coach and he talked about the difference between the NBA and college and college is 247 crosscourt skip pass and a three from Kelly is down they really Ed use that skip pass well especially against that zone they do they ball fake they have a flash cutter in the middle of the floor then they skip it and Tred to find Kelly on the weak side Georgia Tech three for six from three but one for five from inside the Music Applause ark Bulldogs hoisted up in and Applause Music out Caleb Blackwell has entered the lineup for Alabama AM on the handle leads the team with 22 assists The Freshman point guard guard throws it away and Alabama AM has their second blunder good pressure defense on the ball and that time Blackwell just had his head down wasnt aware of the pressure thats what coach Hy says you got to give it up earlier too much pounding into the floor you brought this up earlier Tim both of these coaches have a lot of NBA experience how similar or different is the college game in the NBA here in 2023 it used to be a glaring discrepancy back in the day but is it a little bit more similar now no its analytics driven its five out its shoot the three or get it to the rim and thats the way the NBA is playing it and thats the way college is as well Kelly knifing in STO and Popp and he draws a foul to head to the line for a pair but Alabama ANM still plays a little old school basketball you know theyll go theyll go with the bigs inside theyve got Williams and they got tarz and theres that good passing by Georgia Tech and we just mentioned it its space the court reverse the basketball take it in the Gap get it to the Applause rim Kellys a 73 foul shooter he had a stretch towards the tail end end of last year the last eight games for Miles Kelly he averaged 20 points per game shot 48 from the field 44 from three and 95 from the foul Music line offensive rebound for Georgia Tech stent for a three rebound fumbled around down low and Georgia Techs out of bounds theyre on a 70 scoring run to take a fivepoint lead you know Alabama AM could cause some problems today on the back pors because they do have the wide bodies up front some good quick Wings Georgia Techs not a great rebounding team so right now though Georgia Techs doing a good job on the offensive class Alabama AM coming off a 78 59 loss to Vanderbilt they only shot 29 for the game really went cold in the second half they were in it most of the first session karez for a three short an offensive rebound and the stick back goes for Eric Lee Lee is long and athletic and not a good blockout situation on that possession for Georgia Tech and Georgia Tech turns it over for the fourth time sends us to a timeout Georgia Tech Washington State and then through the first month of this season Tim the league already has wins over un V Mississippi state Missouri and VCU whats making this conference more competitive its a good League it really is good coaching good support from the uh from the universities themselves and North Fork State remember that they beat Missouri in the NCAA tournament a few years ago and youve got to be ready to play against these teams you know when you go up and down in the league I look at the coaches and you dont have to look far Otis hulie is an outstanding coach at Alabama AM and the records are deceiving because because a lot of these schools just like Alabama ANM they spend the most of the first 6 weeks of the season on the road to get the guaranteed checks but theyre quality high quality and with the nil stuff theyre a little behind in that and so theyve got to recruit in a different way and look at this Alabama ANM team theyre theyre a solid team I I think theyre going to cause some problems in the Music whack foul called on Caleb Blackwell his first the second team foul on the Bulldogs nice pass underneath and a dunk for ibrahima Sako good job by Sako on the backside just finding that open seam Alabama AM rotated over no one rotated down Soo another high ceiling freshman for the yellow jackets 17footer rattles off out of bounds to Georgia Tech well good passing by Georgia Tech and Georg Tech when theyre on their game theyre making that extra pass and heres that little pass through the defense by Coleman and thats what Damon St has been stressing just make that extra pass and working very hard on their offensive execution and shot Music selection coach statam not that he feels like theyre taking too many threes passing up Twos for threes a walk on the inside ties Jean Claud turns it over CLA Claw is one of those tough players played at Western Carolina but he has adjusted to playing at this level so far he played very well in the Duke game that was the fifth Georgia Tech turnover drive and kick a three for mcleen as an airball not a good shot by mcleen on that possession he was not open Alabama AM still searching for their first three theyve started 0 for four well Georgia Tech doing a good job of closing out not overh helping on ballside and then contesting the threes now foul called on Eric Lee of Alabama AM third team foul second personal on Music Music Lee stent and Reeves playing catch out front rebound tapped around to a bulldog Alabama AM on a scoring drought of over 2 Applause Music minutes Moody spinning Banker rolls off right back to him the follows short and its out of bounds thats good defense by Georgia Tech with every dribble towards the paint towards the rim their defense shrinks theres a lot of help in and around the basket this is a well oil defensive set right here this team is good ball pressure dont overh help but you see the help in the lane a tough one knocked down by Jaylen Randall well thats what George Techs trying to do though theyre trying to force you into tough twos but its good offensive shot in the in the paint Georgia Tech with their sixth turnover and Alabama AM wants to Music run Music jumpers an airball hoisted up a whistle and a jump off Sak strong man on the inside hes 66 225 well built for a freshman and Damon stoutmire head coach of Georgia Tech told us that we are way ahead defensively behind the eightball on offense though they held Mississippi State to their lowest offensive efficiency rating of the Season according to kenpom and it was Dukes third worst performance against this Georgia Tech defense long three and the rebound to a yellow jacket with a foul over the Music back Dylan McLean picks up his first in the fourth team f how is Georgia Tech struggling to take care of the ball on this end though six turnovers for the yellow jackets well theyre not theyre a little bit over dribbling in the area where the theyre tight the spacing isnt always good I I think George will get them better into their sets got to have better do a better job of ball reversal and then get some more movement away from the ball three from Coleman Georgia te with six turnovers and five made shots in this first Music Applause Music Applause half driveing kick and a threes off the back rim a Miss from Riley and its out of bounds to Georgia Applause Tech you talked about their defense James and and their defense has been very very effective all season long theyve done a pretty good job their field goal percentage defense has dipped in a couple games the Cincinnati game being one where Damon St said we havent been the same team on the road and that was seen again this past week in their loss at Georgia but he said its were work in progress we dont care who were playing when were playing were just going to keep trying to build for the Long Haul so I like his ideas and you can see that their defensive philosophy is very very solid so that will keep them in most games and if they can get their offense clicking they could be a mid to uper tier team in the ACC I think the big thing that stood out from the Georgia loss on Tuesday was Georgia Tech missed 15 layups in that game after a deflection itll stay on this end with the yellow jackets and that sends us to our under eight mediate timeout its a lowscoring grinder here in Atlanta and the other one shooting 33 so we wont criticize the offense jams we well take the positive outlook well say its really good defense so far but both teams need to get into a better better Rhythm a little stagnant is what I would say too much dribbling not enough movement without the basketball Georgia Tech this has been a theme over the course of the week they went six minutes without scoring the first half against Georgia on Tuesday and today they have two three plus minute droughts this one approaching 330 shot clock into single digits George the freshman in trouble has to put it up and a shot clock violation forced by Alabama AM Alabama AM on the season has been less than impressive defensively they give up 48 field goal percentage and give up 86 points a game but looking seemed like an improved defensive team today real good effort out of the gate for Alabama Ann they feed mle oneonone working against Reeves takes him Baseline cant connect in the rebound Dongo The Freshman whos been impressive for Georgia te burrowing to the basket and a Music foul well thats what Georgia Tech needs to do they need to force the issue in transition and thats what they did in the Duke game they came right out of both the first half and after halftime of pushing the pace off a Miss they got the ball down the court they made threes out of transition they got to the rim they got to the free throw line free throw bounces in for gapare and that ends the four plus minute drought for the yellow Music jackets Omari Peak reenters the lineup for Alabama AM and peaks a matchup problem for these power five schools even hes 66 220 a senior plays out on the perimeter actually started the year at point guard for Alabama AM now peaks a goodl looking player hes got good size for guard strong as well Georgia Tech two for four from the foul line in this first Music Music half Alabama AM just five of 21 from the field Peak hes a bucket getter not that time again good defense by Georgia Tech getting out quick close out and contest Reeves and one headed to the line for the oldfashioned threepoint playy Reeves is an efficient player he likes he can shoot the threes good ball handler and that little Euro Step to the rim he came to play this afternoon has eight of Georgia Tech 17 enter today averaging just over 11 points per game the transfer from Florida a fivestar Prospect out of high school and a top 30 player by Music Applause ESPN that was only the second field goal over the last seven minutes for Georgia Tech they pushed their lead to seven theyre doing it on the defensive end outside long range three is money for Riley was good offense on that possession andab andm settling in a little bit the last few possessions first three of the afternoon for Alabama Music AM double comes and Georgia Tech turns it over for the eighth time in this first stza and a steal from George dishes back in a three Trine buckets Miles Kelly knocks it in well thats what we were talking about earlier James how Nate Nate George and Miles Kelly play so well together they seemly are attached at the hip they know where each other is on the court that time good recognition by George with a little shovel pass to the trailer Georgia Tech matches their largest lead flipping it up Lorenzo Downey going to the line to shoot too mil Kelly always looks for Nate George in transition off a rebound off a a turnover because he knows this when he gives it to George hes going to get it Music back when Kelly is set and squared hes one of the best Shooters in the country he does a nice job though he doesnt try to force the issue sometimes he will take some quick threes but he has that mix to his game where he gets to the free throw line hes got the good midrange as well Applause Reeves and Kelly have combined for 16 of Georgia Tech 21 dowy goes one for two for Alabama AM Kyle stur enters the lineup for the yellow jackets who ranks seventh in the conference an assist turnover ratio hes been rocked solid mostly Off the Bench this Music year stur lost the handle and then he commits a foul trying to save The Music Possession just trying to rush things theres really nowhere to go here m is tight they got Georgia Tech has three players on that side of the floor youve got to reverse the ball when theres no spacing on ball side nine turnovers for the yellow jackets to just seven field goals made in this first half thats what damis dmire was talking to us about yesterday he just said you know offensive efficiency we got to continue to work on that every day some days we find it some days we dont right now Georgia Techs too tight they need better spacing better ball movement better player movement midrange jumper doesnt go for dalen Smith in the rebound Georgia Tech Applause Music Reeves puts it on the deck funnels it a hop step and gapare cant get it down good defense Alabama and M converged on the basketball they are feisty defensively this Alabama AM team they are they havent shown that so much this year but you see their length is problematic in the lane and at The Rim near steel loose ball picked up by a bulldog pocket pass Peak blows the Applause Music Gimme George Corner Kelly Applause yes third three of the half for Miles Kelly he lead is Miles Kelly because he can score a lot of different ways and they do a nice job of finding him and but hes going to keep mixing his game up today hes doing a really good job of moving without the basketball coming out and transition on that last possession Alabama AM was coach Otis huy was not happy with Amari Peak the quick timeout after they left Kelly wide open in the corn thought it was interesting Georgia Tech coach Damon Stam told us that they have to get Miles Kelly better shots yeah it it goes both ways you got to get him better shots and hes got to find ways better ways to get open and move without the ball and use screams as well Peak off the back rim rebound Reeves for Georgia Music Tech largeest lead of the game for the yellow jackets cant add to it as a three rolls out Abrams two for 10 on the year but that was a pretty clean look on ball reversal in the paint and in some trouble Alabama AM gets it back out on the ark well Georgia Tech absolutely their game plan defensively in every game is not let you get to the rim they are closing out quickly and giving Alabama AM that midrange shot Georgia Tech top six in the ACC and field goal percentage defense just barely beating the buzzer but the shot wont go in Alabama AM 22 from the field in this first half reees Coast to Coast plus one hes headed to the Applause line weve seen kesy Rees do this a few times tonight he just gets out in transition hes very good off the bounce he has good body control at The Music Rim Reeves and Kelly in double figures with 11 and 10 respectively they have 21 of the teams 26 how does Georgia Tech Stars get some help well its got to start with the point guard George hes got to get everybody involved and see much up front Dongo as well we got to try to get him Music involved Georgia Tech has been able to overcome nine turnovers to build a 12point lead looking much more in sync the last couple of minutes Corner three off the side of the glass from Riley and Georgia Tech wants to run Kelly hell head to the line to shoot a pair well thats the best way to cure a night offensively where youre struggling in the half court is that good solid defense a nice contest by George in the corner and then get it out and go Kelly up to 11 points EJ Williams enters the lineup for Alabama AM Tim as a former coach how hard is it we mentioned at the top that next week is finals week for Georgia Tech theyll have a week off how hard is it this last tuneup before finals to get your team really locked in well you got to just commit to it youve got to commit to you only play 35 games a year so you know why arent you ready and I think Georgia Tech was ready today I think the mindset is there they got a really good coaching staff experienced coaching staff and you got to understand show your team these upsets and you dont come to play you can get upset very easily but Georgia Tech now has picked up the pace taon Claude with the twohanded slam Georgia Texs on a 90 run Bulldogs have hit just two of their last 18 shots every everything is being contested and Techs doing a pretty good job on the glass that time Williams though throwing his body Music around minute left before we break for intermission shot clock at eight for Alabama AM a hop step piercing the lane and a block from Reeves and then an Alabama AM foul and that is their ninth in this first half so Georgia Tech walks to the other end to shoot free throws well Alabama AM is not going to get out of this offensive Funk unless they start moving without the ball a little bit more they theyre trying to do everything off the bounds and Georgia Tech is doing a good job theyre forcing away from the paint and then when they do get in the paint they send the second and third defender in there and when that happens youve got to slide in open areas on the perimeter and try to drive and kick and get create some open threes KY Reeves shooting the one and one and he gets the back end Alabama AM they have already played all 13 scholarship players in this first half as re has really been on a tear the last two Music Music games Georgia Techs largest lead of the half theyve ballooned it to Applause 17 Williams twisting walled up throws it up and in over claw that was pretty good defense but EJ Williams was bound and determined to put his head down in a little reverse pivot spin nice move for the big fella off the window he is 610 275 lbs hes played in 115 career games for Alabama Music AM I was going to say thats a little bit too much dribbling but he proved us wrong with that good dexterity deep in the shot clock flipping it up with the left thats pretty from Amari AB a nice move by Abram with the opposite hit with the left he is a lefty but good move good footwork halftime is here Georg points they are seven of 11 from the field together the rest of the team just four for 12 and kaasi Reeves set a new career high for rebounds in the first half with eight already a foul on the first possession of this second half on Alabama abama AM Alabama AMs defense was pretty solid as well in the first half they just have to get bit more consistent on the offensive end too much dribbling not enough movement with the pass Georgia Tech ended that first half six of eight from the floor and on a 132 run George a jump pass out high for Kelly Reeves rebound number number Music nine nine to shoot for the yellow jackets Reeves Lock and Load wont go another Tap Out Yellow Jackets get their third try Alabama is allm is in the paint in George Tech on the perimeter but those deep rebounds are coming right back out to the offense a whistle and a blocking f called on Alabama AMs Lorenzo Music Downey Bulldogs played 13 players in that first half and Coach Julie told us Tim that these nonconference games theyre trying to stay fresh for league Music play hes hes rolling him in and out of there thats for sure hes trying to find the the right combination on Applause offense Georgia Tech with their 10th Music Music turnover Yellow Jackets only average 117 turnovers per game already 10 in this Music Applause Music Applause one dalen Smith the top scorer on the season for the Bulldogs bumping and drawing a foul he heads to the line to shoot Music two check what Alabama AM needs to do they need to try to space it and then dribble drive into the Gap and draw some fouls because Georgia Tech you know theyre going to swarm the basketball when it does get in the Lane dalen Smith averages 13 1 12 points per game its an interesting story he is completely selftaught he didnt play basketball until high school and here he is he has started the last three seasons for Alabama AM scored over 700 points and his coach says that he is talented enough to be playing in the power Music five Alabama AM with some Applause Music pressure good job by Kelly handling the pressure George was ready to give support down low danana draws a foul and hes going to the line post up by Dan found some space right in the middle of the lane a little pick and roll rolled that short Roll But stayed with it got it all the way to the rim transfer from NC State not a lot of contact attack there the officials are tightening up the whistle early in this F second half Dongo lost the Music handle Alabama AM theyve made just seven shots all game shooting 21 from the field back door Downy he draws a whistle and youre right Tim a lot of whistles in the first couple of minutes of this second half H its a little touchy little touchy right now officials I dont know why theyre tightening it up Music but little slap on the head Reeves got Music caught if youre Alabama AM coach Otis huy whats the message to your team in the locker room at halftime down by 17 well you probably try to get out and transition a little bit more their defense has been pretty good we said Georgia Tech only made 11 buckets in the first half and means there there were a lot of Misses so get up on the glass and try to beat Georgia Tech down the floor if you can because going against their set defense has been a problem Bulldogs are making their free throws theyre six for seven as a club they have ratcheted up up the defensive intensity down low Dongo lost the handle on the way up nice look though by George dribble driving into the Gap with the extra pass that was freshman to freshman but they couldnt convert dalen Smith driving Applause kick Blackwell long 17footer and the rebound Dongo for Georgia Music Tech layup is through for Nate Applause Music George Blackwell racing ahead kick out Smith his three wont go and its out of bounds to Georgia Music Tech Georgia Tech doing a good job just dribble driving into the Gap and way too easy Alabama ANM no rotation over to resist at the rim for George Tim you brought up the transition defense a moment ago it feels like there has been no transition game at all from either team this game has been played in the half court today well both teams are doing a pretty good job though of on the retreat getting back and its Georgia Techs loosening it up a little bit but were starting to rely on the Applause three whistle and a blocking foul called on dalen Smith tried to draw the charge on on Reeves and that is the second personal foul issued to dalen Smith and the fourth team foul already for the Bulldogs in this half at this pace well miss dinner tonight James these fouls are coming rapidly yeah three and A2 minutes of game clock played here in the second half and its more about kind of choppy offense and reaching defense its not the officials fault youve got to call the fouls when theyre there Reeves with a nice Music move that was a nice move by Reeves he is an impressive player he can got really good footwork and creativity in the lane and at The Rim he is so smooth in everything that he does he has 16 points today on five of 10 shooting also has a careerhigh nine rebounds Alabama AM just one made shot since the 612 Mark of the first half Blackwell drains a three right on Q hes been the best shooter from downtown this season for the dogs well well needed for Alabama ANM and then the cardinal sin they dont run back after a make they allow a transition bucket immediately hey 18 for kaasi Reeves to lead all Music Applause Music scorers and a block on the outside Georgia Tech with numbers Coleman lost it out of bounds itll stay on this end with the yellow jackets an 18point lead for GE search that helps save lives you can join the fight against cancer by visiting vorg donate 100 of your donation goes directly to cancer research back here in Atlanta Georgia Tech leads Alabama AM by 18 a big game so far from kaasi Reeves whos pacing for a new career high he has 18 his career high is 21 coming in hes not only a good offensive player hes got real nice length he can guard out on the perimeter he can guard power forwards if he has to and very good getting out in transition Coleman bumped and foul Debo Coleman havent seen a lot of him in this game just 9 minutes he hasnt scored came in averaging almost 10 points per game shooting 41 from three over the last seven and the big thing with him is he never turns it over hes only committed one turnover in 176 minutes this season thats top 10 in the country well Damon sire right now wants to play a lot of players and there you see the nice short roll right down the middle of the floor like Claw at in the lane and he wants to play a lot of guys probably moving forward hes going to have to tighten up his rotation just a bit but a lot of guys that can do different things can move positions around depending on mat UPS Williams commits the foul Claude going to the line for two Tim what did you like about Damon STM as a player back at Arizona 1995 he was the pack 10 coplayer of the Year averaged 22 points per game that season as a point guard what could what didnt you like he he did everything for Arizona and lud Olsen and play an exciting style kind of like his teams are trying to do now push the ball was one of the best Ive ever seen in college running the pick and roll and he was terrific in the NBA as well NBA Rookie of the Year and did a nice job at Pacific and was very well thought of in in the NBA as an assistant coach with the Celtics dalen Smith heading to the line for Alabama AM Smith has five points to lead the Bulldogs Music Applause today splits the pair and the rebound to Georgia Tech heres that Alabama AM full court manto man pressure its bothersome to Georgia Tech but Georgia Tech has found a way to handle it without turning it over and then resetting and getting into their Music offense Stan on the handle for the yellow jackets after the LW the finish at The Rim from Tai claw well theyre doing a good job now with their pick and roll game Damon Sodom sees that Alabama AM is staying put on the outside to take away the three so theyre creating a little twoman game in the middle of the floor and claudes doing a good job on that short roll and then finishing in Applause Music traffic Georgia Tech built a 19point lead a three from Blackwell off and its one and done Kelly with the rebound Coleman from the outside cant ring the bell and a foul down low on Alabama AMs Smith Music thats the fourth personal foul on dalen Smith the leading scorer on the season for Alabama AM Smith a lot to handle today with the multiple Wing type players that Georgia Tech has and lot of guys that can move around out on the perimeter then put the ball on the deck and get to the rim claw of 54 free throw shooter for the year has five points tonight for Georgia Tech Off the Bench make it six with both free Music throws yellow jackets have built their larous lead Tim whats the goal for Alabama AM over the final 13 minutes trying to just get back in this game with their defense and their defense has been solid all afternoon and evening long its just theyre just so staging you see one guys dribbling everybody else is standing on the offensive end thats not going to cut it against this tough stingy Georgia Tech defense on the outside a three just barely beating the buzzer doesnt fall for Osborne and Georgia Tech on the secondary break a deflection out of bounds it stays on this end with Georgia Tech you know its easier said than done though because Georgia Techs defense has been outstanding all game long and your defense somehow can create some easy opportunities by by way of the turnover or off defensive rebounding youve got to try to push the pace and get the ball to the rim in transition dere from Jaylen Randall Randall goes up punched out of bounds it will stay on this end of the floor with Alabama AM excuse me James thats what Alabama AM needs to do even though Georgia Tech did a good job getting back and contesting at The Rim they did a good job though pushing the pace thats what they need to do against this tight Georgia Tech Music defense Williams hes a capable shooter from the outside the rebound to Claude for Georgia Music Applause Music stent navigating a pocket pass and a whistle foul called on Alabama AMs AC Music Bryant thats what coach huls tell his whole team including Bryant right now is just youre reaching got to play with your feet use your length cuz the officials on the perimeter right now are calling it very tight start event at the line for Georgia Tech mentioned earlier that Alabama AM about Midway through the first half had already played all 13 scholarship players now on the other side Georgia Tech theyre yet to play a single game with their 13 scholarship players because senior guard Lance Terry who is expected back at some point this season hes been sidelined with an injury and and thats another double digit scorer for Georgia Tech from last year Well when Terry does come back obviously that will be a really good addition to mil Kelly on that wing and Reeves as well and give Damon stanmire a lot of options because you you do see even though their defense is hanging in there they do struggle at times to score Georgia Tech with six offensive rebounds in this second half Abram has to hoist another offensive rebound Abram drills it keep firing it might go in and thats what AB did good presence of mind though on the offensive class to slide back out and a lot of teams do that instead of trying to put it right back up on the on an offensive rebound they looked back out to the threepoint line that time Abram did a good job of sliding into that open area Peak bottled up down low and a whistle and a foul will be called on Georgia Tech add to this Georgia Tech Team when he comes back and I think Tim one thing that stands out to me is hes an outstanding shooter he hit 47 threes last year and shot 39 from Deep yeah he average 11 points a game in in the ACC as well so he he can step up and play at a high level and I think Damon STM absolutely is confident that he can can just fit in seamlessly once he does get back into the lineup and just gives them another guy that can go get a shot which will take a little a lot of pressure off guys like Miles Kelly and Kae Reeves you know get them open a little bit more because people are going to have to pay attention to Terry peaks free throw ends an 80 run for Georgia Tech over the last two and a half minutes Alabama AM doesnt have a field goal in almost 5 minutes Music Music stent gets it across the dividing line for the yellow jackets leading by 23 pick and roll Corner three from Coleman its not there and another whistle stays on this end of the floor foul on Downey of Alabama AM thats already their ninth foul in the first less than 9 Minutes of play in this second Music half well a lot of reaching going on right now and sometimes that goes with frustration on the offensive end and I think thats what Alabama is facing Alabama ANM is facing just cant get anything going on offense and the its not being fundamental on defense especially on the glass Georgia Tech with their ninth offensive Rebound in this half Coleman 10th offensive rebound this time it leads to some Second Chance points right now Alabama AM is watching and Georgia Tech is attacking on the glass that was Sako with the Music Applause basket tar oneonone with claw Music knifing in the floater buied off the glass and the rebound to the yellow jackets and a reaching foul on Bryant and this will put Georgia Tech at the line that is the 10th foul on Alabama Music AM Brian is Anthony Bryans just trying to make something happen but this is where you got to run back on defense instead they put him on the line for two Georgia Tech last in the ACC from the free throw line at 65 as a team and today just 10 of 18 for 55 three for eight in this second Music half kles stent goes two for two thir have been the only player remaining from Georgia Tech 2021 ACC Championship Music Applause Music team dalen Smith out on the floor with four fouls for the Bulldogs Co still trying to find that right combination that can break the ice of this tight defense really of packline is just force the ball into the paint and they come with a lot of help there it is again Corner three off the mark from mle Georgia t with the rebound good job though by Alabama andm they drove and kick and kick to mle on the perimeter but hes just not a consistent threepoint shooter Abram extra pass Stant turns down a three and the corner pocket triple is there for gapare gapare made himself available his first three on the Year good job by Georgia Tech just spacing the court making the extra pass Alabama AM was chasing them on the perimeter whats Georgia Tech wanting to do on this end defensively you mentioned the packline defense just a moment ago elaborate on that well that means you you control the ball you try to force it into the paint and as it goes into the paint you give a lot of help on balls side you on weak side you stay home on balls side you take away the threes you take away the rim you give up the medium jump shots under under Music duress Abram he pops a three gapare keeps it alive Music Abram Lock and Load cant hit Alabama and M all the way to the rim and a hard foul Riley going to the line cherry picking on the play hell shoot Music two good job by Alabama AM on that possession to finally get a little tip out on that offensive rebound and Riley thought he had a breakaway London Riley gets the shooters roll hes got four points tonight Alabama and M shooting 19 from the floor pacing for a season Music low they have made just two field goals in the last 17 minutes Bridging the two halves together and this isnt the first team that Georgia Tech has done this too they did it to Mississippi state held them to a season low and Duke to a season low shooting its a stingy defense its uh its work in progress though I think that theyre getting better by the game with their defensive chemistry and you know thats chemistry on the defensive end too and as Damon said were better defensively than we are offensively but the I think the offense will come cuz they have a lot of good capable skill players on the perimeter Georgia Tech turns it over for the 13th time tonight yellow jackets have a stretch coming up they play Penn State on the 16th and then UMass and then the winner of Portland and Hawaii before they go to Florida State so this is really the last nonconference tuneup before the nonconference matchups get tougher right before ACC Applause play passes too tall and out of bounds 14th Georgia Tech turnover Chang that thought at the end of the year I I thought there would be a lot of balance getting to the final four and we saw San Diego State Florida Atlanta get there but I was convinced Connecticut was the best at the end and they may be again the best they look really good even though theyre they are young 18point lead make it a 28point lead I should say for Georgia Applause attch James Arizona Arizona seems to be distancing themselves right now as a team that has absolutely been the best so far this season what do you like about that team size experience speed interchangeable parts parts terrific coaching uh they beat Wisconsin easily you know saw the game against Duke earlier in the year here they push Duke around in the paint I think Duke will learn from games like that moving forward but theyve got no weaknesses that I can see now Tim be honest you you said 15 or 16 teams you felt like could have won it going into the tournament last year was Yukon one of the 15 absolutely okay you were all in if if I if you didnt think Yukon could win at all at the beginning of the tournament you should not be a college basketball analyst because youre not pay youre not paying attention but I thought they were terrific all all season long and then after the first couple games I I thought they could win it I really did and uh and they won it easily so I think thats the thing is just how dominant they were in the tournament as Abram hands a three for Georgia Tech that is their ninth of the day Yukon was impressive again going into Kansas got found get the face pretty good in the first half but they came back took the lead and now in Fieldhouse and lost in the last minute but sure theyll get better because of that and theyve just handled North Carolina pretty easily earlier this week at Madison Square Garden Alabama AM with backto back field goals for the first time all game and a steal Blackwell weaving one on three and he draws a foul The Freshman heads to the line for the Bulldogs Tech a little loose on those last couple possessions maybe looking at the scoreboard to touch too early for Damons liking six minutes left Alabama AM head to the line now this is what Alabama AM didnt do early enough in this half is force some turnovers and get out and transition what do you think about this kid Caleb Blackwell point guard for Alabama AM his coach had some really high praise for the Freshman well I like his decision making and hes been very solid all season long he gets into the gaps hes pretty quick can make an open three I think hes a keeper for Alabama AM hes a guy that o Otis fuy can keep on the floor and Trust to run his team and I think hell get better and better as he gets more experience but a real goodl looking freshman in the whack Alabama AM pre season picked seventh in the swack they did receive one first place Music vote they continue to put the pressure on this is good for team building as o h said were trying to get ready for our league and they want to play this quick style but Georgia Tech is too athletic up front clauds had a nice night eight points and six rebounds big steps and the teardrop goes for mle mles got some good length as well you see him getting out of transition Kelly teas it up two on two the other Applause way Moody plus one he count the basket going to the line for the oldfashioned Music three Music Alabama AMs made their last four seon theyve got all the pieces um they theyre young in some spots but I think theyll figure it out got to rebound the ball a lot better to be consistent thats the thing and now Georgia Tech is starting to put it on here with a little bit more aggressive play against that press but got really like Virginia I think we talked about the packline defense and thats Tony Bennetts Ace in the Hole and they look like theyre back but they can also shoot the ball offensively theyre going to be an improved team as well I like what Syracuse is doing recently I think theyre playing much better they had a good win at Georgetown earlier today a deflection it stays on this end kapare had the big slam for Georgia Tech two trips ago Tim what about Clemson they enter the top 25 they 80 off to their best start since 2007 and theyre currently on top of TCU whos also undefeated out of the Big 12 Clemson leads by nine that game is being played on a neutral floor in Toronto well Clemson showed me a lot by beating Alabama and last week and with Clemson theyve got a lot of depth got a lot of experience and theyve added Joe Gerard III and the transfer from Syracuse and he kind of gives them something they never really had just that deep Long Range threat just adds to there are other guys that can score and I think gives them a different look but I I like Brad brells team a lot spinning in the lane bucket will fall for Moody he has six for the bull Music doogs Alabama AM theyve made six of their last seven shots and a run out for backwell he converts on the Music break its probably a little bit too late for Alabama AM but this is a good sign for them moving forward they staying spunky with their defense and trying to get out and transition we head to our final immediate timeout the under Music four 18 points today for Georgia Tech on six of 11 shooting last three games Duke Georgia and Alabama AM 1412 and 18 hes also grabbed a careerhigh nine rebounds for Georgia Tech this Music afternoon final chapter of this one here in Atlanta with Georgia Tech up by 23 and Reeves giving it up it goes to gapare in the corner knifing has it stuffed George on the outside and gapare a whistle and a walk on Georgia Tech now thats one thing Georgia Tech will want to clean up thats their 17th turnover Tim sometimes over dribbling is a problem against a tight defense usually it is but if you have the right guys taking the ball into the gaps I think sometimes guys that arent supposed to dribble in traffic or dribbling in traffic and one thing Damon thire almost never did as a player he almost made the right decision off the bounce and all was really hard to guard and thats what they have to do theyve got to run things through George through Kelly reeze rarely puts the ball on the floor unless he finds it has an open Lane but some of their secondary players have done that today booty Square on his Defender and he draws a foul Alabama AM have only been outscored by Georgia Tech by six in this second Music half Georgia Tech has struggled at the free throw line theyve got to the free throw line early but Alabama AM two for 19 from the three ACC big pi picture you brought up Virginia theyve scored 80 or more points in three of their nine games this season they only did that twice all of last season what whats different when you look at Virginia well sharing the basketball they theyve got a group of guys that can score and Tony Ben teams have always been you know people say theyre going to walk the ball up the course I Court I think theyre playing at a faster Pace to be honest with you I think theyre trying to open up the court and you know coaches that adjust to the way the game is played you know especially when youre such a outstanding defensive coach I think thats what Virginia has done theyve opened up their offense a little bit more theyre more of a four out five out offense where instead of Tony Bennett calling plays its more of a read and react offense and theyve got a group of good Shooters they always have on the floor the other team Im curious to get your thoughts on because theyll be here on acc Network after us is pit as Abram bricks a three in the rebound to Alabama AM pit Lake Henson hit nine threes earlier this week a pit record against West Virginia a nice win for the Panthers is gapare with the Euro Step and the Feathering layup for Georgia Tech well Jeff Cables done a really good job of retooling this program in the last two years and hes an outstanding coach and he understands the portal and Henson that was the Backyard Brawl game against West Virginia so wasnt against some buy game at home where theyre going to win by 30 I mean this was a rivalry game on the road so that was very impressive by Henson turnover Georgia Tech with under two to go I think you said it best it was on the road and it was in front of 13000 Rowdy West Virginia fans that pit went on the road and won by nearly 20 Georgia Tech by 23 here with a minute 45 left well move to five and three and five and one here at home Runner yes sits down for Chad Moody well its one of those games youve got to be able to Applause uh get your team ready get in stay fundamental make sure they play tough defense hope some shots fall in the second half and thats what Georgia Tech has done and just some good little building block for Georgia Tech as Damon stener tries to keep his team moving in the right direction after a couple good wins and then a disappointing loss at Georgia they just got to figure out how to go on the road and sure theyll learn from their two Road experiences that they had in the preconference Alabama AM Burns a timeout after the basket for May 27 theyve dominated the rebounding 50 to 26 and they have 16 offensive rebounds as Georgia Tech will clear the bench leading by 19 here at Music home well theyll head into the final exams and thats you talked about it earlier James you asked about you know these type of games getting into the exam week and they are difficult for for not only the road team thats got to come in and play another road game but the home team whos expected to win its not a glamorous opponent but an opponent that the coaches know can be dangerous we talked about the swack what theyve done in the past and Al also this season as far as their wins against the power five and you just got to get get your team to play the right way and Georgia Tech even though their offense at times didnt clink and they turned it over too much their defense got them through this game as well as they rebounding kaasi Reeves at the line drills the first hes up to 19 points careerhigh nine rebounds six of 11 from the field hes made all five of his free throws so far tonight and Miles Kelly who had the big first half temp for Georgia Tech with 11 points he hit three threes hasnt scored in the second half hasnt been on the floor a whole lot but also when hes been out there he hasnt been forcing anything for Georgia Tech hes letting the game come to him well they have good balance they really do and I think Nate George the insertion of Nate George into the starting lineup has really helped Georgia Tech in their balance and understanding you share the ball move it around it doesnt have to always be about Miles Kelly tonight it was Reeves as well and they got good production for gari and Claud and stent and Coleman I mean these guys can all make plays and I think thats a big positive moving forward Abrams been solid see him in there helping out with the ball handling ability ball handling out on the floor and so Damon stars got to be happy where his team is right now they just have to figure out how to be a little bit more consistent on the road Reeves would have had a new career high if that jumper fell 17 seconds left Alabama AM will have it nobody scored more than eight points for Alabama AM tonight theyll have a week off for finals then get ready for Penn State on a neutral floor on December 16th followed by UMass on the 21st and then Portland OR Hawaii on December 22nd prior to Christmas then theyll come back January 3rd 2024 at Florida State the Georgia Tech foul in the open floor thats on Amari Music Abram soon as were done here well get you out to Kus at pit Jay alter and Debbie anelli standing by for that Music one Georgia Tech LED 34 17 at the half Alabama AMs played almost even with the yellow jackets in the final 20 Music minutes well as a coach you just want to try to get through these games without any injuries especially in a 21point game but continue to see fouls being called and but thats really not about that its about the big picture for Damon sty I like what hes doing for Georgia Tech and his mindset about building a program Nicholls with the rebound down for the yellow jackets Final 5 Seconds a three hoisted by a bulldog doesnt drop and thats going to do it Georgia Tech wins it 7049 for Tim Welsh Im James Westley
