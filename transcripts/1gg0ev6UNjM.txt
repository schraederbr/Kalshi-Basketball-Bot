PC championship game playing North Carolina Tip off is set here and we are underway Starters for Florida State Itll be Robert McCrae of the fifth Kobe McGee Le Jones Chanty Wiggins and Alex Steen Alabama Sego and Micah Simpson Ajan Anderson Arshawn King Draquarius Stanbeck and Mario Andrews as Kobe McGee picking up right where he left off A three ball here to get us started He had nine of them against Alorn State Three threes nine points and the Seminals lead Anderson on the catch on the right wing Arya one of the things coach Louch talked about at shootaround today was he wanted better halfcourt defense He felt like his fullcourt press was good but they broke down in the half court You can see on that first possession really good defense by Florida State Ball almost intercepted there Jquarius Stan back Ball into the back court right before it gets there as Ajan Anderson has it guarded with 10 on the clock now on the turn Plesie shot not there and the rebounds to Florida State Jones catch and shoot three Yes sir Two for two Florida State leads by six This is what FSU wants to do Play fast and knock down the threes Not the start Alabama State was hoping for The first two looks from Florida State are wide open threes from deep Three ball That ones in there Nice shot Micah Simpson One of the lone returners from Alabama States NCAA tournament team from one year ago And the senior has the Hornets on the board Steen on the catch Well hear more about him in just a couple of moments Working against it Nice step through and it rattles out the rim Didnt like it Offensive rebound Steen fouls Stays with it smile on his face and hell go to the line You can see that toughness that everyone says Steam carries The way he stayed in there and fought through that missed shot stayed composed coraled and kept it high You got to keep those balls high down low You cant bring it down for the guards to try to get away from you First free throw is down And Steen on Tuesday night against Alorn State had 12 points Rebounds and two blocks The transfer from Florida Southern College Division 2 ranks Hails originally from Panama City Beach Florida Knocks down another free throw The Simols shot just under 70 as a team against the Braves on that Tuesday night opener as a near turnover does turn into a turnover No want to focus on hitting more free throws So a good start there They lead eight to three McCrae spin move Thats pretty all the way to the left hand Left it short Offensive rebound Steve Its blocked Shot He stays with it Jones already hit one Hes got a second Thats tough to guard Arya If he can post up out there and get those shots off and just be waiting on that ball to come be kicked out to him its going to be hard to stop Jones tonight Shot top of the key Stand back Long rebound McCrae behind the back dribble creates space Somerville He steps into a shot Thats off to the right Offensive rebound Jones Nulls coming out flying here McCrae calls his own number That ones back iron Steen has been active on the glass Cant get two hands on that one Steen is everywhere He is such a hustle player down low Hes got invaluable moves down low cheering Miss shot Offensive rebound Ball is loose in the short corner A tie up possession arrow Stay with Alabama State Who tied it up Ara Steam of course Hes everywhere right now Associate Coach Head Fly was telling me that thats one of the things Steam brings to the table is just how he is just a gogetter Hell go after a loose ball He said he just makes everybody on the floor play harder Short corner pull up jumper Thats good Nice play Micah Simpson hes got a couple buckets and Tony Madlock told us earlier in shoot around today he has got to step up This has to become his team He said hes got to be his shooter He cant be a capable shooter Oh how about Robert McCrae in the fifth with a kiss high off the glass He can do it all We talked about his assist and the way he can distribute the ball but hes a scorer at heart McGee into the open court Hes fouled this frenetic pace and its one that Alabama State invites Its the way Tony Madlock wants to play but the NLES right now are feasting all over the Hornets And its the Seminals stinging Alabama State early on And you can just see the court vision Sometimes you got to pass sometimes you got to shoot but Robert McCrae can make some decisions Theres a free throw for McGee Hes got four couple subs coming in here now for the Hornets When you look at Kobe McGee the transfer from Drexel who averaged 14 points per game one year ago there is a calm presence about him right That been there done that veteran leadership that a guy who has been around the college basketball game brings to the table Yes And you know he leads by example too Hes one of those type leaders as well as Robert McCrae But McGee is like the first guy in the gym If you come to shoot around hes here early If you come to the game hes here early Hes a guy you want leading by example for your team Siminals will jump and press You see Luke Lops there on your screen A follow is called on Somerville Hes the sophomore transfer from UMass LOL wearing number one He comes in pretty quickly for Florida State didnt start but theyve done it now two games in a row where hes coming in the first couple of minutes Another hand check there on McCrae And we asked Luke L and one of his assistants Michael Fly to be honest right about the defense after game one and they both said We love the trapping and the pressing and creating chaos but there are too many times in the half court weve got to clean some of that stuff up and not allow straight line drives to the rim And Luke La still trying to teach them how to play defense without foul right And its a learned lesson cheering And right there they got the deflection knocking it out of bounds Thats something else they want to really be cognizant of is tipping passes to make things get disrupted And he said hes happy with his disup disrupted defense but like you said they want to get that half court penetration and open threes finished None of that anymore And the open threes for Jones He is on fire Ara hes got nine points Hes perfect from beyond the arc has hit all three of his attempts 18 and seven against Alorn State on Tuesday night The hoop and the horn there Simpson has come to life and hes come to play Hes got all seven points for the Hornets For the NLES the pace has been the way they want to play it and theyre hitting shots from the outside in that tempo Yes And its coming easy When you can kick it out to the open man and he gets a clean look its going to make everybody excited And Le Jones is knocking it down 21 years Thank you for your service Heat Heat Heat Heat Well a new face to this Florida State team Alex music D And hes off to a nice start here tonight We say hello to a new face to our broadcast team in Ansley Topchic Well when I asked him what his role was on the team he said Im the plug guy Whether its diving on the floor making plays whatever his guys do whatever his guys need he is willing to do And coach Ls reminder that even guys like Steph Curry make mistakes has given Steen all the confidence to trust his game guys Steen shown a lot of confidence so far here against Alabama State Thank you Ansley The hustle and the effort really helps this seminal team doesnt it 100 and his aggressiveness and his experience and all the years of playing college basketball under his belt and the games hes played the hardware hes won is why hes so confident Cam Miles into the game He launches misses everything Loose ball picked up I like getting the young I like getting the young guys in Ara Getting some looks early so they can get in the rhythm of the game High off the glass That ball not going to be there Rebound collected by Basson Maloo to Somerville Miles his own defense from the Hornets Back door cut Bisag the freshman looking for help instead does it himself Bang the Frenchman using all 7 foot three inches of that wingspan to corral that pass in Maloo shotgun that thing right at him but he cored it and finished up strong Allesie into the game as well Shot up and in for Mason Tyler Mason the junior transfer from Howard Very good score around the basket for his head coach and the deficit now 11 You know thats one thing about Tony Madlocks team People dont realize hes got a bunch of new faces on his squad this year too as well Arya Theres a hand check foul Go against Standback And if that is on Standback hes got three already not even six minutes into the game Hes got to come out And you know Coach Madlock talked about him today at shootaround on how hes one of those young kids He he reclassified early He red shirted last year but hes still just 18 years old and hes trying to help him learn and grow through his mistakes hence leaving him on the floor Miles and Maluke at the rim Last touch by the Nolles Itll go the way of the Hornets 20 to9 Florida State leads by 11 Semol six of 13 early on shooting They have forced three turnovers after forcing 21 against Alorn State on Tuesday night part of this defensive plan the NL want to employ Floater not there Offensive rebound and a foul Mason He will go to the line cleaning up some action there at the bucket Gas kind of over the back trying to pull that rebound Hes so athletic and thats one of the things the staff love about him is how he can be aggressive and take advantage of his athleticism His offensive game has got to catch up with his defensive cheering game Free throw off to the left and one more coming as McCrae checks back in McCrae became a quick fan favorite on Tuesday night and his head coach said You really know hes in the zone We talked to Luke Lax earlier today about shooters getting into zones but can guys who pass the ball get into similar zones as that free throw rattles home and he said absolutely And the game had slowed down so much for McCrae He was trying different things like behind the back passes that his coach was cool with on his way to 17 assists Well you know with that and like Luke can tell you cuz as you mentioned earlier in 2012 hes the last person to have the second most assist He could get in the zone himself as a point guard and distribute the ball Uncanny Allah like he did at Duke to beat Duke up there with Michael Snares shot at the buzzer Pass intercepted McCrae has a threeon two Wiggins euro steps and he attacks the basket with a soft kiss off the glass and in Wiggins playing in his 99th college game is the most experienced player on LZs squad But hes also coming off a big time night careerhigh 22 points with five rebounds on Tuesday Three of eight from beyond the arc in that game as well as had the freedom to be able to shoot the ball unlike anything hes had in his career prior to coming to Tallahassee We asked in Wlard State He said the staff and style of play Matient jump too early and he front iron the dunk Nullles want to run Wiggins screen light three ball rattles out Way downtown with that one Are you He was deep cheering Turnover Numbers in transition for Florida State Miles tries his hand Back irons a tray ball Oh he touched past it to Wiggins Crosscourt Bang thought about the three puts it down and now the Null will run their offense He does LET IT FLY THIS TIME AND nothing but the bottom of the net for the Frenchman And Madlocks seen enough Ara he wants to take a quick one and slow down this barrage coming from the entire bench at Florida State Tom Bang from Paris France letting it fly from beyond the ark And the Seminals now five of 10 from three early in this one They hit 13 of 30 against Alorn State on Tuesday night And again off to another good start here tonight from beyond the arc Well be back in Tallahassee momentarily Heat Heat Heat Heat Its been a heck of a basketball career for Chanty Wiggins across two schools in the ACC His family has loved music watching him play For more on Chanty we throw it back over to Ansley Well yeah this guy basketball runs in his blood Both of his parents played at the collegiate level and one of his earliest memories is going with his mom to her alumni night at Missouri State and seeing her name up in the Hall of Fame He told me his parents love to give him notes after the games And his dad gets specific asking him Do you remember this play Johny laughed and told me he has to say No Dad I just played a whole game But he added he is so grateful for their insight and mentorship Guys its always good when your dad is playing at a high level like Chantys Pops did at Witchah State Michael of course having started there in the 90s The three ball that was good by Anderson to trim this seminal lead as McCrae lets it fly top of the key That one misses everything Itll be Hornets basketball But more on Wiggins We talk about calming influences How about a guy that you alluded to earlier who has been at so many different levels at Clemson where hes made a Sweet 16 in an Elite 8 and hes won 18 ACC games in a year as well you He brings a ton of calmness really for the team because hes been there done that and he said thats one of the things hes trying to share with the team Other than that get six rebounds a game is his personal goal and hed like to get the 10 but you know he he has taken that step with his experience at Clemson and bringing that to the Florida State squad Hes got to help Luke in his first year Good defense by the Nolles Miller forced into a long two Now they want to run McCrae thought about the three Doesnt take it Theyre keeping on the perimeter to get some inside touches will help with those kickouts Thats one of the things they wanted to work on today McCrae all the way to the rack himself Torqued his body and he can do it passing and he can do it scoring as well Oh hes a great athlete We talk about it all the time how athletic he is and his ability to really sky He did a little bit of it there but hes got more to go with those tops he showed you tonight Another turnover force And we take another look at McCrae just putting his man on skates You know and hes got the ability to use both hands Hes very ambidextrous with the ball so he can reach around his defenders You know I had a chance to call his games last year at Jacksonville I got a couple of his games really got to see some of his personal moves And here hes more of a distributor than a scorer right now Wiggins lets it fly top of the key Back iron too strong Somerville long offensive rebound and the seminals will reset He asked for a screen here from Steen The pick and pop Steen back door cut Wiggins stays with it Loses the basketball though Seemed like that play was just maybe a half second off THERES A BLOCK SHOT BY STEEN HE MADE UP FOR IT ON the defensive end McCrae game getting a little frenetic McGee fires Yes Oh Kobe McGee hes got another one And Florida State they got the hot hand from beyond the arc tonight as McGee trying to pump the crowd up A bit of an unconventional kick out three But if you got a guy sitting out there whose last name is McGee you better hit him cuz hes going to drop it Im looking to my left and my right More students here tonight than there were on Tuesday trying to get the weekend started with some FSU hoops You score over a 100 games Says that shot Oh baby Are you kidding me parking lot triple from Ajan Anderson And they talked about his scoring ability and hes a point guard this year Really looking to score as a guard but man he shot that from deep McGee feeling good That one rattles out Offensive rebound and a stick back by Wiggins Good job crashing glass One thing you can see in this game Florida States guards are going to the rim when a shot goes up You got to love it when your guards rebound Just got to make sure one guy gets back to stop the ball Seven offensive rebounds for Florida State on just 12 missed shots so far Pump fake floater Teard drop Wiggins cleans the glass Something hes been focusing on is the rebounding Watch Wiggins push the break and poked out from behind Itll go out of bounds Itll stay with FSU Couple subs coming in But we talked about what the students want to see They want to see dunks and they want to see threes Theyre getting it tonight athletic ability and here it is Steam smacking it off the glass and the excitement from the team And as we talked about dont let them set their feet cuz his nose can drain it Six of 14 as a team from beyond the arc McGees got two threes Jones has three of them And they have a goal of about 32 threes a game Thats what Luke LS wants and they want to lead the nation in attempts and thats obvious with what youre doing And you got a team right here in Alabama State that likes to shoot the three as well but theyre getting a hard time getting their look for Florida States athleticism Offensive foul away from the ball Shawn Mohamd did not hold his screen got a little excited just got in the game trying to get that pick and roll He can jump himself and trying to get that lob dunk over the top Jamu Ahmed the junior from Queens New York UMass is where he played his last stop before coming to Tallahassee Had 106 block shots at Southern Idaho Nearly had a block shot there The put back is good Tapped home by 23 Thats Arshan King Its 3218 Somerville dissects the defense now Back kick three He wants it Its a little strong there Nolles another offensive rebound JONES HASNT MISSED YET and is waiting for his first miss Maybe he wont miss tonight I think we got another guy in the zone tonight Just tonight hes not passing and hes shooting Tonight of zones for the seminals Big three there Anderson tried another parking lot shot He he attempted that one from Montgomery Alabama And one of those things you talked about just a little bit ago Arya is the crowd Youre right When you bring the offense and you bring the excitement like you said deep threes dunks scoring 100 points word spreads A way better crowd tonight The the fans are here and especially the students Thats a good thing for LS and his crowd McGee on the catch Somerville jab step lost the handle fell down jump ball Possession will favor Florida State this time on alternating possessions Thats that toughness coach Matt Locks talks about diving on the floor trying to corral that loose ball Well were at the under eight media timeout here at the tuck 3518 Florida State Hustle plays all around and theyre shooting it well too Hey and the guy thats doing it tonight is Le Jones He is shooting it from everywhere applause Go to the window I love It was a season to remember for Tony Madlock and Alabama State The Hornets who had to win music their conference tournament just to make the NCAA got to the first four beat St Francis and really gave Auburn a test there music for at least a half in the first round of the NCAA tournament And you see on your screen what that meant to the program First 20 win season in over 15 years And Tony Madlock told us he said Well its our message that finally set through We had a lot of returners This years team though going to be a lot different with nine newcomers right And he even said what it did was is kind of second his preachings every day in practice where his kids buy in and believe more about what hes talking about to see it come into effect just like that breakaway layup that just happened right in front of us But coach Madlocks a great guy Hes a veteran He played with Penny Hardaway at Memphis He brings a lot to the game and is a a great example of a tough hardnosed leader helping kids grow into young men Foul calleds on the floor Wet spot as well And the managers quickly remedying that Its on Plesi and team foul number four for the Hornets They lost eight players from last years team including their top three leading scorers in Amar Knox CJ Hines and TJ Madlock who graduated McCrae is called for an offensive foul Said he extended his arm as McCrae looks for an explanation Our officiating crew Eric Lewis Adam Flor and Randall Wells And he just goes down big boy He had his arm out a little bit but then this contact you cant see it from that angle but its a good replay You can see he kind of goes into him with that left shoulder cheering And check violations of these officials right now trying to initiate more freedom of movement rules And they told us again early in the season theyre going to be a lot tighter on hand checks and not allowing guys to be able to move So you got a bonus already opportunity for Simpson Theyre a little bit lighter on them than they were on Tuesday night Tuesday night if you got near anybody it was a foul And now its 7 to five on the or seven to four on the fouls Florida States got more But you know you got to be happy Its at least theyre not stopping play too much and letting the guys go up and down But thats a testament to both these crews both teams and the crew of officials that theyre playing pretty solid Another free throw is due here for Anderson Ajan Andersons the senior whos a score first combo guard the coach wants to challenge to defend at a high level Last year at Queens cheering he was a pretty good scorer Queens of course a school in Charlotte North Carolina Hes played 25 games averaged just over five points a game but had 24 against Western Carolina which showed what he can do And I think the Hornets are hoping he brings to the table this year in swack play Hes had a nice start here tonight in tally Hes coming from a good program at Queens theyve got an established program and they before they went D1 when they were still D2 they were national champions and in the contention every year Miles three ball too strong a battle for the basketball Its loose We got another tie up this time Arrow going back to Alabama State And LJ Jones there He Hes not hanging on the perimeter Hes going down there diving on the floor with that loose ball and still getting a plenty of jump shots when hes out there But I love his aggressive play of making everything happen and not just floating on the perimeter like some guards tend to Simpson will inbounds Nolles will show that 221 press Anderson falls down Oh they call a foul When you land on an offensive player or or vice versa the guy on tops going to get the foul Like they got to call something cuz he went to the floor A tough break for Bassan But the young Frenchman is really coming along He He looks more comfortable tonight than he did on Tuesday his first night out You know funny after the game his name is pronounced in the pronunciation guy is Tomas Basson He told his head coach Luke L You can call me Thomas because youve called me Thomas since Ive come here from Paris France And then he corrected coach and said Its actually pronounced to if you were to say it in French I think we got to call him Tomas Well were speaking English Is it difficult to say Tomas I know its its not It might be difficult to say LJ Jones Theres LJ Jones with a little French on that basketball Hes got the secret sauce Three ball on the other end That ones good Nice shot Tyler Mason and again an Alabama State team that wants to play similar in some ways to Florida State They want to play with pace Well trap on defense and theyll launch a ton of threes And you know Masons really a post player but obviously hes showing us he can shoot it as well Deflection out of bounds Ball go to the Hornets and the ability to inside out and just cross him over and get to the rim and use the rim for protection Thats one of the things that athletes have really gotten good at The basketball players have become so good at using the rim as a an additional defender to keep the the guy from blocking the shot And here 5second goal and the Hornet Simpson able to get it in quickly and Miller darting up the court He steps on the sideline My goodness Turnover number seven for Alabama State That chaos is what FSU wants as Tony Madlock beside himself there on the sideline Well he said one of the things for his team as we talked about hes got a young team or young to him has he just recruited them all this summer is they havent seen me in a game setting yet and he says you know I get a little feisty and I dont know how theyre going to handle me Alabama State team picked fourth in the preseason in the swack preseason polls Second straight swack opponent for the Nolles playing Alorn State And if you count the game against FAMU in the exhibition its the third straight game against a Swack opponent as Wiggins blocked Tried to back down Mason And the junior from Stafford Virginia wins the battle for the Hornets Alabama State hanging around here in the first half Off to a bit of a chaotic start for the Hornets They settled in for the comfortably up 11 Still about five minutes to play Well Alabama States gotten better on their defensive transition and getting back and not giving those open threes Blocked shot No theyll call a foul Nice back door cut by the Hornets Jones was trying to time his jump to block the shot I think he got maybe a little wrist You cant give up the baseline Thats that half court defense we were talking about that Luke Lox is worried about for tonight But you got to give him credit going strong in there and not being afraid King going straight into Le Jones and getting the foul Marshon a red shirt freshman from Memphis Tennessee misses the first free throw Began his career at Arkansas State cheering where he red shirted Hes a former threestar player out of Bartlett High in Memphis And thats one of the things Tony likes out of his kids is those kids from Memphis He said They got that toughness already I dont have to coach them up too much on their toughness Well he left two points at the free throw line Nolles will be thankful McCrae teard drop The Hornet might have got a hand on it too Cleared by Mason The ball movement has kind of slowed down for Florida State which is part partially why theyve gotten Alabama State back in the game Layup No foul call Theres a whistle That is the 10th foul on Florida State Luke LS unhappy about something during that sequence Was there a travel there JRock I didnt see it but you know Luke must have seen something cuz he is unhappy He drug his feet right here He definitely and a double dribble He was tap dancing I can see Coach Ls complaint but its hard to win that battle cheering Its Luke saying I I have the replay now He can request it and then it would charge him a timeout if hes wrong Its a new rule this year Well both free throws miss McGee trail three Not going to be there in transition And another foul as the whistles have really picked up over the last couple of minutes Arshawn King went down on the rebounds and the Hornets will go back to the line Theyve already attempted 11 free throws in this first half Theyve only made four of them So that hasnt hurt Florida State quite yet Somerville and coach LZ are both claiming that he didnt do anything You know theyre saying he caused the contact cheering that Somerville didnt initiate the contact But when somebody goes down high like that its its hard as an official not to kind of see something And also as a young coach and any coach in particular when youve got doubledigit fouls and your opponent has four fouls hes pleading his case to try to get the foul balance equaled out Common practice in college basketball for a coach to complain Two free throws there from King And into the game is Dearan Yates Now the Hornets will show a little token pressure See if they trap out of it They do not They back out Theyre in that fourminute immediate timeout mark Somerville McGee green light Three ball is short Rebound Hornets Simpson wants to push Darts forward inside the threepoint line Heavy pass but resetting There is Mason Wiggins active hands Tell you what Florida State is playing very actively on the defensive side at least Thatll take us to our under four media timeout Alabama State back into single digits The deficit just nine Well be right back Chapel Hill kid a transfer Remember backing up Hunter Dickson last year points and seven rebounds Well tonight hes four for four from the floor and has not missed a three yet And hes music shooting them every way Four threes already and he has got 14 points and leading the charge for Florida State and first year head coach Luke LZ joined here Arya what do you think about LJ tonight Hes done a great job Yeah no doubt about that Hes been a steadying hand there from beyond the arc for FSU and they trust him to take those jumpers But its a null team that started six of 13 from beyond the ark And if my math is correct theyre now seven of 22 for 32 Is that one for their last nine And yes and music they strugg right Good job I promise You know is that Florida State education But the theyre out there and theyve switched the zone for a little bit Now theyve gone back to manto man on this out of bounds under I do want to defend Florida State academically When I got in I didnt help Now its a top 20 university Theres no shot you and I could get into this university at this point Its not only a a topnotch academic institution but its a bigtime athletic institution as well as we all know near flop and Somerville I said near flop he did flop and Somerville knocked down the jumper anyway Laid back into double figures And Somerville had a little something to say about it too cuz he loves to do a little talking 3928 Somervilles first points say looking for a stop here to pick up some momentum late in the first half on the drive Switching hands not there Nolles have numbers if they run four on three Wiggins left wing three ball in the air He banked it in They all count the same I think the bank might be open on this Friday night Not sure It is on the west coast even though were on the east coast Wiggins is not afraid to pull it and he loves to shoot that three in transition Cant cash an ATM anywhere but right here at the Tuck here on this Friday evening 4228 Wiggins has seven Its a quick 50 spurt from the Seinals Miller floats it in Thats nice with the left hands Tony Madlock called him a steady true point guard Wiggins on the other end Steen Hell slam it home Offensive rebound Got the rebound turned to pass it and was like theres no defense on me cheering Got him a little slamajama cheering They had it cut to nine and now they got to open back up on him a little bit Three ball right wing that rattles out Wiggins Oh did he catch it over the cylinder They say no He plays on Thought I heard an inadvertent whistle Somerville fouled on the drive And thatll be the sixth foul on Alabama State and Steen the canny ability to turn and just realize I got to put that bad boy down And they talk about stopping that penetration and its not happening every time because right there Alabama State with the layup near 5sec McCrae able to get it to Jones just in the nick of time Under 90 seconds to play in this first half Bulls have dropped 44 points Defensively have held Alabama State to 30 And McCrae Fingerl hes just too strong Crafty around the rim Do people forget that Mr McCrae can score the bucket as well in his career Hes not just distributing Hes also scoring Averaged 18 points per game in two seasons at Jacksonville University JU and the A Sun A twotime first team allconerence member there Blessie pulls up free throw line off to the left on that jumper rebound Wiggins Johny Jones thought about it Didnt shoot Pulls the ball out You can see Luke Locks on the right side of your screen barking out instructions Im surprised he didnt try to get a two for one here Taking the air out of the ball McCrae crosscourt pass Four on the clock Jones off his hip A foul a reach in on Micah Simpson That is his first team seventh And the no will go to the line for a one and one Bit of a break for Jones cuz he had lost the ball But there was a lot of contact as he was going down the lane And you can see Coach L over there was talking to McCrae trying to get his marching orders on how he wants this last 30 seconds to shake out Im in Were talking about McCrae shooting the ball so much Hes already got four assists even though he hasnt been quote unquote in that same zone he was the other night How many times he going to get to 17 Well thats its not happening That was top five in ACC history If he can float seven eight assists a game Thats phenomenal But hell take five a night too Youre talking guys like Raymond Felton Kenny Anderson Mugsy Bugs Thats how far back you got to go He was in the same breath as those guys with the assist category there in the assist mark 46 30 as Jones missed the front end Miller turns faces jumper two strong four on the clock now Three McGee with two Half court Have McGee lets it fly and he didnt catch anything Might have had time for one more dribble but all in all second half underway here at the Tuck on this Friday night Second consecutive game against the swack for Florida State to start nonconference play First season for Luke LS is Jones right to the basket and he lays it in Jacob thats what you wanted to see right And you think coach LS wanted more points in the paint and taking the easy first opportunity if its there Well when you get into the paint it causes the defense to help and then you can get better clean looks by pitching the ball outside cheering Illegal screen on Pali and that is a foul Its so hard to hold your screen and you want to get anxious to make a play and rotate You got to learn to hold those screens He just got with the program in August per coach Madlock So hes still learning the coach Madlock system Everybody in the early season trying to figure some things out 4830 as Jones on the catch to McGee MCCRAE SIDE STEP OFF BABY THE HAMMER ROBERT MCCRAE THE FIFTH ASSAULT ON THE RIM But I tell you Arya I said that man had some hops and the seas just parted for McCrae who found a clear lane to the basket How about these ups He pressed the button baby Elevator to the top floor Thats what you got out of Robert McCrae attacking the rim Robert McCrae who can really shoot the basketball A foul Its on Is that Pie again I think thats 11 No its on Its on McCrae McCrae was on McCrae Okay Nailed Plesi Kind of bumped him at the body and hes got to make that call The balls falling out of bounds Theres contact Coach L is not happy jumping in this side court press that they like to do the sideline out of bounds Foul number three on McCrae and Robert McCrae eight points in this one and four assists King gets Steen in the air on the pivot foot Nearly traveled Itll go out of bounds Itll be Florida States basketball They did a great job doubling the ball as soon as King got it King was trying to make a move He thought he had gave him a good head fake but that was some better half court defense Thats what Luke Gls is wanting Not just trapping in the back court trying to get a quick turnover but stopping penetration and not giving them easy looks down low Foul play there for Alabama State and coach Tony Madlock Luke Lou said they played with more energy than the Seinals Ansleysley caught up with coach Madlock right before the start of the second half Right Ansley I did And he said you know my guys started off slow but we got a lot of new guys Its a relatively new team so were figuring it out especially you know in a tough away environment And I said Whats the key to this next half And he said We have to rebound the ball Arya Rebounding ball should be a key not just for the Hornets but for Florida State a seminal team that though offensively got 11 offensive rebounds What are some ways Jacob that the Hornets can keep the NL off the offensive glass Well theyre going to have to box them out and theyve been running some zone and its hard to box out in the zone because you dont really have a man and you cant box that out McCraes head was nearly at the rim A twohand flush Weve been talking about how big an athlete he is and hes showing us right here in the second half on the other end Tyler Mason says Let me get in on that action Im an athlete too baby Im about to bury that thing Timeout taken on the floor Were going to take it with him Robert McCrae you know he can pass the ball He can distribute He can score And he can jump out of the gym Hell find a way And hes all about it Whether he does it on his own or has some help to the next left Robert McCrae bring it on Hold on Help Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Heat Its a Florida State team that shot three for four to start this second half Getting better looks and attacking the bucket too Yes And theyre distributing the ball better and theyre attacking what theyre giving them as far as getting to the rim And then defense creates offense with the turnovers Trey handles the rock Calls out a play screen set by Steen Pick and roll Steen lost it on the way up Howd he make it HE STILL DROPPED IT IN AND THE FOUL Stes got really good footwork and he stays with it Even though he didnt have a good grabs on the ball he was able to corral it and keep it high and get that touch even through the contact over the top What a sweet pass And gets drilled and still stays with that bad boy And LJ Jones right there on the backside in case it rolled off ready to flush it home Alex Dean who is a prolific shot blocker at the division 2 level for Florida Southern College 194 career blocks Had two more against Alorn State in his seminal debut Luke La Mr hustle Thats what he brings to the table right Its the intangibles and the grittiness around the bucket 100 He Hes the tough guy down low Hes not walking around like a tough guy but he plays through everything and hes just so strong down low Nothing knocks him off his game He had interest from over 70 schools prior to picking Florida State The likes of Kentucky Louisville Old Miss Bama all had some interest in Mr Ste as Look at him run the floor He catches Oh it went right through his hands Was he the last to touch it is the question He doesnt seem to think so but they will say he indeed was Its a turnover for Florida State Just their fifth That ball had a lot of push behind it right You got to get it a little bit of lob to it Give him a chance to get up under it like a pass You know you cant throw a bullet straight and expect a guy to catch it through traffic running 94 ft Plesi nearly trapped at the midcourt line That was a double dribble Didnt get called That was missed Miller almost traveled there Pass to Pali off to the left Offensive rebound Yates turns and it rattles home Yates with a really good look down low Didnt let the defense rattle him and stayed with it Gates his first points of the game to go along with two rebounds and an assist 5734 McGee straight away three ball Nothing but the bottom of the net Kobe McGee can really shoot the basketball Thats his third tray ball here on this Friday night Hes got such a sweet stroke and works on it is the best thing about watching that young fella in the gym is how much effort he puts into getting better Over 40 one season ago for Drexel was third in the Colonial in the league in threepoint percentage Somerville lost it on the dribble Picked up there by Mason Now Simpson jets forward pulls it back Miller on the catch and he threw it over the top and a turnover Kobe McGee you got to be happy with what hes doing for you Coach LS When he gets spotted up hes ready way downtown whichever side its from hes dropping buckets Stay alive All right party Let us see Heat Heat Heat Heat first year ACC coaches and Luke LS chief among them for the NLES Jai Lucas at Miami Ryan ODM to Virginia and Will Wade heading to Raleigh and NC State all are off to a really nice start to the season have really enjoyed watching Miami and Jai Lucas and the music way they played defensively Ryan ODM known in the mid major ranks as one of the best coaches for a number of years And Will Wade I mean Im telling you what that guy can coach basketball and he can acquire talent Well you talking about Ryan ODM whose dad at Wake Forest coached at Virginia Ryan ODM grew up in Charlottesville Chanty Wiggins from deep once again But then you got Jay Lucas at Texas His dad is one of the best allaround basketball guys out there start in the NBA Big time player And then Will Wade who walks with an edge on anybody and hes ready to walk the walk in the Triad area Hes not offended by Duke Hes not offended by Carolina or Wake Forest He said Were in town and we about to make a presence known in the ACC No doubt about it Its exciting times with those four head coaches coming into the ACC On the flip side though too Jacob think about some of the coaches we said goodbye to Coach Ham Coach L Jim Largo of course Tony Bennett at Virginia The legends are taking it to the house cuz they dont like this NL NIL area Miles fouled on the run Weve said goodbye to so many legends of the game who have made profound impacts on their programs But this is the new era right And you talk to all these new coaches Luke Ls among them Part of the reason they brought Luke LS was his ability to manage a roster what hes done in the NBA his ability to understand what it takes to be able to put a team together at this point One of his things Arya was he said the chaos of the NIL era in college basketball its just a Wednesday in the NBA Thats a good because theyre sitting there dealing with constant agents complaining Allah thats what they have to deal with now for college kids people complaining about not making enough money You have to deal with that with college kids now Its so many different things Playing time that used to be your only complaint but you used to be able to keep your kid if even if he didnt like his playing time Now if they dont like their playing time were out of here Were transferred and theyll pull to the portal in December So its a tough work and its a young mans game now Its hard for the veterans to really enjoy this new era and hoops and to be able to keep guys and be comfortable with only having them for maybe one or two years at the most Right Coach Hamilton he could develop a guy in three years and theyd be a first round lot pick in the NBA Same with coach L Coach Bennett is the null want to continue to run Both those guys like veteran leadership and that thats not whats happening out there now You got to have young kids that know how to play and teach them real quick And thats what a guy like Luke Glings with cheering his NBA experience No doubt about that Like he said just another day that ends in Y in the NBA Jumper there That is good for the Hornets It was Miller on the bucket 6536 Wiggins on that right hand Theyre going to call an offensive foul Did he use a chicken wing Did you see one Well he used his shoulder a little bit But my favorite part about this is coach Ls expression Hes very frustrated with how his guys are playing but it when you go to the rim and it you know he hes got his arm out there a little bit and hes clearing space so its an arguable call Hell call it against you in Chapel Hill Theyll call it against you in Durham Second chance opportunity is good as Mario Andrews high motor player from Independence Louisiana Hes able to knock it home cheering Wiggins three ball off to the right Rebound Yates out of bounds on the deflection Stays with Alabama State Cam Miles running in transition deflecting that pass out of bounds Thats the kind of defense LPS likes to see Close out the whole way Dont pull up But you got to run the floor with these Alabama State players because they play the same kind of system Trap in the corner there Now another one coming and its right into the midst of Bong Was he out of bounds They say his toe must have been on the line Much to the sugarin of the seminal faithful Tom Bassan There it is You can see it on his camera work Hes standing there with his foot on the line Well 11 stepped on the line first and then we got him the Frenchman on the sideline not the baseline Did you catch that on the baseline Plesie Oh yeah about a quarter of his quarter of that sneakers on the line And these are things you can challenge by the way I think Coach Ls eventually youre up 27 Maybe Tuesday night against Florida you might do a little differently Near 5 seconds and a near travel cheering Anderson lost the basketball Pocket pick by Somerville Nolles in transition Jones lets it fly Banks no good Rebound Bung Somerville He tries his hand Yes sir And it all started with that corral rebound by Bang using that 73 wingspan to pull it in and then pitch it back out to Somerville Somerville the America East Rookie of the Year one season ago Hes got five in this game The answer by Anderson on the other end Not phased by the deep ball from Florida State He pulled his on Maloo Soft touch for the big man Alair Maloo 611 sophomore from Baldwin Pennsylvania of Sudin descent Its good for the young big man to get some success Theyre going to need him in their next game coming up which happens to be Wheres that area Where are they next week Its a big one huh In Gainesville against the Florida Gator That should be a lot of fun to be on the SEC network ESPN network televised I really need YouTube TV and ESPN to uh figure theirs the beef out right I want to watch this game Youre going to have to go to a public establishment No kidding Or go to the game Correct Pushed in transition OH BLOCKED SHOT OUT OF THE SKY Fabulous footwork from Somerville to keep him in front and to make him hesitate And as soon as he hesitated flying out of nowhere came the freshman well sophomore to bat that bad boy out of bounds Think twice Look at that clean block Pass intercepted Miles looking like a DB at Dope And on a terrific feed Somerville to Log Jones How about Jones now quietly with 18 points in now backtoback contests as a seminal Hes everywhere tonight You look at Florida State offensively A number of talented individuals especially on the attacking end right You got Jones weve seen what McCrae can do Wiggins McGee has a steady hands and then you get Somerville and Miles off the bench A lot of pure scoring ability for FSU defensively Thats going to be the key for them Can they get some stops and lock it down to allow their pace and their offensive prowess to really take hold in games Well thats what the Florida State fans are going to see different this year is the style of play and the scoring ability of Luke Clauss assortment of players hes put together here in his inaugural season in Tallahassee Think youre going to get a replay potentially a challenge Florida State is challenging out of bounds 7243 Florida State last year Chuck Walsh telling us 27 threes was the most the nullles attempted and now theyve got over 30 in backto back games 31 attempted here today Were getting explanation here from the official whos come over to the desk into the booth Its a challenge And I think our boy Jay Rides going to explain to us exactly what Adam Ford just told him Luke LS has called his first challenge of the season So with it being this close to the media it becomes an extended But thats why its an extended timeout And if the challenge holds up and is turned over the play is turned over with possession then he does not lose a timeout If the possession stays the same and they dont change the call after review unsuccessful challenge white three kicks the ball out of bounds That is new this season So teams will have to figure it out They are precious no doubt Right your timeouts But thats something that I love about it Confirmed Got it Yep Confirmed with the call Well they do confirm the call Florida State loses a challenge 7243 music Well be right back Come on Come on Get the heat Back here in Tallahassee 7243 Florida State Second nonconference game second game of the year both against the Swack as a three ball launched by number three Trey Miller too strong Florida States final tuneup before they play the Gator next week in Gainesville as Miles had a clean look from beyond the arc Couldnt knock it down Seminal team will play on Tuesday night in Gainesville Another turnover from Alabama State Thats number 16 And you get the feeling too that thats what Florida States going to need to do against the Gator isnt it force some turnovers hit some threes and give yourself a chance cuz thats a big basketball team down there in Gainesville with a lot of talent a lot of experience playing in front of the rowdy reptiles This seminal team can create some chaos Oh theyre everywhere Theyre trying to trap everything in the full court and get deflection and as you said to create the chaos which Alabama State just created Thats what they want to do as well Anderson nice work from Ajan Anderson the senior But coach Madlock likes to turn you over too He wants to pick you up full court But hes been turning the ball over They dont turn it over like that And this is not going to make coach LS happy Simpson Oh he blew the layup on the Euro step Jones to THE ROCK OH HE PUT HIM ON A POSTER LE JONES A HIGHLIGHT REAL PLAY here on this Friday night If he gets a look hes taking it Folks Leg Jones just got a body and hes got 20 Mason left it and short Jones again McGee on the catch Probes the Hornets defense McCrae turns faces layup Oh that was nice Robert McCrae The athleticism from the senior Yates three off to the right Maloo fighting for it Ball still loose Yates shot foul and hell go to the line And they open it up like part in the Red Sea Jones sees it right in front of him and goes right at the rim and just cradles it and throws it down Ara he is doing it from every angle every level however you want to talk about it Le Jones is scoring the basketball tonight That was crazy Here comes the whole crew Hes Hes subbing them in like Coach Ham and Harry Clark used to pull Bringing in the posi Yeah the hockey line change cheering for Florida State You see Jones and Malute come out of the game Quick combo with coach LS Free throw good from Yates He splits him By the way congratulations to Jamir Watkins who did debut tonight for the Washington Wizards Has gotten into the game 43rd overall pick of the NBA drafts this past summer That three Wiggins cant connect So another NBA null Well coach Hamilton had a long list of them He did And Anderson down here pulling up in perimeter from deep And coach Madlock is not happy with those quick shots when hes trying to cut into this lead that Florida State has But back to that Coach Hamilton had a really good run and a big time recruiter He affected a lot of mens lives by helping them become such honorable young men and at the same time creating some really good basketball players with a lot of success stories Wiggins corner triple took a couple of bounces didnt fall down He affected half the staff over there working for Luke LZ Sure did That jumper is out but a foul called away from the play Its Did you get a number Did they say 300 or 03 Didnt see it Were all learning Im telling you Early season rust is a thing So they put up double zeros Tyler Burke Thats the foul McGee launches and connects from the corner right in front of his team bench Kobe McGee has four triples and now 14 points Two games for Kobe McGee and no twopoint field goals only shooting threes Simols with 12 threes here tonight 35 attempted Luke La said he wanted 32 and they didnt get there on Tuesday night They have Oh Mohamd pins it against the glass but its goalending But a Florida State team that has easily passed that mark and still has over eight minutes to play in this one Everyones got a little funny look on their face cuz theyre like that ball looked like it was on the way up for that block but its kind of going in either way So it fell fell through Yeah coach L was telling us earlier this week about learning to have patience and we talked about it on Tuesdays broadcast in the NBA as McCrae great look to Mohamd kick to Wiggins He said he got Steph Curry and Klay Thompson and Kevin Durant as that shot no a whistle away from the ball was a foul calleds Yes indeed On number three to Trey Miller for the Hornets But in the college ranks you got to have a little bit more patience with kids who are still learning every day And thats something thats testing Luke here in the early going Coach La over there just called Wiggins over cuz hes trying to talk to him and and get him to get a better shot selection Hes just shooting the ball with too many people on him Its getting stuck a little bit with Chanty tonight where hes was way more fluid earlier but you got to like his toughness right there Cutting to the rim being held by two hands Being held by two hands didnt even phase him Still playing hard And Wiggins is stepping into a new role this year as the leader of the team and thats what hes here for and hes embracing it But you know he had a great night the other night with his 22 points leading all scorers and hes got his 12 this evening That ACC experience for Wiggins Again theyre challenging to rebound the basketball more here in his senior year Hes got five tonight He said My goal is 10 Its an extension extended uh pause in the action here Is it a clock issue No I I think its a foul issue Like whos got the fouls I think its stand back now with five fouls So hes done Miller has four of them Thats the foul trouble situation Theres no horn from the table McGee on the catch Nearly undercut by Bird A foul called That is now going to be the one and one for Florida State the rest of the way This is where these games are tough And its tough Its tough on Alabama State Theyve got 13 games 12 of them are on the road you know and and and you its kind of a normal thing in the swag They play a lot of road games because it brings in a lot of guarantee money and it gets frustrating when youre its their first game of the season and and theyre down 30 It cant be easy right And theyre going to learn a lot He said life in the swack is you got to play road games and they will Theyll go for 12 days out west Trips to Colorado Air Force a tournament out there New Mexico And again Alabama State you collect some paychecks right You help pay some of the budget You hope to pull off a stunner the way Pthun Cookman almost did against Auburn earlier to begin the season But I said the challenge is to get guys ready to play by swack and have them motivated and ready to make a run in conference play But you dont want them to get beat up too much Thats what Im alluding to You got to stay in those games to keep those guys ready so they dont kind of get frustrated going into the season the conference season where they want to make a run cuz at the end of the day its a one bid league You know the smaller leagues are not getting but one team in So they want to be that team Wiggins too strong on the three Hes now two of 10 from beyond the arc Does pick up the loose ball Another turnover Terrific pass McCrae Alioo It was blocked out of the sky and I think Yates knew it was coming Transition the other way Mohamd foul Guilty of it Mohamd trying to pop up there and get that block shot Couldnt quite get it Got the foul Alabama State going to try to regroup coming out of this timeout 8149 Back to Tallahassee in just a couple moments All right will be champion Well get started Go cheering cheering cheering cheering Thank you Wheres the Well a Florida State team that has had a couple of tuneups music before they get the opportunity to play a top 10 program for the Florida Gator on November 11 Thats Tuesday night music on the road The Okonnell Center will be popping And coach Luke LS hes trying to challenge his teams with the best right Florida they play every year But a game against Texas AM in Tampa Georgia in the ACC SEC challenge and then he wants to go play at Houston and he knew hed get North Carolina and Duke but his goal was to get all four final four teams He got very close to doing that He wants to music he wants his kids to know exactly where they stand before they get into conference play Oh with no doubt And and he said when he took the job he wanted to play the toughest schedule possible And I remember coach Michael Fly said Hey coach you cant play the hardest teams in the country and thats all you play You got to spread it out But Ill tell you the ACC said Hello Luke LS Welcome to the blue bloodoods He gets at Carolina as game one in the ACC and Duke at home as game two in the ACC So hes got his work cut out but its the first year man Like make it happen at home Get that rhythm and and by the end of the year the way theyre playing its going to be hard for Carolina and Duke and even Florida and Houston to match up with these guys if they can dictate their pace If they can make people play the way they want to play its going to be a problem for a lot of people I know Carolina will run with Florida State no problem Houston will be interesting wont it That is a contrast of styles for coach Samsons team as an offense Its a foul called on Florida State away from the basketball TexasM will be unique on its own Theyve got a first year head coach right They struggled in the first half uh last night Bucky McMillan am I right Yeah And he wants to play the same way too 100 Hes hes from Sanford Hes you know and he jumped straight from Mountain Brook High School in Birmingham Alabama to get the job at Sanford But his style of play is is a little bit like Lukes where he just wants to shoot And that schedule again you you test yourself with some really good teams but you also play some teams that if they are quad four in the net you have some margin of victory games like you have here tonight and you had against Alorn State That allows the net to stay at a pretty high number metrically which allows you once you then get into conference play to be able to stay high throughout the year as you accumulate wins Exactly But this year Bong how about that three Nice shot And Bongs getting better as the games go on He didnt really make any jump shots on Tuesday Here he is Knock down two good ones tonight but thats what coach Lax is trying to do Hes trying to build his foundation and get this team better every week day in and day out He talked about culture and trying to build one here in Tallahassee And you could see that on Tuesday night the team really rallying around each other I think we have some stuff here that well get to in the broadcast showing you truly how much these guys love each other as Bang Same spot nearly had the same results Looked good out of his hand and Anderson lost it out of bounds Little tip from behind action Hornets may have got lucky It did look a little bit like it may have rolled off his thigh but were staying down here with Alabama State LJ Jones checking back in A true offensive threat at all levels for Florida State Lefty trigger for Mason cheering Barely grazes the iron Jones pushes Somerville wide open for three He knocks it down Martin Silver the Energizer Bunny for this team The sixth man who can really stroke it 41 a season ago at UMass Low And a timeout by coach Madlock Hes still trying to get his guys coached sequence to sequence and situationally Doesnt like the way his teams playing defensively right now for the reigning SWAT champions For coach Madlock hes just trying to get better Hes trying to get execute do things the right way play through the the uncertainty and the difficulty theyre experiencing right now And hes taking advantage of it trying he like he said this is the first game this group of guys has played with me as a siminal team too whos forced a lot of turnovers right Not just tonight against coach Madlocks group but against the Braves of Alorn State They forced 21 turnovers and got 27 music points off those turnovers on Tuesday night Tonight they have forced 17 turnovers with 31 points off of turnovers And thats something coach L has emphasized that he wants points off turnovers He wants to get the turnovers but also to score off them Go straight to the rim when you get that turnover And if you dont have it pitch that bad boy out for a three on the perimeter or just swing it around Its about decisionm not set plays for him You can see that active defense for FSU just swarming at the top trying to create traps a frenetic pace trying to speed the process up for the Hornets Doesnt work that time Plesi confident stepping into the three Those are his first points of the game His first shot made in six attempts 8756 Somerville Well use the screen by State Somerville on the attack Miles steps into a triple That ones short and off to the left and to the right of your screen Collected by Plesi and the Nullles get to 100 points on backtoback games to begin the Luke L tenure Well theres no doubt thats what coach LS wants to do He mentioned that today when he was about to walk away at shoot round He goes first one to 100 wins Thats his motto Jumper not there and trying to save it was Plesi couldnt get to it Nulls running Somerville all the way himself Missed it Tap back No Steen stays with it And a foul called Steen staying confident down there Playing right through all the contact He doesnt care He just wants to corral it back in and get the layup Alex Dean seven points eight rebounds Im a nerd for plus minus and the Nles are plus 25 with Alex Steen on the court In just 18 minutes of action hes added a block and a steel and he showed out in everything theyve done The Bama exhibition game they played up in Birmingham he had nine rebounds He had a close call this summer right back at home in Panama City Chuck Walsh telling us the story Florida States SID Steen stepped on a sea urchin And I have to not laugh when I say that because theres nothing funny about it Hes okay but it was a pretty scary encounter Hey its a stinger No pun intended But if youre not familiar with sea urchins Google it Theyve got these tentacles sticking out all over the place and they really do some damage to your feet Same thing happened to a former Simol and Travis Light where they were on an international trip and he stepped on a sea urchent and didnt get to play a single game on their twoe trip Theyre shaped like stress balls right Except they dont feel anything like stress balls Its the exact opposite They feel like nails Were glad Steens okay in playing for Florida State twotime conference defensive player of the year at Florida Southern College We watched him in practice High energy Oh thats thats the thing coach Michael Fly talked about is his motor He said his motors off the charts and he works so hard that you have to take him out of the game because he cant play extended stretches because he runs out of gas Couple free throws made by Simpson Micah Simpson has nine points Anderson leads the Hornets with 14 of them Jones probes Nulls work around the zone Good idea there Just too heavy and too hot of a pass set a lead to a lay for Anderson Hes been impressive tonight hasnt he Coach said thats how he plays He said hes a score a scoring guard But you got to love Aalier Maluke running the floor after that open court turnover trying to get that blocked shot even though hes unsuccessful Dave Jones pops from two midrange jumper Thats a rare sighting for a Florida State team And I see LS explaining to him in real time I dont want you shooting twos He was happy they only took two against Alorn State They lead by 29 here against Alabama State In good condition to move to 2 and 0 Well be right back 8960 music The seminals leading Alabama State here by 29 Bang on the catch And now Somerville Floridas a team who looking to move to 2 and 0 Theyve already attempted now a program record 41 threes and heres a 42nd three and its connected Theyre not shy Somerville knocks it down Hes into double figures with 11 Hes hit three of them The seminals have hit 15 as a team And thats not the only thing theyre hitting Theyre 93 from the free throw line This team he said he had a bunch of shooters on this squad And LZ was not kidding when he said he had recruited shooters Simpson way downtown left it short Maloop long rebound pushes it ahead to Miles Crosscourt Somerville ball fake Bass top of the key will slow it down Well never mind Somerville just pulls Thats ill advised You dont want to do that Simpson high off the glass Put back is there cleaning the weak side with Arshan King You got to give it to Alabama State Theyre still trying to do what theyre supposed to do Dropping back in the zone right here Switching up their defenses Maloo fires a three Too strong Mohamd rebound Somerville straight away And hes got another His fourth Oh Florida State scorching from beyond the arc 16 make threes as a team Near block floater too strong Bass will take it down Kick out Miles ball fake He steps into a three That ones good Its a three party in Tallahassee The weekend started with the tray ball Three ball corner pocket baby cheering 9862 a seminal team culture important to them And you see that man right there number 15 Jaylen Crawford who had his first career points as a seminal on Tuesday night on Robert McCras 17th assist And his dad Adrian on the radio call Youre going to really love this Enjoy A high ball screen McCrae with a left hand McCrae stop pivots out to Crawford A THREE ON THE WAY screaming LETS GO LETS GO FOR THE 17 BABY FOR THE 17 Theres Adrian Late 90s early 2000 Hes at for the 17 He said he forgot to do playbyplay there and to do Cutler and do the broadcast Jeff Coane on the call with him on the Simol Sports Network That had to be an incredible music moment for a father who put a lot of time into this program to watch his son come in and put a bucket in as well Oh Oh yeah Adrians a fixture in the basketball community in Tallahassee He he kind of really gave back and and and started working with the youth in a lot of different areas music even out in the surrounding areas as far down the Appalachiccola And and his son has kind of grow up part grew up a part of that mixture of being around the program coming to practice getting in the gym sometimes and getting shots up when other kids couldnt So its good to see a young fella have success on the same floor that his dad did Maybe not at the same level but its exciting Went to Mcclelay High School did Crawford the younger Crawford And Jaylen who hit the three again for the recordbreaking 17th assist for Robert McCrae the fifth Luke L pointed to a kid that hed known since he was 5 years old and he said if that doesnt epitomize culture not just the work that he and the rest of the walkons and the managers put in each and every day but the way his teammates embraced him and he said things are going to get hard at some point and you need that unity to be what the guys fall back on together through good and bad And it was cool to see everybody reacting He said coaches were going crazy for him Well thats his motto is connected He wants everybody to be connected COME ON NOW THERE HE IS AGAIN AND HE LOOKED AT POPS STARED DOWN DAD ON THE BROADCAST AND ADRIAN LOVES IT Is he a shooter now He said Give me more minutes A little kid can shoot the ball Theres no doubt about it Hes been able to shoot it since he was a little bitty old type As good as it gets Its why you love college basketball His teammates are all holding each other back Nobody sitting down on that bench Malook miles ALIOOP IT WAS NEARLY INCREDIBLE Mohamd lost it on the way up Nolles are above the century mark Tip in not there Malook wants to push the floor Shot clock is off and theyll call Carrying violation Take another look at Jaylen from three Cold as ice Doesnt even think twice As soon as he catches it he fires it up and pops over here enjoying the moment back to back Two games in a row cheering Final few seconds taken off the clock Floater nearly blocked And at the end Mohamad sends it to the rafters What a fitting way for this one to end Luke LS backto back games in his first season with over aundred points He is
