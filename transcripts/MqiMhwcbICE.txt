home whes with the red lettering and the blue trim CET yigu coming off a 171 rebound performance in a win on Tuesday Over Pittsburgh loses the tip to Fon Reed and the Demon Deacons trying to find Matt cross on the Baseline turn it over to Tyler Johnson the starting point guard these days for the deeps and Doug I think a big thing for SMU tonight is being able to take care of the ball wait for his guards do a great job of pressuring the ball as you mentioned J Carrys into that starting lineup The Freshman missfires from the corner tracks down his own Miss and its a fresh 20 seconds on the shot clock for Juke Harris you cant be hesitant if you have a open look you have to take it you have to be aggressive Batman will be aggressive one of the top scores in the ACC Hunter sales averaging 18 and 1 12 points per game and we know Salis can score the ball in bunches hes just going to have to be a little bit more aggressive tonight looking for his own this is Chuck Harris blocked by Reed and here comes Wake Forest Harris attacks along the Bas line cut off by Harris knocked out of bounds its an SMU Applause Music takeaway dug early on the crowds already into it so SMU has an advantage right there but defensively SMU has continued to improve over the last five games holding teams to 35 and under in each one of those games so they are more than capable defensively heres BJ Edwards more on his plate today missed from the corner by the man who moves into the starting lineup back into it Terio quendo Salis fouled by Chuck Harris who is among the many new f here in Dallas for Andy Enfield in his first year after leaving USC to become the head coach of the Mustangs and he just went into the transfer portal and hit a whole bunch of home runs well they got 4000 Point career scores and hes known as a offensive genius but again defensively is where they really have to come together if they want to continue to improve the rest of this year Well in there win on Tuesday Over Pittsburgh where they hammered the Panthers 8363 while the E offense was humming their defense especially in the first half was just suffocating for the Panthers well especially when you start to get in determined play we talking about conference in NCAA tournament you have to have your defense clicking on all cylinders guys have to be communicating you have to be aggressive and you have to know your rotations Chuck Harris passes into a double team the Freshman from Turkey able to find the open man well done for SMU endos got his first two and thats where you got to be careful with wake if youre wake if youre going to double team C right there you got to look at the Cutters and then you got to look at the long scrambles everybody on smus team can shoot the basketball SMU is one of just three teams in the country right now with six different players averaging double figures along with auburn and Gonzaga but again smus without its point guard and one of those double figure scores in boy Miller thanks to a foot injury last to touch was Juke Harris but how about some IGA if youre wake force and youre going to double team you got to know theres going to be Cutters theres going to be open guys in the perimeter its a good find Right There by CET good cut by Endo good finish at the rim and there is buy the 6 foot Jr who was anticipating playing against his former team he was a demon Deacon last year Matt cross with a long two and the Mustangs take their first lead and and selfishly I wanted to see boy Miller play against his former team not only because hes having a great year but just the the rivalries that they had going against each other in practice it just would have been a a heated contest so its unfortunate that hes not able to play Parker Frederickson off the bounce justtin the ball game misses his first shot yeah boy last year was a back court mate with Hunter Salis and they were as dynamic as any duo in the back court in the ACC theres poopy fired up off the three ball from Chuck Harris its a 7 nothing SMU run Doug you see the match up right there frericks and Harris if Im SMU on the offensive ENT Im giving the ball to Harris every single time youre attacking that match up Edwards takes it aways among the league leaders and steals per game sets up o quendo and thats the type of pace and Tempo the Mustangs want to convert theyll turn you over and Edwards is as good as anybody in the conference and theyre such a good team Doug of getting out in transition even when they dont create turnovers so when theyre able to create turnovers and turn that into transition theyre just a much better team and then obviously Endo in the in the in the transition super athletic get into the rim and can shoot the ball with the best of them he had 17 in the win over Pittsburgh on Tuesday where he was four for six from behind the threepoint line and hes one of those thousand Point scorers after spending two years at Georgia and then last year coming off the bench for the Oregon Ducks and now transfering to SMU for his final season its an SMU offense that is TOS in the AC at 83 points per game 48 shooting from the floor 39 from the ark juk Carris left wide open and he is begging as he goes back up cour as that was halfway down but despite the three misses I like him being aggressive because all three shots were great looks no relation Chuck Harris with his second field goal its 103 SMU on a 10 run has him out at least for today it looks like he is dressed and could come in but what you and I saw first during shoot around earlier this afternoon and then when he came out and tried to get loose pregame he clearly is not anywhere near 100 well well to be honest the loss of Hilder is more of a loss than it would be bopy Miller for SMU hes a hard and soul of this team hes the best defender and hes a much improved scorer on the offensive end Aton Reed gets his first touch inside misses with the lefthanded hook shot thats what wake Force has to do they have to try to establish some type of inside out so they can his defense and then be able to get those kicks out kickouts will result in Long Closeouts in driving Lanes SMU has scored on its last five possessions for this 100 run but that streak is snapped on the turnover pass just a little too tall for BJ Edwards and Doug for SMU you just have to get ball movement side to side everybody is capable of passing shooting and driving the basketball get some good movement see where the openings are attack the openings and then make the good decision got a look at Andy Enfield the 55yearold native of Shippensburg Pennsylvania 2000 point scor during his days at division 3 Johns Hopkins University Parker Fredrickson still struggling to find the range this Applause season Edwards finds the open man in the corner its Chuck Harris for three and thats where SMU really excels at every guy has the ability to get into the paint play off two feet kick it to the quarter to Harris whos more than capable of knocking down a threepoint shot so 13 straight points scored by SMU Wake Forest has had six consecutive empty trips trying to end that Tyler Johnson leaves his feet bad pass five on the shot clock Spillers re able to bat it back Salis for three and the dees continue to fight on the offensive end Frederickson will try his hand and connect much needed make for Fred whos been struggling shooting the ball all year long and with SMU really locked in on Salas who are the other guys that are going to come up Step Up This is an opportunity to be able to get more playing time iive dunan dunan pow at Georgia Tech who took advantage of the injuries now whos going to step up for Wake for Matt cross is as versatile as almost anybody in the ACC the fifth leading rebounder in the league can step out and knock down shots hes got six double doubles already this year Salis off the curl no Reed again with a tap back to Salas and theyll reload theyre getting all these Second Chance opportunities you have to be able to do something with it its a great Drive Right There by Tyler Johnson thats what hes capable of doing getting in the lane making plays play off two feet and get a floater he has to be able to take care of the ball tonight do cross off the feed from Edwards left it short well number zero in white SMU how much more does he have on his plate on both ends of the floor than normal without bopy Miller playing Eric well hes hes hes guarding the best player on the other team usually anyway but offensively hes used to scoring the ball just being in attack mode where boy Miller is setting everyone up now he has more ball handling duties he has more decision making duties and it can be a lot for a player but I think hes more than capable of it here is Edwards a secondyear Mustang Salis stripped it away Salis I think was standing on the Baseline when he touched it and so its SMU Basketball underneath with 14 seconds on the shot clock and Doug to your point for Edwards you dont want to just turn into a passer you want to continue to be aggressive looking to score the ball and when you do that you just have to be able to make decisions see where the helps come from is it a kick is it a drop and hes B and capable of making those decisions now BJ Edwards began his college career at the University of Tennessee he is a Knoxville native didnt get a lot of minutes on the sweet 16 team in 2023 for Rick bars but he is a key contributor again this year for the Mustangs first two points for BJ Edwards its 18 to10 SMU Doug I I just really like the the makeup of this SMU team when you get into turny play you need to have great guard play and SMU has great guard play and they also have inside score with cement and now Tibet gorer also from Turkey into the game for the first time and Salis puts up a wedgie yeah ales just have to continue to be aggressive miss or make you just have to continue to look to get in the paint and you have if you have open opportunities on the perimeter you have to shoot Music them so Wake Forest under the direction of fifth year head coach Steve Forbes going to go into some full court pressure here or no check that on the alternate possession they keep possession after the wedgie and so Frederickson that again was the element Wake Forest expected from Frederickson coming off his freshman year now fredon just hitting those two threepointers now SMU has to change the defense up a little bit pay more attention to him which will open the court up a little bit more for drivers like Salis and Johnson jell Colbert number 20 in white on the screen in R gets the pass back but has it poked Away by Salis out of bounds to Wake Forest SMU with a from Reed and then on the other side SMU BJ Edwards hes going to have more ball handling duties more decisionmaking duties but offensively SMU will be all right its defensively where they have to lock in and really come together as a team yeah these two teams are fourth and fifth coming into the day in the ACC standings in the top four teams when we get to Charlotte for the ACC tournament will receive double buys third turnover committed by the Demon Deacons and you can see on the face of Steve Forbes this is a quad one game they have to get this to further build their resume for both teams I both teams are looking out trying to get into the NCAA tournament so a loss for one of these teams means Im looking and thinking more about the NIT than NCAA tournament gorer his first two coming off the bench for the Mustangs who rattled off thir 13 unanswered points earlier tonight to build the lead Wake Forest though got consecutive threepointers from Parker Frederickson Off the Bench to hang in there here goes Hunter Salis Juke Harris in the starting lineup tonight in place of Cameron hildr driving strong to the basket and the Freshman from Salsbury North Carolina has his first points of the night and Doug we we talked about other players stepping up having opportunities when injuries happen you dont like to see it but it creates opportunities for other guys talking about Juke Harris talking about uh tiet from uh from SMU stepping up and getting more chances to score the ball and going forward extended playing time Frederickson lost it and here comes the Pony Express again the accs leading scoring team at 83 points a night Edwards left alone and he missed it Applause for SMU they want to play with pace and they want to play with space cuz they have guys who can create opportunities with the ball guys who can drive and shoot they just have to in the half court move the ball from side to side and create those opportunities now Wake Forest trying to come back from its crushing loss to Florida State on Wednesday 7270 a game that for the first 35 minutes looked like the deakes couldnt lose and yet they found a way to lose and when we get to selection Sunday a month from tomorrow as Frederickson delivers his third triple of the game we may look back at that game on Wednesday and if the decks are on the wrong side of the cut line that loss to Florida State might have been the dagger that might that might have been the dagger up up 15 with 10 minutes left in the second half Florida States best player foued out with 8 minutes left they should have secured the win at home couldnt get it done matx cross cant answer at the other end for SMU and Wake Forest can tie or take the lead they trailed by as many as 10 early inside they go to Reed draws a crowd and oend is going to be called on the reach in P well you are a shooter in college Eric back at Syracuse you know what its like when all of a sudden the ball starts going in next Manan up mentality Frederick hasnt shoot been shooting the ball good at all this season but next game next shot thats what freden has to do hes a shooter and you see hes already have three threepointers in the first half here for Wake for well hes the alltime leading scorer in the history of Bixby High School in Oklahoma he put up over 2100 points as a high schooler you know he can fill it out he can score the basketball and sometimes shooting is more so mental right you you miss a couple shots now your confidence goes down he hits these three threes now his game is at a whole another level and more importantly SMU has adjust their defense Salis is foul and will shoot to yeah Frederickson came into the game making only 21 of his threes missed his first tonight but to his credit kept firing and hes made three in a row thats the first foul on gorer to send Salis to the free throw line the senior from Omaha Nebraska third leading scorer in the ACC misses the front end next Saturday here on acc Network its a mens basketball triple header beginning at two Eastern with Georgia Tech and BC followed by number 23 Clemson here in Dallas to take on SMU and finally itll be Virginia Tech in Miami at 6 Eastern from Coral Gables Salis gets one out of two wake now on a 60 run to make it a onepoint game Andy Doug is so important for Wake just to hit a couple jump shots theyre more so a driving and attacking team in half court but if you you make a couple jump shots now the defense loosens up a little bit those Lanes get a little bit bigger for those drives Eric youve been talking about opportunities gorer sets up Keon Ambrose Hilton one of the tri captains Off the Bench with some offense well all SMU forwards are versatile mobile theyre capable of putting it on on the ground they could they can shoot the ball a little bit next man up mentality team turkey combines to block that shot Tibet gorer from Istanbul just like his teammate The Freshman CET yigu pretty tall wall to go up against if youre Hunter Sal well if youre sales you know theres a 72 guy there in the middle but you just got to keep going eventually one of those blocks is going to turn into a foul opportunity so Salis keep attacking keep being aggressive Applause Music Applause good ball movement corer misses Omaha Belo the Iowa State transfer into the game off the bench for Wake Forest Mustangs will keep theres Omaha he was a fivestar recruit coming out of Dennis in Iowa walkal high school but he never was able to keep himself in the rotation last year for the Cyclones decided for a fresh start and has missed most of this season thanks to a right foot injury that he reinjured a couple of times well right now if Im SMU Im looking at that match up right now with cement and Im going right down to him giving him the ball letting him attack the rim and beloo hes another guy whos whos capable right hes a talented guy he 68 225 big body but just hasnt had a lot of time this year now Steve Forbes told us after shoot around today that beloo would be expected to play more minutes than the 24 total he has played in his two games back well we talked about the fact that Joey Applause Music Applause Music Music Applause Joe Eric dandorf Applause here Hey Joe Im Im I I do and Im still upset my sophore youre Syracuse we went 8 and two our last 10 games and we didnt get in so I I I just wanted to let you know that real quick but Joe my question is does a go Music ahead yeah so the comedian was wrong and you were right Joe 100 but does a loss for one of these teams tonight does a loss tonight for one of these teams mean nit especially with how the ACC has been this year out out Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause well Joe thank you so much for taking time out of your day in the bunker back in Bristol we look forward to your updates every time they hit our phone and we will be talking very much in the next month and a day till selection Applause Sunday we like that we like that thats Joey brackets joining us and again it is that time of year weve got two bubble teams and as Joe just said the winner of this one at the end of the night will be in the field of 68 Wake Forest got off to a slow start here tonight SMU rattled off a run early of 13 consecutive points but the Demon Deacons led by their allconference guard Hunter Salis have retaken the lead at 2625 dog I like what wakes doing on the defensive side of the ball switching to a little bit of Zone trying to slow this SMU offense down closing up the driving Lanes forcing him to shoot the ball with the hand up and then offensively Ws doing a good job of just attacking the basket if you attack the basket the defense has to collapse now your Shooters have to be ready to shoot the ball and you have to be able to knock down open shots juk Carris getting the start tonight in place of the injured cam hildr one of the better freshman in the ACC this year I was trying to make a case in my head where he might be able to sneak onto the all freshman team but its going to be Cooper flag at Duke Jeremiah Wilkinson at Cal Khan kipple from duke maybe come on malawat I would think yigu who we are watching tonight SMU would be on that team maybe Ian Jackson for North Carolina but that doesnt mean Juke Harris hasnt put together a really solid freshman year for the de really good really good freshman year I mean hes 67 he has a big body hes capable of scoring on all three levels and tonight hes super important for Wake Forest he just has to be aggressive dont be hesitant if you got an opportunity to go to the rim take it if you got an opportunity to shoot the ball in the perimeter you have to take that as well yeah he was a top 100 recruit for Steve Forbes and his staff arker Frederickson back on the floor for the deakes inside they go to Reed pass off the hand of Harris shot clock down to six Salis Rises up and puts up a brick just over 5 minutes to go in the half and shots like that for Wake for you dont want to settle you want to continue to be aggressive and you have to look at the matchups you have Matt cross guarding Juke Harris I think Juke Harris has the advantage right there Bon Reed is his first well Hunter Salis as uh igu is slow to get up he actually went down in Tuesdays game after rolling his ankle they say that is not a problem today oh yeah epon Reed hes known being physical down there and I mean theres two sevenfooters theyre both 250 and above its going be like two offensive lineman running into each other do is under its going to be a physical game so Bill Covington John Gaffney over at the monitor two of our officials to see if this will be a flagrant foul with that raised forearm or elbow from Fon Reed so if you know what and its questionable because it was a little bit higher than the chest if it was at the chest it would have been a non call but if it gets up by the throat in the chin area then you probably have to call it yeah it was just a little bit above the chest it was almost at the throat what do you think were going to get a flagrant I I think it will be a flagrant it the forarm was just a little bit too high there the two big men who will play such a key role tonight Fon Reed on the left 7 foot senior from Richmond Virginia who came to Winston Salem from gonzale a couple of years ago and sot yiga who was so good in the win over Pittsburgh on Tuesday 17 points 10 rebounds in front of a couple of NBA GMS who were in the building that night and he seems to be okay after taking that forearm up around the neck and now the officials confir well samza guy he has good hands he has Good Feet you give him the ball and the post hes capable of scoring the basketball but hes a freshman so Reed hes a senior hes looking at it were both big buys but he wants to set the tone and you just got to be careful right there and he is every bit of 72265 lbs his coach Andy Enfield said yeah his okay thank you his upside is getting to the NBA so whats the word its going to be a flager one two shots ball underneath kind of what we figured and so Reed the previous foul has been upgraded to a flagrant one foul 24 will shoot two shots the ball will be placed at the end line 20 seconds on the shot clock thank you good explanation from Bill Covington I do love that the NCAA has added that element that weve seen in the NBA the last couple of years allowing the officials not only to tell us and our television audience but the folks here in the building exactly what the decision was well Doug especially if he he standing straight up after was standing straight up then he kind of just went right to the chin area if he kind of got some Bend in his knees and then just went into his chest in the stomach area it have been totally different he totally just a 61 foul shooter he missed the start of the season and Coach Enfield said its taken him some time to get going but he is so high on the upside for his freshman from turkey and Doug I think hes going to continue to work on his body work on his agility work on his Mobility right now hes already ahead of the game as far as offensively what when he starts to work on his agility Rim running hes just going to be that much better and that much more appealing to NBA Scouts DJ Edwards playing the point tonight without boopy Miller Miller sitting out with a foot injury here goes Edwards high off the window for two and wake did a good job of having that extra defender in there on the help but SM Ed guards are just so good at being able to create on theel tough runner in the lane over the outstretch arms of of Reed BJ Edwards doing a great job finish at The Rim well the offense runs through Hunter Salis especially with Cam hildr out he has scored or assisted on 20 of wakes 27 points tonight here he sets up Frederickson off the pass fake the shot missed on the front Island Wake Forest cant get into too much pound in the basketball they have to move the basketball from side to side and try to create those opportunities with their ball movement which by and large Eric weve seen that on both ends tonight right absolutely both teams are doing a good job of moving the ball which for your offense creates opportunities to get to the rim or open jump Applause shots these two teams came into the weekend in fourth and fifth place just a half game apart in the ACC standings the Mustangs at 10 and three the Demon Deacons at 10 and four Fon re thats what I think wake has to do a little bit more go inside Fon Reed is more than capable of scoring the basketball he h that right hook over the left shoulder we know hes capable of shooting a threepointer but get the ball inside try to get that balance inside out and he and Salis really kind of came as a combo deal from Gonzaga couple of years ago Steve Forbes got a call from Reeds High School coach to reach out that while Forbes was out in Spokane recruiting Hunter Salis he wanted to tell him the big guy might be available too so he wound up getting both highly recruited players and they have been very good for the dees thats a blocking foul against Juke Harris as we and they live just a few miles from the campus and they make it to his many Mustangs basketball games as they can well its not every day that you get to meet a former president I I know a secret server there he was eyeing me when I when he came over and shook his hand so I was I was careful you know I shook his hand and then that was it I kept it kept it simple well hes a uh wellknown sports fan former owner of the Texas Rangers and so no surprise that he is a Mustangs fan and Applause supporter you know I asked Steve Forbes before the game if he had met any US presidents before and he said he actually had met George Ws father back when he was an assistant coach at Texas AM and apparently when Steve Forbes said his name to the former president he said did I beat you in a Republican primary Steve forbs of course different Steve Ford well you know what I could see coach Forbes running for president he talks enough he could he could run for office got to win more games though uh in Winston Salem for her him to win the election I think they have won a lot of games they just havent been able to get to the NCAA tournament and so uh but he was very happy to talk about his Rush with the former president well weve got two great womens games for you Thursday night here on acc Network at 6 Eastern 12th ranked UNC meets Syracuse and then at 8 Eastern Virginia Tech hosts Stanford it should be another big night of Hoops with Eric dorf Im Doug Sherman here at Moody Coliseum in Dallas first year ACC member AC uhu among the better teams in the conference and very much in the mix for a possible spot in the NCAA tournament right along with wake fores yeah Doug I think what what coach forb is so good at is his mindset his mentality hes a tough hardnosed coach and his team really takes on his identity theyre hardnosed theyre gritty and they battle to the end Spillers with the rebound well SMU has cooled off Eric after making three of the first five from distance theyve made only one since well that zone is really affecting them its closing up the driving Lanes its shrinking the court a little bit and its forcing him to settle for jump shots theres that battle of the bigs inside Reed and yigu this time it goes against the Freshman from SMU bading his case to no avail Im sure and Doug I like that its a little old Big East field real centers giving it down let him pound it a little bit when you see the helpc come kick out hit the the cutter but thats what you want to see from your two sevenfooters two big guys physical going at each other attacking the rim being aggressive dont always settle for that outside jump shot try to attack the rim and then get opportunities to free throw line and get your teammates open Reed has his free throw rattle out heres BJ Edwards the Junior from Knoxville Tennessee playing the point tonight in place of the injured boopy Miller Kio Oquendo good helps side defense Reed swats it out of bounds SMU will keep with 14 to shoot wakes just has been doing a great job this first half but just flying around being aggressive you see Reed right there with the block defensively wakes been locked in switching from Zone to man but Mo most importantly theyve just been active and theyve been flying around and I like that Fon Reed made sure to check on our camera operator who took the uh ball off the front of the camera on that Applause play SMU with a fresh 20 on the shot clock Harris splits the double team down the lane it opens wide up but he cant make the level BJ Edwards though can well thats one thing wake cant do they cant give SMU Second Chance opportunities their guards are too good theyre not going to get second and third chance opportunities and not convert Salis has it poked out of bounds wake will keep it Jerel culbert the Junior from Houston trying to convince the officials he wasnt the last to touch it but itll be wake ball on the side with 18 on the timer and I think coach fors game plan was to try to keep SMU in the half court dont let him get out and play Fast how they want to play make him really work in that half court setting Wake Forest has done a great job this first half of making them make plays in the half courter Tyler Johnson good shot fate got the second defender in the air and draws the foul on Colbert its been a quiet start to the Ball Game for Tyler Johnson the Louisville Transfer sophomore out of Brooklyn who Steve forb brought in to be his point guard this year and so hell head to the line and again cam hildr only a cheerleader tonight one of the captains for Wake out with a foot injury its his right foot that he just didnt want to put a lot of weight on during shoot around this afternoon and to his credit hes tough guy came out and tried to go in the pregame warmups and he did a lot of shooting on his own but you could clearly see he was favoring it throughout yeah hes H and not only one of the toughest guys in the ACC but one of the toughest guys in the country and with hild out Johnson hes a talented guard he has to be able to make good decisions take care of the ball but hes capable of getting in the lane creating opportunities for himself and his teammates Johnson a Brooklyn native who played his high school ball at St Benedicts prep in New Jersey Harris Miss Fires for the Mustangs cross ties up Salis and its a held Applause ball I just like the physicality I I I mean I like guys getting after it it lets me know that youre competing at a high level in both of these teams players compete at a high level right here Sal just going up and grabbing it with two hands and cross doing a good job of just getting in there causing the jump ball Salis with 12 points seven rebounds four assists to lead the way for weight Chuck Harris 11 points for SMU Colbert tries to tip it in and a foul on the rebound yeah Eric the Mustangs have missed 12 of their last 13 threepoint shots this for the best shooting team in the ACC well again Wake Forest is doing a good job of taking them out of their Rhythm offensively theyre not able to get out and play at that fast pace so those shots arent in Rhythm anymore theyre off of slow isolation plays and Wake Forest you got to give them credit defensively theyve been locked in this half second foul on Tyler Johnson he stays on the floor for now for Steve Forbes toet gorner returns for SMU o quendo takes a seat and two Doug SMU they they Thrive off the pace like playing fast theyre exciting theyre getting transition d alyuk when theyre in half courter and at a slower Pace its almost like theyre falling asleep and its not as exciting to them timeout SMU Andy Enfield wants to talk it over on this te possession late here in the first half Music Music the accs committee for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 13th through the 23rd as ACC Unity week we welcome you back to Moody Coliseum here in Dallas Texas home of the SMU Mustangs good crowd here for this key ball game not only in the race in the ACC standings they start the day fourth and fifth in the 18 team field but also both these teams in the first four out Joe lonardi told us live earlier in the half when he joined us that the winner of this game will move in to the field of 68 by the end of the night and so where is SMU you going to go for this key possession late in the first half Eric you got to get some ball movement you see wake is back in the zone you got to get somebody in that high post they try to get him behind the defense but you dont want to settle for a jump shot right here you want to get in the paint and get an opportunity right there haris off the feed from Endo Colbert skies for the offensive rebound plenty of time for SMU with a shot clock off endos not going to wait he was open and why not let a rip Big Shot going into half for SMU Applause Johnson shot beats the buzzer but misses the iron Al together strong finish out of that timeout for the Mustangs who take a twopoint lead into the locker room now and on the perimeter neither team shot it particularly well in that first half both under 40 SMU came out flying knocking down its threepoint shots but then cooled off used a 13 nothing run to open up a 10point lead wakes biggest lead was at 3 nothing early on Tyler Johnson does a nice job to work his way inside find Trayvon Spillers and thats what Johnsons capable of hes capable of Getting By His man getting in the lane and then creating for one of his teammates playing in half court favors wake Force SMU has to figure out a way to try to create some turnovers and get out and play Fast first two points of the night from Spillers ties the ball game at 34 a piece off the Endo miss here come the deeps same game starting units in the second half as we saw in the first Endo starting for SMU Juke Harris in the starting five for wake in they go to Spillers which seems to be a concerted effort to start this second half and cross is called for the foul well you see the pace that theyre playing with they dont mind walking the ball up executing in the half court great job getting the ball inside Great Seal by Spiller just getting a low inside presence and then just going up strong the rim creating an opportunity for himself at the foul line and so Spillers who is an all Sun Belt Conference first team for former a year ago for R State when he averaged 139 rebounds per game makes the first he has been a nice addition for Coach Forbes averaging about 10 and eight this year one of the better rebounders in the ACC well I just love what he brings too besides scoring and rebounding hes like a Swiss army knife he does a little bit everything on the court he brings hustle he brings energy and effort hes a guy that every team would want to have on their on their team and I love stories like Trayvon Spillers he began played his freshman year at South Carolina Suka hatchee then he was a junior college first team AllAmerican at Mobberly Community College before getting his first division one opportunity at appalachin State and now he is a really good performer in the ACC I love the Improvement love the climb I think guys like that they dont take take anything for granted they were they were born in the grind right s to speak the basketball grind so everything that hes getting now at Wake Forest hes just taking it in and running with it from Charleston South Carolina bad pass from Edwards perhaps thinking cross was going to ease his way into the corner and the Mustangs turn it back over to the deeps I think hes a perfect matchup for Matt cross Matt cross is a good inside out player but Spillers is a great athlete hes mobile hes hes agile and hes a ble to stick with cross cross has had a quiet night so far Salis inside to Reed immediate double team from the perimeter swing it around to the corner Juke Harris Off the Mark Chuck Harris for SMU gives to endo and with a full head of steam he can get to the rack as well as anybody and these are the opportunities that SMU has to be able to create long rebound theyre getting out playing fast almost a semi transition opportunity Endo great job of just attacking off that first pass getting to the rim tied again at 36 weve got a foul at the other end long rebounds getting out in transition getting easy early opportunities great job by SMU attacking the basket well every time Eric O quendo has an opening to the basket in transition I hold my breath cuz I think hes going to dunk on somebody well hes like a freight train dog hes 225 lbs so if hes coming downhill at you youre either going to get out the way or take a charge and be filling it the next four days well he has been on Sports Centers top 10 eight times during his college career and his favorite was dunking on one of the Tennessee Volunteers during his days at Georgia but he just laid that one in now whats this discussion about with the officials maybe a late sub by the way yigu was called for his third personal foul so thats quite a development to keep our eyes on here Eric well just make SMU a little bit more onedimensional excuse me onedimensional they cant go inside to him if hes out of the game and then it just turns him into a more perimeter oriented team so theyve changed the foul on Chuck Harris so that is good for SMU that it is not on yigao so he still has two and Chuck Harris the senior from Ashburn Virginia he spent three years at Butler he is called for the personal and that sends Tyler John into the line and look Doug if SMU is not going to get out and play fast like they did on that last possession they have to be able to try to find a way to get cement the ball on the pulse down low you saw early on in the first half when he went for the double made a great decision passing it to the cutter hes capable of passing and hes capable of scoring down there getting to the NCAA tournament for both of these teams would be huge these are not programs that have gone a lot relatively speaking in their history Ms only been 12 times most recently in 2017 as we get a double dribble and for Wake Forest theyve gone 23 times but just once since 2010 thats now 8 years ago well both teams will wake force great history SMU great history both put guys into the NBA so being able to get over that hump and get into the NCAA tournament would just be a huge thing for both of these programs SMU 19 and5 on the year weake for 18 and seven coming into the day Salis kicks it back out to Johnson time on the shot clock down to foul Johnson like a blur Banks it in off the window tyar Johnson we talked about his ability to get by and get to the rim but how about on that previous possession defensively talking about the boopy Miller effect not being in the game good job ball pressure BJ Edwards callusing the turnover on that previous possession boopy is out with a left foot bruise they are hoping hes out for just about a week its a a precautionary move Doug I think Johnsons a guy that waight Forest just needs to step up make good decisions take more pressure off of Salis and then when hris comes back take more pressures off of him having to make all the decisions salz with a beautiful feed senior to freshman for the dunk by Juke Harris largest lead of the ball game for Wake Forest up six defensively great job making decisions on the offensive side of the ball and then being aggressive towards the basket so after giving up six unanswered points how does SMU respond they go inside to yigu lets the second Defender go by miss the first layup kicks the second and hell have a chance for three its what SMU has to do they have to be able to get the ball inside create that inside out great job finding him on the cut C just going in the rim continue to work playing hard finishing opportunity for the an1 SMU has to continue to feed him create opportunities for him at the rim and then when they come with the double you create opportunities for the shots and drives to the basket from the guards foul number two on Spillers who gets the defensive rebound wake has scored on five of with six possessions to start the half here is Salis from the side SMU down by four with the Applause basketball on the switch Tyler Johnson giving up a lot of size and is going to be called for the foul trying to check the 6 7 in 230lb Matt cross yeah just got caught in a mismatch right there but now you see Parker fredon coming back in SMU you has to be aware of freden on the court which helps out guys like Salis and Juke Harris trying to attack the rim Johnson takes a seat with his three personal foul Salis has done a really good job so far tonight five assists along with his scoring and rebounding he has one off his season high and assist two off his career high Chuck Harris through the legs behind the back Parker Frederickson trying to stay with him soaring for the rebound is J Harris who dribble it up Wake Forest just doing a great job of being active helping and then getting back to their Defender SMU is getting into situations where theyre having a lot of iso play right now Salis at the Applause point whistling a foul off the ball this time the rols were reversed cross was the smaller man and he called for the fou when youre paint my face orange and blue got to do it if you do you have to do it at least once or twice I never did it I was out on the court playing but I saw a lot of people who Applause did Wake Forest has been a little better in the second half on this end Take the fourpoint Lead Fon Reed takes his time into the lane soft shot that just didnt fall Harris there to clean it up Doug what Harris is doing a great job is just being active on both ends of the floor hes doing a good good job cutting offensively being on the offensive board and just being available when the ball is Applause there Chuck Harris turning the corner hangs in the air taks it home wow President Bush no doubt impressed Salis left alone and he buries the three tough finish by Chuck Harris on one end but you have to be able to get back didnt get back and even the Miss Right There by Juke Harris it created an opportunity for sales to get that threepoint shot off offensive rebound knocking it down after the Sal make Chuck Harris has his three Rim out Salis leads all scores with 15 Chuck Harris for SMU has 13 6 minutes gone in the second half Spillers finds a gap in the lane and puts it up in you see SMU went to a little zone right there that middle was wide open where do you want to attack the zone free throw line area short Corner area I know a little bit about the Zone though yes you do Frederickson with the steal and he lays it in the lead grows to 11 thanks to seven unanswered points by the Demon Deacons what a lift off the cour your teammates feed off of that energy and you see top 15 in the country in in a opponent field goal percentage under 40 second best in the ACC we are seeing that effort right now by the Demon Deacons making it tough on SMU with under 10 on the shot clock blocking foul oh just the fourth team foul so a nonsh shooting foul I tell you what great job I thought it was a charge but defensively wake fors This Is How They want SMU to playing half court theyre scrambling theyre taking tough shots and yes they have guys who can make those tough shots but you cant sustain a basketball game making those tough shots every single possession you have to get some easy opportunities and wakes doing a good job of just making it tough every single possession good to see cross get right back up remember hes been dealing with a back injury suffered on the very first game of the season there the defense caught napping just into the game AJ George with the easy layup up for SMU and those are the type of plays you just want to get to get yourself go back into the game get going a little bit more Salis using the screen from Reed behind the back driving on Edwards into traffic no long rebound comes to SMU Mustangs with numbers Harris kicks it back out to George four quick points off the bench for the SMU reserve and dug why that last possession was a bad shot for w for because a tough shot like that gives SMU an opportunity to get out and play fast like you saw Wake Forest has to be able to execute and get cleaner looks Harris attacks tough shot Frost stood his ground and weve got a foul thatll go the other way a big stop for the SMU defense now you see the SMU crowd the energy is back into it a little bit more I think offensively when SMU is stagnant they come back on the other end and dont have as much activity defensively they cant let what happens offensively affect what theyre doing on the defensive side of the ball they have to continue to fly around and be active Eric thats the second foul on Fon Reed Applause cross sets the screen Edwards guarded by Harris great patience to get to the left hand and this is what makes these guards for SMU so good W Forest is doing a great job playing deep keeping bodies in front but great footwork by Edwards keeping the Play Alive reversing and then finishing with the left hand and they looking him active right here energy on offense bringing it to the defensive side of the ball Frederickson going to be called for the foul and George will head to the line its a 60 run by SMU to get right back in it so youve got so much riding on the outcome of this game not just for the ACC tournament but as Joel lardi said both of these teams are among his first four out and the winner of this game he says goes back into the field of 68 well those first three Louisville Clemson and Duke if something unless something drastic happens they pretty much locked in for the NCAA tournament these other teams are still trying to play to get into the NCAA tournament yes they want to get the double Buy in the ACC tournament but theyre thinking bigger they have to win games to stay alive to be in the NCAA tournament AJ George Inon offense six of the eight points scored in this 8 nothing SMU run Frederickson steps back for three and he gets the roll well how about George and frerick say two guys stepping up taking advantage of the opportunity thats given to him these areio guys get extended minutes going forward into the season cross from way downtown Frederickson active on the defensive end again for the long rebound well fredericksons careerhigh in scoring was 19 last season against NJIT hes got 14 Off the Bench getting extended minutes tonight in place of Cam hildr Salis flying with three fouls somebodys going to have to put up a shot here in the final 3 seconds before the timer its Juke Harris now nice job by Salis to grab another rebound his eight of the night Parker Frederickson just stepping up and taking advantage of that opportunity a guy who hasnt been shooting the ball well all year makes a good move move to create separation and then gets the shooters rooll great to see a guy like him come out of a slump and just take advantage of opportunity that coach fors has given him and so now Hunter Salis at the line whose mom Jessica Haynes Jackson was a Nebraska High School Basketball Hall of Famer who then played at San Diego State and she also played in the WNBA with the Utah stars and Hunters mom who stands 6 feet tall she was among the women who could dunk and so that is one of the big influences for cam hildr First Team all AC Applause player its in the blood dog its in the Music bloodline Salis will get a blow playing with those three fouls Spillers back out there for weight Tyler Johnson also back back on the Applause Music floor foul by the way was on yigu for SMU his third hes out of the game Colbert has returned Edwards good close out by Johnson and juk Harris has it for Wake Forest these are the shots that you can get at any single time but SMU if theyre going to pound the basketball like that they have to continue to move off the ball to try to create clear and more clean opportunities at The Rim bad pass from Spillers right into the hands of the Mustangs Edwards and a foul called against Frederickson it looks like Parker not so sure and indeed it is on Parker Frederickson who tells me his favorite sport is golf hes from a golfing family hes pretty good but apparently hes got a younger brother whos even better Doug Im terrible at golf Im terrible golf I want to I want to learn how to play and be better then I could make you know fake business calls on the golf course and well his younger brother is in junior college probably going to be a division one golfer before too long and Parker says hes become spoiled as a student athlete at Wake Forest he plays only at Oldtown which is the Wake Forest course and it is beautiful of course when you talk about Wake Forest golf you have to mention Arnold Palmer he was one one of the great again in Syracuse I dont know what thats like I live right down the street from a golf course and theres 2T of snow right now so I dont I dont see anybody playing golf right now in Upstate New York just dont use a white ball get an orange ball and you can find it right Applause exactly 5650 Wake Forest with a basketball and a sixpoint lead Salis back into the game working the Baseline now coming out to get the pass on the left wing Reed hits the floor and hes holding his right ankle he lost his shoe in the exchange AJ George called for his first and that is the fifth on the Mustangs Wake Forest with seven fouls here 10 and A2 minutes into the Music second yeah you see right there it just the left foot he just kind of stepped awkwardly on it and I guess it was the right shoe that came off it looks like hes all right well AJ George is Eric taking advantage of the opportunity to play again bopy Miller is out for SMU so Andy Enfield using some guys for extended minutes and George has been good offense with six points here in the last 5 minutes you know he was a a key player for an NCA tournament team last year for Long Beach State he averaged over 10 per game so thats just another weapon that they got out of the portal who as we go into the final three weeks of the regular season he may wind up playing a key role and again you dont want to have guys be injured especially your top players but what it does do is create opportunities for these guys who would probably not play and show what theyre capable of doing five to shoot Salis pounded by George able to get the shot on the rim and Spillers pulls it back out to the perimeter Wake Forest has to find a way to get easier shots at The Rim Frederickson will head to the line the folks here at Moody not so sure either Oquendo or Colbert called for the foul its funny what confidence does for a basketball player last game Parker frederson would have been pass in that basketball now he hits a few shots now his confidence is up now hes driving the basketball driving drawing the foul opportunity to make two they got Endo for his Applause second and Doug I mean confidence is something else in the game of basketball or any sport two games ago or even a game ago Parker freden he would have pump fake and pass that ball ball away he hit a few shots he got going his confidence up a little bit now hes looking to attack the rim and get to the basket thats not even what he does but hes just making something happen being aggressive with the basketball in his hands young man who originally committed to Mike Bray at Notre Dame before he was let go by the Fighting Irish and then signed with Wake Forest gets one out of two the Wake lead is seven wake back into a little bit of Zone Action see this is what wake wants SMU to play stagnant a little bit slower closing up the driving Lanes not giving them clean looks SMU averages 83 points per game well off that pace right now as again Wake Forest has had the tempo it has wanted most of the night right Eric well this this tempo of the whole game is favoring Wake Forest but if Wake Forest is to go in zone you have to put a guy at the freezer line could score the basketball and they put the guy who could do it Matt cross but he has to turn and face the rim and look to be aggressive you cant just catch the ball and pass it back out turn and be a threat look to make a play Edwards misses the front end ball goes out of bounds whos got it oh SMU after the third foul on Spillers SMU couldnt cash in at the line but they keep possession of the basketball and for these last 8 minutes and 33 seconds SMU is going to have have to junk it up a little bit theyre going to have to get get on the floor get those loose balls get offensive rebounds put backs right now wake for us is doing a good job but just making every single shot tough for this SMU team cross defended by Spillers Endo with an airball Here Comes Tyler Johnson one of the fastest with the dribble in the ACC good job SMU to get back in transition and and SMU did a good job of getting back but wake for us is okay with playing in this half cour set oo Sal trying to dunk on o quendo whos called for the blocking foul Salis at the sports center number one top dunk on Wednesday a twisting Slam against Florida State he was thinking Applause about again and if youre going to attack the rim dog and attempt to dunk on somebody do it like that being aggressive even if you miss it the refs more likely are not are just going to give you that file call just for how aggressive you went did you ever make Sports Center top 10 not dunking the basketball but laying it up really really nice well the Shriners childrens Clear Water Invitational continues Sunday morning as fourth ranked UCLA meets Virginia at 1000 am eastern right here on acc Network Applause SMU down eight just over 8 minutes to go in the second half see SM or excuse me Wake Forest extending that two3 zone out a little bit theres gaps in the zone you just got to be able to get into those areas cross from the short corner back out to Endo Edwards o quendo up no Music good hustle to track down the offensive rebound and extend the possession Edwards no fight for it Frederickson able to get it for wake and here comes Salis to Johnson he finds the trailing Reed who is fouled and Fon Reed down on the floor one more time Applause Music so now Fon Reed who was named for his maternal grandfather Fon very close to his mom Maria back in Richmond Steve forbs was very smart to recruit mom when he was convincing young Fon to transfer from Gonzaga if you get Mom youre have to get the kid exactly if you get Mom youre all good so you see the four fouls now on yigu after the flagrant one and possession stays with wake for underneath 23 seconds are up on the shot Music clock Doug you got to give credit to Reed I think hes been doing a great job on cement just being physical and really taking him out of this ball game after a double double in Tuesdays win over Pittsburgh igu is at a very quiet night cross tied up with Salis Hunter Salis 18 points eight rebounds a season High six assist has been all over the floor on both ends Eric and hes really stepped up just being aggressive hes not shooting the ball particularly well but hes been to the free throw line 12 times and hes going after every single rebound just being aggressive youre going to create opportunities just by being aggressive to the ball Hunter Salis has been all over tonight and with that Eric he has weight out scoring SMU in the second half 2816 at halftime held a slim twopoint lead cross trying to hook up inside with Colbert and they cant connect and honestly Doug this Zone just has SMU confused youre not going to post a guy up in the mid post right there when you got a guy in the middle you have to get a guy in the free throw line try to get some high low action then when the defense comes in kick out to your Shooters either have an open shot or play off the scramble what do a Syracuse guy know about the Zone I know a little bit I I I know the two areas in the zone where its most effective Carter fredson playing perhaps his best game of the season largely in place of the injured cam hildr heres Tyler Johnson to the high post finds Spillers extra pass to the corner Frederickson off the bounce give him three more how about Parker Frederickson in Wake Forest shows you how to play against his own Cuts in the high post got the defense to suck in kicked out to the corner Frederickson one of the best Shooters on the floor knocking it down hes having unbelievable night 18 points one off his career high including his fourth made triple of the night was a great job initially by Spiller kicking it out to Frederickson pump fake side dribble knocking it down again confidence is something else when youre feeling good youre youre doing stuff that you normally wouldnt be doing on the basketball court Frederickson obviously a shooter but we saw him doing more things defensively attacking the rim great job stepping up tonight by Parker Frederickson and a short Change to him hes got five made threes for those 18 points BJ Edwards makes the front end wake has seven wins this year Eric when trailing at halftime this would be the eighth coming back from only two down but theyve been a better second half team coach Forbes Club trying to bounce back from that awful loss on Wednesday to Florida State to move ahead of SMU into fourth place in the ACC well we talked about what type of Coach coach Forbes is hes aggressive hes hes tough hes hard nosed and thats how Wake Forest is playing theyre aggressive to every single ball theyre getting on the floor theyre gritty and now this is what SMU is going to have to do if they want to get back in the game pressure the ball full court and try to create some turnovers Harris knocks it away from Salis and thats a 10sec violation terrific pressure from the Mustangs this is how SMU has to be able to get in the B back in the game 6 minutes left they have to try to create turnovers get out and play fast now if theyre in half court against a set defense in the zone they have to figure out how to put somebody in that high post and create offense in that high post area and you know this is about the point in the game against Florida State on Wednesday when things went sideways for Wake Forest they had control of that game and it just fell apart and I know Court coach for is telling his team that Music Edwards cross Endo Paris around the perimeter for SMU Colbert inside shot clock down to three Endo tough shot and the whistle comes if it was on the initial shot the whistle came late weve got a twoot foul coming from John Gaffney back up its going to be on Hunter Salis his fourth oh really SMU didnt have anything Wake Forest was switching everything from the guard position but Endo just using his strength getting through the contact creating the foul an opportunity at the Applause line big Miss for the senior from Titusville Florida but again Doug this whole game SMU really hasnt had any clean opportunities at The Rim everything has been tough at The Rim on the perimeter wake Force has just been flying around being active defensively and theyve gotten next to nothing out of CET yiga who is so good in Tuesdays win over Pittsburgh hes only got three points not on the floor Applause now inside Spiller had position and he lays it in Trayvon Spiller now with eight points as yigu watches from the Mustangs bench and now with yigu out of the game one less offensive threat for Wake Forest to go against Edwards missfire Spillers tracks down the rebound and you got to know theres going to be games where youre just not hitting shots so when a guy like yigo isnt in the game you have no inside presence youre not hitting jump shots youre not creating turnovers every shot is going to be tough on the offensive side SMU has won five in a row and eight of its last nine but up against it here tonight big threepoint opportunity for tyar Johnson well theres two guys that are really standing out today for Wake Forest and one of those guys is Tyler Johnson hes been doing a great job taking care of the ball making good decisions getting into the pain and just creating opportunities for himself and his teammates Parker Frederickson and Tyler Johnson have really St up and took took advantage of these opportunities with Cam hild just being out of the ball Music game heres Tyler Johnson the 6foot sophomore from Brooklyn New York that was second foul on Edwards as Johnson has given a nice lift and again trying to fill some of the Void for Steve Forbes without hildr well last game against Florida State he kind of had that head scratching shot at the end of the game where he took a deep three with 11 seconds left on the shot for him to come in and play like this against a great SMU and SMU team it just shows what the type of player he is what type of character he has and how about that drought you just saw on the bottom half of your screen going on nearly 8 minutes without a bucket for SMU and seemingly in the blink of an eye its a 15point Demon Deacons lead Johnson starting to feel it Tyler Johnson makes it 70 53 Wake Applause Forest Johnson hes got nine points in the second half nine of his 12 as they have extended this lead weight trailed early by as many as 10 as the Mustangs came out on fire but their offense has ever since been ground to a halt foul on the entry pass from Harris to yigu thats the third on Fon Reed and so the big man 72 265 lb who has been authoritative decisive not so much today but hes been putting together a really good freshman season here in Applause Dallas tonight after we wrap things up here in Dallas the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the AC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for next week and no surprise Duke added another win today blowing out Stanford 10670 and I saw some of the analytics that earlier today ESPN says Duke is the oddson favorite to win the national title in spite of the fact that Auburn is still the consensus number one team after beating Alabama today how about John shy and the job hes done since getting that Duke job I mean hes recruiting all the right players in an era where everyone is kind of like me me me hes got guys who just want to go in and win games he has a generational Talent he has Shooters but most importantly theyre probably top two defensive team in the country yeah Tyler Johnson to the corner Spiller is open well short gets his own Miss and Salis will pull it out yeah John sh told me earlier this year that the three guys they brought in in the transfer portal who fit perfectly quote theyre all over themselves theyve gotten over themselves they just want to win they want to be part of something special there in Durham and I think now when youre recruiting the transfer portal its so important to recruit High character guys guys who want to come in and add value to the team not a guy who wants to come in and hey how can I up my nil it its hard to do that and John shy has done a great job of putting the team together shot clock violation on the air ball by Reed gives it back to SMU you see the drought now pushing 9 minutes for the accs top scoring team finally Matt cross gets the Mustangs back on the board under three minutes to go but even with that make look how far that shot was I mean its these are all hard shots that smus taken in teams playing SMU going forward theyre going to look at this film theyre going to see how wake for is played in the zone and SMU is going to have to figure out a way how to attack the Zone get the guy in the high post have a short corner and then be able to have Shooters around the the perimeter o quendo off the Salis Miss takes a hard foul from Spillers before the shot couple of grown men matching up there at high Music speed yeah seeing quendo in person he is a thats a big boy right there its a linebacker right now at the free throw line and the way he moves the way he can get to the basket change direction and shoot the basketball hes a heck of a player for SMU but Wake Forest has just done a great job of making it hard every single possession for this SMU Applause team Endo will be replaced if he makes the free throws AJ George awaits at the scores Applause table and Doug I dont want to say the games over theres still 230 left SMU only down 12 but they have to do something quickly cause turnovers get some opportunities and transition and then try to be able to make some threepointers and the de certainly in no hurry Tyler Johnson takes a look at the Applause Music clock Frederickson back to Reed and now the Demon Deacons have to go re the turnar around doesnt get the roll its a key stop for SMU with 2 minutes on the clock and they have to be decisive right now o quendo decisive with the three ball SMU back to within nine would put whichever team comes away Victorious into the field to 68 the other with even more work to do both sides will have work to do but this a big one and theres still a lot of season left so anything can really happen but each game going forward for both of these teams means a lot here goes Johnson dump it off Spillers and the foul is Music called such a difference in Tyler Johnson and how hes playing today hes getting in the pain hes playing off of two feet hes in control and hes making the right decision a kickball not a foul correct on that Reed got the layup off the nice feed from Spillers that snaps an8 nothing Mustangs run how about Fon Reed just hes always been like The X Factor today for Wake Forest hasnt scored a lot but done a great job defensively on cement and just his presence on the court has really helped this wake Force to Spillers has just filed out as we take a look at Reed doing it again inside there was a great High Low by Spiller good job of getting into the pain and then just making the easy dump to read who finish at The Rim so Spillers is out Salis and Johnson for Wake still flying with their four fouls eigs got four fouls for SMU and so the Freshman who got the start tonight comes back on to the floor Juke Harris starting in place of the injured cam hildr who had been playing so well for Wake we hope hes able to make it back sooner than later last four games Hildreth had gone for 20 or more points and theyre going to need him down the stretch well Doug when a guy like hildr is out of the game you need guys to come together collectively and really help you out whether its six points here eight points there and even look at a guy like JW Parris hes come in give you seven points five rebounds then you add in what Tyler Johnsons doing in Parker Frederickson youre really making up for that absence uh of Hil foul given against Reed in the back court Applause not sure what he said to us well I didnt even know he came over but hes having fun I look up and theres a 7 foot man with his mouthpiece in his hand saying something to us and Im not sure what he was saying oh you love to see guys smiling and having fun basketball is a fun game its a competitive game and yes its youre going to have emotions high but man we all grew up playing this game that we love and these guys are lucky to be on this stage at this level playing the game of basketball well we knew coming in it would be a battle of wills the SMU offense against the Wake Forest defense and wakes defense at this point has been better you know number one in the AC in threepoint percentage Defense number three in the ACC in Block shots and they have made it tough on SMU all night long well and offensively they havent been great but theyve been aggressive theyve been attacking the rim theyve been get to the freee throw line theyve been getting Second Chance opportunities and then defensively the the activity and the energy has been there throughout the whole game o quendo from the corner cross has it saves it out to Applause Harris Edwards tries down goes Hunter salz as he tripped over cross who was on the floor good to see Salis right back up Music we just see Salis the whole game hes just been aggressive hes 65 but hes going in there like hes 7 foot offensive rebound defensive rebound it doesnt matter hes just been super aggressive and again he hasnt been really efficient shooting the ball but hes just giv himself an opportunity going to the free throw line 14 attempts tonight a young man who joined the 100 point Club against Western Carolina way back back in November came into this game third in the ACC in scoring he has surpassed his season average now with Music 19 and as you said Eric in spite of the fact that hes not shot it well from the floor when youre not shooting the ball well what do you do you put your head down and get downhill and try to get opportunities at The Rim from the logo standing on the S in SMU cross with another deep three really Big Forest has toen Matt cross out of this game for the most Applause part Juke with the flush and that will be the exclamation point Edwards tries to get it back to cross and at this point just academic into the back court its an over and back violation and the ball goes back to the Demon Deacons what a win for Coach Forbes and Wake Forest really without their best player I mean we obviously Hunter Salis but what cam hilds does on the floor you cant replace that the hustle the heart the energy improved offensively what a way for these other guys to step up and show that theyre capable of bringing value to the team for the 13th time this year Hunter Salis has reached the 20point plateau that that along with nine rebounds and six assists helps lead Wake Forest to a huge Road Victory here tonight Wake Forest just aggressive activity and
