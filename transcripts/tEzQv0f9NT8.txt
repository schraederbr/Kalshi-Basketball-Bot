call we do completely unbiased by the way absolutely at least Im not wearing an orange tie today absolutely Fon Reed wins the tap for the decks and the ball is into the hands of the first time starter this year at the point Tyler Johnson and what do you make of the switch to have him in the starting five for Coach fors I think its obvious with the decks needed another guy that can create offense like smiller there with the Baseline Drive but Tyler Johnson comes in his speed makes a difference if he can just cut down on the turnovers he can be a huge addition and the smart to this wake for his offense and so after the Trayvon Spillers dunk to get things started same starting five for the orange that weve seen in recent days including the two freshman along with Donnie Freeman Elijah Moore looking to bounce back after a rough outing in the win over Buck now as is always the custom here at the Dome the fans stand and applaud until the home team scores a bucket Chris Bell with the steel and a kickball itll be Syracuse possession on the sideline and that right there is what Tyler Johnson has to cut down on its the turnovers and hes inserted to the lineup if he can control the turnovers and cut down on those turnovers and just get the deakes in the offense Let The Game come to him well hes got two of the best wings in the conference we showed you Hunter Salis the captain Cameron hildr averaging 12 A2 points per game both are equally dangerous theres the double team on Eddie Lin he finds Freeman whos got a real good midrange game but misses his first shot attemp Eddie Lin is an excellent passer youd like for him to turn and face the double team so he can see it coming I think the deeps will time in that cut here soon hild Banks it home that is a senior going against a freshman going to work on his first Applause attempt and as we saw in shoot around this morning for Wake Forest the plan is every time the ball goes into lampin theyre going to double it on the post heres more from the corner no lamin on the offensive rebound again so he gets two points and a rebound out of that possession and the orange are on the board they want to double the post for multiple reasons but the one thing is keep Fon Reed out of foul trouble hes just proven to be invaluable second dunk of the afternoon already for Trayvon Spillers terrific pass from midcourt out of Tyler Johnson sper so active with his motor create so many opportunities with the offensive rebounding and running the floor traveling violation called against Eddy lamin Jr I must say Trayvon Spillers has warmed up since this morning he was dressed leaving the hotel to come up to the dome for shoot around about 830 this morning as though it was 30° below zero hey he told you hes from South Carolina man he was not happy hes trying to dunk on everybody Fon Reed cleans it up and a quick start for the decks on top 8 to2 DS doing a great job when they break the pressure from the orange theyre attacking to score thats what you want to do to get him out of it youre getting no free press press rotate we got to attack the Bass from the other end great job by the de so far Syracuse has to get Chris Bell going shooting only 22 on the year thats 20 percentage points down from a year ago on threepoint shots I think some of that would jquan Carlos needs to be really aggressive for rotation to get guys shots shes playing on the perimeter too much for this team right now needs to get downhill get in the lane three opportunities for himself and for his teammates Hunter Salis becomes the fourth weight player in the scoring column already Freeman little strong thats his comfort zone there in that midrange right now hes missed two shots he normally makes and we have to keep letting those go here goes Johnson the Louisville Transfer he draws the foul and will head to the line to try and complete a threepoint play personal against jquan Carlos great job here just driving it getting the angle taking a contact kissing it off the glass this is what you want when you insert a Tyler Johnson in the lineup his speed matters and its significant in the game and again making an impact rewarding coach Forbes with the early start here so now all five wake starters have scored Johnson with three and its quickly an 11point lead Dis doing a great job in half cour for some turnovers this is the second best field goal percentage defense in the ACC only behind Duke Johnson wide open for three and hes got it 162 timeout Applause orange the digs off to a fast start here Up Up and Away here by Spillers with the and one dicks with a run out early 162 run now hell Applause he Applause Music Applause back at the Dome its been all deakes early Randall they have theyre just controlling the paint theyre attacking the rim you cant get much easier than that heres here just getting the angle kissing it off the glass theyre just driving the ball throwing lops so far just getting wherever they want off the dribble and then Tyler Johnson had a really fast start knocking down his first three ball attempt rewarding coach Forbes with the starting tonight and this afternoon rather and this team has just come out the orange has come out flat theyre not defending and right now the defense of the deak is just taking control of this game early and that has happened repeatedly this year for red As team slow starts to halves and we heard some booze when the timeout was called as the home team had surrendered 12 straight points to the deeps another turnover here just too easy not much resistance here for the for the deak to start you can see now they gotten in pressure well this was something that started last time for Syracuse against Bucknell little fullcourt pressure how do you see that fundamentally changing what Syracuse can do well they need help right now maybe a turnover speeding the up a little bit trying to create offense either to defense Kyle cuff and Lucas Taylor have come off the Syracuse bench again the Orange playing without their Junior leader JJ Starling who continues to make progress coming back from a broken left hand but not available again today has been practicing but limited Spillers again at The Rim paint has been controlled by wake and this Wake Forest team has not shot the basketball well this season but shooting it well also its a good sign there that JJ Starling does not have any sort of brace on the left hand we saw during practice yesterday afternoon he was involved yes had a brace on it had a wrap on it still was favoring it but he continues to get closer you can tell hes close you know one thing about a hand injury hes able to continue to keep his conditioning up so for him when he gets back itll be more of timing and obviously Comfort once hes cleared with the doctors but he start to involve himself in some five on zero and some practice time with the orange well he has missed the last six games since breaking that hand in practice the day before the team traveled to Tennessee to play the volunteers and since they have lost JJ Starling the team has gone two and four Carlos with the basketball hes now got two fouls after the personal sending Spillers to the line dier Davis also into the game for the orange here goes C coming off his two best games of the Season he is a passive gets himself to the basket and draws the foul his experience has been well needed for the orange the last couple of games and it started going back to the U alony game he came in gave him double digits from the bench in the last couple of games he just continued to Fed off that red Archer didnt hesitate to get him in the game here early so heres the 62 red shirt junr from Harlem makes the first free throw coming up next on ESPN 2 our mens basketball triple header is capped off in the Big 12 with Arizona State and BYU we wish everyone a Happy New Year Mar Center should be rocking well be tuned in ourselves a highflying BYU team with five cougars averaging in double Music figures Jer Davis is in the game spillers motor was really bothering Donnie Freeman early drive by early and the offensive rebounds Freemans got to know hes got to put a body theres a couple of veterans who have been playing together for a while hildr off Balance Falling Out of Bounds Salis understands Im going to come to the basketball and he gets an easy bucket playing against the deak you got to see weak side action and theyre always going to be cutting from the weak side no ones better than that Hunter Lucas Taylor with the long three over the last three games he is now six of nine from distance to had to feel good for the former demon Deacon knocking down a three and they pride of themselves when those got he and cuff said when they got in the game the intensity of the defense have being picked up and they were looking forward to coming in the game and kind of flipping the energy I dont think they expect it to be down 16 to two no Spillers no Reed got a piece of it but here comes Carlos for the Orin poked Away by hildr itll be Syracuse basketball underneath I think Carlos needs to do the same thing he needs to be jquan Carlos needs to be more aggressive with the basketball not just in a situation like that hes crafty a pass first his guy but hes got to be really aggressive with the ball in his hands Carlos with the ball he is seventh in the ACC at five assists per game but he lost it turnovers continue to be a huge issue for Syracuse Spillers when going for his third dunk of the afternoon is called for traveling Spillers thought he was in the NBA and got to do the gather then two steps still in my guy the transfer from Appalachian State five early points he averages just under 10 per game Davis has a poked away I mentioned the turnover Syracuse in its last two games 21 turnovers in each of the two you cant win basketball games coughing it up that much no turnover was a plague both of these teams right now the decks are doing a better job of taking care of the basketball four on the timer Davis strong on it hild picks up the rebound and here comes Salis who a year ago torched the orange down in Winston Salem for 24 points and a 99 70 win for the Deep Salas has torched a lot of people so theres nothing to feel bad about that from long range no Here Comes Kyle Applause C and He will draw another foul the have to do a great job of getting stops trying to get out in transition they have struggled in the half court against the decks they can get rebounds and push theyre struggling against to find offense here in the half court and they can just stop turning the basketball over give themselves a chance maybe to get back in this game you know KY cuff Junior father Kyle senior played for St Johns here in this building when Junior was a baby from obviously Kyle wouldnt remember if he was here but he said as a kid they would go to carnesa Hall and watch his dad play and at the Garden but uh his dad is 69 hes 62 and he kind of chuckled when I asked him yesterday any similarities yeah no no similarities in that game he was honest about it read into the post for Parker Frederickson is come into the game also the Freshman Juke Harris Off the Bench for Steve Ford the foul goes against Peter movich The Freshman from Serbia great job by cam H youre taught as a guard you come off that screen you drive right into the hip of that big Defender and forced the officials to blow the whistle and thats just the experience of Cam H heres Hunter Salis 65 senior from Omaha Nebraska started his college career at Gonzaga now he feeds the post to re whos got a size advantage on the Freshman movich into the lane for an easy two you got to know Reed wants to get to that left shoulder great job getting into the body of M storage the 7ot senior from Richmond makes it 218 Lake Forest Davis caus the foul on Fon Reed well it is New Years Eve and it has many of us here inside the JMA Wireless Dome thinking about New Years resolutions and when we come back well be talking about resolutions for the Atlantic Coast Conference com Music Music Applause for Applause us oh my Applause Applause on this New Years Eve afternoon were thinking about resolutions our first for many of the teams around the ACC get healthy they need to get healthy so many important players to to these teams just imagine what these teams would be if they had older guys number two is patience for all of the new faces in coaching positions in the League weve lost some legends true Legends in the game Hall of Fame coaches just dont replace these guys overnight so a little bit more patience is probably needed in a lot of these programs Adrien atrey here at Syracuse year number two after replacing Nate Smith Hall of Famer Jim beheim of course and then resilience as you turn the calendar over to 2025 yeah theres going to be some trials and tribulations during the season but one thing about this league so much was made of the SEC AC Challenge and rightfully so but when it matters most in the tournament ACC always shows up and I dont see that changing this year and as we talked off the top Randolph both of these teams come in with everything in front of them Syracuse has played one conference game to date lost it at Notre Dame the deakes are one and one having lost 10 days ago at Clemson but in ACC play you can still build your resume and get yourself into the NCA tournament if you just win games you can and both teams have to do it probably a little differently and theyre playing for a lot I mean this this Syracuse team is looking for a pile five win they they dont have that yet this year and the digs that they want to get to the insd of a tournament they have to take their show on a road theyve been really good under coach Forbes at home but theyve struggled on the road theyre 0 and three this year on the road and doesnt matter who you play you want to Stack up as many Road WIS as you can more grumbling here at the Dome as Jer Davis misses two free throws wake with a basketball on top by 13 salad had it blocked by Taylor a lot of time in this game as well myovich in the paint didnt even look at The Rim kicks it back out to Carlos Carlos the only starter on the floor right now for the orange under 10 on the timer Carlos gets it back from Davis front rim it cuff on the offensive glast and a foul third foul drawn by Kyle cuff Jr vage on the front line with the orange great job by cuff going in getting the offensive rebound my storage that time had a point blank layup didnt know where he was on the floor second foul on hildr Taylor from 15 Davis on the offensive glass P fakes is denied by Spillers who nicely stayed on the floor Spillers plays a lot bigger than his six S size this arm reach underrated shot blocker as he gets his hand on that one Harris Davis sores for the rebound to get it away from Spillers Carlos with the basketball for Syracuse with a burst around Parker Frederickson for the layout thats what we talked about with Carlos jquan Carlos is has to be aggressive on the offensive end of the floor such an unselfish player if he just aggressive to score hell find teammates but right now the Orange is struggling in the half court he needs to be more aggressive like that that pass by Frederickson out of bounds trying to find Spillers on the post well have the womens basketball Red River rivalry game Thursday on ESP ESPN 2 number 10 Oklahoma hosts number six Texas at the Lloyd Noble Center in Norman coverage begins at 9 Eastern 8 central just past the midpoint of the first half Davis gets double team finds Movic who has it knocked out of bounds Syracuse will keep on the Baseline really good play there by Davis turning in FA in the double team you dribble its double teams coming knows the cutter there and the Freshman Juke Harris late on the rotation got to get there and protect the basket when the double teams coming and right in front of decks bench sure theyll remind Juke Harris has to rotate but great find there by Davis I think they got to do a better job of turning and facing that double team when its coming whether its lampin or Davis yes and because itll allow you to throw the skip pass for the three on the weak side right now theyre trying to have an assist for the Bas they got to be careful that they dont get a couple of unforced turnovers there when theyre trying to get back in this game next stoppage lampin will return for Syracuse he sits at the scores table Johnsons pass off the back of movich and here comes K Salis met him at the rim and it is Syracuse basketball well cuff may not be the tallest guy but he is always looking to dunk on you another unforce turn of Tyler but cuff is going to take it home silage like no great job attacking the rim even better job with the block not committing the foul its a heck of a play there by Hunter Silas wow Johnson being a pest to Carlos gets the basketball back spins into the lane and hes going to be called for Applause traveling crowd was looking for a foul call I dont think coach Audrey or the fans like that call no to drug that pivot foot on the spin move Kevin Cosby the Alabama transfer into the game for the first time number one in black Kyler Johnson around it out under 9 minutes to go in the half Syracuse with the ball down by 10 off from the corner Eddie lamin with the offensive rebound always looking to pass the basketball gets it out to Davis for three DS never got matched up thereis just his second made three of the Season draw Syracuse back within seven lamin is the point guard in the half court for the orange I mean hes just an excellent passer and you got to get him more touches than opposing even though the double teams coming you know its coming let him turn Face pick it apart give you a chance to get back in this game Spillers to his dominant left hand for two spers also had a great start his activity in his motor its nonstop he played his freshman year at South Carolina Suka hatchee and then a junior college first team AllAmerican before coming to Wake Forest this year Salis Johnson went for the steal but is called for the personal foul Wake Forest jumped out early and continues to maintain a ninepoint lead here on this New Years Eve afternoon in central New York loated for Music is e e Happ Kevin coach thank you very much and one of the jewels of the class of 2025 in recruiting for Syracuse in the building thats Ken Anthony has a day off from Long Island Lutheran High School so made the drive up from Queens to Central New York to take in his future team the Syracuse Orange they could use him in this first half his ability to score the basketball and I know youll be excited to see him in an orange uniform following his dads footsteps I was reading something the other day that his mom lost has already started working on her wardrobes for coming up next year to watch your son play for Syracuse Im pretty sure itll be a lot of orange well kayenne is a fourstar recruit number 36 in paulb andard ESPN 100 sadique white 68 Wing from Charlotte he is at IMG Academy number 16 in the ESPN 100 so weve certainly seen the last two years Randolph the coach autrey and his staff have gotten Syracuse recruiting back to where its more more accustomed to being yes I think the addition needs to happen with them is what you dont you see the Freshman you see the potential and what theyre bringing in I think the nil and what they add through the nil to compliment these young guys will be the key to get the orangs back among the elite teams in college basketball Jer Davis one of the nil editions this year transferring in from Delaware hes now got five points Off the Bench the Deeks meanwhile as you see have cooled off after that blazing start this has been what weve seen from the decks in the past theyve struggled to score also both of these teams are in the mid 20 from three so it turns into a rock fight at times even though the digs came out early blister from the floor silence gathers misses and a foul on the rebound its going to go against Fon Reed more than a head taller than Kyle cuff next to him but its the big guy who picks up the personal those are the fouls that I know Eon Reed is a really smart player but hes invaluable to this team things change for the decks when hes not on the floor hes got to protect those fouls you just let that one go if you dont get it live to be Live to play another day and hell probably have to sit the rest of this half with the orange now finding some momentum and some Rhythm and theyre starting to control the paint that was hard to do do what have to read in the game so he sits with two fouls cam hildr also on the bench with two fouls for Wake as Kyle cuff goes back to the line and gets the roll well hes had three games k tough this year where he has not played coach ay has had him on the bench but his role has evolved and changed dramatically now for the third game in a row hes forcing coach Ary to play I mean hes coming into the game and hes making an impact hes doing a little bit of everything offensive rebounds hes driving making plays for others hes scoring and more importantly he he Embraces the defensive end of the floor the once 16point lead has been trimmed to five Johnson works the Baseline tough shot the whistle comes and Carlos picks up the personal to the Chagrin of Adrien arrey working that sideline thats a dangerous play there by Tyler Johnson hes hes forcing the contact here and the official dont call as they ba him out but the fouls there with his hands its good call now the Carlos picks up his third yeah thats the real problem here because without JJ Starling Syracuse really has nowhere else to turn for ball handling initiating the offense and so their lone point guard goes out with three fouls with six and a half minutes to go in the first thats that time when coaches gamble with their players they trust their veteran guys not to pick up the third foul great recovery by Davis to get the shot block Churchill abass is coming to the game number 55 for Wake Johnson cant get the role Davis fights his own teammate lanin keeps it alive and its Elijah Moore The Freshman for the orange with it both of these teams struggle from moments where they they just cant find a lid no matter how close they get to the basket and D stormed out to a 19 to3 lead But Here Come the H Davis tried to make it his second three of the day instead under six minutes to go Johnson back the other way well as weve talked about neither of these teams shoot it well from distance two of the worst in the league wake has only taken a couple so far today hild back in the game with two fouls turns it over P are letting him play thats for sure Taylor missfires tough active again on the offensive glass he was the last to touch the intensity is picked up in this game you started out so slow there theyre fighting for Applause everything Steve Forbes team shooting 27 worst in the ACC and in the country only three other teams are worse so do you like the idea that they are just shooting fewer of them if thats not your strength is that the way you should go I teams are going to force you to do it and theyre coming out they were able to control the paint here early but they teams going to force you to take some of those threes I think the guys that need to be taking them that guy number 23 you need to get him more tips and getting him off the ball some help does you know help do that here goes number 23 Salis and he is called for traveling one of the thing I see with the deakes a lot of times these guys are driving sometimes you got to drive to pass here Hunters looking get the ball to the rim to score hes going to have a ton of opportunities to do that but when your team is struggling you got to get someone else try to make a play for a teammate and I think both of these teams struggle because they dont have guys to do that aass is going to be called for the foul off the ball trying to High space to the equally sizable Edy lampin a bass doesnt have to foul theyre doubling a post he has help coming well Eddie lampin was the first Syracuse player to get to the Dome today he showed up in a boys in the hood shirt Im like you werent even born when that came out no that was 10 years before he was born hes like oh Ive watched the tapes over and over again when he was a kid dance party Lin with the first free throw of course he has had two other stops started at TCU for Coach Dixon and then last year at Colorado on a really talented team they had three players drafted off of the squad that lamin was starting for him then hes come for his final year of Eligibility here at Syracuse average 10 10 and seven at Colorado and has those same number here for the orange Syracuse really Elite passer for a big guy and I think was their point guard in the half court he was also the first out to get shots up before the game makes a couple of free throws and pulls Syracuse back within three hriff makes it a sixpoint game big three for the senior from England good shot there by hild no hesitation on a pull up three the foul on Syracuse Applause foul on cuff cuff has two and Carlos is already on the bench with three Chris CS not coming out hes going to play the remaining few minutes of the half now the energy that he provided no hes been great but he has two fouls now and looking to see if coach artra maybe play some Zone with something to try to protect protect him from that third foul but hes staying manto man and leaving him on Ty Lord Johnson here is Johnson Salis tough shot along the Baseline Taylor comes away with it here comes Syracuse bounce pass Chris Bell hes in a tough spot somehow gets it to lamin and hes called for the offensive foul Cameron hildr absorbed the body blow and gets the whistle good call Bell you got to know gave it to the big fella there kind of in no mans land and thats on Eddie lampin hes got to know the only thing H can do at that point was the Flop but wait for the double team to come just a little bit more Applause patient could have got a better look at the basket T that HR playing with two fouls gives it to Salis and now an offensive foul on the other end on an illegal screen called against a bass both teams struggle from the three but cam here just doesnt care anything about that des knocks down one of two threes we got a close Music OPP but Le for now thank you guys and Coach it sounds like youve been part of the conversation the last two days here in Syracuse with Randolph childis thats exactly what youve been talking about about the lack of true point guard play and it manifest in many ways including the threepoint shooting and if it if youre dont have a point guard you just need someone that makes the game easier for someone else and thats where both of these teams are struggled no one makes the game easy for anyone else and it could I think lampin has ability to do that inside because of his ability to pass but some teams dont make that adjustment and force him to be a scorer theres another just really unforced turnover there and who takes advantage of these turnovers I think just will ultimately win this game that is the 11th turnover for Syracuse these teams got 20 turnover here and were in the first half hildr little hesitation move a bass goes up front rims it Puck comes away with it got numbers if hes attacks well you know hes going to attack and hes headed back to the free throw line puff is just showing you why hes playing hes forced himself into the lineup chasing down a rebound no one stops the ball gets into a bass chest takes the contact has a chance for an and one Applause here well its not like Kyle cuff came out of nowhere he was recruited to Kansas saw something in him and a an injury made it so that his time with The Jayhawks never really amounted to much and transferred here to Syracuse so there is Talent there and with the Vigor that he has shown coming off the bench the last couple of weeks there is going to be a role for him going forward but hes forcing you playing you know hes forcing you productive and hes coming in and whats happened is theyre doing this from the bench the orange have outscored the de 17 nothing from the bench here so far in the first half and Kyle cuffs a big part of that he has eight of those bench points for the orange Spillers no Freeman tried to hold his ground Freeman has to find a way to match the energy of Applause SP Salis with a half dozen back to a fivepoint ball game cuff gives it up to Taylor he was shot ready he was but that all comes from Lin again the double teams facing him he sees Applause itay as Taylor gets call for the technical foul its the second time he hit his first Jumper in front of the Wake bench turned around made a comment a gesture toward the bench and he hit his second shot there and Applause hes getting teed up for it he got away with the first one you can tell you know the emotion I was part of the Steve forb staff when he was being recruited he was there for two years didnt play you know he was emotional about the game and that time he let his emotions get the best of him and Hur hurt his team with the technical fou under Salis missed first and there is the former Dee played a couple of years his first two years in college in Winston Salem before transferring to Georgia State last year had his numbers Spike at Georgia State and got another opportunity in the ACC this year at Syracuse and again hes experienced guy now has more of an idea of what he is as we talked about Taylor and C cuff those guys told us before they want to come into the game and lift this team up and both of those guys have come in and done just that bringing the orange back in this game they just came out flat not ready to play theyve taken Pride on the defensive end of the floor with their energy I should say that this morning as Tyler Johnson rattles in the three and now weve got a technical the other way this is just the highs and lows that both of these coaches have been dealing with with their teams and he blew a kiss hes going to say he was saying it to the crowd will the two for the yeah he blows a kiss toward cuff and got to know the officials not going to have much of that and hes playing well just knocking down a three and when hes when he is playing well W Force team is different but you got to you ride the highs and the lows with him and hes got to find some consistency in his Applause game this is the first start as a member of the Demon Deacons for Tyler Johnson team needs him this team needs him badly and got to find some stability the way cuff is for the orange here cuff has 10 points Off the Bench Syracuse bench scoring as you see 22 nothing under two minutes to go in the half Taylor with a tough bounce pass into traffic Sal is fouled from behind by Bell just some really bad unforced turnovers by both teams and its why they have these scoring droughts and they struggle I mean you got to try to figure out a way to take care of the basketball and at at least get a shot so Salis the former star at Millard North High School in Omaha shooting a one and Applause one well the college football playoff continues with the quarterfinals on ESPN Tonight Penn State squares off against boisey state in the verbo Fiesta Bowl at 730 Eastern 430 Pacific and tomorrow Texas takes on Arizona State the ChickfilA Peach Bowl at 1 Eastern and then its Ohio State in Oregon in the Rose Bowl presented by credential at 5 Eastern 2 Pacific and we cap the night with Notre Dame and Georgia in the All State sugar Applause B with Randolph children Im Doug Sherman here at the JMA Wireless Dome Syracuse battling back from having trailed by as many as 16 early has been the Catalyst thats a mistake there by bass I know theyre doubling the post Donnie Freemans going to have a difficult time trying to back down Trayvon Spillers no need to come in double soon as he did Freeman sprays it into the corner for the three cup has matched his career high with 13 points what he did against shamad last season big answer for the deakes one minute to go in the half its back to a five point game both of these point guards are playing really well Lon spins into the double team and Pops it Applause up and now wake is going to get a timeout from head coach Steve fors and well take with them back to the dome in 30 Music Music 3631 Wake Forest with a quick time out with possession of the basketball under a minute to go in the half Steve Forbes team jumped out to a 16point lead early but red As orange have battled back led by number zero Kyle cuff Jr what do you see in this perhaps final possession of the half for weight coming out of the timeout Randol I mean he had us a lose its just going to make it I Id like to see them get the ball to Spillers particularly if Freemans going to be guarding him hes he had his way early but when you got a guy like Hunter Salas on the floor you can always run offense for him Applause H even on that inbound Tyler Johnson was still politicking with the official Billington saying wait a second you cant call a technical on me Al great feed to re gathers his pass deflex out of bounds wake will keep with 11 on the shot clock do politicking with the official ever work uh no how many Ts did you get it w never come on never NBA one did you earn it I was trying to get it I was trying to get it and they they obliged Salis tough shot rattles out 20 seconds to go in the half Syracuse will hold for a final shot great defensive possession there by the orange as wake gets into there Applause 131 Taylor in to around and out Freeman with the offensive rebound 3 seconds two and he is fouled on the shot and will take three free throws thats a really bad foul by Ty Lord Johnson there and just a great play by Freeman getting an offensive rebound from a shot I thought cuff took too early just a desperation three there johnon gets him on the arm the officials are over at the scores table taking a look at something see where his foot was if it was a threepoint shot or a twopoint shot you know we saw we havent seen much of Donnie Freeman today but uh that offensive rebound he is really good at rebounding the basketball he seems to have a knack for it its got to get thats how you get yourself in the game I mean in a game like this this level you know theyre not going to run a ton of plays youre going to get the ball you dont have a rhythm go to the glass and hes going to be re wed for his offensive rebounding there and get a chance here for a couple of free throws hes top 10 in the league at over eight rebounds per game also averages nearly 14 points per game five double doubles but he has yet to score today as Syracuse came out slow fell behind 193 but now a chance at the free throw line for Syracuses best foul shooter frean ninth in the leag at defil the threepoint attempt three shot so indeed there you go as Bill Covington JR says it is a three shot foul and a Freeman where in Washington DC he grow up southeast DC baby you and I were here doing the U alvany Syracuse game and had Donnie join us after he put up 24 in the great DS and half of the time seemed like you guys talking about old neighborhoods we did I mean I didnt know he was B and raised in Washington sou this DC so got a few things in common and just excited to see his future such a talented player hes five star McDonalds AllAmerican number six in last years ESPN 100 three big free throws to draw the orange within two hildr with a baseball pass Reed to Salis did he get it off in time either way that is your first half and Off the Bench Kyle cuff Jr is the story match their best player great job by our crew to come up with that video little levity on the end of the Syracuse bench start of the second half a lot of foul trouble for both teams Kyle cuff gets the start in the second half after matching his career high with 13 points Off the Bench he starts in place of Chris Bell and also Taylor starts in place of Elijah Moore third person foul yeah for Fon Reed there and as we talked about it hes valuable to the de and Id go and attack him again Freeman tried to get Syracuse its first lead Reed and Johnson Miss handle but wake has the basketball yeah foul trouble all across the board wake already has three guys Johnson who has the basketball a bass and Reed all have three Syracuses point guard Carlos has three fouls KY cuff saves the ball but he stepped down the sideline Phil Covington was right on top of that Applause Applause play pretty clearly did step on that second stride on the sideline so w for for the basketball up by two now Randolph you talked about the bench storing Applause 25 to nothing hriff now has seven points and pushes the lead back to four h and Hunter Sol do a great job of getting to the ACC playing off two feet reverse pivoting and shooting that 8 to 10 foot pullup Carlos left alone shoots an airball yeah he shot the 8 to 10 foot pullup for the four feet shot it over Johnson uses the screen cant get the roll lampin pulls down the rebound Here Comes Carlos by himself against a couple of black jerseys trailing the play cup steps for the jump shot left it short Spillers Salis Johnson kri and Reed on the floor for Wake Forest Captain Reed now hold up hold up both teams ice cold to begin the second half Applause lobin inside great position Lankin able to save it big collision and its a blocking foul against hild well when cuff gets the ball he makes like a running back you know hes going to the bucket hes in attack mode as he should be I mean hes playing well so far this afternoon hes been the best offensive player for the orange and when you when youre struggling to you got to take advantage of opportunities with area and this seems to be his afternoon and as you see hildr is now the fourth deak with three fouls Eddie lanin doing some work along the Baseline great Baseline under underline execution there for the orange with the youre so accustomed to a one5 ball screen not often do you get the one5 ball screen with the point guard setting scen and L showing you he can put it on the floor and make a play rounding out on Johnson he made his first three this afternoon hasnt made another on the Swift Freeman fouled by the much shorter Tyler Johnson and that is his fourth personal that bench for Steve fores is going to be very active here in the second half carker Frederickson will now come into the game for Johnson those are the things that that drives coach forward or any coach just drives a mad you have three fouls youve got to know were coming to double or you give up the basket its a four foul you pick up your fourth foul with 17 minutes to go and a half just reaching and hes not be looking to score just a bad Carloss foul had a sense that that forway into the paint wasnt going anywhere he didnt look like he had a path to the bucket and hes another guy hes hes been inserted to the start lineup I mean hes had moments where hes impacted this team and you have to account for his speed and his creativity hes a big part of their offense right now and hes going to spend a significant amount of time on the bench and now this puts a tremendous amount of pressure on Hunter siles to to get going on the offensive end one thing Steve Forbes has talked about throughout the early part of the Season his want to get Hunter Salis off the ball more frequently and that was behind putting Johnson in the starting lineup but when your starting point guard has four fouls this early in the second half Salis is going to be back on ball he is and see alry made the adjustment and started cuff the second half and its a good job with Carlos being coming in the game he had three in the first half he has to be careful not to pick up his sport game his two free throws tie the basketball game at 38 AP piece where does the offense come from Applause now H spins missed the Lefty layup Syracuse can take the lead pu season opening and is foul thats got to be at least the sixth time he has drawn a foul today by that time no oneop the basketball and it digs really good in the half court and now cam Hill just picks up his four foul and I think sometimes this is just frustration with some of these guys these are not smart fouls and so Johnson and hildr both have four Reed and abass with three a piece and a bass youre okay with because when you tell guys from the bench like this some guys youre not going to play enough to foul out dont worry be physical be aggressive rebound defend but when youre Fon Reed you need him on the floor and Tyler Johnson gets the first start tonight you cant commit that first foul the no look pass from Carlos and Freeman gives Syracuse its first lead of the day credit to the orange theyre competing they fought back to get back in this game and a lot of that is Taylor and cuff those guys have just been outstanding and they INF effort and energy brought in this game Cosbys come back into the game for Wake as Fon Reed tries to go against lanin who is called for the foul well this you said coming into the game might wind up being the key matchup of this ball game those two big guys yes who wins this match up between lampin and Fon and both are similar bigs the physical both are Id say below the rim guys that need angles to score and that time Fon was looking for an angle and you got to know both guys want to turn over that left shoulder shoot that hook shot former top 20 National recruit who went to Gonzaga out of IMG Academy started his high school career at the Steward School in Richmond should say started at LSU and then went to Gonzalez wake is his third stop and no one has struggled more with the point guard play in their and their effort and output than Fon Reed I mean in the past hes had point guards coming off throwing lobs whether it was goopy Miller or or applebe and his numbers have dropped his Effectiveness have dropped because he needs that point guard to help him score particularly when on the offensive end when hes in a dunker spot Reed averaging 76 points six rebounds for tough shot in the end one for Lucas Taylor the former deak with a highlight for the orang orange you got to know Taylor is coming in being aggressive great no look past there to Freeman giving the orange first lead here coming in with former de scoring against his old team that has to feel good Music ATT to the video to watch the Syracuse l l the official hard provider of Syracuse basketball the heroes we deserve always ready okay fans were going to go out to the court now for our D bright sleep shoot and score contest our contestant today is Beth shes going to have two chances

good effort were going to home a 50 gift certificate be sure to visit Furniture New York Furniture sh Randolph Chris the Syracuse bench led by Kyle cuff Jr has been the difference so far today outscoring the decks 27 Z so far here in this game and it all started with Kyle cuff hes been incredible coming in knocking down shot Lucas says you know what remember me hes com in with a lot of energy and playmaking as he shows you there getting the and one and extending the lead here for the orange so CU cuff with 13 points hes gotten to the free throw line repeatedly eight out of nine he has drawn seven fouls against the deakes and singlehandedly has a number of the Wake for his players on the bench in foul trouble he is and wake Force control the paint early either off the dribble or throwing the ball inside catching lobs and then thats flipped and now the orange are dominating the paint but theyre doing it off the dribble theyre drawing fouls and Coach R comes back in the game puts F Reed back on the floor with Spillers see if he can get control more of the paint but his front line again Taylor has now matched his season high with the nine points and at the other end you know thats not the shot Wake Forest wated Spillers from three and again its just the foul were talking about now thats four on e Reed hes got to sit down and hes got to try to protect his fouls and Ive said it all game hes you can see the the the W for is bench look at the coaches theyre in theyre telling you right now like they just dont know what to say its its frustrating for them and he has to learn to let some stuff go and stay on the floor but right now the activity level of the orangs is picked up theyre just a harder playing team right now theyre playing smarter theyre playing Harder They have fought back and take control of this game Reed hildr and Johnson each with four fouls and so Hunter Salis back at the point draws a foul against Taylor whos done a nice job since coming off the bench to begin the game to make things a little tough on Salis with his scoring he has you got to defend Salas with length you cant put a smaller guard on him cuz if you do he gets to his midrange shot just elevates over got to keep a longer and letic defender on him to bother that shot right there Spillers was the last to touch its Syracuse Applause basketball trying to change things up the de are in a 131 Freeman he is so comfortable thats his shot around the free throw line thats his shot and thats okay its three balls developing but that midrange shot of Applause his that is where Donnie Freeman is just so comfortable that turning you facing you you close out on the midrange hell drive you no play no play commits the foul after blocking the first first attempt by Spillers so wake has it underneath SP gives it back to Sal excuse me Rand no this is where so much pressure is on Hunter Silas to score and they get bog down in a half court and their offense becomes hun silus go score and build me out Taylor trying to deny him hard to keep the first team all ACC player off the board and thats why hes all ACC he just has the ability to hey we need a bucket go get me a bucket not everyone has that type of player great entry pass better rejection by Spillers traveling violation second time Spillers has been called for steps just great timing he gets beat look at the timing there on the block by Spillers tries to get the ball at as high point before lamin elevates and able to get a hand on it Freeman draws the Crowd Goes to the basket missed it lanin able to lay it back in the lead is back to six thats where he wants to get the ball he doesnt shoot it hes going to turn and face and drive you there and he missed it and lampin a to clean it up Salis draws a double team and lampin comes too hard third foul on lampin so this is a wake team whose best win so far this season came on November 10th they beat Michigan a really good Wolverines team that has fallen out of the top 25 this week but I think theyre going to be ranked for the better part of the Year Syracuse meanwhile has not defeated a power conference all year its six and six they have not beaten a power conference opponent yet yeah six and0 against mid Majors 0 and six against Power Conference Team Salis with a huge three for Wake great job by Parker ferson turning the pin down ready to shoot ballside defender came to help and he sprayed it at Silas for the three Carlos good shot F probing along the Bas line Freeman calling for it five on the shot clock Applause cff has to put it out and a terrific rebound by Spillers to close out a terrific defensive possession for Wake Frederickson catching shoot Dees need to get him going timeout Wake Applause Forest I asked Parker fredon before the game was he worried about shooting threes he says Shooters dont worry about they knock down shots they keep shooting as he knocks down this one got a tie game here in the orange Music Music Music Applause know Applause Music Applause the Music Applause Music Applause Music got come Music in the blink of an eye Wake Forest with back to back back threes has retied the ball game Randall throw away those percentages back to back threes here by the de one by the best player in Hunter Silas he comes down now if hes not scoring it hes creating it welcoming sight to see Parker fredon knock down to three no one knows better than red alry when your teens is is struggling to score cant give up the known and Parker fron is a threepoint shooter no matter what the numbers say you got to get to him only eight on the year coming in but clearly during practice for Syracuse yesterday red ay and his staff made sure to say never go under a screen on frericks always identify and know where he is and they lost track of him that time and weve got our second tie of the ball game the threes coming bunches and when youve been struggling basket opens up and you see one go in my stovic off the Davis Miss able to bring it back out to Applause Taylor Harris also into the game for Wake Applause Forest foul on the floor Syracuse already in the bonus and so a lot of free throws upcoming for the next 1225 for a team that doesnt shoot free throws very well only 69 for Syracuse but right now its about who the fouls are on Wake Forest has a couple of guys with four fouls jquan Carlos can have his imprint on the game I think hes so selfish he gets aggressive puts pressure on the rim and draws fouls and gets to the line hes a good free throw shooter one thing that struck me during Syracuse practice yesterday was that there were a lot of light moments they were still having fun led by their head coach right Adrien ay was encouraging his players dont just dunk it throw down windmills yeah yeah so they they were it was a good sign to me that in spite of the fact theyre only six and six and have not lived up to their own expectations this team as the calendar is about to turn is still one unit conference play starts right and you get a chance to fix everything youve had a break the great thing about the Christmas break is you get a chance to reevaluate whats worked what hasnt worked you get to alter some things fredericksons three bounces untouched out of bounds well what did Steve Forbes tell us this morning that apparently at practice at Wake Forest yesterday Frederickson made something like 40 4 out of 46 threes yeah he can shoot it hes hes like I dont know whats going on he cant figure it out and the team and and one thing that coach Forbes does I can I can assure you is they chart your five on five threepoint shooting from the summer and the fall and this team shot 37 in live action and then it gets to the game and for whatever reason its just not carrying it over and that sort of thing is infectious right Rand absolutely its a confidence both good and bad absolutely cuff no Salis with a strong rebound warding off the larger Davis and hes got a look on his face like Im going to Applause score Cosby steps into a three no Harris big offensive rebound back to S he said he was going to score at least with his facial expression and hes got the deakes back in front he wants the ball he wants the moment he just needs a little help from his teammates hes at 27 and 26 points the last two games for Wake Forest hes up to 17 now to lead all scores this afternoon Davis with an easy Applause two1 for by the way as you see the bench points 30 to3 the triple by Parker Frederickson a couple of minutes ago the first from any reserve for Wake Music Applause J friendly Hometown bounce for Juke Harris The Freshman from Southbury North Carolina good look there with dukee Harrison at the four got a close out to him then the Freshman blocks Davis and

that off the top it looked like Steve Forbes team was going to run away with it but Syracuses bench has brought them back into it Su led by his many of six but hunter Salis and Company have punched back and now Midway through the second half weve got ourselves a ball game we do teams are starting to play hard theyre Mak any adjustments and lets see who has enough in the tank close out and get this all important win both teams need Rickson got the shot they wanted coming out of the timeout he just couldnt Applause connect Carlos Freeman Taylor cuff and lampin whos got position inside

touch the basketball with the group thats on the floor now Ws g a double Salis is Fielder its money thats his shot he gets to that ACC and he elevates and right nows hes singing a rim its wide open

his way on the other side I mean theres no one been able to stay in front of him and but I still think they got to figure out a way to get lampin the ball get touches with Fon Reed out he has a size Advantage inside where you know the double teams coming maybe find someone cutting or three on a weak side well cuff got the start in the second half based on his terrific 13point first half now 14 for the game thats a new career high and we have not seen Chris Bell in the game at all here in the second Applause half dangerous pass barely gets through Harris he this morning everybody calls him Juke except his mom when shes mad at him then its Jaden well you dont never want to be called that she not mad right now not at all her babys knocking down to Corner three bringing to DS a lot of

look to hit Juke Harris off the space calls his own number and draws the foul got to get the ball out of his hands hes completely taking over this game thats the third foul on Lucas Taylor line and so Salis the fifth leading scorer in the ACC makes the first womens basketball takes over the AC Network every Thursday starting this week we have a double header that begins at 6 Eastern with Virginia Tech hosting Florida State in blackburg and then Stanford squares off against SMU in Dallas at 8 Eastern 5 Applause Pacific this is the game of runs its a long way from being over beaks are going to their Zone Carlos and Taylor have been the story this afternoon for Syracuse you know he wants to knock it down and have a big game being a former deakon Applause he has lived up to the billing here Spillers with a quick first step and the foul against Applause Music movich Taylor is one of the many players who been struggling from behind a threepoint line but not that one as he knocks down a three brings the cuse back within the point Music e e e e e here at the Dome Kevin Wake Forest Back on Top 6057 with Randolph chis Im Doug Sherman 8 minutes to go in regulation and one of the big stories for Syracuse in this comeback has been Lucas Taylor with a uh new season high with 12 points Off the Bench yeah hasnt its been the bench for for the orangs this how they got back in the game down 16 early Lucas Taylor doing it on both ends of the floor hes drawing the assignment here hes got to find a way to continue to knock down shots but also cool down Hunter Silas and speaking of the journey that its been for Lucas Taylor he was recruited out of high school by Steve Forbes he picked Wake Forest over Clemson after a couple of years of not getting regular minutes he wound up transferring last year to Georgia State before coming to Syracuse and its been a long adjustment for him this year but over the last three games especially his shooting has been excellent and hes brought other things to the floor well hes bringing it hes hes accepting the responsibility of being he wants to be their best Wing Defender and when you take when you attack the defensive end to the floow that way it opened up its opportunities for you on the offensive end of the floor weve seen that so far this afternoon Carlos pick and roll Applause Movic theyve got a foul on the pass Syracuse trying to save it was on the shot either way its going to be two free throws for Syracuse movich at the line they got something going there that against the Zone they trying to run that middle ball screen gets throw the pocket pass get in the middle of the floor and with that big in The Dumping spot you saw in my store was trying to throw the lob to Freeman before the foul was called movich was signed by coach autrey and his staff late not until August did he join Syracuse played last year in Frances under 21 pro league what exactly does that mean is somebody who played in Europe what level of basketball was he playing its a really good League I mean its you got the u20s nationally you know making your national team or making your age team its shows youre one of the best players in the country your country at that age no different than we have in the US foul on Freeman great find here but hunter Silas is taking over this game and he readed that weak side showing you his point guard playmaking skills Freemans on the outside of the cutter and he dimes him up gives him a chance to get to the free throw line we talked about Lucas Taylor moving around I love the story of Trayvon Spillers as he has made his way from being somebody who went to Junior College without division one offers became an all Sun Belt Conference first teamer last year at AB State and then had offers from LSU Arkansas Wake Forest he chose the deakes I love the growth and potential that he has continued to live up to just shows you when you play hard your opportunities are Limitless and doesnt matter how you start hes a valuable addition to the decks Carlos into Freeman second Defender Comes The Freshman able to get it back out front seven on the shot clock Taylor catching Applause release tough at designs of a sports center top 10 right there didnt quite work out but I love the way he goes hard at The Rim Tri he tried to time and catch him one didnt he as a guard though and you go to the offensive glass if you dont get it you got to get back help set your Applause Music defense not a great possession there by the de ball didnt move from one side of the court shots like that start the transition break there and Carlos comes down on the other end he gets to the rim Harris called for his fourth foul Johnson Harris Reed and hildr all with Applause four coming up next on ESPN 2 our mens basketball triple header is tapped off in the Big 12 with Arizona State and Brigham Young we wish everybody a Happy New Year what we got another whats that eight hours left in 2024 any big plans tonight not at all hope Im a wait when a new year starts thats my plans hope I can make my flight to enjoy it lets say that there you Applause go got to attack him to get the ball out of his hand big play by Harris what a quick first step in the strengths to finish through contact freshman had huge impact here in the second half cuts on the Baseline catches it puts it on the deck draws the contact chance has an and one Juke Harris giving some great minutes to the decks the orange have got to do a better job in their ball screen defense theyre allowing Hunter siles to get too deep picking them apart got to get the ball out of his hands to make someone else make a decision for the def Freeman takes a seat after picking up his third third foul Jer Davis returns for the orange he sets the screen Carlos Travis was thinking about trying to give it back to him and and thats what Im saying about him he has to look to score nobodys stopping him there he turns the corner hes hes defending himself hes essentially turned the corner can get to the rim he doesnt want to take the shot and he travels the best thing for the Orange is for him to take that shot when defenses start taking out way could you make a pass like that Spillers up and over Davis couldnt stop him its once again a sixpoint Wake Forest lead they better change their ball screen coverage defense because Hunter Sol is picking it apart Harris making another big play Here Come the deakes three onone Hil off the feed from Salis Wake Forest by Applause eight Deeks returning defense and the offense there Juke Harris picks the pocket of movich and Silas continues to diing guys up finding HRI there trying to get rid of the ball before the foul you know you got a player when hes excited about passing as much as he is scoring and he is taken over this second half for the decks well he was the centerpiece of the off season there was no better feeling Im sure for Coach Forbes and his staff at the point where Hunter who was going to likely be drafted somewhere in last years NBA draft if he had left decided to come back for at least one more year or what would be his final season here at Wake Forest what a difference he makes you got to be excited when you get a player like that I mean guys like that dictate the excitement about whether youre going to have a postseason or not and its why hes the reason why the de for preseason pick third in the ACC because you had a play of the Year caliber guy returning Trayvon Spillers near a double double with a senior from Charleston South Carolina turnover is starting to be an issue again for Syracuse up to 16 now Taylor keeps his dribble big bucket back to a sixpoint game he was determined he was going to shoot that one he had no intentions of passing that basketball Applause shot clock reset to 30 then to 20 and the officials were trying to get the scoring table to get it back to Music 30 I guess 20 is where they wanted it it went back and forth and then the official stop was there a change of possession or was it an offensive rebound down b c is heading over scores Table and there reset in the shot clock the orangs had possession of the basketball so its a full 30 seconds so its an its a defensive rebound and a turnover Trey go get it Applause hey no reason to go away from the ball ball screen action with Hunter Silas they havent stopped it yet just get him in the ball screen lanin back on the floor for the orangs theyve got Sal trout able to get out of it 10 on the shot clock under 5 minutes left in the second half H lost the dribble out of bounds to Syracuse just a great defensive possession there by cup thats closes out contains the dribble knocks that off hildred its not easy to do on a close out great job understanding The Scouting Report youre not guarding a shooter a guy that wants to drive the basketball he close out short cut off his driving Applause angle I think you Rand chelis can relate to what weve seen in Taylor Im going to shoot this basketball hes determined hes not looking to pass it at all and hes done a great job with his length guarding Hunter Silas when he hasnt had a ball Applause screen extra pass to Cuff wide open for three lampin grabs the offensive rebound and goes back to work lost it Syracuse fortunate to keep possession now with under four minutes on the clock here frederson and ball screen for 101 so Carlos draws the foul on Frederickson and the senior from Brooklyn will be at the free throw line when we come Music back e e e e e e Syracuse really jumped out dug themselves in a whole early they went to their bench led by Taylor and K cuff just completely flipped this game and and so now the HRA transfer jquan Carlos misses the front end out of Thomas Jefferson High School in Applause Brooklyn fun fact Fran filla back in 1979 was a student teacher I thought you was going to tell me Fran was a bucket back then at Jefferson High School he may have been Laughter that 6865 the Wake lead is three Salis has been the star for wake in the second half especially with Tyler Johnson on the bench with the four personal fouls he has taken back over the point guard job hild step back three nothing but Applause n thats a tough step back shot there by Hill hes not had one of his better offensive games but no shot bigger than stepping up knocking down that one right there come on Lucas come on Applause Luc off the crossover now another rebound hes got himself a double double and weight will take its time Applause theyre going to go back to the same action itll be in hilds hand or Hunter solass Applause hand five on the shot clock Salis it rims out on him Syracuse with it down 7165 Carlos leaves Salis couldnt finish though Applause had to layup but hes trying to find the teammate there and jumped in the air looking to pass and not to Applause score hildr Fade Away n the orange has numbers if they push blocked Reed got a piece of it what a great job by the center to close out on the perimeter great job using his length and making the deflection there big block while we thought they be an open three for cuff timeout coach Forbes says its a full timeout Hunter Salis has hit his stride the last three games doing it all today for the deeps he hasnt hes been doing it all hes either knocking it down or hes creating offense for everyone and you see why coach fors was thinking about starting him at point because of that decision making but off the bounce off the catch however you want it Hunter silus is capable delivering and thats his money shot there getting into the middle of the lane elevating shooting that fade aways money had a great game so far here and lets see if he can close it out alas with those 21 points he is also two of four from Beyond The Arc along with those four assists and the lead is 7165 with under two minutes to go why a timeout there for Coach fors its a big possession there the game is gone up and down he doesnt like his offensive possessions the last couple of times down the floor settle your group down designed a play to get Hunter the ball or Hill just whever you want but a couple of frenetic possessions there on the offensive end H had a chance the orang had a chance to come down and knock down an open three you want to settle your guys down make sure that they understand time and score and situation right now and I like that the Freshman Juke Harris is still on the floor getting big crucial minutes late for Wake Forest he has delivered a spark the last few minutes as Wake Forest has retaking the lead theres the young man from Salsbury North Carolina and at his size he gives you position flexibility because he can shoot you know threes and he hes so well he can play the three or to four he works the Baseline while two Syracuse Defenders get the ball out of the hands of Salis Spillers attacks dumps it off Harris he will shoot two as Taylor is called for his fourth foul number three Music somethings going on with cuff I think hes hes taking his shoe off I dont know if his shoelace popped or not baring a teammates left shoe if we got a Zion Williamson blowout hes played hard enough to blow out his shoes I tell you that hes hes had himself a game and yeah Bill Cy comes over and tells he has a blowout so hes going to finish the game in Mitch ma Applause shoes little pink little blue I like it its New Years baby oh he looks like hes got another emerging blowout on the right side hes got a slow leak in the other one one flat one slow leak two shot and so now the 67 freshman makes the first the college football playoff continues with the quarterfinals on ESPN Tonight Penn State squares off against boyc state in the verbo Fiesta Bowl at 730 Eastern 430 Pacific couple huge free Applause throws 7365 now 67 for Syracuse as Carlos gets to the basket and the quick Syracuse timeout last thing you wanted youre wake Force demon Deacon is to give up a layup uncontested with minimum amount of time off the clock got to offer some resistance here you still got a lot of basketball left to play here in a minute and 33 seconds theres a game reset for you Syracuse has used its final timeout wake still has one both teams now in the double bonus Randolph the biggest shock to me is that weve yet to have anybody foul out of the game weve had multiple players sitting on three and four fouls seemingly the entire second half Harris hrth Reed and Johnson all with four for the deakes Taylors got four for Syracuse just a understanding time and situation late you got to know if you didnt protect your fouls early you got to go NE you got to know late you pick that fifth foul youre done Music and this is the way these teams play theyre going to junk it up youre going to need everyone and you look at that screen and everyone has had their Music moments after the New Year Syracuses next game will be in Tallahassee against Florida State on Saturday at the same time wake will be taking on North Carolina state which lost to Virginia earlier today in a game scene here on ESPN 2 cam hildr leads the Demon Deacons out of the Huddle off of the ma basket the inbounder Harris will be able to run the Baseline full court pressure by the orange as always Freeman up on the inbounder the immediate double team handled beautifully by the senior Hunter sales its a great job being strong with the ball hes dominating it forcing you to foul gave it up to Fon Reed tried to get it back and smart far by Squan Carlos there identifying Fon Reed is shooting 60 from the free throw line he didnt want to put Hunter Silas there who shoot in the mid Applause 80s big free throw for Fon Reed Applause II its always a plus when your bigs can step up and make free throws you never want empty possessions no pressure on him now hes knocked down one always H to bigs make at least one of two after re knocks down both great rotation on both and its back to an eightpoint lead Taylor for three C blocked out of bounds Syracuse will keep with 18 on the shot clock Carlos finally gets it into Taylor gives it back to the point guard off the spin jquan Carlos for two Al Carlos could have done more of that throughout the game just get to the rim and be certain and try to score cam H got away with extending his arm may have gotten away with an offensive foul there but I thought Jain Carlos might have sold it too much Applause third Applause shot pretty good Collision right in front of us yeah those are two strong guys there and so hildr at 82 on the season shooting Applause two hes been in his situation a bunch experienced guard tough as they come count on him knocking those down and the rare fourthe senior in the same place Carlos another two Applause points inbound deflected but right back to Wake Forest and then the reach given by cuff and thatll send Salis one of the best free throw shooters in the ACC to the free throw line for two got to try to find you want to foul Juke Harris hadnt been in a ton of situations like this before youd rather foul him than put this guy at the line Applause Hunters mom Jessica a Nebraska High School Basketball Hall of Famer who went on to play in the Music WNBA her son Hunter with two more free throws back to an eightpoint game Carlos Tock puts it Music up well even though Cups imprint on this game has been great for Syracuse he has shot a very poor percentage and really has had a hard time getting going in that regard here in the second half well everyone hasnt but hes just been the guy that provides so much spark in his energy got the orange back in the game but when you fall down by so many points that early in the game you spend so much energy trying to get back in the game and sometimes when you get tired of fatigue makes cowards of all of us when you struggle to think and key moments and you cant question his effort at all all he gave it his all looked like the Y are come up short here against the deeps well Wake Forest LED 193 and then led by two at halftime so the comeback occurred throughout that first half once the bench got involved right Syracuse took as much as a sixpoint lead in the second half but the Demon Deacons now up by 10 let me get it let me get it and and that will do it Syracuse backs off and the folks from Winston Salem in the old gold and black are going to head back to North Carolina with their second ACC win of the Season DS get a crucial Road win for a program and a team that has struggled on the road doesnt matter who you play Road wins in any conference are tough to get congratulations to the digs for getting that first road win of the season a resilient Bunch for Steve Forbes posts an 8171 Victory on the road over Syracuse led by Hunter Salis with his 23 points got n on the clock still as both coaches wait at midcourt for the inbound and thatll do it wake improves to 10 and four S drops to six and seven great effort I thought by a
