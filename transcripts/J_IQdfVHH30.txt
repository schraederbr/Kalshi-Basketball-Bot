Music foreign Applause Music thats a big reason he attributed to their success in the last three games nahim McLeod kaidaria Smith Steph to the line we are underway from the Donald L Tucker Civic Center starting lineups first for the visiting Spartans itll be kiberius Smith Nick albs Jordan Gainey Trey brodnax Floyd Rideau Jr early action inside and a traveling violation good energy from Florida State on that first defensive possession yeah thats something that Leonard Hamilton talked about getting back to playing Florida State Defense uh being disruptive trying to disrupt the offense thats a good start for Florida State seminal team who forced 16 Louisville turnovers on Saturday Worley Mills Darren Green Jr Matt Cleveland and nahim McLeod the starting five for Leonard Hamiltons goals here is Matt Cleveland who has been playing better as of the last four games shot clock winding down McLeod a lefty shot missed everything it should be a shot clock a violation and it is you see coach ham hoping to join Coach K Dean Smith Roy Williams and Gary Williams his guys who joined that prestigious 400 win Club in the ACC what kind of company is that Mr octopus uh theres not many uh there is not many thats why he is one of the best and again I think the key word consistency its one thing to do it once or twice uh hes been doing it for over 20 years uh at Florida State Ron Gruber Tommy Morrissey Isaac Barnett the gentleman and the zebra stripes this evening a late start in tally we appreciate your prime time Tuesday night ACC basketball Worley the deflection and the middle is now trying to get out into transition Applause quick strike three not gonna fall Laredo the Redshirt sophomore back in his home state of Lake Wales Florida looking for Cleveland not on the same page thats been an issue for FSU at times this season on their own yeah and thats really uh I think the number one glaring up thing for Florida State turnovers uh coming into this game they have more turnovers than assists now the last three it has been better the close losses to Purdue and Virginia two teams that many think will be in the final four or contenders but they played very well then against Louisville uh single digits uh they had a shooting 10 turnovers in that game so again theyre doing a better job as of late but that needs to be more consistent Gainey gets the friendly roll keep an eye on him last years Big South freshman of the year I mean hes coming off a game where he had 28 and hes not just a threepoint shooter midrange and I think I like about him he is a very good assist guy as well too Mill and this is what Gainey does right here now Florida State they switched one through five that time at the big on him went right to the basket nice little turnaround jumper foreign Music ey really took over in overtime against those Bulldogs on Saturday Mills a player for FSU Malcolm that theyre looking for leadership and hes trying to figure out right now with the Knowles not having a true point guard how to distribute to his teammates but also get his own shot and its been an adjustment for him hes not a traditional point guard we spoke with Coach Hamilton about that and at the beginning of the Season he felt like look he was thinking too much hes more of a natural scorer hes getting a little better trying to find that balance and one of the things theyre doing is pulling him off the ball and moving Cleveland and Worley when he gets in Worley on the ball pull up Jay Rito no rebound McLeod cleans the glass up ahead to Worley combo guard highly touted recruit as Mills have swatted into the stands by kyderius Smith hes senior from Fort Mill South Carolina now the only thing I dont like about this right here the great late Bill Russell said hey look keep it inbound right looks nice for the cameras but you dont have possession still though good help side defense nice feed down low easy duck for nahim McLeod and the file doing a nice job not bringing that down its a beautiful pass by Worley and from a cloud kept it up high flushed it excellent offense by Florida State Applause going the other way Applause and I like this offensive possession that previous offensive possession by Florida State football has a clear size Advantage right now roll him put him in some ball screen situations let him roll to the basket and just throw it up let him use his size see if you can either get him more dunks or get him through the free throw line Mills into the teeth of the defense stays with it Cleveland three Bang Applause Music Florida State leads by five and improved outside shot for Matt Cleveland this season he has worked really hard to credit the coaching staff of Florida State they do a really good job and the Player Development his shot has continued to improve Applause quick 70 burst for Florida State energy the key component according to Leonard Hamilton over the last three games Florida State beating Louisville yes and inside it goes McLeods fouled but also looks competitive against the number one and number two teams in the country Purdue and Virginia teams again Ill say it uh many would not be surprised to see those two teams the Final Four and Florida State played those two tough just ran out of gas and were going to get into it later but what Florida States missing theyre missing some key pieces that they thought they would have but well certainly theyre pivoting and readjusting to the lineup that they have but I like what theyre doing the last three possessions now not settling for jumpers on the first look worked the ball around that time going back down low to McLeod McLeods second free throw has struggled this season from the line look pure on both attempts there the big man converting Music see Florida State picking up 90 feet from the bucket foreign have been known to just completely disrupt your offense not allowing you to run your place Smith double team comes and a foul on warley Applause Florida State leading by seven its been a nice start for the Knowles as Cleveland connects on the three early in tally congratulations to Matt welcome to the neighborhood now did you know that Geico could help with your Homeland insurance cookies Charlie is my mums secret recipe a little nutmeg isnt it its a secret is it cinnamon its my moms secret red kitchen okaycom thats why Music Applause Music you love to see scenes like that Malcolm a Florida State team that has battled so much adversity in a tough start RJ Marsh got his first Scout win of the season for Florida State on Saturday and we talked about it in the shoot around the energy is just different now I call the Florida game uh here and it was just a different energy coach Hamilton talked about it where guys just were unsure of their roles they had to adjust but he felt like their mindset wasnt right you could tell in that video they are locked in and its just a different energy right now with this Florida State team you hear it from all the players too this week weve got to just reset the season try and win the game and go to 10 each and every contest I mean to feel even in shoot around was just a different energy and it showed up in their game and I think the biggest area defensively early on right now theyre getting some points off of turnovers something that Florida state is known and thats the staple for Leonard Hamilton teams how smooth was that jumper from the princear line from Cleveland he is just playing at a high level Music we spoke with Coach Dave Dickerson of USC Upstate he said the thing we cannot do against this Florida State team turn the ball over and you can see now Florida state theyre out up in the passing lines and thats something coach Hamilton talked about pressuring the ball and then not making it easy for teams to run their offense and youll watch theyll switch one through five on down screens or any screens they will switch contested opportunity there for Gainey great defense for Mills Music all the way to the Rock high off the glass Corin goes down hard numbers for the Spartans burrito a three Applause Floyd Rito Jr he can stroke it from the outside 45 on the year from Beyond The Arc excellent transition offense by upstate extra pass they had them spaced out Music Applause Hills who scored in double figures in eight of Florida States 11 games this season active defense from the Knowles Spartans recover the three wont fall and Cleveland has cleaned the glass very well for Florida say it has a late thats one thing that he does hes a very good rebounding guard yeah Tempo is picked up here at the tuck with Florida State leading by six Applause good load youre not gonna fall Music Applause well whats been impressive early of the pressure of the ball pressure and thats something both coaches talked about we must put pressure on the ball Leonard Hamilton said early on in the season uh he was not pleased with how his guards have pressured and then he said on the back end uh there was not pressure on that initial pass you can see now both teams but in particular Florida State being disruptive with their defense I want to say its got five points early off three Spartan turnovers a foul cold Applause is that on Deontay green it is indeed freshman from Asheville North Carolina weve talked about injuries and we will continue to Green battles and ACL tear in the spring semester in his high school senior season has recovered very well to get back onto the court for FSU playing way Music shot clock winding down on upstate three yes Burrito Jr heating up and thats a miscommunication that time on the switch now we talked about it Florida state theyre going to switch one through five that time they dont communicate excellent offense with the shot clock winding down again by USC Upstate you like that stuff back Jay sometimes good defense doesnt make a difference thats a beautiful a step back jumper by Greene Darren Green one of the prolific transfers in the market this past off season LED UCF and scoring one year ago coach Hamilton will tell you thats one of the best Shooters Ive ever had in my

Williams he had some great stories so hes still coaches a talks with Coach uh Williams on a weekly basis hell go to him any issues come up with the team uh certainly uh played for one of the best uh hes doing an outstanding job with this UFC Upstate program and again when you get High Praise from somebody like a Leonard Hamilton saying look its not just coach speak the job that hes done with them and how well coached they are he knew he was going to have to come in and have his team prepared tonight thats really a fun thing coach Dickerson spent a year as a scout in the Utah Jazz system before getting the job at Tulane on an upward trajectory are these Spartans and how about that put back from Langley and thats something that coach Dickerson talked about trying to manufacture some points like that offensive rebounds Second Chance opportunities thats great work on the offensive glass pass Coast to Coast stand the game Music Applause redo has simply been on fire into double figures already with 10 and that one right there though aint gift and thats something that just cant happen uh if youre Florida State against this team again we talked about it their last outing uh they have 31 points off the turnovers uh this right here just to miss you thats not really a forced era youre just throwing it to a guy and theyre Off to the Races and they do an excellent job generating offense with their defense and Corin as he goes to the line Malcolm you look out right now and the theme for Florida State having to play those freshmen a lot more minutes than coach Hammond intended to but you had four on the court at one time you see Chandler Jackson coming off as well as house and Deontay green and Coach Hamilton you know talked about look Im gonna have to this is just a new Norm for him right now uh and he knows hes going to have to rely on a lot of these young guys I think the biggest thing that he talked about the film session uh he has spent hours in the film room with these young guys and I got a good laugh at speaking this afternoon I remember freshman Year film doesnt lie and when you see yourself on film the things that youre not doing uh its good to see it obviously its humbling at times but he said these guys have improved through watching film of getting more educated in terms of what they want to do in this Florida State system inside Little Hook not gonna fall Worley long rebound Applause offensive foul on Jalen Worley yeah I mean double he got the arm out and thats right in front of the ref thats the easy one to call at first I thought it might have been a flop but now he definitely extended the arm and thank you Applause itll be interesting to monitor how worldly continues to develop maybe the purest of the ball handlers Florida state has oh foul on Mills on a threepoint shooter Music thats just something that drives coaches crazy right there again and they talk about it its things that they track uh coach Hamilton and staff they tracked their nine principles that they want to have on defense one of the things they talk about Closeouts uh hes the book you have to close out hands high and certainly you do not want to file a threepoint shooter it was interesting he got a question from one of the media members earlier this week on how do you quantitate and qualify energy and he said look Im not into philosophical Im into showing them the stats the numbers and we track it so they have something tangible that can kind of measure what that effort and energy is turning into and exactly uh what happened on that last play he went over Phils guys not closing out uh not uh talking and communicating on screens all those little things add up in games Applause Mills can get hot in a hurry career high 27 last season against Louisville Applause scoring is in his DNA as Florida State extends the lead to a tray Applause Gainey not gonna fall Cleveland another board Applause Music a foul on the floor on Upstate how about this pass well Upstate aggressive in the passing Lanes thats a great backdoor cut by Mills and the pass was on point certainly not an easy finish back to though that last possession again I think thats where they need to go again hes got a huge a size Advantage uh roll him to the post and then let him get down into Pace well as pure as they come Darren Greene Jr straight away bomb what do I know Let it Fly Away from the response guess who Applause hes having himself quite the evening Applause Music doing a quick strike attack Applause Music Applause McLeod might have got a hand on it but Smith reverse lay it Music Seminoles have made their last five from the floor Applause good ball movement open shot Cleveland will want that one back Music well its not a bad look I still say McLeod at times has had some pretty good position uh almost two feet in the paint I almost say you got to give him a touch but certainly youre not going to frown at that shot right there off of dribble Drive Cleveland whos been shooting the ball better thats a wide open look for three Applause Music ball put him on skates bayley The Freshman from Taylor South Carolina coach Dickerson called him a microwave Off the Bench and he gives him the green light as you can see why that step back my goodness oh they are so high on his potential Applause theyve hit their last three shots from the floor in Fork weve gone in this first half Knolls now have numbers if they want it Applause green three no Applause Applause thank you Applause Bailey not quite as close from that time but it break for Florida State though he was pretty open back though uh Mills in the paint thats better offense for Florida State not settling for a jumper Mills now with a with a short fader Cleveland rebound his fourth awkward call from a cloud thatll take us to an official timeout Justin Bailey highlight reel three bomb we love our new home theres so much space but we have ants its inspired expired expired its a lot of house I hope you can keep it clean at least Geico makes bundling our home and car insurance easy for bundling Made Easy Go to geicocom its bow time this holiday season put a bow on it with a big bow box for your family friends and neighbors because nothing says seasonings greetings like boldly seasoned chicken Fixins and bits Applause foreign foreign how about the run for USC Upstate over the last couple of minutes it started with their defense right now 10 points off a sixth Florida State turnovers and then this step back right here by the Freshman big time uh their energy has picked up uh its been a pretty balanced uh performance by them defensively theyve been solid and an offensively uh in transition theyve been really good how about some fam for redo gotta love it when your familys here and hes putting on a pretty good show they got shirts and everything I love it I love it the Floridian from Lake Wales was told by my producer Wyatt dossey thats 30 minutes from his hometown of Lakeland well he is giving them a show right now 13 points doing it on all three levels and Applause the energy has shifted in this one and I think the big thing of the turnovers uh continues to be a issue for Florida State and hold them also left some points at the line a foul on the floor itll be on house and some of the keys to the game from coach Dickerson were look we cant turn the ball over weve got to crash the old glass and then we probably have to hit 11 or 12 threes tonight he said when he looked back at the tape from some of the other mid Majors that knocked off Florida State they were very successful from Beyond The Arc absolutely and I think the turnovers is key you cannot uh play into the hands of Florida state that has been much better defensively Gainey not shy not gonna fall offensive rebound a second stick back pouring with the block and Cleveland with the clean this is where fsus at its best Cleveland goes down was looking for contacts and now we go the other way Euro Step finger roll its all as cool as you like from Nick house thats great body control to avoid the charge Applause uh you cannot do it any better right here and then this is just under control side step Euro Step and then finish body control on point thats beautiful transition offense you know and Nick owls also a Floridian from Melbourne with a transfer from Eastern Florida State and the Juco ranks Applause heres Jalen Worley tap the line sophomore from Pennsylvania coming out of high school a consensus top 40 recruit Michigan wanted them Virginia wanted them and if coach Juwan Howard and Tony Bennett want you theres something to you ended up picking Florida State on a live national Signing Day webcam feed and hes still learning how to play at this speed and playing at the tempo that Florida State wants to operate at and I think the biggest thing the adjustment had played more on the ball than moving Phillip Mills off the ball well its been an adjustment period for all these guys playing that point guard position Applause foreign Music Applause defense by upstate forcing Florida State late into the shot clock Applause turnover open court run out owl to the rack and hell go to the line but what Im noticing is uh USC upstates doing a great job keeping Florida State out of the paint theyre not allowing any dribble penetration and then they are being disruptive in the passing lanes theyve been active and right now thats uh Florida States eighth turnover and right now UFC Upstate already double digits and points off of those turnovers Applause Saturday on acc Network and the ESPN appar college basketball doubleheader starting to set one Eastern with Pitt hosting UNF keep an eye on that Oakland Zoo as itll be rocking and then Cornell takes the 50mile drive up Route 11 to square off against cuss the orange have won the last 41 games against the big red dating back to 1969 I know Applause how good is Jesse Edwards been for accuse this season its been an amazing transformation that hes just gotten better each year and certainly they need his production but Id say in line for one of the most improved players in the ACC Applause ENT a scramble on the floor timeout awarded to Upstate Florida State holding on to a onepoint lead early action here in tally has been offering savings for over 85 years thats longer than the buffalo wings been around lips are burning Geico over 85 years of savings and service its bow time some folks say dont call it a comeback but when the sizzling arriving for your Applause foreign Music some of the best music youll find in the ACC in the arena sorry Im a shooting Malcolm Huck could be our entire ACC Network crew here from tally and Upstate down just one against Florida State this is their third game against the ACC this season yeah theyre not going to be intimidated we just talked about that and I think the big thing excellent guard playing Ive been impressed with their backcourt in particular defensively uh theyre very active in the passing Lanes thats something that coach Hamilton and staff talked about uh when we met with them this afternoon and shoot around he said look were going to have to be very good with the ball because he knows the numbers dont lie again their last time out they had 31 points off of turnovers its become a bit of a defensive stretch Upstate just one for its last nine from the four Florida State going on nearly three minutes without a bucket Applause broadnax on the drive just comes away with it Applause Music pouring goes down away from the action the Seminoles will be at the line Music Applause now its been a physical game didnt see right here yeah yeah I mean again guys jocking fourth position uh right there certainly though you do not want to put a Florida state in the free throw situation right there horn has been a very good freethrow shooter for Florida State this season came in 84 percent but now just two or four from the line cam Corin told us earlier this week Ive got to be the energy guy and yeah its kind of baptism by fire for me but this is what I want this is what I expected when I got here and 15 points against Louisville on Saturday a comingout party for Mr corn huge and I think you said the key word energy uh mindset thats something coach Hamilton uh has preached with these guys in this last three game stretch a half the right mindset coming into these games Applause foreign take a look more at the Freshman from Allen Texas coach Hamilton said they were trying different spots for him at the four at the five but losing Jalen Gainey for the season the Knowles had to readjust it did and I think the biggest area where hes uh shown uh coach Hamilton said right there that last play coming over on help side defense understanding the rotation again thats film session understanding of where youre supposed to be at defensively they love his motor but back to the Boost that he gave them in that Louisville game I mean thats huge 15 points for him and uh theyre gonna be expecting and counting on more performances like that as they get deeper into ACC conference play Music Applause Shin thats really good defense from Florida state theyre bench really excited thats better closeout oh that time by Caleb builds remember the previous possession uh where he picked up a foul thats a nice contest and then coming up with the turnover thank you green POA J all the way down and out Applause quick strike three not gonna fall that was Mr Goodloe 20 points in his season debut against South Carolina State on Saturday Applause Applause Mills the blow by acrobatic attempts well go to the one and Mills has done this a couple times now been able to get aggressively down the lane and now finds himself at the freethrow line and rotation was late that time for upstate Hills really has so many moves in that bag and as he connects on his first flipping the script Sunday our womens basketball quadruple header starts at noon Eastern with wake and qs and then Louisville taking on Pitt at two a top 10 matchup between number five Notre Dame and number six Virginia Tech in Blacksburg and then eighth ranked NC State hosting Clemson to cap the night what a full day and evening of one of the best conferences in womens college basketball Music Applause the drive now a second chance for the Spartans active defense the buzzer not gonna go out of bounds itll stay with upstate Bob stays doing a nice job attacking the offensive glass and thats something coach Dickerson talked about they wanted to do see if they can create some opportunities in this first half theyve been aggressive attacking the offensive glass those are tough Malcolm you get your hand on the ball but your body follows yeah thats a tough break for Florida State and youre right I think its one of those things it seems like he got his hand on the ball first but certainly a lot of contact lets see all right both guys going for the ball yeah that angle right there Id say thats now again we have the luxury of Replay but from that angle right there didnt look like green I thought there was a collision it looked like the greens did not hit him as hard as I initially thought and thats just two guys going for the ball come on Dara green Jr one of the Veterans for Florida State this season front end of the does not fall for Gainey cam Boren said one of the guys thats been keeping us optimistic during this tough stretch has been Darren Green Jr as he handles the rock oh I just lost Focus out of bounds turnover one of the critical moments in basketball they say the last four minutes heading into the break and then the first four minutes coming out can decide so many games absolutely I think if youre a USC Upstate uh you want to get a good possession right now your Trail is five its some positive momentum going into the half and hes been quiet and a turnover Music Hills calls out the action Cross Court pass leads to an open three for Middle Applause nose by eight take a quick break Applause go down were going to take a look at Florida States best offensive of possession of the first half all set up Caleb Mills right here again now he may not get the original assist but that spaces the floor extra pass right here unselfish basketball you cannot ask for a better possession if youre Leonard Hamilton ball went left to right guys making extra passes and thats what you want to see to close out the half Applause so many teams practice that play Florida state does it every day in practice for Coach ham getting a Baseline Drive full court swing allowing for more ball movement thats something Florida state has struggled with at times offensively is that ball sticking thats the key word ball did not stick that time went left to right everybody got involved how about that defensive effort by The Freshman Jackson forces the turnover Gainey cant believe there was no whistle a lot of contact right here lets see oh yeah he got away on right there now again originally we thought it was uh that one right there a lot of contact though but again theyve been consistent to refs uh in this game and you got to play through that its been a physical game and certainly thats a big turnover for USC update oh straight away triple off to the left offensive rebound Cleveland leaner didnt get the front we found before it on the tippet Seminoles quickly extend the lead to 10 one final possession for Upstate its a good one Second Chance opportunities on the offensive glass right here again another break for USC Upstate but theyve been active thats been the mo in the first half theyve been crashing the offensive glass thats a big time offensive rebound putback yeah thats the ninth offensive rebound for Upstate in the first half good work from Surat The Freshman from Hometown Spartanburg South Carolina Mills with two now with one Mahi thats the Buzzard almost had it Florida State a late burst has them leading by seven we head to the studio Kelsey Riggs down Carlos Boozer hello Kelsey Florida State defended at a high level there to end the first half it had been almost six minutes before that and one almost a near turnover here Music Florida states third consecutive lead to break unselfish pass three and a three no Applause thats a good look coming out wide open Corner three then excellent ball movement uh by Florida State its been the second half Malcolm that we havent been accustomed to saying for Florida State theyve warned out in some of these second stanises yeah thats something coach Hamilton talked about he said look against Virginia and Purdue he just ran out of gas I mean we uh we fought uh really hard obviously a lot of guys coming back that have not practiced as much I think theyll be a big area for them they have to continue to improve sound like a broken record of their guard playing in particular uh the turnovers when they dont turn it over you see uh they put together some really good possessions just cant have the live ball turnover great recognition that time by Worley at McCloud I go up thats twice down in this game when theyve thrown it up to him he has not brought it down kept it up high and flushed it active hands Mills with the Steal will do it himself and Seminoles get a break as it was last touched by the Spartans itll stay with the Knowles well I found Florida State Im going back to this again he has a huge size Advantage just throw it up to him hes been getting pretty good post position uh they need to look for him a little more try to get some uh ball reversals and then get him down low in the block let him use his length and size they went right back to it same result Music they were listening and Ill tell you what though again thats just excellent recognition in offense a goto to match up uh that favors you right now McLeod against anybody uh for this USC Upstate is going to be an advantage Applause Worley Music ball rotation Cleveland lost it Applause foul on Mills Music speaking of those second halves Malcolm you were on the call for the Florida Gators comeback against Florida State they were down 17 at the half and had the lead by the 14minute mark of the second half well I think the emergence though of McLeod again he is a guy that has become a bigger postpresence before than that last game uh six blocks I think his post presence that wasnt there in that Florida game yeah Cleveland on the Finish Applause Gainey steps into a three long rebound of the Sparks Applause you see Deontay Green in for Cleveland Malcolm havent said Jordan gaineys name too often he did struggle against Duke and Cameron who just scored 28 on Saturday night well he was a focal point we set it right off the tip he was the guy of that they needed to focus on you said it 28 points in his last outing thus far Florida States done a nice job keeping him under control oh bottoms Darren Green Jr from way downtown and a timeout from USC Upstate Florida state has extended the lead respect or have you realized Applause face in America you only watch pool because of Jeanette Lee Jeanette is powerful on the table she will eat you alive in Black wants to kill the Black Widow Music I cant believe how she keeps getting up their body is quite fragile it makes the story better when you win 30 for 30 presents Jeanette Lee versus stream now on ESPN Malcolm Florida state has made it an emphasis to get it to the big man and he has delivered uh twice now hes kept the ball high not bringing it down and finishing Ive been impressed but when theyve gone to him how hes been able to show off the great hands and finish and uh Stan Jones uh his tutors I love speaking with Stan but you look at what he and Coach ham have done with the bigs Ill give these guys a lot of credit with the Player Development I think the biggest area that Ive seen and hes talked about it film session and then getting out on the court with these guys we were here at shoot around watching coach Jones work with the bigs they do a phenomenal job in that area developing these guys Im going to take you way back though coach ham I laughed I said these bigs now are a lot more mobile he had a guy that played for him when he was a coach at Miami Constantine Popa I said coach he was not out a 75 guy out there switching off all three Cloud Ive been impressed with his motility switching out on guards Applause Spartans have to get something up at the buzzer itll stay with the Spartans the activity from kaidaria Smith Rewards Upstate with the ball oh Florida state did everything correct on that closed out except a finish off the play with a defensive rebound but you can see in the second half theyve made it difficult theyre contesting all these USC Upstate jobs almost a five second violation Spartans able to get it in the pump the Euro the Finish not there Cleveland yet again rips down the board from the glass warley to the rack and one subtle thing but watch McCloud he clears out the space of four Worley and thats a beautiful pass by Cleveland little things Cleveland did not hold on to the ball too long gave it up to Worley and then the big fella McCloud uh cleared out a lane of Floyd Worley thats a beautiful transition offense all set up by their D again right here Cleveland give it up and then watch McLeod clear to space Beautiful Finish five Worley you cant run your transition offense any better a quick 70 run for Florida State we spoke of big men you had a chance to play with some good ones in your career spent the season with the Miami Heat whos the best big man you played with Ill tell you morning was probably the best but he was not hedging and switching out on guards back then they just blitzed trap tried to get the ball out of any guards hands but now these bigs are asked to do so much in Ball Street coverage its impressive Applause do you enjoy watching Joel embiid and his ability to cover guards I mean plays like a two guard as well too again just the mobility of these guys and speaking of mobility and uh progression Ive been a group impressed with uh Clevelands Improvement offensively uh he is shooting the ball at a high percentage we talked about it last four games over 50 from the floor foreign move from Amir Langley and the foul hell be at the line when we return lets talk about your

defense from Florida State uh theyve contested all of this shots uh theyve done a really nice job disrupting what he wants to do offensively and I think its a big reason why they have this lead right now shutting down their their top score Applause so Gainey will look to lead another comeback it was upstate that trailed in the second half against South Carolina State on Saturday the Florida state a different challenge its an FSU team 29 on the year looking for its first winning streak of the year Cleveland hang and hit and then its Corin causing chaos last deflected by a spark thatll stay with FSU but I like the change up though by Coach Dave Dickerson uh having that USC Upstate team pick up full see if they could try to force a turnover with their full court pressure trying to mix things up defensively give Florida State some different looks Worley was looking for the alleyoop recovers stays with it the push back no popping around last touched by a seminal a lot of contacts but again I think the key word uh consistency theyve been consistent and now you know as a player look youre going to have to play through uh some contact Music s working Cleveland kick out floater Corey cleans glass Applause Mills the heavy and couldnt hang and hit Applause thats a great block out uh by Upstate keeping the Florida state off the glass and a miss reverse layin staying with it Music Applause in transition Corey fouled Music the activity from cam foreign really puts himself into a lot of good situations as he progresses he could have he has the opportunity to be one of the better big men in the ACC its something they track uh coach Hamilton uh said look we have some things that we track that are tangible but one of the things uh help side that last possession set up by great help side defense and Recovery thats how you keep yourself on the court Corin misses the first I want to remind you the annual ACC huddle Bowl preview specialist tomorrow at 6 Eastern right here on acc Network in the ESPN app its Jordan cornette Eric McLane EJ Manuel and coach Mark richt taking a look at the nine ACC teams playing in a bowl game team breakdowns and comprehensive analysis like only the guys can provide the ACC has sent at least 19 Super Bowl every year since 2016 how about Florida State Mike Norvell nine win regular season has a chance for the doubledigit mark and thats best for college football Florida State back to where theyre used to being an outstanding season fans are excited about the number of guys returning the Seminoles next season ing Jordan Travis the Tippin by Langley Upstate inches closer hanging around well begin on the offensive glass something we talked about in that first half they did an excellent job of getting Second Chance opportunities the Spartans team that has played Clemson and the Gamecock to South Carolina tough as Greens tray ball wont fall Langley back door cut and a turnover as redo couldnt handle it Music this right here is something that has been impressive uh three guys going to help side there to block out is not there and as they continue to just aggressively attack the offensive last some different pressure being shown by the Spartans there game you called against the Gators for Florida State UF used trapping to their advantage in the second half and I think thats the adjustment uh see how Florida State adjusts to that they need to get somebody into the middle of the floor to release that pressure inside McCloud yeah house the step back triple oh it was all the way down and spit back out a foul on Langley will keep it with FSU and I like that offense by Florida State play through McLeod again hes showing off some pretty impressive passing skills thats a beautiful skip past that time out of the double team into post uh make it easy for yourself let the big fellow get some touches in the paint and then play from there green misses the runner and now a foul on house and a lot of pigs would not be able to make this pass right here he sees the double coming from the opposite side gets it out doesnt hold it too long thats a missed opportunity though but thats good offense by Florida State playing through McLeod Applause he approached the latter stages of this contest is that triple not gonna go and now Florida State and well have it Applause Seminoles leading by 13 looking for their second win in a row here in Tallahassee for Leonard Hamilton told us earlier this week that it has been a trying time for Florida State and you see on your screen Malcolm the adversity that has hit the Seminoles in the injury Department hello he will not use it as an excuse but certainly I mean thats uh pretty much of three guys that he was expecting to have in his rotation playing big minutes for them uh you can take your pick which one hurts I think you know obviously Gainey and Fletcher two guys uh that provide something to you that is a staple for Florida State and thats depth and now hes forced to play some younger guys extended minutes thats just not how they typically want to play but he knows look we have to Pivot and were going to go with what we have right here I think the biggest adjustment though is their energy and effort has picked up in these last three games a Florida State program who used to Pride itself traditionally on maybe not our best one through five will be better than your one through five but our six two threatened will definitely be better than the guys coming off your bench Mills couldnt finish there threading the needle langway you can count it and Ive been impressed with Langley not only on the offensive glass but running the floor what that does uh that makes uh the other bigs for Florida State have to run well with you that time hes rewarded by running uh with a nice bounce pass alleyoop McLeod doesnt bring it down Second Chance opportunity and Worley should be headed to the line in a second to Music Worleys got five in this one make it six weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now we need your help this winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video tag it with hashtag all the devotion and post it to your social you just might see it on accn foreign Music Applause Seminoles by 13 Music okay Im an alien if youre making a scifi movie you need to finish the special

neighbors because nothing says seasonings greetings like boldly seasoned chicken Fixins and biscuits tonight order a big bow box and spend less time in the kitchen its back in Tallahassee that was a quick time out there Malcolm how does Florida State go about trying to handle this pressure but it seems like Upstate has thrown upon them somebody in the middle of the floor I think thats the biggest thing when they trap you have to be solid but you have to have either a big or a wing in the center of the Court play from there and then uh defensively for them they cannot have any breakdowns uh you do not want to let Upstate get any open look from the threepoint line thus far in this game theyve done a good pretty good job defending the threepoint line Upstate was four of 16 make it four of 17 now save it to a teammate was Langley instead threw it to a player in gold now FSU in transition Cleveland McLeod on the foot back Music Applause nahim McLeod now with 10 and into double figures Music has come on for Florida state has the plate how about Mr Goodloe in the paint thats good patience that time by good load goodlow was injured in an exhibition game for Upstate earlier this season saw his first action of the year against the Bulldogs of South Carolina State on Saturday dropped 20 thats the line 12 times on that one Knowles have contained him this afternoon green three ball short now Bailey into the Open Court and the Spartans will run their half court offense Applause foreign Applause Music he is a guy that can make difficult shots that one right there contested not bad d uh thats a guy thats coming off the game where he put up 28 Applause Music Applause that was some old school wasnt it high off the glass agree a difficulty off the charts and again theyre still hanging around in this game 10 point game 9 46 to go and here comes the pressure Jackson will handle the Rock Music double team on Cleveland and leads to a turnover Seminoles had done a better job in the second half of protecting the basketball up until that point see it just two for each team Music the Spartans have another run in them Applause broadnax Applause defended by Mills drops it off the Finish not there Cleveland into the Open Court Matt Clevelands fourth career DoubleDouble with that board his second in his last three games hes one of the better rebounding guards in the country not just the ACC he does a great job especially on the defensive glass and thats a smart play for him not to force that fast break again understand time and score you got a 10point lead no need for you to force anything Applause foreign Music Applause Music Applause told us hes high energy its a kid thats used to winning one loss in his high school career and that Vince love that energy right there uh the Freshman getting after it on the offensive glass theres a turnover and Malcolm as we take another look at this coach Hamp said he reminds me of all the winning plays that Trent Forest used to make and thats a winning play right there again uh your team uh pushing it a back up to 12 in this game and getting on the offensive glass as freshmen uh thats what you want to do but thats what you dont want to do turn it over a leak out for the Spartans turns into a foul on Mills Applause Justin Bailey Applause his third foul by the way for Caleb Mills well the one thing that USC Upstate does a really good job of make turnover or a Miss they do a good job in their transition offense they get the ball up quick and they are trying to strike quick if they get a turnover Applause because he makes the free throw bayley began the season with three straight double figure scoring performances 15 on the road and Cameron at Duke thats something they want to do is play in transition they look at yalls numbers right there thats just unbelievable right there well one of the better teams in the Big South and forcing you uh into turnovers and then they do a good job defending the threepoint line as well too Ive been impressed on their closeouts Music sharpshooter oh there goes the announcer Jakes guess what I praised them for their Closeouts guy flies right by greed and he steps to the side and buries a three response not there another offensive rebound for the Spartans but active hands from Morley Mills the show The Drive kick green pullup J en yes friendly Shooters touch well those are the plays uh coach Hamilton talked about Mills uh and also green turn down jumpers uh deeper contested threes and turned them into a higher percentage shots thats excellent offense and unselfish Play All Around uh by Florida State Music come on oh a bomb Applause redo how about it Applause ties his career high with 16 and thats all set up Florida State win youre gonna switch if you dont come shoulder to shoulder together uh on that situation right there especially on the shooter like Riddell whos been on fire hes going to make you pay right here though Floridas still still up uh

the difference in this one turnovers Florida state had 10 turnovers in the first half theyve only had two in the second its as simple as that thats something that has been a theme for them throughout this season that really has hurt them hard to win games when you have turnovers and youre giving up points off the turnovers uh your big reason why they have this lead in the second half theyve taken care of the ball and gotten high percentage shots Florida State during Thanksgiving went down to that ESPN Invitational and they really struggled to protect the basketball lost all three games and thats something coach ham was talking to us about was Finding guys who could handle the rock for them getting Chandler Jackson back fully healthy should pay off for the nulls Ive been impressed with the backboard play of Florida State theyve done a nice job in particular in the second half Music Cleveland looks for help to the Freshman house Noels got to get something up in a hurry a ball on the aggressive drive from Green this is a nice hard drive right here for winding down Upstate trying to contest at The Rim because that drive coach is crazy 29 seconds of great defense and one second left on the shot clock you get a foul they are ready to jump through the roof I can tell you from personal experience that is something that will drive a coach crazy you do everything right on the defensive possession and then you bail him out at the end with a foul shot clock winding down foreign having quietly a nice night now with 15 LED UCF and scoring last season transferred to Florida State and has been a really nice addition to this FSU Squad Applause a career 45 threepoint shooter Darren Green floater Frito has had himself quite the evening whats up all right we talked about his

strength he just continues to get better we talked about his last four games uh 15 points a game shooting over 50 percent from the floor the decision making I think uh overall Court awareness and his decisions uh that hes making uh really have been impressive coach Hamilton called him a warrior and Cleveland to us earlier this week over the phone said Ive got to be one of the guys whos more vocal as a leader we dont have a whole lot in that department and Ive got to grow up a little bit more quickly theres a foul on corin will send good load of the line excuse me check that Bailey The Freshman from Taylor South Carolina Ive been impressed with this freshman Bailey they found a good one again he has got great size does it look like a freshman a good strength a great footwork coming off screens and then the ability to get into the paint he is going to be a really nice player for this USC Upstate team and in the Big South coach Dickerson was really excited when they were able to get him to come to Spartanburg he said hes one of the best players in High School in South Carolina one estate title over at Blue Ridge High Applause Music Cross Court pass green a step back too long Music actually enjoy uh that a transition right there Bailey with a huge rebound and then the ability to push thats a beautiful play by The Freshman to set up his teammate after a rebound thank you Cleveland onehand Runner no and now the Spartans have hit each of their last three shots an illegal screen on enjoy Justin Baileys uh the Freshman uh for USC upset you can see why coach Dickerson its bad are so high on this young man thats a huge rebound right there and then the court awareness a lot of guys would have given that up too early to the big he waited to the last second saw that Mills was behind and then throws a nice lob pass for a finish Applause Holts trying to close out the Spartans Music Mills leaning off the glass Corin put back yes Music hes into double figures the Freshman

State aiming to get win number three on the Year by the way Malcolm Seminoles the first time all year with five players in double figures the ball movement the ball movement has been really good uh throughout this game Im gonna go back to the earlier comment we talked about it throughout this game coach Hamilton has really been tired of talking about it with his guys but he knows its so key the turnovers they only still have only two turnovers in the second half and theyve had some really good offensive possessions where the ball has not stuck with one person or on one side of the Court foreign Applause tough evening I should say getting tougher for gaining in part give credit uh to this Florida State uh backcourt uh theyve done a nice job they knew he was their key guy and they wore them out I mean hes missed some open opportunities I think a lot of it has to do with fatigue theyve been really physical with them foreign Music Cleveland after the turnover Applause Music its Clevelands second foul Andy Spartans will be shooting on the other end and its one thing to turn it over uh but then its another thing to file put them on the free throw line give them a chance two freebies but more importantly to set up now their full court pressure Applause Music Applause and he converts on the front end Music right here averaged 18 a contest coming in Big South player of the week last week has already accumulated eight Conference of the week honors in his career what a freshman year he had as well too last year Big South freshman of the year again Im going to say it again hes one of the better mid major guards in the country really impressive on that Lou Henson award watch list giving each year to the top player in the mid majors Applause keep an eye out for Mr Jordan Caney we approached the threeminute mark Applause Worley pretty move Applause could not hit so theres the stop for the Spartans how can they score straight away triple in and out Applause offensive rebound Applause Music stepping out of bounds before he went down was Justin Bailey Applause critical turnover for upstate Applause Florida States got a battle awaiting them in Sunrise on Saturday St Johns that would be the Orange Bowl classic Applause theyre hoping they have a twogame win streak when they head down to Sunny South Florida Applause ball ripped out of bounds itll stay with FSU well both these teams its impressive how they just get the flexes theyre really active on dribble drives or passes with their arms foreign Applause Music thats a beautiful out of bounds underneath that time nice little run screen for McLeods great Hands by the big fella again Applause all right Applause oh baby Matt Cleveland the hammer Applause oh you can feel the vibrations on media row well his first step and then his length and explodes to this on display right here my goodness head into rim split the Defenders and thats just a big time athlete going and making a play at The Rim Music almost Applause I tell you what you turn on a Matt Cleveland High School tape on YouTube its 10 minutes of dunks like that back in his days at Pace Academy and the thing that coach Hamilton when we talked to him about Matt Cleveland he said look uh he is just uh his basketball IQ is off the charts he said I love how he thinks the game uh he understands uh a really good understanding and feel for what hes done I think the biggest Improvement hes made is on his shot uh he has worked on that every game Ive called for Florida State he is out here consistently hour before the game working on his jumper and again Malcolm for Florida State theyve tried to reset their season winning one game at a time focus on the opponent at hand this is going to start sending some good feelings into that locker room having a win streak Music Applause theres the icing on the cake Tommy house from three thats all set up again Caleb bills thats a beautiful dribble drive and kick to seal this game with a three by house foreign they call Tom house Young Jack Harlow I think its more how he looks and then how he wraps but I havent confirmed yet uh Im gonna let you do a little uh research on that one but I can tell you right now this is a big time play by Caleb bills and of the Finish look USC Upstate uh theyre gonna come up a little short uh if your coach Dickerson you have to be pleased with how your team kind of battled in the second half they hung around oh theyre going to be a tough out in the Big South uh really impressed with the pieces that they have in particular their freshman guard Justin Bailey was big you know a gaining hes going to be one of the better players in the Big South but on the other side for Florida State Im gonna tell you right now uh the team that I saw play against Florida was not the team that I saw play tonight and uh their last three games the win versus Louisville impressive but Im gonna go back to the Purdue and Virginia game two teams that potentially are going to be teams that are going to be going on Long NCAA tournament runs I would not want to see this Florida State team up quick and they still have great lake and they still have some guys that can do that right there finish with authority Jalen Worley wanted to get into the ACT Applause doing damage to the rim now the Knowles have the green vipers in two games in a row the Seminoles have had the green squad and the walkon get to come on to the court to finish a game and Coach him talks about it and we saw them running the scout team offense oh those guys do everything they do all the film stuff sessions they do all the practices but then they got to get here early and learn to scout offense as well too coacham says anytime I can get those guys on the court uh its a good thing and reward them for all the hard work that they put in Music hows Florida State build office if youre in that locker room three things that stood out to me tonight energy and then the ball movement the ball movement uh was excellent Ive not seen Florida State uh move the ball like this in quite some time and then Im going to go back to the third theme and again I sound like a broken record when they dont turn the ball over uh theyre a very good team McLeod uh played really well for them as well too it comes down to their energy and then their backcourt play they cant turn the ball over if they do those things theyre going to be able to compete and play with anybody in the ACC Leonard Hamilton said it were not going to make excuses were not going to throw ourselves a pity party and Florida state is the final few seconds well take off this clock couldnt get a shot off at the buzzer for Music schools now have a winning streak 8063 Florida State flexes its muscles in the second half impressive second half ball movement of the defensive pressure I think it was uh sums up five players in double digits for Florida State
