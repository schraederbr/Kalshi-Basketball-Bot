Donnie Jones begins his fourth season at Stetson contract extension announced last December and theres Leonard Hamilton youre 21 what a job he has done transforming this program 17 straight winning seasons as they embark on this new campaign national championship game 21 weeks from now and here we go Seminoles Hatters for the 54th time Florida state has won the last 18 meetings between these two Sunshine State schools how long does it take first game of the season to get the nerves out of the system Terence well usually until the first media timeout then everybody calms down but I thought it was interesting to start out this game Caleb Mills number four calling the ball hes more of a scoring guard Evan theyre starting him out at the point guard core state has a lead linked we know that can he be the facilitator that the Seminoles need him to be a cloud missed the 15footer in the opening possession knocked away Cleveland doing what he does coming up with a loose ball and the jump ball possession arrow will keep it with Stetson one thing that cant happen you come off and you catch a handoff Florida States going to jam the handoff switch it hard you got to take care of the basketball if there was a band Zone be ready for that pressure to come back after Cleveland six foot seven sophomore from Atlanta was a top 20 player coming out of high school the McDonalds AllAmerican he is he has that kind of talent needs to shoot it better this season for the Seminoles to be better he was over oh for nine in the exhibition game not sure what that conversation was its Ron gruver Jamil Spearman and Isaac Barnett the three officials presiding over this opener tonight Applause battle for the board won by the Stetson Hatters big man Josh Smith second try and the possession is down for Alvin Tomlin and threenothing Hatters two for a dollar youre going to see Stetson extend their pressure out try to slow down the tempo of Florida State make them run some half court offense but you cant give up offensive rebounds Florida State you got that big 74 player in the paint you got to clean it up and get out and run first personal foul on Swenson they call it him in the bottom of the backcourt but his first assist of the night sets up the opening points and this is what Swenson can do he gets into that painted area makes the defense collapse and tumbling nice follow through on the three on house inbounds freshman in the starting lineup for Leonard Hamilton and that ball deflected out of bounds last Touch by Cleveland in the corner Seminoles turn it over something they did too many times for Leonard Hamiltons liking in their exhibition game closer than maybe we want victory over Newberry 7466 they had 18 turnovers in that one six days ago Music Applause you think about Florida State you think about defensive length switching but the kick out to the open man Smith missed again but another offensive rebound Blackman reloads one for four so far the Hatters from Deep theyre getting into paint at well Florida States going to switch everything and sometimes thats going to put McLeod out on an island to stay in front a little out of control Swenson the other way Stetson playing really free right now passes are going a little bit too easily and Swenson just crafty off the bounce excellent pass and you have driving legs tumbling to the bucket and foul thats just a big time move Evan tumbling ball fake lefthand drive and attack the big fella seven foot four it doesnt matter if you drive with purpose but Swenson getting in excellent Vision both fake get to the cup big fella and he McLeod just a little bit too late on the help side and thatll be hand one how about Swenson drawing three Defenders to the Baseline and it was good defense from a rotation perspective but Swenson able to look off the defense by the open Lane first foul on nahim McLeod five nothing Hatters after a Miss free throw Cleveland gets it to go and thats got to feel good for the sophomore sometimes it just takes one made bucket to get guys in Rhythm or the states showing a little bit of pressure here early full court typically a mantoman full court pressure team but Cleveland stepping out trying to slow down the tempo Music you go see a lot of ball screen action Evan look Florida State switches one through five and those are going to be the results everything coming from the outside except for the one drive that last trip Hatters now one of five from Deep Aaron Greene Jr the transfer from UCF will play his old school this coming Friday night getting his first start for Florida State as McLeod misses too strong off the glass gets it back and draws the foul on Smith nice move just has to finish everything out well we have a moment lets take a look at our Ford keys to the game what you got Terence if youre Florida State youre trying to set the tempo for the rest of the season this Stetson team has an excellent point guarding Swenson if youre able to pressure him out those rotations have to be good got to be better on that end if your stats you have to take care of the ball this team really struck struggled with turnovers a season to go and thats really tough to go against a seminal team that thrives off live ball turnovers Donnie Jones talked about it before the game with us Evan they take care of the ball thats going to give them a chance to be in this game later oh for two for McLeod at the line Music Applause first sub of the game is the steps in Hatter Albany is in corner three wont go for panzo and itll be Florida State basketball when Stetson gets that ball in a painted area its going to be really difficult to to get out on some of these threepoint shooter Swenson is a load to handle and on the other end Stetson on dead balls theyre going back into a matchup Zone theyre switching up their defenses as Swenson comes out of the game a little TV timeout substitution there get him a quick breather but theyre switching up pressures trying to slow the tempo down off of makes and dead balls on misses theyre going back to mantoman and as a Florida State team in the middle is running your point guard position youre gonna have to take care of the ball at least get a shot on every possession sincere Harrison the backup point guard for Stetson replacing Swenson in the Mills a little teardrop and thats what he can do an unorthodox score I talked to assistant coach Steve Smith before the game one of the most unorthodox scores hes ever coached long strides crafty floaters little fade aways from 10 feet he just finds multiple ways to get it done its like you and your Heyday excels at making tough shots yeah but he dribbles a lot more than that thats fair thats fair Applause Harrison Aaron pass taken away Cameron Cora and the Freshman to the basket how about Cameron Warren custom Sunrise Christian Academy Im kid plays with Grady dick in Kansas Mark Mitchell who went to Duke he didnt score a whole lot but he has that ability at 610 to get a steal and take off and initiate the break himself Big Time finish away from the ball fouls going on Darren Greene Jr different guys can do it for Florida safe and how about Corey he takes off and he can handle it himself Little Euro Step In the finish for his first the well outfitted Seminole fans ready for basketball and you will not know his true identity by the end of the night Florida State its interesting Leonard Hamilton says they have five veterans and Veterans is in quotes because theyre all second year veterans it doesnt have a third year scholarship player on this team Terence he likes the talent but its young and inexperienced how quickly can they congeal as a team I think thats the big question how many guys are they going to have to step up into that leadership role with with a few injuries to start out the year and the stats and Hatters look this is a program that has not had a winning season since 2000 and 2001 you contrast that Florida States 17th consecutive winning seasons the Donnie Jones has a track record and he likes his players its a building block game tonight this is Stetson program that travels to Dublin Ireland later this month for a pair of games before Thanksgiving tend to shoot out of the timeout Stetson scored in the first five Florida state has the last six and Mills has the steal mills all the way wow what an athletic finish a two on one situation the Stenson Defender taking a little bit too long to come over excellent finish Connie was going to lob it to Cleveland but he took it himself but Harrison kicks it to the corner three is nothing but net for wesa panzo it was a panzo was a nice player for Stetson why because hes 67 he can handle the ball a little bit he does a little bit of everything for stat Center but thats what the type of shot that Florida State likes get your guys sped up quick shots in the Hat or in the full court and then you can get out to run and do what you do best hands are 39 from Beyond The Arc a season ago snaps the 80 Run ties it up eight all Cameron Fletcher answers for Florida State and I got off the phone with Cam Fletcher the other day he said man Im really working on my outside shot its something I can develop and with The Playmakers we have on our team Im going to have opportunities just like that one for the from the 45 hes the third returning score for the team behind Mills in Cleveland panzo from the other side the same result for the Hatters and he doesnt get much elevation but that stroke is smooth and it continues to be the same thing for Stetson if they get in that painted area the defense is collapsing we have a stoppage in play maybe some blood sincere Harrison getting patched up by the Stetson athletic trainer and sincere here I mean he is a freshman that Donny Jones is really excited about a really good athlete played for team Charlotte during his AAU season brings a tenacity to the game and was a panzo from Canada can really shoot the basketball is really versatile in his offensive skill set Donnie said I dont know if he can dunk the basketball but he does everything else for you he can play point guard he can also a play center sometimes at six seven for this Stetson team and Harrison getting patched up hes the backup point guard bring Swenson the starter back in it was a nice creation though by Harrison to set up that three Corin lost it and his first turnover of his career puts him back in he really kicked up his scoring late last season averaged about 11 per game over the final month throughout his season average up to seven points per game but the five assists per game for Swenson bread and butter seven to shoot Alex Oglesby no relation to my partner and thats a good thing because he just got swatted by Caleb Mills and thats the length of Florida State and now theyre off to the run and then you can do what you do best as you see Jalen Worley bringing the ball up number one has the potential to be a breakout player for Florida State this season and what a finish almost by Caleb Mills almost is the key word there tip would not go either Swenson finds himself open around and up rebound Track by Fletcher and Fletchers looking a push like a freight train coast to coast and he draws the foul and Fletchers got such a big body when he gets going downhill like that hes a load because of that size in athleticism a Kentucky transfer he can get it Florida state has so many guys that can get out and push the pace on their own tough move nice left hand almost an in one but that shows the lineup versatility for Leonard Hamilton having so many different guys that can initiate office when youre coming off the season scoring seven he wins a game like Fletcher is and you know theres offensive opportunities theyre in number as a player that you kind of have in mind Id like to get to this 10 11 12 again and I addressed this with him when I spoke to him last Friday but Leonard Hamilton has got it in his head that its not about me those things are going to happen on their own theyre going to happen organically the pleasure he certainly has a talent it was a highly recreated recruit coming out of high school didnt really fit into what Kentucky did he has found a home here in Tallahassee Kyle was on Alec Oglesby and one of two at the line one point lead for Florida State good ball movement pretty good defense though from Florida State everything but the rebound to secure this trip down the floor and I just continue to be impressed by Swenson and his ability to get where he wants to go off the dribble its kind of a herkyjerk game right Evan he gets it to the Lane hes patient he doesnt lose his dribble too early and hes been finding guys pretty consistently so far against a really tough defense assault on Applause the it might have been a delay of game warning on the Florida state pinch Music stoic 74 year old Leonard Hamilton looking on Applause changes speeds really nicely heres Brown rising up off the mark rebound pulled down by Fletcher Jalen Worley a little out of control and foreign draws contact on the second chance in those early season Jitters are still going right now Evan that should have been a pass quick to the trailing Darren Green Jr whos an excellent shooter transfer from Central Florida but theyre still kind of figuring themselves out but Cameron corn has been pretty good early sure has he brought energy brought toughness its exactly what the coaches have expected from him freshman from Allen Texas but played at Sunrise Christian last year in Wichita he misses the first well pause for a quick word from works meet Works Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by powershare batteries to give you the power to outperform a little bit with the injury to Jalen Gainey and also the suspension to Baba Miller the very Uber talented freshman from Spain who got ding 16 games for reasons passing understanding in this day and age well talk about that more in a bit Brown on the attack sets up the Wesleyan transfer and Sam Peak misses his first shot as a Stetson Hatter but another offensive Rebound in the reload from Brown is down Luke Brown is a big was a big time scoring he gets the steal back scored over 3 000 points in high school draws the foul he was a big time he was a big time scorer at the high school level transfers back to Stetson from Ball State Luke Brown can really fill it up one of the three Indiana natives on this Dixon team and the Hatters hanging with the Seminoles early here the warm November Monday here in Tallahassee 1412 Stetson leads Florida State we miss Baba that is a common sentiment in these parts right now the highly touted freshman from Mallorca it was kind of a shocking suspension to hear about it Terence I know you have some strong thoughts well I mean its tough on the kid he comes over from Spain hes excited to be part of Florida State hes suspended for 16 games for travel benefits to go to training camp with Real Madrid and in everything thats happening Evan in the world of college basketball right now were gonna get upset at a kid for going to practice let this kid play he doesnt deserve 16 games in my opinion but he doesnt deserve any games he should be playing tonight hes one of those guys for Florida State he could have been the next draft pick the next lottery pick seven foot really skilled can handle the ball in transition really good passer capable shooter hes that next guy and its really a shame that we dont get to see him tonight and he still might be that next draft pick just to be clear but I thought Leonard Hamilton made a really good point in his conversation with the local media a few days ago saying that if were gonna hold someone accountable there needs to be more effort into educating the international kids into what they can and cannot do as Luke Brown knocks down another three its the fifth made threepointer of the opening nine minutes for the visitors from DeLand Florida Luke Browns going to get a lot of easy looks this year playing with Swenson and he is a high level shooter ties of 13 from three theyre one for three from Two and theres a triple to answer at the other end Tom house Tom house they have raved about his ability to shoot the basketball and its six foot six six foot seven thats really going to space things out he fits that Florida State profile with him in the starting lineup with Darren Green Jr in the starting lineup that four should open up for this season heat on the drive across contacts and uh Cameron Fletcher a little shaken up as he gets called for the foul and this was a big time pass by Swenson getting in the teeth of the defense Fanning out to an open ground hell knock it down and then coming right back at you Tom House 6667 Centerville Ohio nice follow through and the knock down Tom house a 40 threepoint shooter in high school and heres Sam Peake this guys interesting yes he is this guys interesting a division three first team AllAmerican transfers down to Stetson theres been a few guys move up a few levels or at one level maybe not two levels thats pretty big jump the obvious comparison of course is Duncan Robinson who started his college career playing division three balls and he went to the Big Ten and to the NBA finals he can be anything like Duncan Robinson I think Stetson would be plenty Clues one for two at the line for Sam Peake played three years at Wesleyan Baron green Jr missed it follows his shot keeps it alive and then its picked off by Peak Oglesby rise and Fire oglesbys failed to hit the rim so far this game but theyve had a couple of good looks you take that personally Terence well theres no blood relation there but he isnt doing the Oglesby name too much good theres still time theres still time its a long night and a long season Florida State right now struggling from the floor the trail by three its in one 11 ball game games possession alive again Brown from DeLand knocks it in theres no hesitation with this young man what is that three and if he doesnt hit the first one it comes back its going up this kid has no conscience Luke Downtown Brown he averaged three points a game for a 1417 Ball State Cardinals team a year ago but hes always been a big factor averaged 27 a game his freshman year in high school and never less than 30 the other three years striving on Brown missed it gonna stay here though on Stetson on the rebound action if you dont the first one you can get a hold of the second one a little bit Long offensive rebound Im shocked the Florida States not taking care of the boards but for a dollar for my man to look Brown and he knocks down that second one cant give him too many good looks thats uh six assists on seven buckets for the Hatters and they beat it resulted from offensive rebounds or guys getting in the lane and then Fanning out theres not a whole lot going on around the rim this is how you can get beat if youre Florida State allowing so many threes are you surprised by how the stats and point guards have gotten the pain against the Florida State Defense well Stefan Swenson hes a guy who has done that with consistency throughout his college career but getting in there so easily and drawing help is a little bit of shocking because of Florida States ample but he is so crafty with the basketball its been shocking to watch so far and then sincere Harrison The Freshman Donnie Jones Raves about his athleticism and his quickness hes somebody to keep an eye out too but getting into the lanes a big point of emphasis for steps its the moment youve all been waiting for the the first replay review of the season Al spearmans coming over to let Terence know looks like theyre trying to check and see for a hook and hold obviously that would be a flagrant found flagrant and a free throw and the ball back Music right side of the screen McLeod and garerezi battling whatd you see and I think that that plays right into it you cant grab the arms down now did he hook him I guess by definition no but youre grabbing the front and all his weight is going forward they might get hit with that common foul common foul thats one thing you got to love about college basketball the endless reviews Music they want to get it right and they got that pretty quickly really the decision to look at it took longer than looking at it Well Ron Gruber is my man one of the officials and they do an excellent job you can say it a little bit facetiously like I did but ACC officials are the best there is fun to see these officials before the game good to say hello and opening night for them as well Florida State just turn it over on the inbounds pass fourth seminal turnover as the opening 11 minutes Hatters by six with the basketball sincere Harrison got patched up back in the game and play some Swenson Music Luke Brown feeling it knocks in another Luke Brown is showing up and showing out doesnt take him a whole lot of space hes not that big what about 6162 but he gets his feet set so quickly and that releases quick excellent job by the point guards getting Guys open Cleveland a little out of control comes up empty on the runner Seminoles on the ropes a little bit right now brown dagger Luke Brown its come ready to play and Florida State will get a timeout Luke Brown is back and ready to go for the Hatters hes got 15 first half points in his Stetson debut Luke Brown and its all off the ball he gets his feet set really quick balls in the shot pocket and then he comes up and why not thats way past the NBA range look Browns here to play hes waiting for the simple shot always moving off the ball and that follow through is sweet look at the rotation on this jump shot just one after another and how about the recognition from his teammates they know where to find the shooter quick speed sets up shoulders forward ready to fire as hes progressed hes gotten deeper and deeper with each ensuing attempt well its his teammates do finding him sincere Harrison coming down on the break and finding him from behind how about that coming out ready to play Luke Brown is our partys start to watch you mentioned his high school prowess over 3 000 points Blackford High School out of Carmel Indiana but played sparingly last year for Ball State 12 minutes a game in 18 games he never made more than two threes in any game last year hes got five threes in less than 12 minutes of game time tonight he didnt even start he is tied Florida State by himself points for him 15 for Florida state that is a wise point and if youre a seminal fan of demoralizing one Music Ball State wishes they had him back good defensive possession uncharacteristically sloppy with the basketball and brown condition two its slammed home by Josh Smith 14point lead for Stetson and really this game so far Heaven has come down to shot quality Florida State doesnt seem to get any good looks they get in they take contested twos while Stetson on the other end theyre getting in and theyre creating easy opportunities for each other and then whenever theyre able to create live ball turnovers this is Florida States job Evan they can get out and run how about the flush from a man Smith well theres a couple questions right now for this Florida State team I mean one whos going to take charge and is it going to be a big time scorer or a point guard I mean theres no Raekwon Evans theres no MJ Walker theres no Trent Forest theres I mean we can mention all the great players that have been here the last five ten years this is a young inexperienced team Leonard Hamilton has talked a lot about that and now its time to see who will step up well it comes back to your question whos their point guard Kayla Mills is more so more so a score whos going to create easy looks for their teammates thats what it comes down to you would think Jalen Worley could be that guy but he hasnt seen the floral generals havent helped themselves from the line either theyre two for eight theres good hands but its going to stay here Leonard Hamilton cannot believe the call he thought Mills had this deal and then Stetson reached in but Isaac Barnett saw it the other way Kayla Mills cutting off the dribble a little bit too handsy on the drive knows it sincere Harris likes to get to his right or to his left hand excuse me he puts it right in front of him I thought Harrison was the one who grabbed it now Im with you the First on Mills and you mentioned Jalen Worley he did not play six nights ago in Florida States exhibition against Newberry hes been referred to as The Heir Apparent at point guard for Leonard Hamiltons team so hes only played a few minutes so far Luke Brown gets to the bucket are you kidding me well what happens you hit a bunch of Threes And The Help sides scared to come over thats an excellent move by Luke Brown he does it outside he can do it inside too especially when that help is scared to come over hes hit time threes he has addition transition leading the break he just drove and scored and theres another stop Blackman leading the charge out Music Stetson is pulling a Florida State on Florida State theyre creating turnovers and theyre getting out in transition this for this Florida State team needs to wake up in a hurry Matthew Cleveland picks his house foul shooting the three by Sam Peake and youll see right here on the screen Luke Brown because theyre hitting so many shots theyre scared to come over look at this drive help side comes over a little bit late hes got to be there helps late theyre a little scared of the threepoint shot and thats what happens and then of course when you get out in transition you struggle to match up anyway and everybody for Stetson right now is knocking down shots its a 171 run was 1715 not all that long ago the 10 minute Mark of the half Tom house has three free throws he just got roasted defensively at the other end so hes trying to pick it up here at the offensive end the Seminoles only made two of their first eight house knocks down his first two hes the son of coaches Tom house his mom was a volleyball coach Music basketball coach College in the WNBA three free throws for house hes got six points he gets the Seminoles back within 15 that wasnt a phrase I expected to use tonight I didnt expect it either back within 15 the Stetson team take towards the bottom of the Asun conference giving Ford State all they can handle right now with the shopping Luke Brown going to work on Corinth did he step on the end line no double dribble is the call well Im not sure about that one I thought he had a nice hesitation move but might have picked it up before a carry he gets downhill little hesitation pauses a little bit of a carry Im not sure it was a double triple though Evan just the third steps in a turnover Seminoles one for their last nine tipped up and in though by Fletcher and thats what Florida States going to have to do to get back into this ball game I never thought Id be saying that Evan impose your will physically you have the size you have the athletic system attack the glass stay in front defensively use that athleticism to get back in this ball guys Second Chance points or nine zip before that Florida State put back and theres another turnover on consecutive possessions for the Hatters and thats Stetson theyre not running a ton of offense what theyre doing is theyre just breaking their man down off the dribble and theyre making the extra pass its very simple Florida state has to keep them out of the paint the more they do that the more they run into turnovers and they can get either get out and run or just create extra possessions Music what do you think Leonard Hamilton is contemplating right now I dont know but I would never feel comfortable with that scalp and I didnt play a whole lot of Defense anyway Evan I cant imagine what he would have looked at music he had you on The Scouting Report for a time from the corner Fletcher tipped up no good but a foul But there again thats Matthew Cleveland making an easy shot for a teammate Cameron Fletcher Cleveland the ball in the middle of the Zone Stetson is doing some matchup defenses gets the ball in the middle finds the shooter on the opposite side good play recognition opposite corner cam Fletcher needs to knock that down Matthew Cleveland shot 17 from three last season he feels like hes going to be able to improve that but what makes him such a unique Prospect of it is defensively his playmaking ability like that pass somebody who could take a step towards being a potential allconference selection come March Matt Cleveland just turned 20 in September Seminole is on a 70 run to cut it to 11 Music Applause Music the question tonight might be can the Seminoles impose their will defensively they havent done it yet stopped the last couple of trips Tumblin kicks it out for panzo a shoot here for Stetson into the hands of the junior point guard from Brussels panzo deep three got it and I was about to say thats a great defensive possession by Florida State but it doesnt matter if theyre able to shoot over the top was a panzo Luke Browns not the only person who showed up ready to play was a panzo hes hit some big threes as well would you believe ten first half threes for Stetson and theres still five minutes to play in the half Corinth for two that is a big time move going to the middle Kim coren an excellent player in his own right really athletic did Swenson just pick up his second foul who do they call that on in the backboard I dont know but Camp Corin Big Time move going to the middle six foot ten good athleticism beg your pardon it was on Fletcher so its Fletchers second for Florida State excuse me Fletchers gonna head to the bench house back in oh green Worley Cleveland house and tour in the five on the floor from Florida State Florida State mixing up a little 221 pressure back into man hoping to get early looks sometimes thats good to very up the game a little bit of a change of pace but then you get put on the wrong side as a big time move by Blackman not able to finish in Florida States Off to the Races house making his Collegiate debut and a foul on tumbling thats a big time pass by corn and whos going to make shots whos going to get shots for teammates for Florida State corresented a little bit theyre doing it by committing nice cut by Worley his man turns his head he cuts right off his back and hes able to draw the foul you have to create easy looks when you dont have a pure point guard on the roster like Stetson does you have to do it by committee nice pass by corn Cleveland a little bit earlier thats how youre going to get back in off ball movement and good passes Music Applause coming up in our Toyota halftime report we will look ahead to the second game of our doubleheader tonight the Virginia Cavaliers trying to do something they couldnt do last year which is win on opening night they lost to the Naval Academy a season ago they got NC Central tonight 13 ACC teams in action on this opening Monday hundreds of basketball games across the country today it is fun to just look at the scoreboard and scroll theres always going to be upsets on opening night theres theres upsets every year you never know where Lightnings gonna strike tumbling gets his own Miss lost it Rican chase out for Brown another offensive rebound I mean there hasnt been a ton of them but it seems like they come at pivotal points during the game Evan and well the whistle saves Stetson a live ball turnover but despite these past few turnovers it has been a tremendous start to the season for the Stetson Hatters theyre 50 percent from three theyve made it from deep and they have an 11 Point first half lead over the seminals out of the ACC and they havent been overly complicated sets stetsons getting into the paint theyre pitching out theyre doing a nice job finding each other and then you get into the paint you find the shooter in the quarter help comes thats an excellent play by sincere Harrison and then what happens theyre late coming over because theyre scared about the threepoint shot so youre able to find some easier opportunities a lot of teams like to go inside out first stetsons gone outside in knocked down some shots then Delane opens up wide open and Luke Browns able to capitalize its been a good game plan its been executed well and it has discombobulated the Florida State Defense a good bit it has and its its discombobulated but its been very simple actions thats just getting downhill by the way the Stetson basketball record for most threes in a game by a single player is eight Luke Brown Its a danger yeah its in Danger tonight especially if he keeps it up Music the guy that Leonard Hamilton would love to see get going green on the drive gets his first bucket that was a great move you come off the ball switches sides of the floor and then youre able to attack a pick and roll Darren Green Jr he can do that his first points as a seminal scored 949 points in three years at UCF now its the bigger Corin on Brown badgering him on the perimeter Brown gets past him goes back door for the heroic slam dunk my goodness wow Luke Brown does an excellent job getting past the initial line of defense and then a Thunderman slam car house answers from Deep to the other end there needed to be some kind of answer hows the leading scorer for the Seminoles hes got nine and quite frankly hes keeping Florida State in it right now against Luke Brown in the Hatters Browns got 17 points two rebounds two assists and all the confidence in the world Evan what am I watching Luke Brown its his show six threes in the first half and he stared down Camp Court a fivestar recruit he said I scored 3 000 points in high school I can do this college basketball you never know what youre gonna see On Any Given night Corin answers pulls back with him within nine when that ball moves from side to side Florida state is finding better opportunities its whenever theyre trying to force the issue thats when theyve struggled travel called 98 seconds left in the half and Luke Brown he doesnt just shoot it he can get downhill as well corn good pressure up top helps coming a little too soon a little no look a flush tumblrs ready to play too but Luke Brown Its been his ball game so far Music comes up short on the glass nice dish Korean missed it but a foul set up by Worley on the glass Applause and Worleys getting into the pain a little bit Evan but Luke Brown look at this the confidence on this kid the bravado Im gonna step back Ill think about it for a second go over there pull forget about it hes on fire Evan thank you Applause theres been a couple of possessions too where you look at it youre like thats pretty good defense but Luke Brown right now hes in another stratosphere most of his threes have come five six maybe eight feet Beyond The Arc makes me proud Oglesby country Applause I was going to say Curry country but I thought Id throw you away well I appreciate that I take what I can get at this point in my life all right seven point game after a couple free throws from cam Corin Italy Seminoles are four of their last five from the floor but can they get a stop stetsons nine for his last 11 hey Cory is getting stuck out on an island quite frequently Evan and hes using his hands a little bit too much on that possession but all Florida States doing theyre switching every ball screen so youre getting some outside in matchups Corin typically a fiveman he does have that athleticism to stay out in front but hes struggled a little bit in this half the First on Corin but its the seventh on Florida State so this is a one and one here and Tumblin missed it but the offensive rebound for Peak Jalen Blackman who I said might be the Hatters leading scorer he hasnt got a point in the half Browns one more not this time Cleveland the rebound kind of a sarcastic cheer from the crowd about getting Brown to miss and thats an offensive foul Cleveland thats just an undisciplined play you cant leave your feet you have the ability to see over the top and make that pass Sam B getting out in front good defense holds his position takes a lick Cleveland made the right play just the execution of that play needs to be a little cleaner Peak only has one point and six minutes off the bench but hes got five rebounds and one assist hes done a lot of little things to help this steps and cause well pause for a moment time out taken by Donny Jones Donnie 11 years as an assistant under Billy Donovan at Florida and he recruited a young Terence Oglesby from Tennessee daddy dude coach that he did excuse me Coach Jones one of the great guys in college basketball theyve been derailed a little bit by that by the covid year he had things going a little bit but Donnie Jones was at Florida whenever I was coming up in high school a part of some really good basketball teams including those great national championship teams Evan Al Horford Joe Canoa Corey Brewer you could go on Dont You Forget Lee Humphrey as a fellow Tennessean thats right so probably a great man I I will say that about Donnie Jones and hes got his guys playing the right way unselfish making the extra pass knocking down shots if theyre like this theyre going to be a team to be reckoned with NBA Summer coach Taco Fall at UCF these turned out to be pretty good taco its a legend that he is playing in China now is Taco Fall he sticks out in China and pretty much anywhere he goes anywhere he goes pretty good turnout from the student section here today Evan on game one a week after a big win over Miami a lot to cheer about hoping to Spur their Seminoles on and students have really shown up here theres a small band of students that was literally in their seats 75 minutes before tipoff Applause its impressive to see that passion Brown what a heads he play maintains machine are you kidding me wow tumbling lays it in after a wild sequence near Mid Court what an intelligent play by Luke Brown he realizes he touched its about to be an over and back and he smacks the ball onto his Defender and able to retain possession final 10 seconds of the half Cleveland gets the roll might have been a little bit too early in the clock well see how this plans out brown fakes it takes it Music missed back to back shots despite that miss it was the half of Luke Browns life 20 points off the bench in 13 minutes in his Stetson debut and Leonard Hamilton has quite a scowl understandably so well how about Luke and kick opportunities those are horse shots out on the perimeter especially a guy like Luke Brown whos shooting the cover off the ball starting the game or starting the second half on the bench they need to set a tone from the getgo Leonard Hamilton 182 in his first 20 seasons in season opening games Matthew Cleveland talked about him in the open and he gets going quickly to start in the second half that matchup that matchup Zone by Stetson has given Florida State fits you get that ball in the middle to Cleveland he can make some things happen powerful move nine points for Cleveland three of five from the floor Applause well Stetson be able to play as freely as they did in the first half making 113 pointers Swenson really set the tone with a turkey jerky changing in speed looking for his own offense here he cant finish but just like the first half a Hatter flying in for an offensive rebound this time it was Josh Smith seven offensive rebounds for the Hatters its kind of hard to believe with their lack of size compared to Florida state that theyre able to have that much success on the offensive glass caught winding down Blackman missed a three but another offensive rebound panzo hits the slashing Alvin tumbling for two they have struggled finishing possessions even when theyve had good defensive stops the offensive rebounds have just crushed him its either been an offensive rebound or crushing contested made three McLoud number two the hey McLeod gets it that close to the basket I think we can just go ahead and make it Im not even sure he jumped he was over four in the first half thats his first basket of the season Applause Music Applause saw McLeod gets it back we were told that McLeod can guard the perimeter like this and he did a pretty good job shot him and output its another rebound for Smith Blackman missed it again finds the rebound again this is a Restless Tallahassee crowd as the offensive rebounds piling up and the second chance points doing the same for the Stetson Hatters well what happens when you switch sometimes guards are getting switched on to Josh Smith and hes able to attack the offensive glass but Stefan Swenson is a problem with the ball on his hands and has the ball on a string can get into the paint pretty much whenever whenever youre able to get into the paint consistently against the Florida State team youve got some things to your game as you would expect from Stefan his game has everything tonight hes got two points three rebounds four assists and theres the steal Swenson leading the break Blackman for panzo to Blackman for Swenson Mills the other way Mills all the way and one if thats what you have to do if your Florida state gets stops and get out and run use that athleticism create opportunities for yourself Caleb Mills thats his second finish in transition but an open look I mean regardless you got to play defense a little bit fortunate but Caleb Mills a little in and out Strong finish Allen Jalen Blackman his first is Caleb Mills going to be able to take that next step and distribute to his team is that what thats what were waiting to see in todays game he can get where he wants to its a matter of 10 minutes all the way and then find open shoes its a very important question for Florida State this year and Mills bumping sweats into the backcourt called for the foul thats a second time east of Florida State being able to play that physical type of Defense I thought he got in correct position got in front Leonard Hamilton obviously not pleased they need to set the tone Music Applause calming presence over Stephanie doesnt get rattled one of the best defenders in the ACC and that means one of the best defenders in the country pressure in the ball not phased whatsoever Luke Brown 21st half points including six threes Applause shooting over Luke Brown if I didnt know he played ball I think he was a country singer but he is knocking down everything and face up jump shots off the dribble doing it off the catch off the move he is on fire country singers will be writing songs about this performance if it comes to fruition for the Hatters what about a shot forces the switch Luke Brown theyre coming up Florida State switches everything that puts coron out on an island and hes had his way so far this game seven so far for Luke Brown all right Terence youve had your fair share at nights when you were just stealing it from the perimeter and didnt matter who was guarding him whats that like I mean you dont really see much except for the basket but I will say this coach Hamilton might not let us back in the building if this continues I dont know for blame you and me I hope not brown comes up to steal Cleveland a little out of sorts but then the turnover traded the other way Mills Picks It Off green teardrop battle for the board still lose Clevelands got it Music looking High a little bit of a delay oop but he lays it in for two nice play making plays for each other nice aggressiveness off the bounce Applause Luke Brown needs to be careful here hes hitting shots sure but try not to force the issue youre finding shots within the flow of the offense Stefan Swenson what an answer is a clock and its not just with the shots around the rim its his ability to get wherever he wants to off the house someone on Florida state has to take that personally defensively deep three for green nope long rebound Track by Brown Swenson got four assists and four points with three rebounds and he has set the tone for the pace of this game at the offensive end of the floor five minutes gone in the second half Swenson kicks it tumbling oh are you kidding me Josh Smith from his backside gets the rebound another chance for tumbling stencil against free throws they are out toughing Florida State right now how rarely do you say that in this building I cant believe Im even watching it right now offensive putbacks and Swenson just being a problem off the dribble a lead change of pace and a finger roll Music PPI Security usually Florida state does a great job protecting the paint but so far in the second half six offensive rebounds in 5 15 off the clock yeah and 13 for the game this is a Stetson team that is much smaller than you you have to take care of those things and finish out possessions and whenever theyre getting into the paint its not just the offensive rebounds its the penetrate in penetrating and kicking out to Shooters theyre not still knocking down shots at a high rate Music 13 Second Chance points for stepson got a 138 edge in that department we talked so much Through The Years about Florida States death they kill you with waves they play 1213 guys well bench scoring tonight 2717 in favor of the Hatters Luke Brown with a big part of that hes got 20 off the pine well hes the big reason for that obviously Florida State still dealing with some injuries uh Chandler Jackson a freshman from Memphis out with a thumb injury theres a lot of guys that are kind of waiting to get back into it theyre missing them tonight though especially from a toughness perspective in a weird way it feels like a continuation of the end of last year the shorthanded Seminoles and theyre not going to get Jalen Gainey back the transfer from Brown ivy league Defensive Player of the Year a couple of times hes out for the year theyre hopeful to maybe get Deontay green with talented freshman for Nashville back in January but hes coming off the corn ACL you never know what youre going to expect a couple at the line Cleveland brushes to the basket thats his second offensive foul of the night thats a really good charge taken getting outside the charge Circle Cleveland getting a little bit too anxious hes wanting to dunk this ball nice patience staying on the ground drawing the charge one of two belgians on the steps in roster I never knewed Belgium to be a recruiting hotbed Evan that ones new to me but for Stetson its working out very well you traveled Europe quite a good bit how many different countries have you played I ended up playing in six with varying levels of success thats for us all gadaretsy does it on both ends of the floor takes the charge and then takes the two over Cleveland and it just seems to be more of the same forcing the switch to Stetson and gadarazza gets in holds his seal and just finishes over the smaller Mills and thats not something we can say all that often we encourage you to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer coming up at some point here in the second half 1404 remaining Music some matchup Zone it looks like a man but they are switching consistently communicating Stetson giving them fits Cleveland has to be able to hit that shot in the middle Matthew Cleveland into double figures hes got 11 hes got 11 Warren has ten house has nine Mills has seven Seminoles who havent LED since it was a 1211 Advantage early need to stop Luke Brown he takes it all the way and hes slow to get up near the cheerleader under the bucket help side late once again all the action was up above the freethrow line and he just takes the open Lane with that awkward one foot finish green blocked Music and Tumblr thats it hangs in the air walking foul on Florida State and thats a good call Swenson being aggressive in transition and how about Brown there is no Health side whenever hes handling the ball all the action is up top Darren Green Jr expecting some help and that little off foot finish is not an easy finish Evan and hes pretty good at it Donnie Jones told us before the game that Luke Brown messed up his toe over the summer it was kind of a slow preseason buildup looks okay he saved it all for tonight got 25 points 17 minutes off the bench Swenson extends the Stetson lead Luke Brown 20 years old hell turn 21 this Saturday how happy is he averaged three points a game last year comes in takes some opportunities not being held down to a system Donnie Jones lets them play a little bit this isnt overly complicated what stetsons doing theyre dribble driving attacking and hitting the open man playing unselfish basketball and hes been a beneficiary something about the transfer portal and coaches talk about this building chemistry early in the season becomes more difficult because you dont have as much continuity across the country Fletcher had ideas of detonating at the rim and he was met well in the battle for the loose ball continues Fletcher what a vertical contest I think that was Josh Smith coming over and going straight up that was impressive look helpside comes over a little late he maintains his verticality tremendous gets a piece of the ball that is a big time defensive play by Josh Smith lantanzo and Fletcher had a little extracurricular thats okay Florida State might need something like that to get their juices going a little bit pound 13 13 minutes to play Stetson not scared of anything right now no full court press broken easily by the Hatters Winston all six of his points have come here in the second half starting to look for a shot a little bit more waves off the big man down low but his kickoff pass tipped and stolen by Cleveland Worley to clutcher Tim Cleveland no opportunities slipping through the Seminoles hands one after another thats the one you need Evan right there that turns the building on its head it gets the crowd into it the game changes thats one you have to finish shot clock its seven green steps into it Applause there green was a big time shooter at Central Florida had one of his best games at his Central Florida Career against Florida state says Hey I want to join this squad they need him to get hot in a hurry 112 to play Brown Put on the line short Fletcher ahead for Worley Skip To The Hoop two this is what you need you get out in transition create some momentum a quick three a basket a basket quick layup and now the crowds into it you can feel the energy first field goal for Worley Tucker Center as loud as it has been tonight Smith off the dribble rejected Cleveland swats it and the Seminoles are coming alive and theyre using their length to get out contest Big Time block by Matthew Cleveland but a three by Darren Green the crowd was starting to get into it a little bit and then a bad shot results in an easy layup and then Matthew Cleveland coming over this extra energy gets the block lets them know about it Applause Seminole fans getting excited about the effort quick little run here to get back within eight with 11 12 to play coming up later tonight Kihei Clark begins another season for Tony Bennett the hair has changed through the years but uh the Fantastic point guard is back and getting ready to play NC Central with Tom wormy and Mike jaminsky on the call on many of these same stations I used to think that Greg paulus was a guy who never left but Kihei Clark has now taken the club in the ACC into the league and its good for college basketball I mean they remember Kyle guy and Ty Jerome and Dion Brianna whos having a heck of a career with Atlanta Hawks those guys fiveyear grows now that he played with basically no an excellent career that hes had Mike jaminski the legend himself shook it on the call Virginias going to be good Im really excited to see that team uh free Speakman he doesnt get the credit he deserves in my mind because of that length and athleticism he has Elite Speed with the Ballers who will get you to Charlottesville when we are done with our business here in Tallahassee and weve got some business to finish Applause rebound Fletcher big Outlet green pretty good transition D Worley on the perimeter attacking Brown kicks it pretty good defense really good defense excellent in transition Walling up make them making a different decision now you have a mismatch on the inside Camp electric begging for the basketball in and out strong rebound for Sam Peake the D3 transfer from Wesleyan where he was an AllAmerican here is Peak on the attack and he draws contact second time hes done that tonight on the drive but just driving it into the teeth of the defense and forcing the issue but the three ball hasnt been falling this half Evan only one of seven from Beyond The Arc here in the second and they need to be careful with their shot selection of course Luke Brown whos knocked down a bunch they still need to create the easy looks that they have been that was a nice shot by wasapanzo you get into the paint you kick out Sam Pete coming in getting fouled but be careful with your shot selection even though you are hitting shots still be a little bit selective because theyre coming whenever your your team moves the ball Connie Jones did bring nine guys back from last year this year which in this day and age is a pretty good continuity he lost his top three scores three guys who combined for about 44 points per game enter Luke Brown enter Luke Brown he might take care of the 44 himself at 25 right now in 20 minutes Sam Pete one for two Applause Mills knocks it in a little full court press make sevenpoint game so theres obviously pros and cons to some full core pressure if youre Stetson you open up the floor a little bit and that results in some easier shots but youre also slowing the tempo got to make sure you get back in front of the basketball and limit easy looks we enter the fourth quarter of this opening night ball game and a strong Drive cincier Harrison was all alone at the rim and it comes from penetration at the top thats the toughest place to help from but as you see the rest of Florida State for staying out on their man leaving opportunities around the rim 53 air mailed by Greene Applause Harrison feeling it up for the Stetson Hatters my goodness Evan when it rains it pours shot making is contagious and now sincere Harrison no more so as an athlete than anything else coming up in a semi break and knocking it through deep I think weve got to know him as a shooter now too eight points for Harrison Mills missed it puts Apollo from Worley time finish but if youre Stetson still relaxed take your time getting it up the floor get yourself in your offense dont get rattled by some of these momentum type plays what a game this has been nine minutes there hasnt been a ton of offense played hes got a lot of shots thats not a good one thats what I was referring to Evan whenever youre making shots sometimes you can fall into that heat check kind of shot be patient with that let the game come to you well I wasnt in Rhythm stand still foul on stetsons Peak at the other end this is a nice office nice patience flagman getting into or excuse me not Blackman Harrison getting into the paint scared to come and help too much and then Harrison too coming in trailing Florida State failing to match up in a semi break he got to communicate at a higher rate if youre Leonard Hamilton Squad Luke Brown defending that last shot choice to his head coach no matter what he says right there as well teaching moment perhaps foul again on Stetson Peak again second of The Possession yeah no matter what Luke says right here its not right I can guarantee it and heres the thing too he shot the heck off that heck out of the ball in the first half let that ball come to you a little bit be patient you know Evan weve talked a little about whos going to bring the energy for you Cameron Fletcher is battling anything whenever hes had the opportunity hes drawing fouls hes attacking the offensive glass Matthew Cleveland he can do it and one gets in the middle of that zone attacks the fiveman up and over hell get an extra hell get an extra one with that nice move ball movement moves quick nice decision up and over the defense its the fourth personal foul on the six foot eleven Belgian Aubin gadaretsi that is well done opening nine Jitters for the broadcasters two in the pronunciation department they were pressing on theres no question 8 15 to go could not complete this threepoint play Seminoles have missed eight free throws tonight you can look at the scoreboard to see how important that has been Applause eight minutes to go Applause behind his back makes a move bottled up great defense by Caleb Mills and a foul on the backcourt Florida state has hung around despite stetsons battle eight point game here in Tallahassee Music its now we are back at the Tucker center opening night of the college basketball season and the Stetson Hatters out of the Atlantic sun with a second half lead this is the Florida State team that has only lost one of its last 47 nonconference home games theyre not the only ACC team thats getting a battle on opening nights Miami Hurricanes down at the half against the leopards of Lafayette out of the Patriot League by two Georgia Tech playing a division two team Clayton State they were tied at the half at mccamish in Atlanta those are the two ACC teams other than Leonard Hamilton Seminoles that are in the most trouble right now on opening night the old Mike Tyson quote he always have a plan until you get knocked until you get punched in the face I think thats what he said thats exactly it second half has been a little bit better for Florida State theyre starting to clean up their defensive possessions in the shot here in the second half six assists moving the ball a little bit better Florida state has been kind of pushing back ever since there was a 171 run Midway through the first half they fell behind nitson has led since then Florida state has continued to Chip Away Stetson has continued to keep pushing as well Seminoles havent LED this game since it was 1211 early its a matchup Zone Florida States starting to figure it out a little bit gets your best Playmakers in the middle Kayla Mills on that occasion able to draw the foul but Matthew Cleveland a couple possessions before drawing fouls finishing above changing defenses missed the front end but Cleveland on the offensive glass cleans it up and thats moves it to six its the closest its been in a while and theyve been major by majority on effort plays Florida State makes those effort play as they get back in the basketball game Matt Cleveland has 15 points on effort plays tonight theres a defensive deflection by warley catch alive though Harrison 12 to shoot Worley staring him down defensively Harrison step back three rebound Fletcher Worley kicks it green hasnt been there hes now one for six from Deep the roof might have popped off if they made that one but if you look over at the school stable Swenson back in the coming back in the ball game next that ball Luke Brown back in the ball game they have gotten a little bit rattled Stetson with Swenson on the bench you need your settle down guy in there when the tide starts to turn Hanzo is going to have to create something with five to shoot he kicks it pretty good look for Valdez Florida State can they inch closer Fletcher has positioned somehow he got a second chance but he couldnt hang on to it thats one thats gonna be tough to look back at for the film Mr Cameron Fletcher thank you Music it was almost like stepson was conceding the layup there he had such great position look how wide that stetsons playing yeah I mean there is always space in the middle of the floor it doesnt matter theyre going to switch out top youre going to have chances to get and penetrate youre going to be able to draw the foul and their lightning quick guards Harrison being one of them he can get wherever he wants if theres that much room to operate yeah great spacing open the floor green couldnt stick with him without fouling second personal foul on Darren Green Jr Music Applause 43 to go here reminder NC Central and Virginia from John Paul Jones Arena in Charlottesville coming up with Tom roomy and the former ACC Player of the Year from duke Mike jaminsky timeout called one more free throw after the timeout its a sixpoint game with 5 43 to go Hatters trying to pull off the upset on the road Music sixpoint game 5 43 left Stetson has one free throw out of this timeout which was called by Leonard Hamilton after sincere Harrison missed the first Leonard Hamilton in his 21st season winning his coach in Florida State history time to discover the best presented by The Fresh Market Leonard the recipient of the 2022 Joe lapship character award and pretty good company cremins Gillen shashesky says a lot that bottom line 73 out of 75 who went to school for four years got their degree and even going back Evan to his time at Miami if you combine the two 101 of 106 hes about the right things sometimes we forget nil and all these different things coming into the equation in college athletics its still guys getting their degrees and Leonard Hamilton really emphasizes that hes going to play in here and its a college basketball for such a long time trying to wheel his team back on opening night against steps and Mills rebound Fletcher third chance Worley and one wow the offensive rebounds the extra effort plays warley going in strong Josh Smith doesnt love the call you got to keep your hands straight up it doesnt matter if they bump into you or not but extra effort plays thats Cameron Fletcher hes done a nice job this half of bringing energy to his team in warling could be your breakout guy in this conference with a big time finish third foul on Josh Smith Worley no good Smith gets the rebound Music free throw for Florida State Music as we close in on five minutes to play Evan Lefler with Terence ogles be our entire crew Courtside here at the Tucker Center Applause rotations in the second half as far as switching is concerned away from the ball much sharper attention to detail much better for Florida State Swenson having a much harder time getting where he wants to go in and out a strong rebound for Fletcher who just grabbed his ninth Board of the night Mills to the basket thats goaltending tumbling pinned it after it had already hit the glass and its a threepoint game and a lot of the things that hes done this half number 21 camera Fletcher hes bringing that extra juice that energy sometimes it doesnt result in baskets but nine rebounds getting out initiating the break and Caleb Mills when hes got ahead of steam hes tough to finish this crowd is ready to explode Swenson back door what a pass tumbling throws it down and thats a sign of that young team Leonard Hamiltons referred to whenever he said I have veterans but theyre all second year guys Fletcher is one of those second year guys when the when the momentum is starting to be on your side thats something that cannot happen 15 points now for Alvin tumbling quickly inside Cleveland draws contact Applause more free throws for Florida State with 406 remaining he cant lose sight of your man nice cut someone with another flush hes had a few of those tonight Donnie Jones just trying to hang on this game could come down to free throws you get underneath four minutes you have the lead in a tough environment Music free throws and extra effort plays cant lose your composure on the road here one for two at the lines for Cleveland Luke Brown made a three with 11 48 to go in the first half made the score 1412 Stetson has had the lead ever since theyve LED for most of the night Stefan Swenson double team kicks it panzo sticks it was a panto another one 43 of the night but thats Swenson being patient he gets stuck in the lane he doesnt panic Big Time find and Big Time finish foreign Music Applause State triple Cameron Fletcher thats only the fifth three of the night for Florida State but they needed it in that moment back to a fourpoint game contrast that with Stetson whos made 14 threes tonight I love what Swensons doing here hes calling for the matchup that he wants thinks he can get by Green Jr off the dribble so he takes his time gets the ball down to 10 seconds and then creates something off the bounce setting up hands on the corner oh what a pass and Smith with his stuff that is unbelievable Touch by Wes of panzo on the pass picks it up with his left hand gets it to Josh Smith whos able to flush it has been truly a brilliant performance from the Stetson Hatters thats a blocking foul Smith was sliding he picked up his fourth so many magical moments for the Stetson Hatters theyve got a lead 239 to go panzo what an incredible dish play of the night in college basketball can the Hatters finish this off in the Tucker Center game summary we got two minutes and 39 seconds left Stetson leads by six on the back of 14 threepoint field goals 19 assists on 27 buckets and the Hatters out of the Atlantic Sun trying to finish the deal at Florida State wesa panzo shades of his fellow Canadian Countryman Steve Nash with this dish to be able to pick the ball up off the dribble with one hand to get rid of it stents is just using Florida States aggressiveness against him excellent read excellent finish was a fanzo the Jack of all trades for this Hatters team look the pickup and to get it there quickly that is a high level of skill on the pass Donnie Jones talked about he does everything for them I mean he brings the ball up he initiates offense he can knock down shots played well so far tonight another missed free throw for Florida State Donnie Jones looking for a signature win meanwhile when were done here remember well get you to Tom wormy and Mike jaminski in Charlottesville for the 18th ranked Virginia Cavaliers taking on the Eagles of NC Central led by Lavelle mode one of two at the line fivepoint game Luke Brown had 20 in the first half hes got 25 overall Brown working on the dribble against Greene wants to get rid of it but no ones open this is where Florida state gets you it sticks on one side of the floor youre gonna have to make something happen last minute Luke Brown draws the foul on green after dribbling himself for 25 seconds and thats what Florida state does to you and then Darren Green Jr just cant keep Luke Brown in front good aggressiveness little he loves going to his left hand thats been a consistent theme this game whenever hes putting it on the deck but you got to keep them out of the middle of the floor thats where stetsons Got You Luke grounds pulled off quite a bit since that electric first half but whenever hes been in the game or whatever Swensons been in the game Stetson settled down this game very well could come down to free throws and I would trust Luke Brown to knock down some free throws well last year at Ball State he got to the freethrow line seven times and he made six of those for the whole season its good for 86 or something like that bro exactly two for two here hes got 27 points career high last year theres 10 so hes headed this matchup zone Im sorry for interrupting you back to this matchup Zone incredible defense by gatheretsi thats right and what happens is it makes Florida State hesitate and then have to run some sort of zone offense slowing them down in result Worley did a great job defensively on Swenson last possessions prevented him from getting the ball but then Brown got to the line anyway against Greene Swenson gets around him finds gadaretsy who scores inside for Stetson what a luxury to have somebody like Stefan Swanson to settle down your office Florida States gonna have to get something in a hurry Mills cant connect Second Chance same result gotteretsy Bear Hugs the ball and the Hatters are 80 seconds away from shocking the Seminoles here in Tallahassee fans who came expecting greatness are starting to head to the exits Swenson with the ball he has been terrific today I know Luke Browns going to get a lot of attention Swenson has been able to get wherever he wants whenever he wants and thats just two more that might be the dagger the exclamation point of sorts for Stefan Swenson who appropriately has done everything a 60 spurt here for Stenson to create the late separation Music foul inside stepson gonna snap an 18 game losing streak against Florida State going to be their first win against the Seminoles since March of 1975 when Glenn Wilkes who led the Hatters program for 36 years was at the helm of course Glenn wilkess grandson Wyatt suited up for Florida State the last five years here in Tallahassee a lot to take away from this game but this is a program win for Donnie Jones theyve struggled in recent years they get nine guys back theyve shot the cover off the ball and Stefan Swensons going to give you a chance to win every single time and that program win gamechanging win Florida State kept on grinding got with him in five got within three could not get over the Hop Music Applause Florida state has only LED for two minutes all night long drill by 10 and give a foul with 278 seconds to go the Stetson Hatters can sense the magnitude of the moment and Luke Brown the transfer from Ball State could never have envisioned entering the transfer portal signing in an Atlantic Sun School that many probably havent heard them arent too familiar with here he is and those other nine have been wide open because Florida state has been worried about the three ball theyve been shots around the hoop Luke Brown terrific and sincere Harrison this is his first defense great first showing by him as well Aaron green gonna play his old team four days from now on the road Seminoles at UCF and they are going to be trying to avoid an Owen two start because the Stetson Hatters come to the Tucker Center and put on a show behind Luke Browns 27 Stetson upsets Florida State on opening night in Tallahassee final score 8374 the Stetson Hatters get a marquee win to start their season coming up next NC Central and Virginia lets get you to Charlottesville with Tom wormy and Mike jaminski
