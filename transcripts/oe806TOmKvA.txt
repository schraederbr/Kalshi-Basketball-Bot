Leonard Hamilton fifth alltime Brian Oliver in ACC with wins 403 of them got a chance to talk with Coach Hammond he said that hey you know what I missed the memo on this whole thing with the transfer portal you know what thats the first and the last time I got it consider it but we got a good win this afternoon again when the open two teams right there at six and ten dont adjust your sets Florida State wearing turquoise as they do from time and again raising awareness or bringing sport to Native American and Aboriginal youth this big time decision that theyve made program wide thats why theyre wearing the turquoise Applause Zachary playing with a compression sleeve on his right cats been a sore spot for him in recent weeks still waiting on the first shot of our game Chuck clocks down to four Applause someones gonna have to put it up shot clock down to one up and in Devin McLaughlin very good Patience by BC getting the ball inside the McLaughlin youll find time and time again this Florida State team will basically switch all picks that last time Boston College doing a good job of recognizing the mismatch Caleb Mills looking for help Papa Miller didnt play the first 16 games of the year but this kid has really come on late in the year and the shot clock for Florida state gets down to two gonna have to put something up so both sides wait until the last Nano second of the shot clock to put up their first shot of the game empty possession for Florida State you saw Miller last time for young big putting the ball on the floor and then picking up his dribble thats one of the things if youre limited Hamilton you do not want to do early but heres the thing for Florida State theyre going to extend their pressure interest and see if they can get turnovers because that early offense is something that they definitely can lean on today we played 75 seconds and only seen one official shot and a foul call as Makai Ashton Langford hits the deck in the active shooting so free throws coming for Ashton blankford and thats one of the things for Boston College thats key for them when Ashland Lanford can break down the defender and get to the basket it makes it a lot easier for them because for the most part four of the states going to have a lot of their attention on Quinton post fronting him in Weak side help Ashton Langford has improved Big Time across the board and maybe not so much anywhere else as free throw shooting hes at 87 freethrow shooter many moons ago when he was a freshman at Providence playing Big East basketball he was a 52 freethrow shooter so to go from 52 to 87 is huge in the course of a career looks like someone spent some time in the gym getting those reps up and again one of the best ways to get better man is to put that time in the gym only way to get better partner I wouldnt know America but it seems to me right with my man Brian Oliver ACC great Applause thought about a deep one turn around Darren Green back of the Iron rebounded by Zachary good defensive possession for Boston College through Florida State you got to do a better job of trying to break down and penetrate thats one of the things you see good pass in and flip over to McLaughlin I thought it interesting we talked with Earl Grant about teams now choosing to double team Quinton pulse he said that he wants him to invite the double you see right there nice little dump off to mcglockton right on the other side now Eric Grant right now has got to be beaming because he talked about the importance of getting the ball into the paint and making things happen and so far so good McLaughlin up and in having to play two minutes in BC doing on both ends of the floor getting good paint touches and on the defensive end not giving Florida State really anything to chew on and heres the thing for Florida State they got to do a better job of Shifting the defense because Boston College is going to get in and try to disrupt what youre trying to do gonna get some early playing time comes into the game at the 1804 mark housewares number 12 freshman from Dayton Ohio comes to make basketball and volleyball family sits Mills bumped off his spot missed it on the tap the followup is in and thats what Florida state is going to be able to put their input on this game you saw it last time Mills get into the cup couldnt finish corn on their offensive rebound neither team really shoot the lights out of from behind their Arc if youre Florida State you have to get up and get downhill for a lot of pressure break down defense and get these turnovers to get an early offense house with the steal green transition three is short Music thank you Boston College on the road just a pair of wins two and seven Applause skip pass Ashton Langford had it ripped away back to back turnovers this time its green with a steal active Hands by Florida State again thats what they want to do turn you over and see if they can get some early offense house fakes one way goes the other misses his first shot of the afternoon good Applause Music typical Leonard Hamilton fashion theres always a sub waiting at the scores table missed the short one good weak side help by Mills again trying to get that lob over the Post House come up the bench and aggressively fired up a couple quick shots and heres the thing for Florida State they do not have great threepoint shooting theyre settling right now Lena Hamilton always preaches breaking down the defense and being patient I think right now with a younger team they have not been patient to run their offense and some of that is due to Boston College getting up on four minutes into our game Boston College just one for eight juping the basketball Applause Zachary good dick back up and in a league Bay and thats one of the things about a Lee Bay playing a small four Position will crash because theres so much attention put on Quinton post great opportunity down there good pass a good recovered by McLaughlin house found corn but there was no room to get the shot off you see the big good defense right there you see penetration and what looks to be an easy one easy McLaughlin said you are denied BC up by six theres an eight to two lead for the visitors Boston College off to a nice start against Florida State Brian Oliver how about your four keys to the game easy for me for Boston College disruption through physicality theyre physical they want to turn you over and get you out of source and for Florida State we talked about the fact that they have to get better in the paint on both ends of the floor try to get to the cup and theyve got a limited Boston College and what they want to do on the inside and how about that welcome back Demar Langford has inflated since January 28th we saw him struggle in the first half of the game at Virginia hasnt played last handful of games but hes back in the mix now first sub Off the Bench for Boston College along with Chaz Kelly whos just checked into the game a huge shot in the arm for Earl Grant because of his physicality athletic ability gives you another Defender and someone can put the ball on the floor and finish it at the rack little dump down good catch there by nahim McLeod has checked into the game McLeods turnaround is short another chance to tell you about for Boston College Mason Madsen shooting a real good ball hes checked in number 45 for the Eagles thats one of those guys you have to stay close to him because he does not need much time to get that three ball off with a quick release Applause quitting post seven footer nice ball handling Music post gets it back in the corner Corner flashes of three and this is one of the things that we talked about from the cloud thats going to be a hard matchup for him because being 74 youre not going to want to chase another big out there when post he gets you out that he is not going to waste time in launching that three Chandler Jackson has checked in for Florida State number zero who run the point and a foul no stepping on the end line was the young freshman Tom house again watching this last play you see post going to penetrate good Ball moving by BC drawing kicking and you realize if youre McLeod you have to understand The Scouting Report tells you he does not wait long to launch that three a lot of skill with Clinton post what he can do with the ball handling the passing and the shooting a lot to life post draws a crowd gets out to Matson whos left open thats a couple of games that shots been automatic you have a good play by post realizing the double is coming welcome back we talked earlier but Im fake by Mills and the Up and Under nice move getting underneath Holst Caleb Mills cracks the seal Mattson passes High run down by TJ Bickerstaff had it poked out of bounds itll stay with Boston College so the only starter remaining in the game for Boston College right now is they play with a seven point lead is their Center Post Florida States going to make a change warley comes back in he replaces house Music without hesitation and you saw that last time as soon as they run that play in with his height being almost six ten six eleven shoots over a smaller guard Florida state has to understand they got to get a hand up on him quick Mills picktoback buckets virtually identical and you saw two possessions for Caleb Mills understanding he can get by his man and finish and again Florida State I think thats one of the things they have to focus on is getting stops on one end and trying to break down and get some muckers in the basket post surrounded by three seminals has it taken away Applause green thats the first three quarter for Florida State and if theres anyone for Florida State you want to see shoot the threepointer thats green because again in transition gets a chance to get that three up against Florida State on a nice mini run on 50 run Greens now got 83 pointers on his season Applause Music pass deflected lankfords got it now Chaz Kelly offensive foul Mason Matson you see backtoback action for both teams and again you see weak side help here coming over from Florida State get out in transition if you got to find anybody Aaron green is the guy again allow him to get going knocks down that three we talked about Florida State getting a couple of stops and going on a little 50 run Florida State theyve hit their last three shots from the field Makai Ashton Lankford comes back into the game along with Devin McLaughlin post sits for the first time see how Boston College can operate without post ripped away bigger steps got it and number one Florida State knocks it away from number one for Boston College Eagles keep possession Applause Boston College won a year ago that game uh in New England comfortable win for BC 7155 Applause main weapon for Florida State in the loss was Matthew Cleaver at 18 points told you that Cleveland will not play today hes out for a second consecutive game Music Chaz Kelly working on McLeod and it was a bad idea got bailed out with a foul Jazz Kelly The Freshman went after the 74 nahim McLeod had it blocked easily but he was contacted with when you see Kelly realize hes got a big one to decide to try to dance on him and then McLeods a little late absorbing that contact and going back to Kelly I thought that throughout the year hes been waiting patiently playing behind Zachary done a good job of taking advantage of his minutes ACC corookie of the week exploded for 17 against Virginia Tech a week ago McLeods gonna leave Corin comes back in for a second tour Applause one out of two for Kelly Applause Jackson over Place second consecutive steal by bickers Death and now the Eagles will set up shop Music Applause just playing keep way a long way away from the basket as the shot clock dips below 10 Applause Ashton Langford thats the way in do things when youre a grad student been around playing a lot of basketball a nice move by Ashton Langford realizing anytime you get a big out there you may not get all the way to the basket nice midrange game and again for both teams pretty much small lineups interesting to see as you see Corin come up with that shot both teams want to get out in transition if they can and get some early offense Music weve played close to nine minutes home standing Florida state with only nine points thats an issue for Leonard Hamilton Music and an offensive foul second time Boston College has been called for that infraction this time its Tamar Langford well his brother Makai Ashton Lankford doing work senior moment for the senior BC up by eight for 46 gold Ford dealer The Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America and zMAX micro lubricant extend engine life increase fuel mileage available at OReillys going into the way back machine taking you back to 2012 the Seminoles their first ACC title they beat Miami Duke and the topseeded Tar Heels in the championship game Michael snare the Everett case Award winner as the MVP there is the banner immortalized 2012 and Brian Oliver you must have an idea of what thats like 1990 the Everett case uh MVP of the tournament seems like eons ago man Ive been literally dating myself 32 years ago but you know what I can still shoot that thing man Im telling you ball comes over here Im shooting it partner Im a bubble shooter not a passer I love it all your cohorts were not in the mix that year right Kenny a was already gone Dennis Scott was gone I know that was actually a Lethal Weapon three of us meet the weapon three in the house full effect I love watching Kenny Anderson by the way so did I especially when he was diving me it was actually Mark Prices birthday a couple of days ago gave a shout out to Mark Price Grayson from Georgia Tech Cameron Mills or Caleb Mills with the misfire tapped around finally cleared by Prince Elite Bay back into the ball game post is also back in for Boston College Boston College almost halfway through the first half both ends of the floor doing worse but what you see is that the great ball movement anytime you can move the defense from east to west and then get to your first option right there you see Quinn post welcoming into that double team and getting the ball out of his hands Away really fast missed opportunity turnover in the paint Here Comes Florida State green hit one of those earlier Jake and Zachary back into the game Zachary may not be a hundred percent been dealing with a right lower leg injury for a couple of weeks Applause another turnover BC has been the rosenworth enemy green took it right to the body of post and didnt get a whistle and heres the thing Eric Florida States doing a good job of getting the turnovers as you see yet another one they have not been able to turn him over and then capitalize on the turns nice block from behind that was McLaughlin who took it away from Mills huge numbers Advantage for BC hits up the window how many times do you see a four on Two And you ought to give it to your seven footer for a bank three whatever works that is the third threepointer for post and post influences they missed there by warley they might as well wait for post and nope theres got to be another offensive foul nope its a block again watch the fast break again you see Jayden Zachary realized Ive got the big fella I mean hes like you know what I meant that my bank is definitely were open on Saturdays but again great recognition no hesitation whatsoever big guy whole strikes the polls keeps that follow through the postman Rings three times Quentin post 42 from behind the arc my only issue is with that stroke and how good it looks why has he only taken 38 so far in this season fire him up there more I think the teams as he had when he came back off the foot injury a lot of teams once he started dropping those numbers paid a lot more attention thats why again in talking with Earl Grant he said he he encourages them to accept that double team get everyone else involved and eventually those looks will come a lot easier Ashton Langford rear missing the free throw line for him but the lead is 12 for Boston College Florida state is going to get back in this game if they can spread Boston College out and do a better job of penetrating you see right there Jackson doing a good job I like Jackson he calls it 215 pounds stocky guard they can get downhill now they got to get some stops one of the biggest things is theyve done a good job of turning Boston College over but they got to capitalize on the end Deontay green has checked in for the first time for Florida State freshman from Asheville North Carolina he wears number five this is post his fourth threepointer of our first half you would think Scouting Report tells you if anyone you go out to and you do not leave Clinton post again this Boston College team normally only makes about five threes a game most of the time is Quentin poster you want to go ahead and stay with them body slying this is Jackson left open cant capitalize largest lead of the game 13 for BC and Id have to say that the pace favors Boston College because on the Florida state Miss theyre trying to not so much getting a fast break early offense that ball moves left to right and is Shifting the defense especially in their reading getting the ball inside to Quinton post and knocking down wide open shots Applause it is raining triples for Boston College they lead by 16 and Florida State early on the ropes theyve got a call timeout listing into that huddle while BC is sprinting towards their bench well again when you see your big guys knocking down threes you see Quentin pulse and then the prince says I want to get in this too BC up by 16 Music coyote turning points he has made four for four already and you look at just that his ability to get those threes down again Scouting Report says youve got to close out has one of the quickest releases not so much for a big guy for any player in the ACC get those numbers hes missed two too far inside field goals but four for six four for four from behind the arc already off 12 points hes take two shots from inside the arc hes missed both of those but in the Deep ones hes perfect and heres the thing Austin colleges last in the ACC with three pointers made per game at five theyve already got five right now in the first half and my man QP has already got four of them Coyote Tractor Turning Point early Boston College making it happen yeah significant loss for Florida State Matthew Cleveland now two consecutive games he hadnt been able to play look at the minute total thats a massive number you play for Leonard Hamilton I expect guys to be coming in and out like its a revolving door but Matthew Cleveland is that important that Leonard hamiltones to play him majority of the game and its a huge blow for Florida State because you see 14 almost eight rebounds this is the guy that there was their goto guy and then not having him on the line puts a lot more pressure on the other guys typically Leonard Hamilton likes to funnel guys in and have a quick rotation hes playing to start us more minutes and you see quicker fatigue and so obviously thats one of the things of not having Cleveland has really impacted them on both sides of the floor Langford misses a wild shot batted around cleared by Chandler Jackson Florida State needs something easy they have made just five of 23 shots here in the first 13 minutes Madison almost to steal good defense by Zachary understanding that were green he wants to throw that threepoint shot up Florida States got to do a better job of taking care of the ball and again that was one of the things that for BC they get up in you theyre physical and they want to push you off your first and second options Florida State you got to be a little bit more patient spacing make that ball pop and then take your opportunity to penetrate Florida state does not have a free throw attempt in the first 13 minutes and the rip away by Zachary some of the best hands in the ACC I mean Zacharys one of those guys feisty down low realizing he was part of that mismatch of corn came up with that steal second instance with Boston College playing with host on the bench again watch this defense you see big on little hes like I dont know as you call him snatching cookies from him realizing you know what Im I dont need any help dont send the double Ive got him staying back coming up with that still Matson Zachary working in the backcourt alongside Langford Kelly and bicker staff routing up the five for BC Kelly somehow got it over Langford along the Baseline comes up short trying to get his legs back hadnt played in three weeks good challenge there by Mills again for Florida State staying solid on defensive end they got to find a way to get some offense dont want to settle again for just a threepoint shot a little pick and roll Boston College doing a good job of switching and standing from the ball wild shot by Darren Green a rolling half off maps in transition three making it rain on a Saturday afternoon and thats problems for Florida State because you saw not great shot discipline allows BC to get out and for Madison weve talked about give him an opportunity to get that going and see no one guards on Mills free run down finish up at the basket Nelsons got three layups here in our first half Boston College is six for eight from behind the arc good job up a 17point lead when you do that Kelly turns the corner blocked away from behind Applause Mills another layup is full it could move by move bikes you saw the first time realizing him were gonna hesitate right now get to the basket allow you to go buy me again this is where Florida state is going to get back into this game good solid defense getting in transition and getting to the basket Zachary Music Langford again another three the seventh first half triple for BC and which Aiden Zachary did a good job of being able to realize he had nowhere to go defense is going to collapse you get it over to Demar Langford knocks down that three Applause Worley into the corner and Mills is pressured by Kelly Applause Music Florida state has made one threepointer and theyve not even attempted a free throw thats a tough way to win a ball game in the ACC your best threepoint shooter is green so they have to find some way of trying to collapse that defense and get him some uncontested shots but in his first half you see Boston College already up to 18 this second unit did a solid job while post was on the bench and then Ashton Langford was on the bench interested to see now in his last four minutes can Florida State get some consistent offense Florida States been bringing Shola out of BC just the seventh game hes played all year not ABC wheres number 51 and another foul called on Boston College and you so you see the new guys coming in Leonard Hamilton with the injuries that theyve had hes got to give his starters some blow because when he talked about the minutes that theyre playing a lot of these guys are still not used to playing that many minutes because that was not the initial plan coming into the season CJ Pena has checked in for Boston College Grant transfer wears number 24 for BC Mills has been the best form of offense for State his four race to the cup and this will result in free throws for the first time as Florida state has been searching for offense it has been Mills that have been able to get to the basket again you look at right now down 18 youre not going to hit home runs you chip away at this try to get it under 10 by the half and then stay solid defensively Caleb Mills second year in the program started at Houston the last two guys who have worn Caleb Mills is number four in Florida State both went on to be selected fourth overall in the NBA draft you got Patrick Williams he got Scotty Barnes thats I I remember Williams I couldnt remember Barnes thats something magic in that number four here in Tallahassee Applause closing into the four minute Mark of our first half its been all BC Clinton post couldnt handle the catch stolen away by Greene Applause oh my goodness a loco three didnt get there and post is undercut by adebisi half Boston College enjoying a nice working margin of 16 welcome back everyone busiest man in Tallahassee at all times is Florida States Chuck Walsh congratulations to Chuck he was named the US basketball writers associations Katha Quinn Award winner for 2023 that is a big big deal he will receive that honor at the final four later this year uh just an allaround good guy 23 years now in Florida State you walk into the building Eric great to see you were happy to have you here we got a hot meal for you waiting in this room bathrooms are right over here were going to talk to coach Hamilton with when youre ready he is an absolute dream to work with and Eric Ive been doing this for 15 years and even when Im not doing the games I can always count on my man Chuck to keep me in the loop phone calls sometimes hell call to check on mirmo and my wife and my daughter Chuck is one of the best guys goes Way Beyond to make sure that hes making people keeping him in the loop and keeping them comfortable theyll call you from the team bus tough trivia with you tough storylines whatever you want good stuff yeah congratulations Applause taking on UCLA thats the big story what are the stories here in Tallahassee Music Applause oh my gosh well I was going to give a quick recap and say what basically for those who may not understand how BC has gotten as long as you see Nancy come up with this steal get it to post Madison misses it Im telling you Quentin post has got to be the best shooting seven footer in the NBA maybe over the last 15 years I cant figure out who would be better they got constructed and Mills gets the benefit of the doubt look at this logo three you watch The Postman as hes coming in delivering in Tallahassee watch out here is it by the logo oh yes its by is that the mouth it was like you know what take that one Florida State and again for Florida State I mean watch this no hesitation didnt think twice go ahead strike the polls keep that follow through like the true Shooters do he is five for five from behind the arc on the year he is now 21 for 43 if he makes his next one hell be exactly 50 percent from behind the arc this season just an incredible shooter and its not like its looking Goofy Im not a shot doctor but Quentin post that shot is pretty oh you can tell like I said he knows that he holds that great form and most times with Shooters you hold that follow through and if you look at the first half Austin College is shooting 72 percent from behind the arc 57 overall versus for Florida State 26 and only one per six behind the arc too Boston College having trouble with the turnovers and a reach in foul called on Ashton Lankford really the only fly in the ointment for Boston College with the way that theyve been playing is the turnovers theyve got nine of them five committed by their graduate student point guard Makai Ashton Lankford and heres the thing Eric if theyre going to chip away at this lead this is how theyre going to do it they have done a good job of trying to disrupt Boston College when Boston College is not reigning threes but theyve got to be able to turn those turnovers into points off for turnovers Jalen Worley Applause sophomore from Pennsylvania wow thats gonna be tough for Florida State to get back into this game because they are not an elite threepoint shooting team they average six and a half threes per game and a standard issue going by twos and ones from Florida State well what theyre going to have to do is that you see them right now extending their pressure you want to speed this game up we talked with Earl Grant he said he did not want it to be a high Tempo game but it does see that from Boston College when theyre getting stops theyre getting out into their early offense so in this first half the temple has definitely been in their favor a league Bay Zachary tough angle trying to get it to post but somehow hammers it five threes that have dumped for post and heres the thing when you got a little guy trying to front him then youve got the weak side another guard you throw the ball anyway that last time they were able to get it to post he got through both of those guys and finished with a dunk at The Rim he is a analytics dream threes and dunks is what uh the smart people are talking about in the world of basketball these days and thats all hes got I mean five threes and a dunk I mean watch this next play youve got a small garden in it on the weak side youve got Worley so basically you say go ahead and throw it anyway because if he throws it he gets past the other guard theres no one on the weak side and hes able to finish at the rim and again talking about his afternoon 17 points six for eight and perfect five from five behind the threepoint line actually had a similar first half a couple of weeks ago end of January game in Charlotte field against the Cavaliers wasnt able to keep up the momentum in the second half and thats when Virginia pulled away from Earl Grants team I thought it interesting in the last game against Pitt with a loss I thought Pitt did a good job of frustrating him in the first half girlfriend said that he pulled him aside and said hey you know what dont get frustrated welcome to the double teams and well make sure that we have guys in right position to get through ball theyve done a good job of getting him at the right place and not being impatient finally Caleb Mills now with 12 points for Florida State and a foul Clinton post has the full attention of Florida State and were gonna have well its just the sixth team foul on Florida State so sign out of bounds and if you realize with this lineup that when youve got guys and Zachary that can shoot at Madison they can shoot it all so its easy to be able to play a four out and want one in because again that puts a lot of pressure you see Madison wide open over there not able to knock that one down Music Florida State trying to chip away before we get to halftime 17point game Applause Mills Up and Under and he has been a foul magnet last couple of times down the floor Mills has been the one person that could get to the cup at will and again if youre limited Leonard Hamilton going into the half which could possibly be somewhere around the 1514 point mark you encourage your guys to stay the course you got to play solid defense and you have to try to turn over Boston College and capitalize and keep just chipping away at this thing Leonard Hamilton has played Caleb Mills this entire first half really cant afford to take him out Mills is the only one whos brought his offense with him he has got 13 of the 22 from Florida State 14 of the 23 for Florida State by that man and then if Im Boston College I go with whats been working you move the ball around you do not go immediately in the Clinton polls you shift the defense try to get him a little high low action and then Force Florida State to react deflected another turnover for BC theyve been Their Own Worst Enemy Chandler Jackson using that good body to set up Mills stays of Florida State final 50 seconds of our first half spacing very important you want to move the defense with the pass not so much with the dribble Florida State fortunate that theyve been able to hit free throws because they have gone stone cold from the field almost five minutes now without a field goal but heres the thing as well as Boston College has shot the ball from behind the arc Florida States got opportunity to go into the to the half down at least 13 I mean the way that Boston College been shooting they easily should be down by more than 20 what an interesting game has been for Caleb Mills he makes these two free throws he will have 16 of the 25 for Florida State he is singlehandedly keeping Florida state within shouting distance combination of Dave coward and George McLeod inside outside at the freethrow line Caleb Mills have a half and finally going to catch a blow its the first time hes going to sit in our entire first half hes replaced by Tom house after Florida State you want to play solid defense again opportunity to go into the half down 13 but for Boston College he literally take advantage ball movement Kelly cant hit the three and a pushup going for the rebound and theyre going to catch Devin McLaughlin so we will come all the way to the other end of the floor and finally someone Music the thing if you look at the stats for Florida State theyre shooting 25 and 14 and then when you look at how well Boston colleges shot the ball I think that if you go swimming at Hamilton you got a chance to go in under uh maybe 11 you can probably take that and then regroup Florida state is perfect 11 for 11 its a free throw line Caleb Mills is eight for eight himself one more coming for Chandler Jackson Music you talked about the half by Mills I think that Florida States ability to turn Boston College over as well has been one of those things its allowed them to chip away at that lead Applause perfect at the line as a team for Florida State there in first half Applause for all intents and purposes the shot clock is off Applause BC holding for the final chatter at least they are hoping to Applause Kelly All by him Lonesome Music Kellys going to have to restart locked at Center Court by out of BC so a whole bunch of nothing for Boston College to end the half and Florida State using a bit of a run to close within nine make it 11 Florida State they go on a 102 run over the last 90 seconds to make this 11point game Boston College a lot of your chance today for Florida State we should mention Caleb Mills man he had 16 points the most points in a single half this season he was eighth grade at the freethrow line he has now made 15 consecutive free throws and maybe the coolest number associated with Caleb Mills in 20 minutes he was fouled seven times seven times Boston College had to foul to stop him and theres a foul to begin our second half scored the goal Jalen Worley and if Im in Leonard Hamilton I go ahead and tell you my guys you know what hey weve shown that we can get downhill lets focus on putting the ball down make sure we have proper spacing and then you see Worley comes out from the beginning puts his head down and goes in for it could potentially be an and one to start off the half best thing that Florida state did in the first half to shoot free throws a perfect 12 for 12 a Taylor Swift 13 for 13 are the seminals and theyre within eight first time theyve been this close in a long long time and again Florida State you would not have thought that as well as Boston causes shooting the ball that you open up the half and theyre down eight for BC you stick to the script make sure you come out spread the ball and keep doing what youre doing dont try to go outside of yourself and make sure you stick with it did you see that last time couldnt post realizing Ive got a little guy on me a little mouse in the house action put the ball on the floor and take him to the rim all right Im gonna make a bigger deal out of this than it probably is but Quentin post needs to start making these free throws he has got a decent chance of being a 50 40 90 guy 50 point 50 shooting from the field 40 behind the arc and 90 at the free throw line but hes got to get to work at the line hes at 86 percent and thatll go up a bit now a message from Coyote Tractor my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo all right Im telling you Im gonna be keeping a close eye on this the rest of the season can Whitton post whos got a great stroke get to 90 of the freethrow line hed be the tallest player by a wide margin to be a 504090 guy in division one and heres what I want to tell you that when I played man I did not leave any crumbs on the table so when I go to the freethrow line Im making sure that I get everything that I can so as a guy in Quinn post is having a great night Im interested to see does he make sure that he does not leaving those crumbs on the table today Creek got it off of Mills who split turnover the defense by Zachary again you realize over there and hes going to come over and watch but get those active hands over there again for Boston College we talked about how physical they are and stars which are point guard and how he gets up in the in the offensive player Zachary last year against Florida State 18 points eight rebounds six assists five steals a historically great game for him hes been relatively quiet this afternoon shot missed inside post missed the tap back but it stays with BC Zachary runs down the loose ball Zachary natural runoff from bills Applause oh thatd be basket interference cam corn couldnt keep his hands out of the cookie jog but heres the thing for Florida State he had a solid defensive possession and then you see cam corn come right there oh yeah a little bit more patience could have given an opportunity its gonna do it you have to like the energy that Florida state has come out with again I cannot over emphasize you see Clinton post realizing hey you know what Im feeling Im gonna put the ball on the floor and try to get to the bucket were scrappiness down there between Zachary and corn all the foul on Zachary Applause Boston College had trouble defending without fouling in the first half Florida State got it the bonus early and made a lot of free throws that was a big factor in the first half of how Florida state was able to at least stay within shouting range of Boston College absolutely and we highlighted Bobby Miller and you see green with the little Runner right there corn thought he was going to give him a chance at alleyoop a league Bay took his hand eyes off the ball lost it stolen away Mills is fouled for the eighth time today they call the foul on post and what weve seen especially in the first half is pulse draw a draw is uh commits his third foul any opportunity Florida state gets into transition theyre going to try to get downhill and when you see a guard has a big guy back pedaling you know thats a great opportunity to be able to go to the cup all right that was handy to note so this is not going to be the announcer Jinx I was handed to note by the Sid dont do it here in Florida State telling me the Caleb Mills has now made 15 consecutive free throws so this would not be the NL through jinx this would be the Sid Jace you can win all these Awards you want but its not on me that is not on me Ill even show you the note folks where I was handed Mills has made 18 consecutive 15 consecutive free throws that goes by the wayside first Miss of the day for Florida State as a club oh my Amos too yeah Ill take credit for one of those one announcer Jinx one sports information director of James Applause empty possession for Florida State still down 10 Ashton Lankford crowded from behind and the foul called its on Baba Miller well I like the fact that Ashton Langford realized he had Baba Miller on him and his will is the seven footer can move his feet he took his time realized he all he had to do was get him to drop that last leg and get by him Florida States done a pretty good job in his second half of playing defense but now for Boston College you can make sure that you take advantage of those mismatches its tough being a young player in the ACC Baba Miller we talked about him beginning of the game opportunity coming off a nice Game 12 points 28 minutes earlier this week but a whole bunch of nothing for Baba this afternoon hes got three fouls head and tempted his shot doesnt have a rebound doesnt have an assist and I think some of that is due to the level of physicality that Boston College is playing with a lot of times he is going to drift outside and for a sevenfooter that wants to shoot the three theyre getting into him and shes through right now Boston College extending their pressure Florida State have a little bit of an issue in involving inbounding the ball bodies flying TJ Bickerstaff hits the deck and it stays with Florida State DC getting greedy putting some pressure on in the back court and Quentin post is going to leave they dont want uh their post player to pick up another foul hes already got three thats not what you did there Music Applause so this is what happens when you give a threepoint shooter a wide open opportunity he saw an opportunity for a Duncan using great pass by Miller you see green out there taking oh yeah 43 steps instead of two just like a threepoint shooter so Boston College trying to run some offense with Quentin post not in the game Applause Mason Matson has checked in Zachary offensive rebound stolen away Chandler Jacksons got it for FSU green much more comfortable doing that and that was him redeemium himself he realized that he missed an opportunity and said you know what Ive got to get some get back right now but again as much as weve talked about Boston College Florida State still hanging around here still getting their hands on balls and Im really impressed with Baba Miller his ability to switch off and stay in front of the smaller guards Applause itll stay with the Eagles Music 10point game and heres another thing when you see the switches Boston College is going to put the big on a small but what Florida state is committed to having the front side come over with weak side help and theyve done a good job and not allowing that whole pass to go in BC they missed their last five shots in the field Ashton Langford dribbled into a crowd its another turnover he has turned the ball over six times this afternoon Jackson off the window and in heres what youve seen is there for Boston College a lot of times 101 penetration Florida state with their long hands are getting in those passing lanes and every chance they get theyre getting downhill and trying to attack the rim Madsen bounce pass before the shot weve got a foul their fouler kickball and watch the active hands you see corn gets his hand in there and then out of that theyre going to get the ball up and you should get it in to be able to finish thats the drive presented by Defender Applause and it was just called a kickball on Florida State so it stays with BC Music Applause CJ Pena now into the ball game for BC number 24 Applause Zachary had his pocket picked another turnover warley Miller missed opportunity for Florida State Madsen and a tie up McLaughlin is tied up with Corin th all right Florida State showing some feistiness they dont want to be embarrassed on their home floor theyve made this a contest its an eightpoint game remember at one point they were down 17 in that first half eight point ball game it will be Boston College basketball Zachary Ashton Langford McLaughlin Madsen and Pena the five on the floor for the Eagles Ashton Lankford starts with it Applause Ashton Lankford keeps the jewel alive shot clock out of five Matson picks up the loose ball Fade Away Madson never got there Pena fights for the rebounder ripped away Bubba Miller what weve seen in the second half as Florida state has come out with a different level of tenacity again going from one end to the other and weve got body upper body on top of body and an offensive foul and you watched his last penetration by Jackson and you see right there I dont know part it looked like he may have been in that uh so lets see right there its a good thing that Im sitting here next to you because I thought that he wasnt set Music Im getting right there look at that foot that Left Foot Right There and the other restricted area potentially close to me BC makes a change guy with the ball new into the game Chaz Kelly the Third Jazz the ACC corookie of the week last week its been quiet this afternoon also into the game Demar Lankford link for playing the first time in three weeks for BC Applause shot clock dips below 10 Zachary Long two finally something Falls thats his first field goal had been open for three in 18 minutes but heres the thing I like about Zacharys game is that he realizes they didnt really have any options offensively realized also knowing that hes got a big on him just a little separation knocks down that jump shot Kelly gets called for the foul trying to stay in front of Morley thats the fourth team foul on BC still playing without Quentin post whos got three fouls Earl Grant just tried to buy some time with his Star Center on the bench Music Caleb Mills back in for Florida State Applause Mills and score the goal basket interference Caleb Mills didnt waste any time trying to get to the basket love that he was able to get over there realize that he had Kelly on him a quick rip through get to the bucket and as much as it seems that Boston College has got control of this game Florida States still doing a good job of hanging right around there all right cut this lead down to eight and here comes Quentin post big man heads to the scores table hell come in next whistle Applause foreign Applause did he get it off in time no shot clock violation empty possession for BC I think the refs are going to take a look at this one because you see that last you see post come back into the game his number for the afternoon 196 for 10 again we talked about the five for five from behind the arc and also six rebounds yeah that a shot will be looked at Demar link for banked it in with the shot clock expiring and you see the zero ooh that looks like he may still have had a fingertip or a fingernail on that ball Music really quick review and the officials come to the agreement that the shot was tardy Applause this was the definitive look at for the zero yep theres the zero on the shot clock ball still in the hand of Demar Langford thank you it scored as a turnover become chronic for Boston College and Florida States got it as much as weve talked about Florida State and how theyve been able to get to the cup if youre Boston College youve got to be able to make sure that you you do not allow Caleb Mills to get to the cup force him to shoot some threepoint shots because the only guy is really a deadly threat is green for the threepoint shot the tax post whos got three fouls smart play by Mills the foul is not going to be on Mills its going to be on Kelly but that looked like Leonard Hamilton said to Caleb Mills Quentin posted in the game wed like to get him out of there see if we can get a foul on it and heres the thing a lot of times when you run big on little uh Postman excuse me scream if youve got him you want to get downhill force him to either defend you or you get an easy run at The Rim so the follows on Kelly is fourth he has to leave the game Applause Music Applause Mills that is the ninth time today Im making it up that is the ninth time today that he has been fouled by a BC Defender but heres where well tell you when youre a guy and you know that youve got that feeling no one can guard you and youre going to get filed Caleb Mills realizes that if I can get spread regardless of whos in front of me Im going to try to penetrate and get to the cup because Im either going to get a bucket or someones going to foul yourself yeah Florida States now the bonus next time they get fouled itll be free Pros having to hit the 13minute mark of our second half and thats really early again as you see green trying to get trying to get him started Ashton Langford on the run out the overplay ball knocked away from post saves the BC Applause Music all right Applause last Touch by Florida State one of the things we havent talked a lot about is that periodically youll see Baba Miller squish down on the guard the seven footer has done a pretty accurate adequate job today and being able to stay in front of the guards from BC and not allow them to get by him Leonard Hamiltons gonna go with two seven Footers you get Bob Miller the baby seven footer at seven on the nose you get nahim McLeod at 74 joining him on the floor a baby seven foot I love it shot clock is at six Music post turns it over Worley green Applause Boston College able to survive a bad turnover weve seen a lot of Florida State doing a good job of being able to get hands on the ball and we talked about how they get back into this game itll still eight point game for Boston College so like you got to give Quentin Polster a touch right now a post touch there it is score the goal youre brilliant Brian Oliver you ever buy a lottery ticket when were done but I love the fact that they were able to swing the ball to the top of the Kiwi calls that that pass to the rim there was no weak side helping allowed him to go right over that guard Caleb Mills weaves inside and draws another foul unbelievable Mills has been a foul magnet well have free throws on the other side again when you need to get your Mana pass you see weak side help there is none again pulses put his imprint BC up Valley Sports South welcome back everyone 11 56 remaining in our ball game Florida State trying to figure out a way against Boston College Blue Cross Blue Shield North Carolina presents the upcoming schedule for the BC Eagles next game is going to be Wednesday against Virginia thats return game Eagles have an X too theres a grind with that Virginia team and that early matchup Quinn pulse had a huge first half but he couldnt hold on Virginia won that but then when you look at at wake this wake teams got a pivotal game against Miami Florida State this is what theyve got next theyve got a full week off not going to be back in the short fancy until next Saturday where they head down state to take on Miami and that Miami game is going to be a huge game for them and then Carolina and then they finish up at Virginia Tech thats why todays game is really important for both teams sitting at six and ten in the league Quinton posts remains in the game he has got a gamehigh 21 points four in the second half look at that perfect five for five threepoint shooting in the first half second leading scorer in our games at the freethrow line Caleb Mills for Florida State 18 points eight of his 18 points coming at the freethrow line he has been fouled officially as the official number 11 different times thats a lot of hacking hes been in the game for 26 minutes and two seconds and in that time hes been fouled 11 times its going to be filled with one big bruise tomorrow morning extended time in the ice tub hes 10 for 2 is a free throw shooter Music moderate pressure in the backcourt weve talked a lot about the pressure from Florida State and how theyve been able to force BC into 16 turns you see what the 17th turnovers and that was one of the things earlier is that for Boston College they started out shooting the ball really well Florida State again chipping away at this thing with their defense interesting to see can they capitalize on yet another DC turnover C averages 12 turnovers per game theyve passed that Mark a long time ago Caleb Mills again looking for a foul did come miss the layup Miller misses the tap stays at Florida State Worley oh nice nice by warley Applause see someone go down on the side and Im not sure if thats its Mills Mills right there Applause and again watch the penetration you see right there Then Florida State doing a good job of keeping that ball alive that last time Jalen Worley a little bit of Up and Under Quinn polls realizing he cant foul in Florida State finally gotten this thing under six with looks like could have been another another turnover if youre bossing College settle down run your offense dont do too much and continue to spread the ball out Applause BC led by as many as 19 back in the first half now only up by six again shot clock dips below 10 skip pass into the corner post gonna have to put it up didnt realize shot clock violation turnover number 18 for BC and his thing is that you see Florida State basically make them go east and west that last opportunity when post got it they immediately doubled not realizing that he was under five on the shot clock and this has been the tale of the second half for Florida State already forcing BC into 18 turnovers cut that lead into six every head coach in college basketball will say there comes a point in every game where adversity happens but for Earl Grants PC Eagles the adversity is right now they are limping still have a six point lead but Florida State on the charge green needs help in the corner the big man McLeod Music Mills is relentless oh Applause what a diamond what a finish talking about mama and his ability to Lynn great finish Mills to Miller that is a highlight fourpoint game in Tallahassee and again you talk about the Florida state coming in Caleb Mills says that you know what man Im not dropping nickels or pennies Im dropping dimes Florida State carbon deck Music South presented by your local Ford dealer welcome back everyone and that is where the momentum is in the building Leonard Hamiltons Florida State Seminoles theyve got the tiger by the tail right now theyve come charging back it is a fourpoint game with plenty of time to do some damage a lot of it has been Florida States ability to turn over Boston College first half you saw that Boston College shot the lights out of it second half Florida State thats up the temple defensively and being able to get downhill on them and again A lot of it was Caleb Mills but hes got some help now in the second half stay tuned weve got a fast break coming your way presented by your local Ford dealer well get you ready for our second game today its going to be just down the way Wake Forest at Miami important one for both sides Paulson college has gotten a little out of sorts as of late with their offense again I feel like anytime you give Quinn post a touch nothing from Busker bucket or let that guy get to the cup and finish off Makai Ashton Langford much needed bucket last time down the floor Florida state had that great assist by Caleb Mills was handed a note just the second assist for Florida State as a team today but coming out of that last time out and you see Boston College in the zone two assists in 30 minutes from a program that produced Sam Cassell and Charlie Ward and Bobby Sarah well heres heres the thing is that when you see this last played by Ashland Langford realize hes got a big on him a lot of times put your head down and they just get right to the basket but back to your point with the low assist a lot of it is unassisted because theyre getting right to the bucket for finishes youre right Caleb Mills thats been their major offense give it to Mills let him go to the cup and weve got a foul situation that is Baba Miller number four looked like he was trying to get out of his uh little shell here in the second half but now hes gonna have to cool his heels for a while just two points two rebounds for Bob Miller and now he sits with four fouls Music BC has not made a threepointer in the second half how about the job by Green down there on the fronting of posts took away that that option Langford Miss delaya Chandler Jackson the other way Florida States in the bonus betcha Dodd and Balor that Caleb Mills knows that in attack mode missed for the left hand Applause green keeps it McLeod great fights by the big man just cant keep it with Florida State a little scrappy down there but another basket good defensive possession by Boston College coming over to that play and rebound foreign knocked to the floor so in Boston College searching for offense it has been Makai Ashton Lankford the grad transfer who has taken the basketball right to the rack and been fouled but heres the thing how hes able to do that because every time they try to get the ball in the Clinton post hes being fronted ending that weak side guys coming over ball gets swung and it allows one of those guards to try to get downhill and penetrate 87 percent at the line Applause Music Applause number three Music Florida State they bring Camp corn back into the game nahim McLeod leaves oh my Ashton Langford 87 percent misses a pair Applause Mills oh good defense by Ashland Langford stands solid right there hell try to get him to bite on the pump fate Jackson Music cleared in the corner Ashton Lankford gets it to his brother behind the defense great read by Langford realized that Lee Bay was able to get behind the defense and for someone that athletic you just throw it up and let him go get it youre from Minneapolis and your name is Prince you know youre special eightpoint game uhoh and thats foreign not only is it a foul on post his fourth but because of the bonus its going to be free throws so free throws for Florida State down by eight when we return Music all right time now for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer our bag is bursting on a Saturday in the ACC coming up next weve got a great one in Coral Gables Wake Forest traveling to Miami to take on the Hurricanes both teams need this win but I want to say that wake probably needs it more last year missing the NCAA tournament they dont have any quad win victories this is a huge game for them against a Miami team thats ranked 15th in the country youve got both teams The Specialist Miami team that plays well at home with that backcourt of long and Pat they are dangerous they put up points and buckets in numbers man this is going to be a high impact game with both teams is to pin heavily on the point from their backboard because they wont those want to get up and down the score and this is going to be a high energy game and when you look at the numbers for both of them Kyrie Appleby 18 points the 36 minutes a game but then again when you look at Isaiah Wong and when he does partner 16 points a game as well Tyree Appleby gets in hey just for attendance he plays over 90 percent of the minutes 36 out of the 40 minutes he is available for his head coach he got it like that in a college player all right an important one for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons as they head down to South Florida wake in Miami back with more right after this word from your local Ford dealer in America Florida State down by eights under eight to play 7 39 in our game they do have free throws coming for Chandler Jackson Fresh Market presents discover the best how about Caleb Mills he has got 20 points with half of his points coming at the freethrow line and when it looked like early in the first half that they were going to get shot out to Jim it was Caleb Mills and I thought they put this Florida State team on his back to allow them to narrow the Gap he picked up in the second half again already 20 points as you said has drawn already 10 fouls interested in C especially with pulse with the fourth foul how does this game turn with him in the game and his ability to get to the cup free throw opportunity for I thought it was actually Chandler Jackson but its going to be Darren Green at the line all right not too much of acquittal this is a oneonone for green 88 as a free throw shooter something good stock his father played at George Washington back in the day previous college experience played for ACC Legend Johnny Dawkins oh my GCF JC and JD was my point guard my days in Philly again for Florida State down six interesting for Boston College now with post on the on the bench with four fouls where do they go for scoring because when he was on the bench struggled to find some type of offensive consistency blocked away from behind Corin takes it sixpoint game green explodes Jackson back to green Music Mills darts in the paint and another foul 11th time that he has drawn contact and hell go to the line shooting a oneonone CPI Security press protecting the paint what do you got Brian again you watch the defense and how about the block by coin coming up right there again when you see the defense that theyve been able to play especially in the second half they come up with big play and theyre blocked by Cohen for allow Florida State to be able to impact this game so again clock stops 701 left in our game free throw opportunity 11 for Mills I had no doubt hes now one away from his season High one shot straight in straight in Applause Middles good looking stroke a movie if youre gonna get as many foul calls against you youve got to be able to make the throws but heres my thing earlier Boston College went to a Zone not sure why they went away from that because in that zone then youre inviting Florida State to shoot the three in the mantoman theyve shown that you have a hard time being able to contain the dribble and then on this end of the floor where are you going for buckets now that you dont have been post on the on the floor Zachary the clock dead scored the goal and a foul great boy did the Eagles leave that talking about they needed that one McLaughlin coming up with that offensive rebound watch this last play you see Florida State people and ball Falls right down to McLaughlin gathers himself going a little late on the rotation comes up with the possibility for an in one much needed bucket for a team that struggled offensively stronger than 10 rows of onions lead is six with a free throw coming all right BC some wind in their sails right now Applause Music Baba Miller back into the game Millers playing with four fouls this is a freshman does he have the wherewithal and we talked earlier for Leonard Hamilton hes got to make sure that rotation wise the guys are on the floor he give them a blow it periodically you see Mills throwing up that three there Florida State still with just one made threepointer theyre one for 10 its an issue theyve done a better job of holding Boston College without a three here in the second half PC made eight first half threes Madsen and a pushup yeah they saw that in the upper deck McLaughlin the pushoff and will come the other way Music and heres the thing we talked about Florida State already being in the in the bonus too how does that play for them in this last less than six minutes again ancient Im sorry any chance you can get to put points on the board with the clock stop is always a good thing Winton posts only thing holding it back is fouls he is one of three Boston College eagles with four fouls Kelly Ashton Lankford and post all one foul away from dismissal and if youre Earl Grant you try to buy yourself some time run the clock get some stops Id bring post Banks probably about the three and a half minute mark basically everyone on Florida state has turned into George McLeod at the free throw line team they are 21 of 23 by the elite Elite sports information director who will go unnamed the only two misses from Florida State fivepoint game Boston College trying to win for a second consecutive year against Florida State Applause all three BCE with four fouls not in the game as we speak and they commit another turnover man and if youre Earl Grant over there the time cannot pass fast enough again you say yet another turnover fivepoint game give Florida State an opportunity to cut this thing down to three possibly two and he decides to bring him in Quinn pulls back into a game saying you know what Im not going to allow this one to slip away Florida state has shot 28 percent from the field but theyre in this because of what theyve done at the free throw line and all of the turnovers committed by BC Mills is fouled again and heres the thing if youre Earl Grant you have to tell your guys you have to defend without fouling because again the one God has shown that he has been hard to guard Caleb Mills as you go on and then you talk about the fact that 21 for 23 from the line 22 points per Mills over half his points have come right here at the stripe post back into the game look at that 10 next to uh BCs name right there theyre 53 points that 10 means 10 fouls that means double bonus for the rest of the game final more than a quarter of our second half every single time that BC fouls Florida state two free throws and you look at those numbers by Quentin post 21 points and four four fouls and so heres the thing that from BC Im gonna run some plays with trying to get them back out on the perimeter because in the post Florida States doing a good job of fronting him and with weak side help allowing him to get a touch when hes not focused on that weak side we can get the ball to him two feet in the paint not to Zachary McLaughlin as a mansized shot oh my score it with a foul if thats on Miller hes done what a pivotal moment and watch that last penetration you saw Miller had to come over because he was fronting late on the penetration McLaughlin had already got to the rim watch the play Miller comes over late Applause Millers gonna have to take a seat short afternoon for him Baba Miller finishes with more fouls than points and rebounds combined in his game two points two rebounds five fouls learning experience for the youngster from Mallorca oldfashioned threepoint play Florida States now down seven Chandler Jackson back in to run the point in last possession right now Austin College in what looks like a Zone understanding that theyre going to challenge Florida State to shoot the ball from outside and try to limit the penetration Music good at getting into the paint cant finish corn but heres the thing Jackson was able to get to the basket forced The Bigs to come over and help corn comes up no one puts a body on and allows him to get that put back coast and Kelly both on the floor with four fouls for BC Music Applause Zacharys been known to make a big shot in this post wide open in the corner Matson elbow extended got him nice shot by Madsen because hes such a deadly threepoint shooter you have to honor that he was able to put the ball on the floor get the defender to bite on the pump fake to get that shot up Maddens Nails grappling his guts Applause Florida State down seven the way theyre shooting the ball from Deep thats a big big margin weve only made one threepointer loose Jackson sent to the floor clean somehow most just blocked out of bounds oh wow BC may have caught a break can you see Jackson on the penetration you see post comes over oh it looked like it was my man Zachary we got a close one partner all right were gonna hang on they lead Florida State 5851 332 remaining the drive of the game presented by Defender you can see great ball moving by Boston College Devin McLaughlin comes in initiating contact was able to finish for the and one Baba Miller goes out but great drive by McLaughlin for the and one to allow BC to maintain their lead not only three points for BC but it takes Bobby Miller out of the game Miller getting extended playing time with Matthew Cleveland not in uniform for the second consecutive game all right lets set it up three seconds on the shot clock for Florida State clearly they know this coming out of the timeout Id run something to try to get green a jump shot maybe up back to a pin down allow him to come off or roll for a lob at The Rim trigger man Jalen Worley Music oh with two on the shot clock that is a gut punch for Boston College Id have to see that one again oh that play was going nowhere for Florida State talk about a bailout you see right there you see a little bit a little bit of a hold there by post on Jackson Music you see right there and you see holding off and then getting caught ah its hard being a seven footer well Chamberlain used to say nobody roots for Goliath Quinton post is done hes gonna finish his ball game with 21 points remember he made five consecutive threes in our first half but he is no longer a part of the mix double bonus two free throws coming for Chandler Jackson freshman from Memphis Applause everyone has made their free throws for Florida State except for Caleb Mills now Mills gets a little bit of a pass because hes been there 16 times well heres the thing is that their defense and the turnover and the free throws have really kept Florida State as he still gets that one to go are you looking for the game 10 Applause something so fivepoint game pressure in the backcourt BC playing without quitting post both teams have lost a player due to fouls Ashton Langford whos got the ball hes got four fouls and heres the thing for Boston College the clock is your friend you run your set give yourself enough time to be able to try to make a play shot clock down to four Ashton Langford and a foul called on Florida State it looks like Caleb Mims may get called for going over the back from McLaughlin and solid defense but youve got to come up with that off that rebound so Caleb Mills who has been filed himself 12 times called for just his second foul this is a one and one one and one for McLaughlin 73 free throwing confident dont forget coming up next weve got another game coming your way just down the road down to Miami weve got Wake Forest playing an important game for that program taking on the Hurricanes thats a fair fight a couple good backcourts Devin McLaughlins had a solid afternoon 126 boards and has been that guy that when theyve not had a post in the game has given them a nice little boost especially from the Kyle four position you see and no call right there on Zachary final three minutes of our game Caleb Mills slips BCs got it numbers Zachary Madsen Applause all right McLaughlin first on the floor taken away by Jackson Applause can Florida State find a little bit offense this would be nice too strong for green looked like it was right online and a foul going for the rebound its going to go against Florida state that would have been a big shot if green had knocked that down all right this is what its going to look like you get Tyree Appleby leading the ACC in his first year playing at Wake Forest close to 19 points per ball game with six assists I mean talk about a walking bucket you see his numbers almost 19 a game in the six dimes man he puts a lot of pressure on the defense with his ability to get to the cup and knock down the three ball big moment of the freethrow line for the Freshman Chaz Kelly misses the front end of a oneonone youd think that Florida state has a chance here but the way that their offense has been all afternoon long you just gotta Wonder wheres Leonard Hamilton gonna find it his team is shooting 28 they have made one out of 11 from behind the threepoint line if I go into the Huddle of Earl Grant first I may come out with a Zone understanding that this like you said this Florida State team does not shoot at boil from behind the arc make sure I send everyone in for rebounds for Florida State you got to find a way to get some quick buckets and then even though green is not shot it well see if we can get him going and again its the early the comeback was the their ability to be able to get some stops and get some early buckets green was one of those guys but then the get downhill very aggressive was one of the things that I thought that Florida State used for their advantage with the turnovers and getting Nifty plays like this breaking down and getting everyone those easy buckets right now but Florida state has done a good job now go right back to that and send your bigs to the offensive glass on those challenges at The Rim Florida State 24 made free throws a new season High 24 for 27 at the line but free throws over going to get you so far you need to score in multiples of twos and threes when youre down by seven with 214 remaining Isaiah Wong getting some shots up just like Applebees really good year 600 points in his college career thats coming up next Wake Forest taking on the 15th ranked team of the country files have been a huge story two guys have already fouled out baba Miller for Florida State Clinton post for Boston College BC two players with four fouls Chaz Kelly and Makai Ashton Langford you you watch her or was it hes sitting there hes getting down you know he wants to get out of here with this win hes coaches guys from the sideline already in the defensive position green gets the screen Jackson Worley nice teardrop nice bucket nice penetration by Jackson Olson Collins is already got 19 turnovers Florida State being able to capitalize with 13 points off the turns you stay solid from BC where do you go for a bucket right now madsons a pretty good option oh Applause last Touch by Florida State and New Orleans beside himself our Worley an opportunity cut the lead down to three again we were just talking for BC already 19 turnovers at Twin watch him get there and then opportunity for him and Ashland Langford you just go in and try to come up with that with a missed opportunity for Florida State trying to get the ball back the foul commit it McLaughlin goes to the line and this is now the double bonus so two free throws a little bit of pressure taken off McLaughlin hes perfect at the line this afternoon looks perfect too see how that works you know I said perfect and then you know no color analysts thing howd you look at The Strokes thats a good looking stroke hes going to make this more often than not thats a free throw right there folks McLaughlin makes a pair seven point game final 90 seconds Worley tried to atone thank you Applause Music Jackson fouled from behind McLaughlin got him Jackson can do a lot of things in the ACC in the next handful of years that body is he is a freshman listed at 65215 and he looks solid again and talk about his ability to absorb contact hes got a nice little burst going to the basket two important free throws his parents were huge fans of the TV show Friends thats how he got his name his name for Chandler Bing from Friends love it I got nothing Im not making enough folks all right one more coming out makes a pair and its a fivepoint game still plenty of time you know what five five points get BC you got to get the ball in nice play gets the ball into and Zachary is fouled hard and this is going to be reviewed Jade and Zachary knew he was going to get uh fouled and he is fouled hard and all the way he takes them all the way to the ground nice how to bounce play in the game watch it right there does he make a play on the ball came across those arms that may be deemed excessive I have two guys who have played a lot of basketball knowing the importance of that play and Darren Green know hes going to be called for the foul but is this a foul Plus well what this does is it gives both sides a chance to catch their breath and hes come up with a plan 116 left in our game second half has been close throughout DC built a 19 point lead in the first half and Florida state has whittled it away one time getting within as close as four Music looking at Zacharys numbers has not attempted a free throw today only has two points does have five assists and three rebounds Applause just from where I said that seems excessive I understand that that he was going for the foul and I think theyre going to look at whether he actually made a play on the ball I think the play for Darren Green may have been considering how fast Zachary was going almost like play as if youre gonna follow him let your hands back I like pulling the chair out I had to take my odds of that Zacharys a good free throw shooter hes a gutty player all right this is what were talking about big difference in the game top shelf eight of 17 threepoint shots made for Boston College compare that to Florida State as a team theyve made one out of 11 from behind the yard in the first half we were talking about how Boston College was shooting the lights out of it and then Florida State doing a better job but then you look in the second half nine of 12 on layup attempts then we talked about Caleb Mills with 23 points the turnovers for Florida State and being able to get down Hills will allow them to be able to get back in the game because statistically they didnt really shoot the ball that well but they were able to capitalize on the turnovers just a reminder we got another game coming your way voice Forest at Miami an important one really for both sides you get Miami 15th ranked team in the country they dont want to stub their toe but wait no Grants over there trying to see if he can do pull his best Lip lip reading and try to get to a forum right there and I think theyre gonna go back all right the decisions been made and were going to get the input Music all right so after uh much thought and contemplation its deemed to be a common foul common foul two shots I guess you were right that Partners I actually thought that that was a little bit more I just thought the defense played by Darren Green as of the Lloyd Zachary is going maybe a little bit out of control I would have taken my odds that maybe hed missed the layup and heres the thing Zachary has not been at the freethrow line this afternoon interested to see again they definitely need these two zephyrs the type of player didnt miss refills down to stretch game when he gave a scholarship offer this is what he said late in games Jayden youre making free throws for me so that makes it makes it tipped pass Finds Its way to Green nothing falling Madson cant Corral the rebound green able to keep it finally something Falls for Darren Green there you go two four dollar and again from Florida State you want to be able to trap Zachary is fouled again Applause and heres the thing how about the say about Jackson whats this and then green gets it realizes that hey just pick it up and let it go Im telling you that reminded me of Dennis Scott back when you played in the Georgie nice call nice call but watch he kind of tippy toes there doesnt put his heels on the floor and just comes right back up and what a play agreeing to knock down that shot so Zachary back for a pair shoots those with the Swagger of a NASCAR veteran been there won that lead is back up to five not only gravel is guts but spit in his eye and heres the thing you see Boston College extends a little bit if you imagine you stay close to Green second smell Applause is he behind the yarn are they gonna give him three free throws oh my God interesting to see they are going to give him three free throws and you see this last play and if youre see if if youre Ashton Langford you dont bite on that you realize that Mills is not a threepoint shooter once he bit on the pump fake then he got you off the ground Ashton Langford just fought out so this is just a disastrous time down the floor for Boston College and now post has already filed out Ashton Langston Langford just fouled out and now youre going to get three free throws for one of the best freethrow Shooters in the conference in Caleb Mills and youve lost your top two scores and then probably one of your better perimeter Defenders now with 46 seconds left to go Florida States got a chance to cut this lead down to three if Mills makes all three he will set the new Florida state ACC record for free throws made in a game the record currently is 15 by Al Thornton did it against Duke back in March of 2006 mils has made 14 free throws I was like you know what he still could make this one in tie Florida States ACC record all right move aside Al Thornton youve got company Al Thornton Caleb Mills now with the school record more importantly its a fourpoint game and a foul in the backcourt will walk the other way and have double bonus free throws for Mason Madsen Music is that Madsen is that McLaughlin going to the power to the free throw line I thought it was Matson and the way hes walking down the floor nope it is McLaughlin let me see if it works for me because he has been perfect at the line eight for eight not sure hes hit the rim either Applause hit the rim but it still comes again obviously Florida State wants to try to extend this game but when he gets to be a free throw shooting contest you want your best free throw Shooters to come to the ball McLaughlin knocks that down McLaughlin did 10 for 10 at the freethrow line weve had a combined 59 free throws Jackson the misfire and a league Bay is foul so a league Bay will come the other way and shoot two times first free throws of the game for a league Bay 61 for the freshman at the line and leeways had a solid afternoon 77 rebounds 13 two important free throws for him this happened to seal this win getting an update from Miami good start for the Hurricanes they lead Wake Forest 1312 well get you that game immediately at the conclusion of this one Music Applause youre slightly still open there Applause one out of two for a league Bay Boston College you want to extend you do not want to get Florida State just free ones you want them to use a little time youre at the floor and you stay solid you do not want to foul green missed everything BC ball Applause Music so weve gone under 30 seconds shot clock is off the remainder of Regulation the balls in college you want to get the ball in and forth Florida State to foul use Tom house will come in he replaces Worley Florida State you want to try to get the ball in the corners for us a quick trap to see if you can get it easy steal if not then you immediately foul and try to extend this game smart play by Zachary uh is that going to be off but BC it is yeah you see house came in great tip I think by what may have been Mills and then house push the ball off of them and Florida state has the ball and now Florida State wants to call a is this a timeout or just using the stop it yeah officials are going to make sure that that ball was indeed off of Boston College and Florida State will use it as a defecto timeout to draw something up accident last play what looks to be Jackson gets his hand on the ball and then house comes over presence of mind to knock it off from McLaughlin again a lot to play about a house right there Florida State ball so the original call on the floor was Florida State Ball the indisputal video evidence to overturned I dont think that exists so its going to be Florida State basketball down by seven 264 remaining wow that is a great shot thats the one you need right there looks like the ball wanted to go off of top house but it went right through the legs Music all right Boston College their only win here in Tallahassee long time ago 16 years Music must be a big win for Earl Grant his team has gone four and four in their last eight games all ACC games so you win today you go five and four nine game stretch a lot of road games itll be over 500 in late play whats huge is for them to get another road win and again this could push them to seven and ten with what looks to be with three or four more games and when we talked to him early looking for consistency from his team we steamed put Florida state with the ball weve seen stranger things happen 258 on the game clock house fires loose Corin Pennies from Heaven Florida State calls a quick timeout Seminole still think theyve got a chance fivepoint game final 197 46 years straight more arrested Ford Fseries trucks to help save the day stretch the weekend Hall ortone just about anything anywhere thats because theyre built for tough and its why Ford F series are Americas bestselling trucks 46 years straight and for that we thank you get two nine for 60 plus up to 2500 with eligible tradein learn more about pickup and delivery and remote service at your local Ford dealer thank you its been an unusual game here on a Saturday afternoon the Tucker center Tallahassee Florida the locals down by five Seminoles can have to play some defense look for a steal if they cant get one commit a quick foul both sides have been in the double bonus for a while now Applause we saw the last play Florida State being able to get that turnover Jackson got his hand on the ball and we see the alignment from Boston College Madison is fouled in the corner Matson is a really good outside shooter but not necessarily Elite as a free throw shooter 71 percent and the foul committed by cam Corinth his fifth hes done both sides have had two men foul out Corin and Miller for Florida State Post and Ashton Lankford for BC if for some reason we get to overtime where do we run out of players let me look for Charlie Ward get a uniform Applause shooter that looked nice Matson makes a pair Applause Florida State on life support need a bucket right here Music and Memphis all game long just be getting fouled time and time again he needs one free throw here gonna have two to set a new Florida state ACC record for free throws made in a game but heres the thing if Im Earl Grant I tell my guys to to defend without fouling because we do not want that clock to stop youre up seven so thats your new ACC record for Fritos made in a game 16 for Caleb Mills hes 16 for 20 hes had 14 shots in the field and 20 freethrow attempts that is now 35 times he shot the ball either at the line or from the field fivepoint game final 12 seconds and Zachary is fouled so Zachary will come the other way and shoot free throws a combined 65 free throws with two more coming Earl Grants team on the road is going to attempt 33 free throws maybe more Florida state has already shot 34 free throws and made 30 of them cant say enough about Jaden Zachary off day offensively just one for five shooting but when yes going to make a late game free throw automatic from A to Z Jayden Zachary Florida State quickly the other way maybe the final shot of our game green splashes a three will take calls a timeout thats a fourpoint game threepoint one remaining in green still with a glimmer of hope for Florida State actually I think that for Leonard Hamilton you try to draw up something and you see this last play see the penetration by Mills touches the paint gets out the green realize that he does not have time on his side unless it Fly again great penetration you see Madison a little late Marine gets it up Darren Green had made one of his first nine threepoint attempts hes made his last two so its been a while but its been worth the wait for Florida State he keeps his team in it you know thats thats saying better late than never so Boston College they need to inbound the ball they need to survive contact maybe make a free throw but they cant slip up here fourpoint game maybe a young mistake there by Chaz Kelly he inbounded it to the worst freethrow shooter on the floor yeah I thought about that you know getting the ball over to a league Bay and then theyre talking about it I thought that that play would have been to basically get the ball over to Zachary whyd you pass it to me so Elite Bay 61 at the line hell have two double bonus BC almost cant screw this up right theyre up four Florida state does not have a timeout they can advance it so this is kind of it Applause okay there you go Prince a league Bay slams the door shut on Florida State fivepoint game 22 remaining this is gonna be the first win for Boston College here in this building since 2007 congratulations to Earl Grant and the Eagles Applause in a league Bay saying youre right to pass it to me theres our final shot of the game Jackson Off the Mark and this one is in the books 7569 is your final score hope you enjoyed it from a partner Brian Oliver Im Eric Collins now lets send you to Coral Gables where Tom wormy is standing by and we welcome those
