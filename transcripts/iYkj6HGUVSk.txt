in black and gold Virginia in the home white and we are underway to start what is a terrific Saturday filled with basketball and its the Demon Deacons that start with the ball this is a downhill driving Wake Forest team four players in double figures theyre very balanced offensively go inside to Fon Reed backing down Miner in trouble Miner all over him Reed finally puts it up and in to open the scoring really good patience good cutting off the entry pass to the post Eon Reeds got to be confident with that left hand Virginia had their eight game winning streak snapped on Tuesday at the hands of Pittsburgh big bounceback opportunity today at Applause home cam hild with the Isaac McNeely matchup keep your eye on number 11 in white hes their best threepoint shooter for Virginia Ryan D Wiggles free hes a pro prospect that a lot of people are high on what youre going to get today from both these teams is a clinic in cutting they are excellent Cutters off the ball its the basket cut the scoring cut then its the exit cut to the threepoint line great ball movement Salis lines up the three but Way Off the Applause Mark they go naked side twoman game but they dont like to score too quickly they like to use the shot clock does Virginia bro steps out for three and knocks it Applause down one of the things Wake Forest did very well in their first matchup is Run Virginia off the threepoint line into their shot blocking presence which is eon now Wake Forest won that match up back on January 13th 6647 they didnt handle the ball very well in that game turned it over 17 times still won by nearly 20 Steve forb said even when you beat a team like that you know you cant turn it over that many times you cant give him extra possessions thats for sure and this is a great recognition by Ryan Dunn right here Id say they dont like to take quick shots but if you get a mismatch and transition because you push Ryan Dunn pulls the trigger on this one to get to the Applause line well after Tony Bennetts team lost that game at Wiston Salem they ripped off eight straight wins Big Catalyst to that was Jordan Miner coming into the lineup giving the Cavaliers a much needed boost in the front Court when you look at that eightgame winning streak what do you attribute it to I think Jordan Miner being able to mix up their coverages in the post which changes their pressure on the perimeter I think one of the things that we talk about a lot with with Virginia as theyre scheming but basically they have some of the best ball pressure one through five of any team in the league they bring at every Applause possession back down low the re through a double team he has all four to start this game for the Demon Deacons now bopy Miller making an excellent decision right there keeps his dribble alive until Reed can shape up to the ball is there a better name in the ACC than boy M no theres notman getting the better of poopy there this going to be a tough match up for roie cuz Cameron hildr is a downhill driver up to Reed who hammers it home Fon Reed has all six for Wick they have gone to the big man early back at his home state of Virginia and the sevenfooter has delivered so far MC Neil he so good on that curl action for Virginia hildr doing a really good job staying on his hip cant give him any space shot clock down to five mcney in attack mode Wiggles free and it rolls in for Isaac mcne Virginia has started this game a perfect four for four from the floor I think Isaac mcneel has really added to his game off the bouns hes not just a threepoint Applause threat now Virginias made all four of their shots to start this game in Wake Forest is three of four so both teams dialed in offensively to start this Music one with Frederickson coming in the game I really good threepoint shooter 92 of the shots that Parker Frederickson The Freshman takes are outside the ark so you got to really run at him and close his space you talk about knowing your role Frederick said the Freshman certainly does back into Reed he has all of Wake Forest points straight up in post by miner he lost his shoe and Miner with terrific defense and Reed has to run back and play defense with one shoe on nobodys picked it up its still sitting there so that means you go right to minor right I would think its dead and mcney long two and he Cates Applause it Isaac mcne reads cuts under take a look at what ESPNs bracketologist Joe lonardi has and Wake Forest is the first team out a win today would move them into Lenards projected Applause field Virginia who spent much of this season on the bubble comfortably in the field right now as an eight Applause seed Ryan Dunn doing a really good job on Hunter Salis theres the double to the block on Carr and he travels so its a good change by Tony Bennett even with Miner on the floor not the indicator that he will only play straight up in the post they played Fon Reed straight up but they double Andrew Carr its a good change coming off the timeout Dante Harris a transfer from Georgetown into the game for the whoos not expecting the ball Frederickson battling for it and the demon Deacon steal it Applause away first turnover for Virginia today they turn it over less than any team in the country eight times a game part of that is Pace driven but its also really good ball security and its what you emphasiz every day in practice Salis in attack mode right to the rim for two I think he is such a big time player in this league he has had a fantastic season his the system that Steve Ford plays fits Sals game perfectly third in the conference with scoring nearly 19 points per game he has had 10 points or more and every time hes touched the court for Wake Forest heres Jordan Miner trying to muscle his way in great defense by Reed really good job to wall up and epon Reed has been in a little bit of foul trouble the last couple of games did foul out of the Duke game they need him on the floor to give them that threelevel defensive presence Applause hildr spins his way free couldnt quite squeeze it to read Harris making a good choice Applause Music there Ryan dun lines up a three Off the Mark and Ryan done just a 24 threepoint shooter not necessarily his game he looks at his teammates he goes my bad thats the kind of leadership that Ryan D will give you he knows that he had a ball in his hands late in the clock shot clock down to seven heres Salis wake for is go to guy pull up pop cant hit it offensive rebound Carr Carr had 12 rebounds the last time these two teams played he was terrific on the inside ildr thats all ball goes flying into the crowd and ruled Virginia ball coming up at 4 Eastern over on ESPN our terrific day of basketball continues number six Kansas taking on Oklahoma and then Kentucky and Auburn is our Sonic Blockbuster at six thatll be a great one by the way Jay will you dont have to win a championship to be great just throwing it out there if Caitlyn Clark doesnt win the title that doesnt mean that theyre not shes not great what she did this week was absolutely amazing and and becoming the ncaas alltime leading scorer on the womens side Applause amen mcney fading away cant connect Virginia started five for five now theyve missed three in a row theyve cooled off and Wake Forest has dialed in defensively and Monsanto for Wake Forest is on the floor now thats their threepoint threat theyve got two on the court right now which really stretches that Virginia Defense horizontally not so much vertically two guys who are not shy to let it Applause Music fly brogues tangled up with Monsanto no Applause Music whistle always a threat to shoot left it short there Monsanto Monsanto has 14 triples in his eight this is his eighth game coming back from injury hes 0 for one from the twopoint range so hes going to fire away hes got deep range offensive foul on the screen so wave off the three home fans dont like it Virginia leading by three Debbie Antonelli Jay alter with you this made three by Jake Groves was waved off because of the screen set by Blake Buchanan and during the timeout Virginia head coach Tony Bennett took issue with it we dont usually see Tony get this agitated but you know hes not 100 hes a little bit under the weather and uh this is a time of year where everybodys agitated right the refs are tired the coaches are put making a push and uh Tony got a chance to speak to all three of them there in the timeout so lets see yeah the officiating crew today Bill cumington Tony Henderson and Mark Schnur I think you said it best Debbie its that time of year you try and block out the noise as much as possible but these are two teams that know that a win today would really really help not only their NCAA tournament resume but help get them into the critical double buy for the ACC tournament and thats the thing with both of these teams you cant be worried about all the noise about the NCAA the net and and all the stuff that jool Lenards talking about right now what you need to be focused on is every possession next Applause possession and in a lowscoring game you wave off a threepointer like that a threepoint lead would have turned to a sixpoint lead I think coach Bennett was just looking for clarification on an illegal screen boopy Miller back into the game for Wake Forest and a screen called a foul going the other way ball back to Virginia well Matthew Martian the game hes picks up a foul on an illegal screen Matthew Marshs minutes have picked up up the last three games last four games really cuz Fon Reed has been playing with a little bit of foul trouble but also coach Forbes told us hes earned it in practice and Monsanto is going to get called J for the cylinder Music rule which by the way I love that call I love the rule cuz I like Applause offense the Virginia started this game perfect five for five from the floor but theyve missed their last three beakman trying to change it and he does the floater Falls pman working really well in the Twan with Buchanan and that twist action in the middle third of the floor which is really hard to guard its hard to bring help Miller trying to answer all by himself bill Ovington checking the left arm of Dante Harris tells him he has to come out of the Applause game watch this twist action right here Buchanan with the roll and beakman does a great job of putting his defender in jail keeping him on his Applause hip thats the long time Virginia train ER Ethan Sala hes been there a long time hes been around a lot of the greats that have played at Virginia CBA Ethan civa excuse Applause me you never know when youre going to be called on hes always ready Virginia fivepoint lead Groves hands off to Applause Buchanan and now beakman with 10 on the timer bman Wiggles free again that one doesnt drop no surprise coach Bennett goes back to the same action with beakman since he just scored on it you dont want to over Coach Applause it Wake Forest has fallen into a scoring drought of 4 minutes and 30 seconds highest scoring team at ACC play at 80 points a game only has eight Midway through the first half Monsanto has to let it heave and he hits it nothing but the bottom of the net he is so streaky if he gets going last year deari Monsanto was second in percentage and first in makes in the league Harris won it back for Virginia and then gives it Music away Dante Harris has been involved in a couple of turnovers early and look at the separation skill BS of Monsanto pulls it back and sticks it he had just made two of his last 12 threes but hit that Applause one if they get him hot he can be the X Factor not only in this game but this season I think thats why wake has another level to get to offensively which is going to make them better as they continue to head towards March youve been saying it all the ACC Champion will be decided by Wake Forest you were saying that in November I because I saw Fon Reed coming along and I know what deari Monsanto can do and then once you had a feel for what bopy Miller and Hunter Salis do this is a well put together team you knew hildr and Carr were going to be experienced players backto back threes fires the Demon Deacons in front on the road by one mcney right to the rim swiped away Monsanto now if deari starts playing some defense now we got a whole other level mon Santos squeezes it in the read Fon Reed backing down the Freshman Buchanan and they have elected based on personnal to guard Fon Reed oneonone and double others on the Block carsy only other one thats had a catch on the Block Groves missed it offensive rebound Buchanan couldnt clean up the spill well epon Reed is going to continue to stay aggressive because he doesnt have any fouls and hes been marred by some foul trouble lately and theres Cameron HR downhill what happened to that scoring drought right deari Monsanto got it started again and Wake Forest on an8 nothing run in the last two minutes now its Virginia whos fallen into a threeminute scoring drought be trying to do something about it Off the Mark eldr trying to muscle his way in great defense by MCN it bounces back out to hildr now a deep three couldnt connect probably not in Rhythm boopy Miller hadnt taken a shot in a while and he loses Isaac mcney in transition usually mcne will make you pay from there he can pull quick trigger if hes open in Applause transition Miller on the Move fading away missed it but a foul called on Buchanan inside Wake Forest with the momentum right now on an 8 nothing run over the last three minutes points add a premium in Charlottesville as they always are with this Tony Bennett Virginia Defense the Cavaliers right now theyve fallen into a scoring drought no points in the last four minutes what do they need to do to get the offense jump started here I like an atto with Isaac MCN after Virginia gets the ball back um I think thats someone they need to run some offense through see if they can get him going hes two for Music five hildr beats the double team all the way to the rim blocked by dun he leads the ACC in blocks and thats why he came from outside the lane to recover and make that play what an Applause athlete Virginia started this game five for five theyve made one of their last 10 McNeely that rolls off the rim no good he had a good look hes really good off that pin down action and bopy Miller was on them this time theyve rotated Defenders on Isaac mcne early in the early in the game Carr going against Dunn blocked again Ryan Dunn all over it defensively right now now that is his third block today he is an ex factor for this Cavaliers Applause team need to find something offensively just one field goal in the last 8 minutes and 30 seconds for Virginia done that rolls in finally a friendly roll well when you go three sides on your offense and you get to the naked twoman game and a ball screen action Ryan Dunn should be able to make that 10footer really good action heres the beauty of Virginia most teams only one field goal in 8 minutes and 30 seconds youd be down 10 Virginia only down one Reed swiped away theres a great find by Salis 5 seconds on the shot clock here for Wake fors What can you do you got plenty of time for a couple of dribbles and a catch Id look for Fon Reed set in the screen and see if you get it right back to boopy Miller on the Applause inbound into hriff Reed wide open for a three thats not his shot though hes a 21 threepoint Applause shooter Road off the screen cant Music connect Miller trying to take mcney oneonone lost the handle both of these teams W for their last nine the defense has dominated beakman to three missed it tapped back out to him this time drives in off the window and fires Virginia back in front when youre scrambling defensively and give up an offensive rebound its a great take by pman to recognize the matchup he had on him which was Fon Reed Salis been quiet in the first half shot black down to eight hildr met by beakman Reese beakman all over Pam hildr deep three offensive rebound to Reed and he catches in the second chance Point well we all got stuck watching beakman the defensive player of the year containing Cameron hildr and we missed the weak side rebound and Tony Bennett picks up a Applause technical 14 years Miller makes the Applause first and a game where points are out of Premium Wake Forest happy to take these and theyre 80 at the foul line on the season one of the best in the country right best in the ACC third in the nation Miller makes them both so well try and get that verified for you but pretty incredible March 2010 Tony Bennetts last technical foul and his team only down three that doesnt mean he hasnt been upset the with the official since March of 2010 I can tell you that this is the time of year its this time now two teams in the top four of the ACC right now looking for a big time NCAA resume win boy Fon Reed has been all over the glass he got the game going early for Wake four first scored in the Applause paint its a much bigger lineup on the floor for Wake they have the size advantage in the front line versus Virginia Captain Reeds been excellent today eight points seven rebounds shot clock down to five really good recovery on the back row by Virginia Carr as the buzzer sounds knocks it down you got to make tough shots against uvas uh defense they rotate so well and theyve got a shot Blocker on the third level and Applause Music done Wake Forest in control right now on a 134 run they force another Miss I mean its not the quality of the shot but maybe Virginias or wake Force defense is not getting getting enough credit here for how hard theyve worked chasing off all that screening action Carr lines up a three airball Virginia just two of their last 13 trying to find something here at the end of the first Applause half MC Neely the floater got it and Steve Forbes takes a timeout now were excited to share some terrific news yesterday the naith Basketball Hall of Fame announced that our very own Debbie Antonelli is receiving the 2024 Kurt gouty Electronic media work congratulations Debbie that is a huge honor and well deserved well thank you very much its very nice of you guys to do that so thanks its great to work with great teammates like you and hopefully you wont get a technical foul in the booth today try not to but I might throw a few elbows now that is welld deserved from truly truly one of the best in the business I have so much fun with you Im thinking about my uh my late great Coach K the naysmith Hall of Famer so shes smiling down on you no doubt about that Ryan D finally takes the lid off for Virginia hes got six Salis has been quiet but hes got the ball in his hands here for the last possession 10 seconds to work with this is all Miller downhill goes to work finds Carr in the corner for three missed it and a defensive battle goes to halftime 2221 not much to separate these failing by one I also like that he blocks him into their transition game Jay which also helps them get some easy buckets if they chose to do Applause Music Applause that Groves off the side of the backboard kick out beakman a three got it just how Tony Bennett drew it up at halftime the second triple for Virginia the first for bakman you give the hockey assist to the side of the backp right this is a a big staple of Wake Forest offense they let the Iverson cut into a ball screen this time Fon Reed slips it into a oneonone and look at Miner D up Reed still finds Miller who ties it to 24 Jay we started the game game talking about what good cutter Cutters both these teams had that was an excellent cut by Applause Miller two teams that cut as well as a pair of scissors here in Charlottesville tied to 24 points out of Premium beakman backto back threes race Batman barries him the same middle ball screen where because beakman is snaking behind that ball screen Reed has switched twice on that now Tony Bennett knows that Wake Forest is switching that and beakman certainly recognized it leads the Cavaliers with 12 hes playing as well as anybody in the ACC going back inside Reed foul called on Applause Groves I love love this action to start the second half for Virginia here comes the screen and you snake behind which means you dribble behind the screener forcing the switch beakman says no way big man you cant guard me out here Carr trying to answer with a triple it goes begging hes been long on all of his Baseline jumpers today and theyve all come from the corner beakman starting to take over Reese beakman on an8 nothing run himself Rees beakman is already one of the best right side of the back box score Players meaning assist steals rebounds but when he adds scoring to his Defensive Player of the Year job Hunter Salis whos been quiet only had two points in that first half thats a big bucket for him trying to get going going demon Deacons only down three remember Sal has been in double figures every game this season mcney contested triple missed it its a great F behind the penetration s is in attack mode and he lost the handle the Virginia crowd thought he ran over Virg Virginias defense Applause mcney another three off again came into today shooting 47 from three but hes missed all three hes taken today hes the second best threepoint shooter in the country based on percentage and in his textbook it is a beautiful jump shot hes yet to knock one down today oh he had some separation there too early in the shot Applause clock done going right at Carr rims out no good Miller trying to get something in transition done flies in his fourth block today how good is he he has such great conversion speed right from offense to defense right here hes just tracking the basketball hriff got a good look just couldnt finish Applause it Applause beakman has 14 and Virginias 29 he needs to score that hes right at the front of the rim in this second half for Virginia thats a Scouting Report bucket right there that is an excellent job of getting the ball to the inbounder for an easy two its probably the easiest two points for beakman all game Carr backing down Groves 4 seconds to shoot goes up with it and draws the foul that is the first shooting foul for Wake Forest in this game of course theyve only had two free throws which was the technical free throws on the technical foul at Tony Bennett picked up in the first half thats right we said Tony Bennett picked up a technical foul in the first half you had to see it to believe it its hard to Applause believe tomorrow on ABC you do not want to miss it the number one right South Carolina women the nations only undefeated Division 1 basketball team taking on Georgia 1 Eastern the college game day crew is there to take bar coverage at noon South Carolinas the number one team theyre the only undefeated team I dont expect them to lose maybe not at all this season thats how good they are they have up their guard package and their rebounding and their defense is the staple of dawn Staleys program and speaking of dawn Staley she scored a lot of points in this building by the way or actually the building next door they used to exist a Virginia Legend her number hanging in the Rapters here at jpj Don Staley helped Debbie Ryan to three final fours and Dawn Staley still is the only player to win the most outstanding player award at the final four and not win the national championship little piece of trivia for you I love Applause that done nothing but air Way Off the Mark there thats one part of his game that will need to improve for next season Salis been quiet for his standards and thats cuz the guy guarding him is Ree beakman who pokes it away there Tony Bennett always talks about we and US versus the ball re Reese beakman gets his nose on the ball hes always in a stance its not about always guarding the action its about keeping the ball in front Salis only has four his seasoned low is Music 10 going against beakman pull up pop got it Hunter Salis fires Wake Forest back in front the hunter Salis doesnt need a screen he can get go off the bounce and create on his own so skilled Virginia has 10 second half points they all belong to beakman roie Misses the layup Cavaliers need someone else to get going here offensively I mean Ro hesitates even though hes one for two outside the threepoint line he had a wide open look Reed spinning his way in and he traveled Steve Forbes will tell you that this is his best community Communicator there a lot of contact in there but Reed was off balance in and travels you know you mentioned those 17 turnovers the last time they met coach Forbes told us today 10 of those were from his bigs mcne step back buries it that was good defense but good offense always beats good defense that McNeely bucket ends a 6 nothing Wake Forest Applause run seven lead changes already and what has been a close competitive ACC game back and forth we go in Charlottesville foul on the floor in this second half Steve Forbes has gone to a lot of isolation basketball no they get it to the block and theyre looking to get to the free throw line by trying to put Virginias front line at a deficit they do have a size advantage on the front line theyre going to replace one sevenfooter for another right now with Marsh coming in the Music Applause Music game heres hildr 5 seconds on the shot clock hildr trying to musle his away in put too much on Applause it and hildr called for the foul you know what he gets like one of those a game right but you know what its because youre not going to see anybody whos going to play harder or more aggressive than Cameron hildr its one speed yeah hes battling through an injury right now you would never know it by the way he plays also doesnt affect his minutes hes fourth most of the AC at 34 minutes a game all of those played with heart and tenacity mcney fouled coming off the Music curl now this is setting up to be a fun finish 3332 buy week for him earlier at carry Academy where he played his high school ball he had his jersey retired so its a awesome week for Applause him take a look at the photos for Murphy enjoying uh the NBA Allstar break you can tell these guys just love basketball cuz you get a big big block by dun what a rejection is fifth of the day that was all ball wow I mean that was a cargo for a twohanded slam Sal shot clock down to one doesnt recognize it and thats a shot clock violation and the crowd comes alive for the first time today you dont see Ryan Dunn get very animated very much either but he is pumped up check this out car going for the twohanded slam Ando Ryan D says not Applause today fifth block of the afternoon he leads the ACC in Block shots this season and that is the 20th shot clock violation forced by Virginia this season mismatch now dun needs to keep it right here Here Comes com Reed on the double off to BU Canon who hamers it home good find by Applause dun Virginia on a six nothing run theyve grabbed control here at home Frederickson off the mark from three its five points or its two possessions usually you count by possessions against Applause Virginia off to Buchanan again missed Applause it Miller somehow keeps his dribble alive the first basket for Wake Forest in four minutes well he pushes so quickly that Virginias not organized and thats a great way to to get back into game quickly is try to push Tempo and try to speed up the game its hard to Applause do you Canon theyve gone to the Freshman on the last three possessions and hes delivering Tony Bennett told us that he had improved in his been working hard in Music practice going to be a foul on Harris watch this right here the mismatch with Parker Frederickson Aton Reed rotates to double and Wake Forest doesnt drop down and pick up Buchanan which leaves him wide open at the lane at the front of the rim in the lane Buchanans got the best recruiting story in all of college basketball will tell you it in a minute beakman rocks the Rim the steel and the slam as Su Wake Forest had the lead at this game 3231 Virginia on a 102 run Reed open for three cant connect I dont believe that was the play that Steve Forbes DW Drew up off the time out you know Virginias emotional theyre ramped up theres a reason why Fon Reed is wide open you got to work the basketball and try to get something going back door the Demon Deacons is two of 13 from three Harris way too much on it Salis working against Groves squeezes it to Reed great pass and Fon Reed delivers you cant help on that down the lane drive because Monsanto is on the same side of the floor and you dont help off of him that was a great find by Salis Applause inside now called on Salis reached in on beakman see thats what you call putting the defender in jail bakman curls and he knows that Salis is trailing him so he hangs on to his dribble and Sal fouls him from Music behind beakman stolen away Monsanto hes had quick hands today his second Applause Music steal Monsanto a deep three missed it offensive rebound Reed hes one rebound away from a double double yeah Groves push off the ball I like that set though by Steve Forbes trouble J and Applause Deb thanks Kevin a great day of basketball starting here in Charlottesville Wake Forest was trying to inbound the ball and Steve Forbes took a time out so we have to step aside for 30 seconds well be right back weve got a fun one here at Music Charlottesville Alexander volosi Im the king of this division other ways you better watch Applause out an undefeated Force who could be destined for greatness Im going to be a legend been running his mouth show him whats up Im going to knock him Applause Music off fivepoint game and its been a wild one three technical fouls seven lead changes close competitive throughout both teams looking for what would be a massive win both in the ACC standings and the NCAA tournament resume win Reed misses the righty hook shot this would be a road and a quad one for Wake who right now is last four out according to Joe lonardi wake one the first time these two teams met in Winston Salem they shot 50 from the floor in the game theyre shooting 35 right now both teams playing with great Passion dialed in defensively Salis transition three and and Hunter Salis drills it Jay I keep waiting for Hunter Salis to have a little bit of a burst right here he has been their leading scorer he is better than 18 almost 19 points a game just the demon Deacon third made three today mcne cant answer Buchanan trying to clean up the spill and hes fouled well Buchanan has been terrific in the second half around the rim when we spoke to Tony Bennett before the game he said he was improving his game was getting better look how he makes himself available right here fights boopy Miller for rebounding position and then In Crowd comes back down with another board so I tried to tell you Blake Buchanans unique recruiting story earlier this half and then Reese beakman r rudely interrupted me by stealing the ball and taking it for a slam dunk but Buchanan was playing aaou basketball at West originally from Idaho and Tony Bennetts d when Bennett was the head coach at Washington State called him and said Ive got a great player I want you to take a look at and thats Blake Buchanan so Tony Bennett telling us earlier this season its the only time in my life it paid to have cavities well Virginias 0 for four from the free throw line in this game and we know theyre not a great free throw shooting team keep your eye on that because Wake Forest is the best free throw shooting team in the league at Applause 80 Buchanon missed them both Virginia 0 for four from the line whereas Wake Forest is a perfect four for four and in a twopoint game youre right Debbie it could come down to free throws down the stretch little more than six minutes left to play not much to separate these two terrific teams beakman off to Miner and he draws the foul maybe he can earn Virginia their first made free throw today just a really good set you have a ghost screen then you have McNeely working off of multiple screening actions beakman with a good Baseline Drive and Miner shaping up in the Applause paint misses it theres a lid on the rim for Virginia from the foul line theyre 0 for five today as we remind you UFC 298 tonight from the Honda Center in Anaheim you do not want to miss the world featherweight Championship tonight 10 eastern time yes ESPN plus coverage begins at 6 Eastern thats six points that Virginia has left at the free throw line today in a twopoint Applause game with a lot on the line for these two teams Salis right to the rim everything but the Finish is that Ryan Dunn again I think he got a piece of it he has been fantastic and at their third level defending inside yeah that is his sixth block which ties a career high theres that switch again that beakman scored on takes advantage again free pakman hes got 20 points today to lead all scores Good Help by miner theres that oneonone Eon Reeds had some success in this matchup Fredericks in a three got it he shoots the ball with such incredible confidence starting to not look like a freshman the pride of Bigsby Oklahoma won the State Farm ThreePoint Shootout at the final four a year ago now making big threes on the road in the Applause ACC onepoint game 43 left in regulation roie lines up a triple cant answer really good screen by miner to set up that flare Wake Forest has struggled to close games on the road just two and six on the road this season this would be a massive resume win if they could find a way here trailing by one shot clock down to four Salis knows he has to heave it gets it off in time time but thats a shot clock violation Virginia dialed in defensively clinging to a one take a look at this 142 games played in this series Wake Forest in Virginia half a point separating them so no surprise another close competitive game today mcney got it what a great set by Tony Bennett one we had not seen yet and I can tell you Alburn in Kentucky itll be higher than this at halftime McNeals first made three today and its a big one to put Virginia up by four 5 Seconds to shoot hriff lines it up rims out no good this is where reys beakman is EXC excellent hes a really good free throw shooter when the game is on the line as well I would expect beakman and MC nearly to handle the ball most of the last three minutes here pman has it Applause here Buchanon The Freshman rims out no good got to get on Monsanto quickly hildr wasnt expecting the ball Monsanto there Monsanto calls his own number Ryan done another block hes got eight a career high Ryan Dunn has stolen the show Applause defensively and on the offensive end its been Reese Beakmans day through traffic finds mcney right back to beakman the give and go it wont go in three opportunities at it under two to play Wake Forest still trailing by four Sal is trying to spin his way into the lane got to play good d right here theyre on their feet 90 seconds left in regulation Virginia holding a fourpoint lead shot clock down the 10 Ro deciding to take it himself cant hit it falls to hildr hriff going Coast to Coast all the way to the rim for two time out Steve for as hild makes it a twopoint game I think the reveal today said Duke is a three three Applause SE beakman one shy of a career high has 20 points Applause today got to stay right here in a stance going one and one with Salis off the screen to Dun bu and there to clean up the spill count it plus the foul the freshman in perfect position they run a double at beakman to make him give up the basketball I like that and he finds done at the rim and Buchanan cleans it up what a second half for Blake Buchanan the 611 freshman now hes got to make make some free throws Virginia 0 for six at the foul line today Buchan and missed it done the offensive rebound now you got a foul Ryan dun making two big plays here down the stretch the first to catch that lob which set up the Buchanan finish and now the offensive rebound you know Virginia has missed free throws you have to be ready to rebound Applause nine rebounds eight blocks for Ryan Dunn today and hes a 56 free throw shooter so you have to be ready to rebound shooting one and one missed it got a push Wake Forest has life trailing by four 30 seconds to go you can get a quick two Jay tough to do against this Virginia Defense Frederickson a three missed it beakman has it breake Forest has to foul and they do how about that defensive possession for Applause Virginia locked in guard your yard whatever you want to call it for Tony Applause Bennett now Virginia fourpoint lead but Tony Bennetts team today 0 for eight from the foul line they are last in the ACC in free throw percentage beakman missed it now 0 for nine now you got to have a three hildr draws the foul on the floor Virginia has committed their last foul to go to one and one they didnt want wake to get a three off now hild Steve Forbes doesnt like that call I dont think hild cuz it took away a layup ildr shooting one and one without any timeouts left for Wake Forest you got a score and then you got a quick steal quick trap foul grins out no good Falls to Frederickson off to Salis a three got it onepoint Applause game foul comes in Isaac mcne heads to the line if you could have made any but Isaac mcneel catch it there late and if you had a timeout you would have been able to remind your team of that but the worst McNeely can do is make it a threepoint lead which is still a one possession game big three there by Salis big offensive Applause Music rebound Virginia 0 for n from the foul line in this game but they have their best foul shooter 90 on the season got to say Ive never seen 0 for n at the free throw Applause line missed it but hes shooting two 0 for 10 this would never h happen in your driveway no hope not Ryan dun checking back into the game Virginia clinging to a onepoint lead the best McNeely can do is give them a twopoint cushion which he does first made free throw today you got Virginias going to extend their pressure a little bit you got to drive it hard at The Rim Wake Forest no timeouts heres hildr fading away no good Virginia survives
