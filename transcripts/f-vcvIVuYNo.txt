against Cal in this stretch since hes come back so uh Hubert Davis looking for a way to get off to a little bit quicker start uh Elliot Kau really had a he carried the team offensively in the first 10 minutes at Wake Forest by BC with a tip McFarland and he bounces it over to Benny who has been very very good especially of late hes been averaging 16 points and seven rebounds shooting about 63 from the field thats him and cannot get the roll Carolina coming the other way tremble going to pull it Applause out Carolina with one quad one win this season that came against UCLA and thats a good start for RJ Davis second only to Tyler hansbro in scoring all time at Carolina and thats one thing too that you know the threepoint shot has been a struggle for North Carolina pitch it out on the corner and it comes up short from Roger McFarland scoring in general has been an issue for Boston College BC averages right at 69 points per game but far fewer than that in contract play but you know you look at it and we talked about this time that on the season North Carolina 81 points a game but in conference only 71 points a game so their scoring has been down well its interesting with North Carolina their defense has gotten better but their offense has gotten worse yep and they played some great teams as you you pointed out to Hubert Davis in our meeting before the game in that PR seon that ones out of bounds and it belongs to North Carolina lets take a look at that three a moment ago by Davis brought to you by Mello and I think this is going to be something the teams will do defensively against North Carolina theyre going to test them from the three theyre going to theyll play off them theyre going to make them prove themselves from behind the arc theyll give that shot protect the drive protect the paint looked like a pretty good feed but right through the fingertips of lubben and the other way brown with the left hand Dion Brown averages six points a game hes a transfer from UNBC heres a freshman Jackson to the rack and got it to go they want to see him do that more often well and hes so gifted athletically and uh lot he this is a guy no free throw attempts against Wake Forest and Hubert Davis talked to us about that that just cant happen and the two of them had that conversation and thats you know thats just a good attitude to be in attack mode for him pointer by hand was in and out offensive rebound rejection underneath and Boston College will keep it I think the one of the shortest guys on the floor I think kdo was the one who got a piece of that so Boston College with the ball wide open oh boy thats a great play by kadu and it leads to an easy Slam by Trimble at the other end know made that play defensively and and a good good thing cuz that was an easy layup and we saw some things against Stanford and inbounds plays a few last week that were easy layups a heads up defensive play that leads to a basket and thats a nice finish by Joshua Beetle the transfer from clemon he was a big part of that team that got to the elite eight well it it seems like message received by Ian Jackson who first two times hes gotten the ball has attacked the rim so a quick nine4 start wide open and that was a two not a three and another rebound for Boston College at the offensive end and it leads to a bucket by hand taking it to the rack Junior out of Virginia Beach Virginia one of only four players nationally ranks in the top 20 in both scoring and rebounding believe it or not yeah 66 good size for a guard this the thing I you know in this day and age they going to be long rebounds and your perimeter guys have to be good on those midrange rebounds right BC not afraid to take it toh the rim here early Tom how about that shot by Beetle hanging in the air lefthanded he is a lefthanded player but what a play that was take a look at this coach came here and uh you know really his only head coaching experience before going on to Kansas was the jvt up here but you know sitting next to co Smith wasnt a bad uh thats not a bad learning bad incubator to be in but you know those Kansas and North Carolina those two programs so intertwined unbelievable youre right but both of these teams are really focused on attacking the basket here early scoring in the paint RJ Davis has a couple of buckets to get this one started one from downtown and theres a kick ball out of bounds itll no that is going to go to North Carolina its a turnover for Boston College we were blocked here so nearly five minutes have passed see Drake po was checked into the game for the first time another talented freshman for the Tar Heels pal and Jackson last couple of games have struggled Hubert Davis said its only natural for that to happen to a freshman is Washington checks in and misses a jump well and the thing you worry about with freshman and and starting and then you know some guys get really locked in on what that means and you know all right Im not starting now Im coming off the bench how do I react to that and some guys put too much emphasis on it other guys you know it doesnt bother them really enjoyed our visit today with Earl Grant yeah you know but you know for me Id be much more concerned am I in there at the end of the game yeah coach trust me in the second half not so much might you know going out there and uh to the you know the starting lineup know we talk about Boston College they have eight new players they have five transfers they have three freshman last year they lose all five guys that were in their starting lineup they lost 88 of their scoring 82 of their rebounds and the 20th usest minute return from last year among all teams in college basketball in your Earl Grant and you think youre building something youre coming off a 20 win season and all of a sudden youre back at year one even though this is your fourth year at the school well Carolina is shooting the lights out early on in good passing early on well and I think that you know that time that comes from look for this team build Inside Out Get Buckets early inside build your confidence and lets take a look at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Modello right there I mean thats just thats easy basketball pick roll bounce pass layup I mean you know and like I said get your confidence you know start seeing a bigger basket then you know build out from there too much dribbling that time by beetles 139 and Kido bumped lost a Applause handle F will be on Chad venning transfer from St Bonaventure whos putting together a really nice season for Hubert DAV he got big news the other night Caleb Wilson highly talented high school player committed a hotly contested recruiting battle that was good news for him and you know look theyre missing a dominant big man I dont know if Wilson will ever be that guy but theyre missing that kind of guy this year theyve got good production but not like theyre used to around here no and you look historically at this program and thats what thats what theyre buil if one if not two big guyss and you know this this team is a is a bit of a oneoff as far as you know having great perimeter you know really good perimeter players but not much in that is outstanding move by Donald H J we talk about his strength and his size and what he can do Music Applause inside heres the look and you know when you give up the Baseline its very difficult for the defense to get over there and help very explosive move you know if youre going to if youre going to use the Baseline a Defender you got to shade it that way you cant give it up you got to use that Defender his Baseline as a Defender Austin College hanging around almost seven minutes into this one Davis takes it to the basket lays it off beautifully in a slam by Jaylen Washington and thats what a a great scorer does it just attract so much attention he had three sets of eyes on him and uh you know Washington is just all right just drop it off to me Ill dunk it makes it a fourpoint Carolina lead and defended by The Freshman Jackson hand all the way to the basket little Fade Away not going to go down thats a good challenge for uh Jackson defensively really nice play by McFarland defensively on the other and getting back in transition and the jumper and hell go to the free throw line heres the look and you know you you want to beat the defense you throw it across the court he sees hes got a bigger guy on him he draws both of them and uh that just leaves Washington with a fairly high percentage shot two shot yeah not too bad yeah its the ones you used to get although you were taking a beat throw the game today from produc Roby when the name Jack Gib came up well see now that was before the game but you didnt have to revisit it during the game and of course for those of you that dont know national championship game Duke be Kentucky and Mr given goes to 41 you actually had more points in that tournament than Jack given did yeah yeah but he had him at the right time I didnt well I dont know about that he only went 18 for 27 well thats you know he had he had the big game at the big time thats a beautiful pick and roll but the missed layup Washington follows and drops it in and this you know you talk to Hubert Davis and you look at their film theyve been get getting good shots through this stretch you know theyve been getting open looks theyve been getting good shots they just have not been executing and uh theyve been making them here today just getting closer Applause shots playing string music which he did plenty of at Carolina that was the cello he was playing there Im tell were you a in high school I dont think yoyo ma was ever in danger of losing seat see a Duke guy is the only guy that lefthanded P drops the two free throws BC just continues to hang around well and uh theyre starting to get an edge at the free throw line which was uh which was we talked about the advantage of wake carines only been there once despite getting uh getting inside Washington another easy one on the feed from RJ Davis hes really being left unattended in a lot of these and its being forced by you know good penetration Inside by uh by the tar yields nine of 14 from the field and Washington has eight in the game and heres an eagles Applause turnover fourth turnover the game for Boston College and look I mean theres three eagles around RJ Davis and you know Im not Im not I never took a math class with Duke but that means somebodys going to be open maybe two people history major in you you didnt take 101 that theres a three from the corner by Trimble and they love to see that this is a guy they really need to start delivering more frequently and hes coming back of course in that very serious head injury we talked about it early on he has five points in this one he averages 12 but but for them to win hes got to get 12 to 15 if not more right and you know what you put him and Jackson in the starting lineup and that gives you a lot of horsepower and uh you know crazy to say but mean that dunk coming out early I think really gave him just you know just freed him up um got him into the flow early Kelly the three not going to be there and tremble with the rebound Carolina pushes ahead up by seven and tremble floater in the lane well that time Luben was looked like Jerry Kramer to pulling guard he just went he followed right up his back for an easy short jump shot Packer fans out there a double Che remembers him and thats a big three by Dion Brown hes only attempted 34 of them all year long hes hit 12 them he was a big time transfer First Team all America East Conference former and here comes Boston College the other way Kan and right to the basket and his hand lays it in he has eight in the game well that last turnover is the one that kadoo has really got to stay away from trying for the Home Run pass and uh just leading to a layup on the other end of the floor the look Boston College you know Luben not a bad shot blocker but really no real threat out on the floor for North Carolina average about four shot blocks as a team on the year Han was a guy who a handful of games into his true freshman year he had a very serious knee then played 34 games last year was not a starter he played about 18 minutes a game and now all of a sudden his numbers have just exploded shot pocket two and kot to the rack and thats what you thats what you do like to see from your point guard uh knowledge of the clock you know a guy who can break you down off the dribble and get something up at the Applause rim and going straight to the basket and he draws contact hell head to the line for a pair getting to his right hand and uh could have been a call there but nothing at least he played through it you know youre not dont expect the whistle he played through the contact and made the finish and among the best free throw shooters in America his dad played in Virginia was a threetime captain in 98 99 2001 average 13 points per game next week CW courtside Saturday rolls on Clemson goes down the road to take on NC State the number 25 Louisville how about the Cardinals will go to Atlanta to take on Georgia Tech it begins CW Courtside Saturday 130 Eastern hope youll join us youre going to be at that NC State game yeah and boy Pat Kelce all hes done is Win everywhere hes been and uh that that program needed exactly him terrific Hustle there by tremble oh he just chasing it down from behind and heres Jackson and thats swatted away and a diving attempt by brown but he couldnt get to it you know he he didnt have his steps right and he couldnt Elevate which allow right here he just kind of stumbled a little bit and that allowed for venning to get up for the block the one number for venning Id like to see a little bit higher of the rebounds only four a game which at his size 69 270 needs to be up in the seven range I think yep he was a second Team all A10 performer a year ago at St bonent this will be his only season of Eligibility at Boston College he is a graduate transfer nice pass right there by with who checks into the game for the first time he feeds uben who will go to the free throw line hacked by Brown youre watching CW court side Saturday presented by All State youre in good hands we are only almost 12 minutes into the game only the second trip to the free throw line by North Carolina kadoo missed two free throws their first two attempts and now Ming at 65 heels for three shoter Im shooter Im and that one will go down he hits one of two to make it a fivepoint North Carolina lead 820 to go in the opening half big crowd here today we saw a number of empty seats last Saturday but not very many today big three right there by Derek Brown and he has eight points he averages six and you know as a coach these are the guys that youre really Fred about you know who may not be very up you know high up on The Scouting Report and all of a sudden have a big game hes a guy who had 20 in a game against SMU earlier in the year so hes Applause capable tip back into the hands of Withers and he has his first bucket this is a point that Hubert Davis talked about he you know this team has not been a great offensive rebounding team but they give the credit to the tip to keep it alive to keep Withers the basket round thought about it thats a nice feed leads to an easy bucket the first of the game by venning you know he does a lot of his work out of the high post and you just dont see him in the paint area very much or you know havent at least in this first half theres a strong move by kadon to the basket well Carolina really attacking the rim not just jacking up threes like weve seen a lot of them this year and uh you know hu Davis is uh you know its great on the other end but lets get a stop here on this and he is not happy with the defensive effort and just like that the lefthander pay drains the three so no stop this time and this is a guy 4 hes over 40 from three so hes a hes got a guy you got a lock in on Austin College 56 shooting 50 from three and 88 from the line and theyve hit nine of their last 12 field goal attempt Brown trying to answer again too strong got his own rebound hes got 10 and we mentioned the average is six now youve just lectured your team about defense you get a drive it misses and the guy who shot it gets his own rebound and puts it back in and that gives Boston College a onepoint lead at the sixminute Mark Davis takes matters into his own hands and hell be fouled on his way to the bucket thats on beetle thatll be his first and that is the fifth team foul so still two away from the bonus is North Carolina Jackson will leave his fellow freshman running mate how will check back in Davis all the way lays it in nicely done yeah that time he didnt draw as much of a crowd as he has earlier in the game so you can get to that right hand able to finish easily heres Benning he just takes Washington straight to the basket and lays it in the big fell its been a bunch of straight line drives for Boston College I mean playing this manto man Carolina is getting worn out off the perimeter scrible from the corner is short and Boston College a onepoint lead why if its the big guy against you know Washington theres nobody to help if he gets be downtown by pain and he knocks in the three is second of the game and crowd is a little uneasy at this point to say the least Davis passed up to three and hell go to the basket and lay it in ran into his teammate so no whistle there hes got nine 28 points in the paint for North Carolina both teams really attacking the basket and BC in front of the 435 Mark by two vetting little Fade Away not going to go Applause Davis goes right by Brown they kick it out the pow rare offensive rebound by the Tar Heels and a foul will go on venning thats another area that Hubert Davis has just been dumbfounded by and thats their lack of offensive rebounding thats a big one right there by Payne yeah thats uh thats substantially behind the threepoint line too and uh to look again actually North Carolinas big guys nice job of sealing off BCs interior defense let see if North Carolina can start capitalizing on the free throw line hes a cop shes a con together this unlikely Duo uses their skills to catch criminals a hit series returns Wild Card season two premieres Wednesday February 5th right here on the CW want to check that out you know its interesting that Earl Grant talked about you know he said hey you know he told his team were in a storm right now um but were going to get through it you know you dont just sit down and let it rain on you you get through the storm and uh you know youre coming into a team thats lost two in a row theyre vulnerable and uh so hey you know you go out and play and his his team looks confident to me Tom at this point in the game they sure do and it looks like they believe they can continue to attack this Carolina defense yep force that one inside but able to recover they pitch it back to hand along the basine in the middle of the lane crowd wanted a double dribble and they get Applause it and we can get into that of course as we get later into this game but those you know one possession losses are really starting to pile up in fact theyve lost backtoback games by one point thats the first time thats happened to a Carolina team since 1968 designed play for Davis who will go to the free throw line to shoot a pair now coming up on the halftime show presented by Subaru low its what makes Subaru Subaru well check out whats happening around the ACC and well hear from Tom Tom wormy and Brian Oliver at the calling smunc State and well talk about the return of Louisville basketball Pat Kelce we will see them here on the C I cant wait to see them next week in person yeah and uh we talked about Pat Kelce win you know one there College of Charleston W there and thats a Louisville program that had been beaten up emotionally every which way over the last 10 years needed really desper needed somebody like him and three of their best players out before the season ever started and still getting it done and they get into a top point and its really an amazing story for those of you who dont know Kelsey is a protege of the late great SK Ro one of our favorite people that weve ever come in contact with in this great game of college basketball in the ACC possession era will give the ball to North Carolina so the Tar Heels a twopoint lead 32 to go and Boston College when theyre not scoring theyre turning it over theyve almost reached double digits in turnovers in this game they average 12 per game how to the Rock and throws it down oh my and BC was just not aware that the ball was being inbounded they were they were standing around unaware that play was Applause live Hastings hands it off to hand defended by kdo and Han goes to the basket and hell go to the free throw line looked a little bit like the Jumpman logo there on that shot and uh you know all the talk has been about Ian Jackson but Drake Powell The Freshman has given North Carolina some really positive minutes this year thats foul number three in this half for Luben so hes going to have to leave the game his hand misses a free throw Im surprised they didnt get trembled for a lane violation there but they dont Luben will leave this credit I mean Washington has been the beneficiary of some really good drives and dishes inside but 10 points three rebounds for him scoring well above his average well we talked about it last week you know look not one of these guys is Armando vott but not many are Armando vott top four all time in scoring in the history of North Carolina basketball and that went in it wont count my good NBA that might have gone yeah that that continuation thing is arbitrary but not here man oh man he just threw that thing up in the air while falling down hey you you never know thats why you always do that never know this will be a one and one that was not a shooting foul take a look at this whistle there would have been a long two foot in the line you know what the cic says right I mean you know that right when youre sitting around with your buddies and RJ throws one in like that youre like dude where are those when youre wide open and we dont need any disrespect to Davis cuz man he has been a great great play reigning ACC player the here full court pressure for the first time and pain to the basket put it up with a right hand hes a lefthanded player and draws nothing but air tremble the other way lefthanded follow wont go and knocked out of bounds itll belong to Boston College at 215 left and a fivepoint tarel lead you know it just tremble out in the floor gives them another guy who can really Advance the ball quickly Applause you and I did a game earlier this year against L where K Tyson is coming into the game mean he had a career and a half game yes he did he can do that again two minutes out here gets H maybe hit a couple of Threes thats a very large human being there as well Jaden Hastings hes a freshman goes 69240 here he is you just called it and misses open three he used to knock them down regularly at 132 threepointers almost a th000 points during his tenure at Belmont well he didnt come into the game to pass the ball around I mean if he caught it it was going up Kelly behind a good screen by Hastings and just when you think BC is in a little bit of trouble they tie the game up on the three ball by Chaz Kelly his first basket this is Its a 37 shooting team in conference for three so theyre you know theyre capable Davis has really been so unselfish in the game here today Im hoping that Jaylen Washington is taking Davis out for dinner after the game I mean for something well I get a feeling that RJs getting a little more nil money yeah thats good fourth assist and looking for a teammate finds Brown Hastings had position momentarily inside Brown is having a monster game he has 12 points double his per game average he came out hit those couple threes and got him into a Applause nice so one and one time for North Carolina thatll be on Kelly car heels seven of 10 from the line and that means theyve hit seven in a row cuz they missed their first three you know I I really think one your Earl Grant youve made essentially youve made this a 20 minute game and uh I think mission accomplish there if your BC for Hubert Davis he is not happy at all to allow a visiting team to come in here and score 45 points in a half this is almost like an NBA game with the scoring thus far Tyson gets a loose B on the rebound Washington had it rejected but into the hands of tremble and he missed the easy layup its the easiest shot hes had this game aside from the opening dunk he throws his hands into the air and frustration does tremble after that Miss and a timeout called by Earl Grant 48 years Young grew up in North Charleston South Carolina he was an assistant in Clemson and the head coach at the College of Charleston you know we were talking to him before the game his first year he comes in they win 13 second year he comes in they win 16 last year they win 20 and go to the NIT but he told us its almost like starting all over again this year after you lose five guys and thats the land thats the landscape of college basketball now you know who who who inv including your entire starting lineup one only and only one to the NBA yeah well if youre looking for a Cable News Network that respects all Americans then you have a new home with news Nation see why news nation is Americas most trusted Cable News Network to find newsnation on your screen go to newsnation nowcom Boston College shooting at 57 North Carolina shooting at 58 if you love offense this is your game this is a hitters game for sure so far but um yeah no its uh and this is this is what you you hate as a coach to have a team come into your building and feel comfortable in their offense and shooting the basketall right final 7 Seconds here of the opening half Kelly now down to three now down to two theyre not even going to get a shot oh they call it no it does not go down Han was looking for the foul and he did not get it but what an excit the first five minutes are going to be really critical here and the thing lets see if North Carolina can do a better job especially taking away the the Baseline Dage cant get any help there lets see if they can at least send people into the middle where they might be able to get some help defensively interesting to know we talked about the struggle the talent and freshman Ian Jackson he is not starting this second half he is sitting on the bench Drake pal gets a start here in a second I would bet that has a lot to do with defense yeah it might be a little bit of a wake up call for him Jackson had four points in the opening half this is a lot of standing around in uh Davis was the only one who was running around on that possession take a look at that 32 threepoint attempts for North Carolina against L and theres a three that was forced at the shot clock that that possession went Applause nowhere thear heels as you just saw have only attempted now seven threepointers in this game not a surprise their shooting percentage would be so much higher layups a lot better look than a threepointer but the only thing is it it surprisingly hasnt it turned into an advantage with the free throw line where its about even with Boston College in the game so far they do have a distinct Advantage because of all those layups points in the paint 32 of them for the Tar Heels in the first pass D trying to add to that tot and missed it no body has scored here through a minute and a half of this second half North Carolina leads by one this guy was huge in the first half and he starts in second half in similar fashion Dion Brown is third three in the game yeah theyre going to be uh theyre going to be the team thats going to be playing a lot more freely a lot more loose rejection underneath Carolina gets it back and then to take away and trying to go coast to coast and was stripped to the ball by Davis thats an excellent defensive play by RJ Davis and triple to the rra and hell go to the line fouled by Chad venning thatll be his third boy you know what if if there was a layup on the other end there might have been a timeout coming by Hubert Davis that was a massive defensive steal by Davis and I think a really good sign defensively you know for North Carolina or offensively you look at Trimble that that was a Fearless take I mean he looked like he was getting ready to and dunk it on that play gets to the free throw line and I dont know Mike if you ever had all your years better than a decade in the NBA as vny will leave and that could be a very important third foul if you ever had a head injury I never did um just I had a foot injury out a couple of games but never never a head injury never concussion had a few in the in the NBA but well you just wonder if theres a tentativeness about going R you pointed that out absolutely I mean and that playing through that when you when you stop thinking about that is is the last hurdle you know that emotional thought process forgetting thats a nice feed they double team and then cutting straight to the basket is Beetle yeah thats thats basketball oneonone you get the double team and you just follow your pass no weak side help there K loses a handle is able to find it and get it to triple shot clock at 12 Davis picks up his dribble Trimble going to the basket lays it up with the right hand and off the iron and a late whistle there lets take a look at that Mark of a fighter moment brought to you by Mello theres the double team and when that happens so youve got to have some sort of weak side help stepping in none none happened about you North Carolina just seems really out of syn offensively to start this half they sure do thatll help and thatll be a foul on Hastings thatll be his third so the two big men now Hastings and venting each with three personal fouls and were not even well a little more than 3 minutes into the second half and with the with the lower body and then this and we talk about all right where does the aggressive nature of going to the basket pay off you got both of their bigs in foul trouble now with 17 minutes to go in the game this is where it PS off now if youre uh your Earl Grant now you now youve got to start playing right how do I you know how long can I leave Hastings out there when does he pick up his fourth when do I come back with venning um you know I dont know that he has too many other options out there or do I go small and match North Carolina do we watch we watch small ball for a while man when youre one and seven in the league you got to let it hang out right yeah I mean until youre until that forces your hand and youre fortunate that youre playing a smaller North Carolina team where that that really doesnt hurt you like it might in the yearss past got three and here take away by tremble hes been quite active in this game talked about the foul trouble you have Luben for Carolina with three and we just talked about venning and Hastings the two big guys shot clock at six here for Boston College and Beetle pull up for three after the defender fell down RJ Davis got hung up on the screen landed on the deck played horse out there for a second well Im not sure what happened there but uh kadoo his reaction and you can see I mean the frustration for North Carolina I mean that theyre uh you know maybe good see a little fight well Joel Barry uh came out you know former national champion at Carolina that 2017 team came out on a podcast got a lot of headlines in this part of the country talking about the team lacking leadership on the floor no vocal leader and some in these parts took issue with Music that heres Powell for three and got it thats a big one for pal nice pass by uh tremble to set that one up too saw his Guy opening the in the corner Benning is checked back into the game for Boston College playing with three fouls thatss him with the ball working on the much leaner Washington he just bullied Washington to the basket really made a quick move so no double team could come in and BC really gave him some good spacing inside its unbelievable this Boston College team and there seven losses in the ACC its been an average of 17 points to spread theyve been blown out of the gym all but one game heres Davis not there and last touched it looked like by Carolina belongs to BC heres the look hes first of all that crosscourt pass makes everybody run a little bit longer and then the extra pass see you all that room and uh if you know you give up the Baseline and there is no way for anybody to come to help they were trying to get there from the top good move by Benning what a feed after the dribble penetration by Beetle he hes found a hes found I want not even a new life I mean he really didnt play much at all at Clemson boy and then he rejects a drive to the bucket by K and the Eagles back the other way and in the lane oh that would have been a huge shot and Boston College just out hustles Carolina but unable to convert its a fourpoint lead for Boston College couple of players down kadoo hes taking it to the basket Music and I believe thats Roger McFarland it is Whos down for the Eagles oh boy they both came down Mar and bearland still down thats him right there trying to block the shot and it was for kdo it was the Flora that did most of the damage he just went down and uh actually for both players and the thing that ures now in Tom is that you know for North Carolina that you cant have players fragmenting and say Im just Im going to get this done for everybody else and uh you know start going in five different directions I got a feeling McFarland what he slammed his head when he came down here take a watch number three yeah that yeah the Whiplash is uh you know and there theres really theres nothing you can do to protect yourself against that and just have to be hyper Vigilant about a concussion in that in that situation and they take uh Roger McFarland straight into the BC locker room yep and to the free throw line its kadoo where he is now two of five from the stripe in the game he has six points which is which is the smart thing to do and then years years years passed if you knew you were in Chapel Hill if you were in if you knew you were in North Carolina you could continue to play thats put up three fingers three oh youre in youre good youre good play on heres spinning thats a really nice move for a big man right there almost a little delay in that spin to the rack and hell go to the free throw line and thats a fourth foul now on Ben Allen Luben yeah theyre going to have to come back with Washington and the good thing is theyve got some files to work with him hes only got one theyre going to come in with Tai Claude first one goes down this Tuesday on NXT the womens Tag Team titles on the line baia and Julia face off against roxan Perez and cor Jade youre not going to want to miss this NXT all new Tuesday 8 Eastern 7 Central on CW Benning hits him both and that makes it a fourpoint lead as Luben has to sit down cant stress enough how important this game is to North Carolina its not to say its you know any less important for BC thats a good feed underneath good headge fake and then Claude had it rejected got it back and sticks it home Ty Claude the grab transfer from Georgia Tech and hes already outscored his average you know with that and you know for him to come in cold having not played in forever and you know to give that oh my gosh Brown does it again is Fourth of the game wow largeest lead for BC now at five but were starting to talk about this game for North Carolina I mean only one quad one win this would not be a quad one win but any game you have to put in the win column you better start getting them and getting them fast Jackson to the rack he checks back in and lays it home well I understand too Tom this this is not to disparage BC at all no but a home loss for this team would not be considered a Resume Builder for the tournament committee no and atar heels are already sitting right on that fence already and many of the bracketologists you know theyre either the last team in an 11 seed maybe in the first four playing in Dayton Ohio um you know they were on a four game winning streak when we rolled in here a week ago today and you know Stanford shocks him at the buzzer no harm in going to Wake Forest and getting beak they become virtually unbeatable almost unbeatable at home and theyve got a massive game today good defense here by Claude who gets a rebound and hands it off to tremble and the carar heels down three 1234 to go back door cut to Jackson beautiful feed by RJ Davis nice feed and Jacksons giving him some nice energy it didnt start the second half hasnt sulked at all all right how about Tai Claude nice hustle from him in the corner to pay and its short and Carolina with a chance to take the lead RJ Davis can I get it to go goodness Applause gracious beetle great feed to Brown and he kisses it home career night for brown he has 20 points in a game he averages six per game well we talked about it Tom he had a 20point game earlier this year capable of it this matched this season High Jackson a lot of dribbling into the lane and kisses it in Ian Jackson now has 10 and he is really talented physically ear Grant barking out instructions to his offense shot clock at 15 Beetle finds Han he goes to the basket contacted no foul Han cant believe it Jackson the other way and Trimble follows haded blocked but he draws a foul out brought to you by Morgan Stanley where old school hard work meets bold new thinking guess Guess Who uh guess who Kenny Rogers who is his favorite who loves him who Charles Barkley I believe him he sang at his jersey retirement in Philadelphia no Li hes the best the best the best how many years you play with him four yeah bet you had some fun and still my brother he laughs still my brother yeah hes a hes a wonderful guy South Carolina only shooting 33 here in the second half its interesting to note that neither Han leading scorer for Boston College or Davis leading scorer for North Carolina has scored in this second half well and uncs got to recalibrate just to the caress turnover that time they got a lock in on number one Dion Brown for BC yeah this is hes thinks he thinks that uh hes going to continue to come around and get the hand off broke off the route pitch it out to Jackson and all of a sudden this talented freshman is bringing his a game when they need him the most but thats his three now that Hubert Davis can live with that because hed been attacking the basket now he didnt settle for that three he took the three Han tries to answer and he does to tie the game at 67 listening into your broadcast Mr brenman thats right all right Ill Ill get show that idiot tremble now for three and coming away with a rebound his hand venning I beg your pardon H Haskins has Chase these has check back in and heres Han for an open three again boy you cant leave him alone that guys Applause money 17 in the game for hand much to the light of his father he is he just stepped in Rhythm right into that three and all of a sudden a threepoint Carolina leads become a three Point Boston College lead on the backto back threes by hand and now Davis his first bucket of the second half thats a wild game now weve got 845 to go and this is uh this has been the template for North Carolina teams just hanging around and hanging around and it gets to under one minute and will spin moveing the lane Crow to travel shot clock at seven and this is pay the step back three not going to be there Ian Jackson you know hes going coast to coast and hell throw a Applause foul here you take a look I mean theres nobody near him he catches it in Rhythm wide openen shot there for Donald H Jr and this is 37 threes and or 37 from three two of five now in the game well he doesnt look very happy come on dad got a little gray in that beard now too more than a little I know the feeling too yeah you do thats why I shave mine off Jackson his first trip to the line he has nine points here in the second half after four points in the first half this was a guy that was averaging almost 23 points per game over a seven game stretch which he scored 159 points and then struggled the last two games North Carolina is leaving some points at the free throw line Tom theyre getting there but theyve missed some critical ones 15 of 22 on the game now Boston College has only been to the line 12 times hitting 10 the good thing is in the second half only twice so North Carolina has cleaned that up theyve been defending without fouling in this second half Hasting still in there with four heres Brown again and this time a rare Miss from Dion Brown thats whats going to tighten up a little bit more you get under the8 Mark I mean you know just the eye test here this BC team doesnt look like a one in 17 very done heres Jackson oh my goodness I and Jackson lightened it up same spot on the floor that right corner and that gives Carolina a twopoint lead our eighth lead change of the game and takes matters into his own hands and did he lose the ball or was he foul last year so I dont know if he got a pay raise for moving over to the head coaching job L that I talked to him yesterday hes loving coaching the JVS thats a really nice move along the Baseline by by Hastings his second bucket of the game and were tied at 72 with 7 minutes to go big guys uh Hastings and Benning sh a nice ability to put the ball on the floor and get to the hoop if anybody watched this Boston College team the other night in Virginia it is hard to believe this is the same team playing basketball here today and heres a force three there thats thats what Huber Davis was talking about before the game and thats an offensive foul underneath the basket trying to get the Applause rebound and theres the look and this is the thing that North Carolinas consistently done is giving up the Baseline we talked about giving up no chance for the help but uh good clear out good strong move and another easy one underneath thats Hastings he has backto Back Lane in Boston College in front by two not a big time score at all under four points a game but giving them some good offense and everybody really lifted above the free throw line for BC he had all kinds of room to maneuver and Jackson and that was forced up there but a follow and able to lay it home as jayen Washington who had a monster first half thats his first bucket of the second half he has 14 in the game Applause oh doctor were under 6 minutes to go here tied at 74 Brown lays it off to Hastings he had two in a row he has three in a row and heres a guy I mean hes a 55 free throw shooter so you need to take a foul here at some point in time with him take your chances at the line theres the look I mean they do a good job of driving Brown off the threeo line but its its just good basic basketball and getting him want to remind you tomorrow on CW women sups Louisville goes to Charlottesville to take on Virginia thats at 2 Eastern 11 am Pacific only on CW Sports first one goes down for Kad you got you have brown and Hastings on the on the year averaging about nine points maybe 10 points today theyre giving you 28 combined not bad not bad but you know its like you said though its not like theyre theyre incapable of this kind of game theyve had games like this before you just wonder how the what happened if this Boston po team win or lose hand into the lane picks up his dribble it is tied at 676 shot clock at 12 hand from downt are you kidding me with Trimble in his shirt too tough shot I was thinking as the shot was going up Im like this thats not the best shot in the world 440 to go home team down by three and to go a strong movement up and in with the left hand hes got 11 that that last three really kind of rocked thats like a fighter taking one in the chin that that one really stunned North Carolina be tries to pass it off shot clock plenty of time here at Applause 15 wow Lady Luck and Beetle for three again another rainbow three this one by Beetle his second threepoint of the game he has 12 points and look at Kad to the rack oh boy right off the iron he was looking for a foul there BC 12 of 19 on the game now from three point were down to three and 1 half minutes left is just another one and a rare Miss and here comes tremble two onone lays it off for Jackson who got fouled and hell go to the line Half started all of his teammates were standing up waiting for that first basket Jackson was sitting down and it took him a number of minutes to get back into the game but oh my goodness since hes come back 14 of his 18 points and the front in the back hand of the one one complete the threepoint play I thinkig part that was after the Layin and the foul so it is a onepoint game well the other thing it could hurt North Carolina theyve only got two team fouls so theyre a long way from the bonus however the next Boston College foul will put them in the double bonus so North Carolina will be shooting two going forward Benning is in the game they got some great minutes today from Hasting nearly a takeaway back in the hands of beetle 10 on the shot clock a onepoint game three minutes to go theres hand again oh my goodness this guy is r holy they better put dad on the Travel Squad wow hand has been spectacular that is his fourth three great pass by davidon the easy lay in goes down for Jaylen Washington who has 16 well I mean the good news is North Carolina scoring but theyre scoring two BC BC is scoring threes and theres Donald Han Jr Goes by tremble to the rre and thatll be a foul but as Gman mentioned thats only the third of this half against North Carolina the importance of this game again its not to take anything away from BC please dont misunderstand this would be their biggest win of the year and if it happens good for them but right now theres only one of these two teams thats sitting on the proverbial offense of the NCAA tournament and thats the team that wears Carolina blue and white yeah I when we talk about that its its dispassionately and as a as a Committee Member would look at the Applause win I mean clearly BC should they win this game deserves to win this game they have played that way Manning with a shot clock down to two thats not what they were looking for and they Scramble for the ball b and a possession eror will give it to North Carolina so lets take a look at our key play brought to you by Hilton Garden in Hilton for the stay and its been oh hand 20 23 points to this point 7 of 15 four of seven and uh also six rebounds Tom three assists for him playing an allc Court game really has been special in front of his dad and uh in front of a small but vocal BC contingent Boston College eight of 12 from threepoint land here in the second half all right Carolina chance to tie and Washington draws the foul this will be a two shot foul anyway but from here on out now it will be two shots at the free throw line that is the 10th team foul against Boston College and the fourth foul on Dion Brown who with you know all that the superlatives were talking about with hand Brown has been just as much of a factor in this game but if your BC not a bad decision Washingtons 62 from the free throw line rather than give him a dunk make him prove it here right there I I had an assistant coach who used to call it fouling for profit you know make it dont just give up the points if you can if youre in a position to although that was a costly fourth but I will say I mean thats been the case since about the 9 Minute Mark so I think that BC has done a nice job of massaging that all the way through to the end game Jackson going for he has 19 in the game Washington going for his 18 point this would tie the game and thats a massive contribution for Washington we talked about we talked about BCs BS well he looked pretty good right there the follow two and here we go yeah and let talk about you know Washington six points a game on the year tripling his average so big contribution for him Brown has 20 hand has 23 for the Eagles big stop right here venning going to work on a nice ation and tries to muscle Washington and apparently there was a foul no shot yep on Washington and that is only hard to believe that is only the fourth foul for North Carolina in this half two to give still shot clock Chris reset at 20 here this again this is underneath out of bounds that weve seen that North Carolina has had some issues with well they got killed against Stanford last Applause week looking at the big fella down there and that is a beautiful move by Benning he has 13 in the game Kevin mcalees down in the low block Jo your AG well well Im with you I know I am so you know I know all right one minute left heres a senior RJ Davis and a good feed underneath to Pal who forced that one extra pass rather than going up he should have taken that is you know one too many he should have gone up now heres again a case even if you foul you got to foul twice and Earl Grant says lets hold the phone a minute You got to you actually got a foul three in and everybody had to play you said that their aame and they have maybe above their aame well I mean you look at guys like brown and Beetle we know about Han but Hastings has been really good especially in critical moments and here down the stretcher getting the ball to Hastings and Benning Hastings is on the bench its a huge possession in this game right now BC scores in Carolinas in big trouble shot clock at five Beetle handles a basketball hes going to go to the rack left hand and it is good along the base line took the clock all the way down and scores Trimble trying to answer at the other end and he was fouled and Beetle was injured at the end of that play along the Baseline he walked back and looked like he was nursing an ankle how about this at the end of the clock get to that hand and boy just a massive shot thats going to be all for Dion brown boy what a game Brown has had today 20 points on eight of 11 shooting well now you know you well looks like Beetle going to try to stay in the game or going to have to take him out as well wondering almost a bits of cramp because hes over there stretching out his Cal he tried to go over to the table and yeah it is a cramp he tried to go over the table and do it and the referee says well you need to stay on the court if youre going to stretch it Applause out trible hits a first needs this 189 remaining and he got it all right now you got to foul in a hurry foul in a hurry three times times lets take a look at todays player the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom what a day and a game after getting thrown out of the game his last game Donald H Jr well and you know and going back obviously maybe a tough environment having to go to Virginia and and play maybe that was weighing on his mind Five Points there but boy he has come back in had a terrific game here father really proud of his uh what his son has done here this this afternoon I think hes over there bragging about him right now or is he uh lobbying for a draft choice with the Nets I dont know who knows all right so you mentioned um only four team fouls Carol you got to you got to foul three times in quick succession here trying to go for a steel so thats your first you go for the steel initially if you dont get a foul foul yes okay if Im BC I might try throwing the ball long Music regardless all right lets see full court pressure by North Carolina and here we go and a takeway nearly and did they call a foul theyre going to take a look at while they can take a look at it the call is Boston is Boston College ball or maybe he reached over the Baseline to block this well it didnt look like on the floor is red ball we will review it didnt look like he violated the plane of the of the end line and and if you watch the the ball bounces before it hits pain so this is out of bounds off of pow see watch itll bounce and then H they go inside yeah so this should take zero time whatsoever all well yeah it looked like is confirmed it looked like two10 came off clock will be reset to 18 6 seconds well yeah and the problem there is that theyve really accomplished nothing as far as getting an extra getting a foul well they nearly got the takeaway I tell you thats a tough Duty there for Beetle who at least had it on the Baseline a minute ago now theyre not going to have him in bounce the ball this time well yeah to get out from underneath the basket well hes got to stay there now he cant move and this is going to be Chaz Kelly Applause with the very long Po in front of him and five second ball against DC couldnt get it in and now Carolina with a chance to tie the game or take the lead and and with a in a North Carolina tradition I know coach Smith is smiling oh yeah because they had four timeouts left three now with that one so a full full pocket of timeout still B BC was down one all right let now lets go uh there was look you got you got the whole left side of the floor loaded up nobody coming to the basketball everybody running laterally and there is no outlet for him to pass to I mean youve got to have everybody on the floor coming to the ball as an outlet all right now lets move forward in that huddle Ian Jackson has had a monster second half Washingtons had a really good game for you RJ Davis uh while quiet in the second half hes been your main man for the last couple of years who you looking to try and get the ball to Trimble has played well weve seen kadoo have good penetration to the rack what are you going to do Ive got Ian Jackson or Davis getting something going actually Jackson getting something going to the rim just 76 free throw shooter good there athletic enough to get up and he and he and Davis probably your best chances of getting a threepoint play opportunity if youre looking to get a lead but really you know put some pressure on the referees make a call inside but definitely get something going to the rim 14 second half points for Ian Jackson most of tremble work has been done at the free throw line Jaylen Washington has 18 points you know and even Tom even with a tie with BCs foul trouble they are really up against it so thats not the worst thing in the world all right they get it inside the tremble goes up with the left hand to tie the game 129 remaining and we are tied at 89 SE tremble so our 13th timee now your four fouls works in your favor cuz you can take two fouls on the floor without it working against you now you got to you got have to be real careful to not do it in the shooting Music motion well we have talked about it so many times this North Carolina team in one possession games had has really really Music struggled in fact if you look at four of their losses this year four of them Wake Forest Florida and Michigan State and Kansas theyve been outscored in the final four minutes 414 in those four losses now were tied here with 132 but one session games have been a nightmare for the tar here all right so if Im if Im BC right now you know and this is where that that brown foul fifth foul really hurts you at this point I mean hes hes hes another option I mean the obvious guy is hand and if Im North Carolina Im having a a guy and Im shading maybe two guys on him um well is Carolina going to full court pressure remember now how hu Davis is remember they full court pressured in the last game against Stanford and they they lost it and try to you know maybe let three seconds 4 seconds if you can tick off and uh and take a foul heres hand he has the basketball lays it off for Beetle 8 seconds 7 six five and a timeout with 44 boy thats thats thats a lot of time Bur turning off that clock and now Carolina can afford to foul a couple of times yeah no timeouts for BC left that was their last one I think uh Earl Grant is asking to check the clock when that timeout was called but hey look if if he gets three1 of a second on there thats still really letting that thing wind down Music so my only thought here is that Earl Grant wants absolutely no time left on the clock when this when this shot goes up I dont know that thats a little bit of course maybe they knock one down here and its all for not but thats you know you dont give yourself a chance for an offensive rebound yeah I dont know what kind of play but I think you know I think hes looking at all right my you know the guy whos my hottest shooter has filed out of the game and both of my baks have four Al fouls but yeah I mean all right now beatles had a good game he has 14 we mentioned that brown fouls out after a monster game hand of course has been the best player on the floor and you know venning hes come alive here in the second half he has 13 points and he has a huge yeah it be the bulk against Washington if you could see and hes and hes shown that he can put the ball on the floor too I mean I I if Im you know Im just putting on an allout Denial on hand to try to keep the ball out of his hands all you know hes getting it out of the inbounds here hes being guarded by tremble they try to get him on a lob they better get it in and its kicked they got bailed out there that first option they were trying to get the ball to hand on a crosscourt pass and he was defended well right and BC has just got some really tight spacing over there if they dont if that initial play doesnt work everybody is really bunched heres Beetle and a foul theres the foul yep 32 left so that gets him to five about a second ticked off they can foul again which would certainly be the move and and Hubert Davis making sure everybody knows y all right 32 hand again right there 10 ft from where the pass is coming in bounds along the sideline defended by tremble Beetle defended by kadu and one foul to give and Carolina nearly a takeaway one 4 remains boy Boston College just has a terrible time getting the ball in bounds well and thats also the you know the luxury in po call on the floor the previous play is under review Powell you know not the tallest guy in the world but long limb very active um hes done a terrific job of making it a nightmare over there to get the ball in bounds not only in the Baseline but the sideline I mean those are two tough places to get in inbound well who last touched that ball I mean did venning get a finger on that thing I this might be out of bounds on venning yeah maybe he he might look its tough to tell from that angle he might have poked it Applause out the official still taking a long look and the crowd has seen the replay up on the board above us you think you got about 20000 fingers pointing down in the uh toward the home team bench I tell you I I I just have a hard time understanding that whole sequence of events we saw last week Stanford had a time out left decided not to use it goes straight down the floor Against full court pressure hits a shot almost at the buzzer to win the game Boston College has had three different times to get the ball in bounds and has barely been able to do it yep after further review the call on the floor has been reversed it will be Carolina ball with 18 seconds to go so we thought venning did indeed Y and there is uh there is plenty of time to get a shot theyre going to add4 seconds 18 seconds Balls going to be inbounded over it there at 34 court right in front of BCs bench Applause well it was right there for the taken at least to get a shot and Boston College does not even get a shot attempt and now Carolina with a chance to win it at the buzzer well thats where those two extra those not being in the penalty helped Washington going to give it up to Davis for the win and were headed to overtime oh my goodness he had a good look now that was a beautifully side play yep so to tip it off weve got venning and Washington the two big guys have had really good games and also healthwise keep an eye on beetle who was cramping toward the end I mean he this is you know hes played big minutes in this game probably something he hasnt been real used to remember Boston College still not in the BS Carolinas in the Double Bs off the screen Kan the lefthanded jumper is off the Mark and P the rebound and now the T heels a chance to take the lead interesting even for this and uh hes coming into the game now but Jackson didnt start the overtime kadoo lays it in really nice play Washington the high post everything kind of emptied out down low but North Carolina leads by two 14th lead change in this game Kelly head fake and this is what venning does I mean he just muscles his way right by Washington Washingtons had a nice game but he is getting slammed around by venning and his 270 lb frame see you everybody at North Carolina lifted up foul line extended right here and uh maybe a little bit of a hook there but still a very nice move Washington still has a couple of fouls that he can play with yep Bing a 64 free throw shooter he is now three of five from the line in this one so out goes P I think this is going to be straight defense for offense here for Hubert Davis pal on defense Jackson on offense oh boy North Carolina with a basketball were under four minutes left in overtime and Carolina with a twopoint lead kadoo behind the back to the basket rejected outstanding defensive play right there as Luca Taves has just checked into the game for the first time all day sitting for 40 minutes and then getting that defensive stop wow theyre going to the big fella again and he lays it in in Washington is hurt oh boy he reaches for that left knee you just hope and pray that this is just a a bump to the knee oh boy heres the look and this is not an easy play nice behind the back dribble wasnt so much a block but just nice keeping his body body in front of kdo then the look here and uh you know venning yeah he just kind of you know Benny uses that off arm to create space for himself lets see this young man uh get to his feet need some help he just uh certainly say our prayers I mean theres a guy in Washington whos waited till this his third year hes from Gary Indiana I mean he had some big moments in the ACC tournament a year ago but hes getting significant playing time this year and hes making the most of it yeah and great game today and you know injuries and you know overtime and fatigue and uh you know its when these things can happen I hope its not serious I didnt see any you know knee to knee contact he appears to be you know walking pretty well theyre theyre going to get him I guess straight back back to the locker room look say hes putting a little bit of weight on it yeah yeah hes doing a little better here lets hope for the best okay so Luben comes back in and hes got four fouls and were tied at 91 320 to go in overtime Davis for three yes sir no hesitation at all 94 Applause 91 heres hand to try and answer oh my goodness this has been unbelievable back and forth 94 a piece 230 to go you know I dont know how many minutes hes played in this game I dont know how much hes been out but he looks as fresh as he did at the opening jump theres a bump against Kelly on RJ Davis who goes to the line for a pair and uh Davis has probably played the full compliments of minutes as well yeah uh these are guys these are the guys you look to in overtime and both of them delivered on consecutive possessions Davis has played you were wondering he played 38 minutes in regulation hes played obviously the first two and a half here in the overtime P does not come out the game yeah sleep well on the charter home Applause they is seven of eight from the line in the game and it puts North Carolina back in front by two its been a while since Ive called a 100o game Tom I hear you I might have been working for the Hornets at the time Ts being counted oh nice little screen and roll in the big man T Taves has made a couple of big play Off the Bench yeah and uh you know right now attacking Luben is a pretty good idea with those four personal fouls I dont know how much hes going to resistance he can give side at 96 Jad picks up his dribble finds Davis isolated on pain over there back to kdo behind the ark Trimble working on Tate and Trimble bounces it in well hes had a nice rebound game they needed him to come back and get into form quickly and he certainly is delivered one3 to go Carolina in front 98 Applause 96 Kelly kicks it out to Taves and Im not so sure thats a shot BC was looking for with a minute 10 left I mean these teams are tired a lot of guys sucking win hand is beside himself he went that because Boston colge just had the ball and you know look uh weve given credit to Luca Taves about coming in and making a great play on defense really nice pick and roll pass down here but he is not the guy I think that Earl Grant want have taken that shot a moment ago down two with a minute 10 and overtime no number 13 uh should be shooting the most either Mr and or Mr venning should be launching shots at this point all right so North Carolina with a ball5 left and Applause overtime Kau defended by Tage looked like a pick and roll was coming they try to set a screen for Davis and hes bumped in the corner and I tell you what Fred Payne is just shaking his head in disbelief thats his thats his fifth yeah thats venning who gets number five he he saw that they had given the foul on venning and he just could not believe it what a game venning has had we talked about coming in hes been among the very best Big Man in The Atlantics Colts conference over the last really four weeks but yes but on that play you cant get your fifth personal foul with one minute to go in overtime showing on a screen out like that you you have to know what your situation is what the score is and and what the play is and you just you cant get you you just cant pick up the fifth foul in that situation so venning leaves uh thats two very key players on this Boston College team that are out brown had a huge game venning had an outstanding game and now youre putting RJ Davis 87 free throw shooter now that being that being said theyre fortunate that that Hastings is coming in whos also had you know pretty good night or pretty good afternoon up to this point 100 points in the game for North Carolina fourpoint lead 51 seconds remain Trimble on hand lets watch that they just switched it up Davis on him now and hand to the basket and its rejected by Luben great defensive play and now Boston College he got a 10second differential and trying to get a steal instead its a dck by lman blocking one in Slam on the other and Carolina in business first basket of the game by Van Allen Luben and North Carolina is going to pull off the miracle it was that last possession by BC youre going to look back on and wonder we never got a shot and here in the overtime its been all North Carolina yep and uh you know and we well see how how they come out of this game just a huge sigh of relief in the building time you could feel it just the anxiety in the whole second half
