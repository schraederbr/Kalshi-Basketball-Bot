games for Northeastern coach Bill Cohen up there made the move back closer to his home in Atlanta great shooter Cormier scored 15 against the volunteers both teams a little cold from distance to begin yeah both teams playing really good defense and I think both teams were a little wound up this is a big basketball game early in the Music season the UNC transfer Tyler niichel poy beautiful pass long the Finish really nice play right there between the two backup post players long and Music potit pookies will have a size Advantage overall well see if they can take advantage of that going Applause

well defended poti spins and just a little too strong on the hook shot Jeremy Loren in there another freshman really good freshman class for Coach Perry and his staff padulo will push in transition and he lays it Applause in all D averaging 15 points a game had a great game against South Carolina with 26 his career high want to guess how many times Shawn padulla scored in double figures last year it was 31 baskets by 24 theres El Shaker on the other Music end one possession game El shaky real a lot of international experience maybe a freshman but hes ready to play theyve got numbers trip draws the foul and its going to go on maai long were often running on a Sunday night were back to Castle after these men first half Hoke leaded by three and there you look at the socom conference that M McCarthy knows a lot about theyve played a lot of power five opposition look at that UNCG Western Carolina and Chattanooga with some big wins yeah early in the season the soan already trying to work on that uh that that national rankings that that means a little bit once you get to tournament time who knows maybe this is the year the soan gets more than one bid well the last time that Mike young was leading wford we talked about it earlier the 2019 socon title that team went 30 and five 18 and0 and so comp play they were a seven seed in the NCAA tournament and I cant tell you how hard it is to go that go undefeated in League Play that was a special team coutur knocked down a three Re Steiner The Freshman guard Dyan Bailey ding up Hunter Couture right there long three from RE Steiner and he connects look the Freshman can really shoot the basketball watch a practice the other day and he and Tyler nickel were going at it basket for basket uh he can really shoot it hes going to have some big nights offensively coming off the bench for Shawn padulla Music Terriers try to answer civil right back at you hes a shooter with range hadnt shot the ball great this year so far but he is certainly capable at 10 and six against Tennessee the Murray State Applause transfer nickel risen fire three he hits it and a chance for a fourpoint play he can really shoot the basketball of course the alltime leading High School score in the state of Virginia from up 81 at Harrisburg Virginia you see the foul there on Dylan Bailey who I misidentified earlier in the contest on the other end Dylan Bailey the North Eastern Oklahoma State transfer 20 against High Point went three for eight from three long range but hes been doing a great job defensively against Hunter Couture got switched off on nickel and of course a big size Advantage for Tyler nickel right Music there and theyll look at that threepoint shot potentially during the media to make sure both feet were behind the line Allen Nichols going to get loose and have some big nights he may be that that answer that uh that coach young is looking for at the three or four spot played extended minutes against South Carolina filwit going to work on kid cant finish pokeys the other way bar with a good defensive rebound kid with a Music contest Collins kid yes Collins with a nice penetration draws the defense and find kids wide open kid ready to catch it and shoot it continuing where he left off the other night against Music Campbell civil surveys finds Cormier hes had the hot hand over the last week Baron a rejection yeah Baron is a a long stretch four kind of guy that transfer for Northwest Collegiate School product down or Virginia here we go Dylan Bailey dont bring that in here 8 seconds on the shot clock Cormier fell down 5 Seconds to work with catch and shoot three down its Jackson civil again civil this time with Baron right in his face really good Music shot you like threepointers good game for you to watch yeah you may see 30 for each team kid can go to work inside he draws the foul yeah El saer giving away too many inches right there good patience the one big thing you notice about him is he just takes his time way more than he did a year ago and we talked about the difference in his in his scoring and rebounding over the years and he has exploded here early in the season you knew sha padulla was going to score you knew Hunter Couture was going to score if youre a Virginia Tech fan who was going to be that third score and really to be good you need a fourth score and theyre still searching for who that might be M for a Virginia Tech team that likes to shoot as many threes as they do what is having a 61 Center that can score inside what does that do for the offense oh it stretches the floor unbelievably if they have to concentrate on helping and maybe even double teaming in the post gives the shooters a lot of room on the perimeter civil able to sneak that by the outstretched right hand of Lin King soes out of Paduka Kentucky 66 a little bit bit bigger than he looks out there got that shot off over kid padulla will take it the whole way comes away empty wford with numbers pookis finally back five on five now got a mismatch inside Cormier lets it Fly and padulla comes down with the bo thought wford might try to get it down Shak down low against Collins Euro Step going the other way charge call nice job stepping in there that is sha Padulas second personal foul take a look at this from the overhead look gosh thats such a tough call right there trying to avoid the charge defense maybe move but uh the veteran Ry Steins with the call got it right means Brandon Reiner might play extended minutes in this first half yeah I dont think hes ready to do that trip here is Rex Steiner one of the top point guards coming out of the state of Music Georgia little short on that one knocked one down from the side of the logo M the T part of the VT at Mid we can call that the logo right hes got some range open three on the way trip hits it and its a threepoint basketball game really good screen by Chase Martin right there the undersized post player out of jinx so got shooter wide Applause open Baron directs traffic senior to senior its kid who spins nich the board and fouled on the way up good rebound by Tyler nichel you know him as a shooter proven he can rebound the basketball too Oki leaded by three nickel to the foul line when we return to Music Castle welcome back to Castle Coliseum Tyler nichel is going to the foul line started his career in North Carolina M we talked about it earlier alltime leading score in v hsl history from Harrisonburg I can only imagine High School coaches having to scout to defend Tyler Nichol oh gosh yeah he he you know at that size in high school and could shoot like that and uh and hes still adjusting to the college game at this level where hes playing against more people his size but you know when you can shoot it you youre a valuable commodity and uh again coach young looking for that that fourth score now that ly kid has stepped up in that kind of that score third score route but you know there a lot of K MJ Collins Robbie Baron Tyler niichel you know there are so many candidates Jane young there are a lot of folks that could be that that next score but Tyler nickel getting an opportunity right here hes up to six points and is tied with padulla and kid for the most points from a hokey today its civils who is our game leading score with eight ma what have you liked from wford and what theyve done offensively as a travel call well I theyre theyre four for 10 from long range theyre starting to get a little more comfortable started out kind of cold but the big thing theyve done to hang in this basketball game is they have Run Virginia Tech off the threepoint line pretty well Hokies have only gotten up six threepointers where while wford has taken 10 already youre just joining us Shan padulla has two personal fouls Collins open almost got the friendly bounce poti Couture catch and shoot how many times have we seen that from Hunter Couture and how many times have we talked about the ball goes inside comes back outside the percentage of Threes made goes way higher and another turnover Loren looking inside nobody there yeah that that there was some beating and banging down low and poti got the best of Kyler filwit right there and uh the pass win a r because filwit couldnt get to where he needed to be you going back to Couture its been well documented that when coach Mike young took this job the first call he made was the hunter Couture when you think about what this game means to him tonight yeah hes been a good player the the entire time coach has been here and just gets better and better not only is a super shooter hes a great defender too one of the one of the best in the ACC trip crosscourt pass filwit the Center perimeter passing with four tough shot wont fall offensive rebound for Kyler filwit well see who the foul is on he was going to be potate with a little incidental contact right there been a well been a clean game right here lot of contact just a little push from behind and of course when youre that big and its a little push its not a little push right potit almost 6 10 2 165 lbs in great shape finally healthy had some knee surgery out it rice filo the layup with 4 seconds on the shot clock well that was a nice play right there he was just his body the transfer from Southern Illinois Couture yes another triple thats three in the first half when he has days where it doesnt look like he could miss from long range is currently tied for second place all time in Virginia Tech mens basketball history in threepoint field goals five away from the record trip connects didnt touch the rim nothing but net lot of Threes in this first half and were going to break Virginia Tech leading wford 3226 your score the allnew shark detect Pro Auto empty system sharks most intelligent cordless yet detects hidden dirt and boosts power detects edges and double suction Music power it even empties automatically shark detect Pro Clean smarter 10 combined threepointers in the first half between Watford and Virginia Tech its Hunter Couture who has three of them and there you see the active ECC career threepoint leaders its Couture near the to yeah a lot of great Shooters on that thats what jumps out to me right there and Hunter Couture is certainly among the very best MVP of the ACC tournament a couple years ago he could not miss against Duke in that ACC Championship game he lik shooting up there in that building just over four minutes until halftime Couture looking for another one you Applause bet uter cure had a choice he could go off a single or a double went off the double and had just enough space to get that shot off hoky on a run wford looking for an answer and it will not come from Dylan Baileys threepointer long in transition looking for Couture trying to get it to him hes got the hot hand and Couture draws the foul yeah Dylan Bailey wasnt going to let long he long could have gone all the way to the rib before he let the Couture get that ball nice job by Dylan Bailey one final timeout here in the first half hokey by nine youre watching the AC threepointers hes doing it a little bit of everything inside out twice you saw that now coming off the screen by potit that worked why not do it again it worked again Music poies are six of 10 from distance Couture four for five and there you see the alltime leaders in threepoint field goals in Virginia Tech History Couture might break the record today I think hes feeling it once committed to wford under Mike Applause young were back to action with Virginia Tech leading by nine here is Couture thought about it Rex Steiner finds long Dives down the lane Long unable to get that off dont believe it hit the rim it is a shot clock violation long showing some ability to put the ball on the floor averaged almost a double double at Old Dominion a year ago for Jeff Music Jones Music terriers have been feeling it from distance in this first half as well civils has knocked down two threes here he is on the drive and he floats it in well the leftand a really nice job created a little bit of space and shot the little jump hook over Tyler nickel a highs scoring first half nickel wide openen Lin kid the two Hand flush great back pick by Hunter Couture got kid wide open and you cant help off of Couture because if you do hes going to get a threepoint shot trip pass Applause Music deflected Cormier the Lefty yes yeah we talked about that he is their best shooter was a high school state champion at two different schools when he went to school in in high school in Atlanta re Steiner Oh What a Beautiful no look pass kid missed the dunk but hes going to the foul line freshman finding the senior you think hes playing with confidence in his second week yes I think he came in playing with confidence hes not your typical freshman I think he was physically and mentally ready of course you still have to adjust because this is a this is a whole another level and hes got a hes got a big L learning curve hes playing point guard is the toughest position to learn when you make that transition from high school to Music college kid knocks down both hes got 10 first half points Music trip well Applause defended Loren going to work inside tough finish boy nice job by the Freshman took his time faked one way went the other really nice little jump hook Applause Couture kid almost an n one opportunity they are getting after Hunter right now switching when they have to but they are making it rough on him of course this is not the first time somebodys tried to be physical with him either of like youve talked about Lin kid improvements in his game one area has been the foul line so far this five for five today yeah 10 10 for 14 coming into theight already jumped up that percentage had a chance to interview Lyn kid this week and Mac unbelievable personality just a super great human loves Virginia Tech and its kid in double figures his Hokies leading wford 41 Virginia Tech leading wford 4133 the hes have been hot from behind the Ark in this first half it takes good execution to get somebody wide open want you to watch Hunter Couture right here here you see him and watch what he does coming across here to set the screen for ly kid to get wide open hes got 12 points hes also so finding ways to get his teammates open just over 60 seconds left in the first half coach Mike young with two hands in the air he likes it as were going the other way ma what a fun first half yeah you you knew it was going to be a good basketball game wford is has been tested they they played at Knoxville and and played the ranked balls very well the other night uh they werent going to be intimidated coming in here like I said watfords had a lot of success against Power five schools over the years Robbie Baron tries a three and a foul go the other way as it was Collins who hit the deck and then civils fell over yeah Collins on the floor really couldnt do much about that done a good job of staying out of foul trouble Watford still not in the bonus trip with six points averag is nearly 17 on the young season Len has played extended minutes in this first half here he is on the Baseline potit matching up defensively ball loose Collins Dives for it itll stay with wford only seven on the shot clock Baseline out of bounds filwit with four with one okis can hold for the final shot of the first half coach gilner up there with the play sign whatever spin is were fixing to see Music it highe ball screen Baron has 5 Seconds create space beautiful pass potit the exclamation point to close the first half really nice execution an ISO for Baron to go with the left hand he created help bounced into his teammate and poate and kid got there often perfect six for six in the first half 20 minutes down and 20 to go from Castle Coliseum were glad youre with us on your Sunday evening have a news M McCarthy our outstanding ACC Network crew here is civils who we just highlighted shovels for trip and drills the triple really nice job but again anytime theres penetration the defense has to collapse a little bit and that time Couture was too late to get to the shooter great pass from kid and theres Robbie Baron weve seen some really nice post toost passing you know kid says hey I can score I can rebound and watch this pass Robbie Baron coming in from Northwestern he can play a key role on this years hokey Squad chadu missed 9 Minutes in that first half being in foul trouble Im sure hes excited to be back on the floor and trips pass a fast ball some heat on it a little Applause low this just High post back screen by Couture again thats twice Hunter Couture has freed up a post player for a really high percentage shot ma what do you see when you watch Robbie Baron play what does he bring to this team uh he he really can do a little bit of everything that time he got Ked for an illegal foul but uh you know he can put the ball on the floor he can rebound he runs really well hes been good defending the dribbler uh the last couple times out and uh hes going to have some big nights Music offensively there you see his numbers the first three games I dont think thats indicative of what his production will be or what his contribution to this team is going to be going Music forward a ninepoint hokey lead trip a volume score great move to create separation but unable to finish padulla great move going all the way in an emphatic fist pump and a chance for a threepoint play hes got those fresh legs he rested the whole first half hes ready to go here we go in transition defense at a disadvantage sha pulla recognized that and here you see creating just a little bit of space with contact you look back to last week hokes fell a a close one to South Carolina padulla really scored the ball well in the second half 26 and really got going like you mentioned in the second half Bailey thats down early in the shot clock open look yeah Co coach wasnt happy about that because he went under the screen T Timeout on the floor just about 2 minutes into the second half hokes lead it by nine the new assistance to the bench for Virginia Tech JD buers coming over from VCU his wife Marcy the head volleyball coach here they picked up a big win today against Wake Forest yes sir JDs outstanding been a lot of good places with a lot of good coaches a really good addition for Mike Young on his staff Couture had the hot hand in the first half great close out defensively yeah nice play but really good defense to contest that Applause shot its a really well coached wford Applause Music team sham step and the shot in and out we talked with coach Dwight Perry this morning so complimentary on Coach Mike young the job that he did as pulla able to bank it in the layup but DWI perir just could not have said enough nice things about Coach young yeah he he was very complimentary obviously the greatest coach in wford basketball history and bl Perrys trying to make his own trail and went through a lot of tough times last year with the the you know the interim tag and uh then the search this spring and uh involve to the head coaching position and uh he is really one of the Bright Young coaches in the country and he was the believe it was the video coordinator of Shaka smart VCU a lot of energy at those practices Im sure oh gosh yeah between uh between Shak spart and then Mike rhods who JD buers worked for also was on that staff and uh yeah those are high energy intense practices with those guys its amazing basketball just its just a small world so its amazing yeah not six de very go way shorter than six de separation from everybody padulla beautiful crossover move and an acrobatic finish told you he was going to be ready you mentioned the big second half against South Carolina when the hes really needed it 13point lead for Virginia Tech wford could use a basket on this possession Applause trip from way downtown too Applause Music strong padulla driving to the rim yes gets the friendly roll is he on fire we talked about him creating offense both for himself and his teammates right now hes putting the ball in a basket hoki on a 60 run nine points so far for padul in the second half Shaker Second Chance Cory trip lays it in yeah somebody better box cor he trip out cuz he does a little bit of everything assist steals shoots the ball mentioned earlier the mayor of Campus according to the coaches Pula again on the other end I have no doubt about that 11 points Pula only played those 11 minutes in the first half had six points at that time picked up a charging foul put on the bench Bailey was calling for the ball hope he done a good job against Chase Cormier hter Couture knew it calling for the foul itll stay with wford when we come back the hokes have outscored the terrier 138 in the second half starting to heat up in the second half hes got a game high 17 points you know W part of watfords game plan was to run Virginia Tech off the threepoint line and thats a good strategy but Shawn padulla said I can score two at a time also and what a job hes done here in the second half with 11 points so far got into a little bit of foul trouble in the first half hoks enjoying a 15point lead thats a long three on the way and a much needed one Quinton MAA The Freshman from West Valley City Utah what a good shooter mentioned he was Gatorade Player of the Year can play point guard but can really shoot the ball hes really taking care of the ball to hes got eight assist one turnover on the year a strong take from Elijah potit You Know M weve talked a lot about Lin kid averaging a double double to start this year but potit averaging nearly nine points Off the Bench yeah getting great production out of the Five Spot Mike young is another triple down this time from Chase corang thats what hes known for and he can really get going hogis are going to have to make sure they find him and take up all that space on defense theres potit the pump fake and he draws the foul its a nice play Virginia Tech acted like they were going to reverse the ball and threw it back to the strong side and put heat wide open inside to 32 Jeremy Loren first Steiner and set to check in cheing his first rest in the second half been pretty productive six minutes for him head it I I think so you take that right yes 11 points in six minutes those are winning numbers question to coach McCarthy TOS pass deflected up ahead pass in transition Cormier lost the handle niichel all the way in has two free throws on the way I know the staffs excited about the fact that Tyler niichel has created some some contact putting the ball on the floor getting to the rim not just a one trick pony shooting a threepoint shot Okies have been very good at the foul line tonight theres the first Miss some might say that was announcers Jinx some might some might Tyler nickel would and the second go yeah F line has been good to the hokes Watford still with one free throw attempt on the game Chase Martins been quiet today Lorens thought about the triple tough shot excellent defense there from in attack poti got a hand on that Music ball Couture draws the foul hes been great behind the arc tonight with four triples shot fake right there recognize the defense was at a disadvantage and probably created some of that contact but hes going to the free throw line for three his first free throw attempts of the night were talk weve talked a lot tonight about him potentially breaking the threepoint record here on this Sunday night but Mack hes also closing in on becoming the program leader in games plan yeah it seems like hes been here a while he has been I know I know visiting I know visiting teams think hes been here a long time he loves Virginia Tech and Coach young speaks so highly of number zero to seeson high from him tonight with 15 points let him do a little coaching beautiful spin move ma up whistle on the way up hes found on the Music layup thats his offensive players are really smart shooting going back to Couture what a big week for him playing against wford a school he was once committed to and then later this week hokis are going to go to Orlando hes going to get it to go home this week for Thanksgiving thats right Bishop Moore product great program in the Orlando area know hell be excited hell probably need a few of those comp tickets ask some teammates family friends coaches its a 13point game 13 minutes to go in the second half Evan Hughes back McCarthy entire ACC Network crew Couture open for a split second Miss on the right side of the rim freshman Masa did a good job defensively right there Martin back out Music MAA long off the tip from potit teking transition this weather so good nickel you bet thats just really good Thats Mike Young basketball right there pushed it up had numbers open three take Music it nickel with 13 points Off the Bench Castle has gotten loud and an illegal screen on the Terriers its been a very physical game Music 16 Music foul here it is in transition thats another one of the great places to shoot a high percentage ball going inside and out or shooting the ball in transition those are two of the best ways to get a high percentage look from long Music range combined 17 threepointers tonight wford with 10 attack with seven the last time wford made 10 threes in a game was when they beat Texas AM a year ago padulla has that swatted away BRS with the block right there transition three wont fall a foul on the Applause floor trying to get the block out right there he still only four fouls this half offered never got the one and one in in the first half its Baron who will placees long on the Music Applause floor trip directs the offense matched up with Applause Couture civils behind the back great defense from Robbie Baron and theres padulla on the interception hell go the whole way and he thought about the D he took the easy layup instead I dont know if he took it as so much as he he wanted he reconsidered hoki Force another turnover nickel hes been hot this half hes got another out wford 16 points for Tyler nichel the largest lead of the game pokes leading wford 70 49 defense to offense for sha padulla 80 run M McCarthy how Virginia Tech on an 80 run M McCarthy how have they done it big plays turnovers and they are deadly watfords done a good job all night taking care of the basketball but back to back sha padulla with the layup in transition for his 13th point and again a deflection Hunter Couture head up lets find the hot hand who has the hot hand Tyler nickel knocks the bottom of it 70 to 49 Hokes lead wford out of the timeout filwit dumps it off trip the best score for wford pass to the corner extra pass civils wont fall and offensive rebound perimeter passing trip unable to connect pooki basketball Hs dodged a bullet right there did a good job on defense and then gave up the offensive rebound usually that uh is a problem this time they dodg that bullet when wford missed from long range a foul on Virginia Tech and caught caught Robbie Baron with the illegal screen and he actually did it really well because Hunter Couture was wide open he just didnt do it legally what a great job our crew has done today ma you know him Ry Sans Justin Porterfield Chase Shaw great crew yeah really good rys done this for forever ever and talk about Chase making his making his own way after his dad was a a great official and Justin really good also theres trip with a great take I wish we could have a camera for the game one of my favorite Parts about there a lot doing a game with Matt is when the officials come out they have the biggest smile when they see you they know I cant yell at him over here fall loose on the floor and Bailey saves it wford in transition Tri foul nearly a transition block from Couture yeah and thats one of the ways Watford could crawl back in this thing if Virginia Tech gets a little sloppy with the basketball on the other end wford that time pushed it while they had the numbers and Cory trip is really a good player the junior out of Madonna oh how and Terrier lost so much of its scoring from years ago in rebounding trip one of those veterans that come back yeah wford lost their top three scores one went to Iowa one to South Carolina and one to talson but uh they have they have replenished the roster with some talented young folks nice Blended transfers and freshman who we pointed out during the broadcast extra pass from Cormier triple wont fall from Dylan Bailey padulla spins it in side theres ly Kidd who has 14 points yeah first points of the second half ly kid with 13 and four rebounds hes also leading the team with three assists oh he can do a little bit of everything the point Center I like that dont think that exists but and theres Couture who steps in front of a pass hell throw it down Couture in transition yeah when you when you create the steal you should get the finish on the other end and he celebrated that finish with with the big flush hes got 17 four hokes are in double figures Cormier creates enough space at the foul line and hits oh really nice shot off the dribble with that left hand drove it hard Couture backed up just a a smidge Cormier knocks it down the 15footer Collins with space went up and falls down hes fouled fowt with the foul weve talked a lot about threes tonight for Couture how about a dunk yeah yeah hes really good from long range but I I what hes remembered about tonight is at dunk right now knock down four threes against Campbell on Wednesday and there you see its been a balanced attack really has we talked about the fact that padul and coutur you could count on Lyn kid has been very good here early on who was going to be that next score tonight the answer is Tyler Music nickel padulla exits Rex Steiner back on both teams making some subs St get extended minutes tonight first half because of foul trouble and then hes done a good job when he got got the opportunity now know its early in the season Mack but wford through three games theyre averaging 33 points Off the Bench tonight theyve got 22 how important is that to get bench production oh its really good when you can bring folks Off the Bench that give you some production Oki had 13 in that first Half Off the Bench alfords been impressive you know they see take War them down a little bit but you see Cormier bounce back right there coming off yeah not to cut you off apologies that coming off the careit against Tennessee keeping it going here tonight yeah he hes going to be good all night hes their best shooter and comes off the bench thatll tell you a little bit about the quality of this team theyre theyre going to be one of the contenders in the Southern Conference Couture thought about the step back kid goes to work a strong finish for Lyn kid yeah hes not a real big kid physically but but he did a good job of getting position then using his leverage and his height reach up there and laid it up with that left hand about wford in the Southern Conference and some big wins UNCG Chattanooga furmans going to be good Western Carolina a lot of good basketball team sford chance for a threepoint play Jeremy Loren The Freshman from Wisconsin will go to the foul line when we come back Hokes leading it by 19 Midway through the second half the soan pre season poll lot of great basketball teams somebody who knows a quite deal about this conference M McCarthy yeah yeah I was in that League a long time love that league and you know of course Ferman last year with the first round you know win over U vaa and Bob Richies got a good club again Mike Jones at Greensburg coach cray at Western Carolina you see coach Earl down there at Chattanooga getting a first place vote and uh on and on I tell you what now Im watching Watford and I will tell you right now they will not finish eighth in this league they they are way too good for that and the ACC preseason poll a lot of great teams in this conference of course yeah always of course Duke with a great recruiting class already the number one recruiting class for next year and Jim Laren nean down at Miami having a good time coach sh does he did get his first loss against the Arizona team uh first home loss he had never lost as a head coach in in Cameron indor you know we talked about a little bit earlier soan upsetting some power five teams as Loren hits the free throw how important is it to schedule these competitive games in November well you know you learn a lot lot more by playing a game like this than than you do blowing somebody out by 40 and uh and you have to be careful you dont want to dont want to ruin the compents of your of your team either but uh but theres theres a nice mix to that uh and theres a real sign scheduling is the second most important thing you do behind recruiting recruiting scheduling and then coaching Im learning something new I didnt realize scheduling was number two on that list for its really important to your success 7860 hour score just joining us a 10point game at Halftime hes have outscored the terriers 3527 in the second half reunion for Coach Mike young the first time ever coaching against wafford yeah the danger right nows got to continue attack on offense and theyve got to continue to to really do a good job of contesting especially the threepoint line from these wford shooters Applause pulla all the way as it blocked kid aggressive had his back to the basket just flung that ball in the air hes got free throws playing with so much confidence hes been a big difference in this Virginia Tech Team and again its its early small sample size but this is his fourth straight game where hes played really really well job protecting the basketball going back to the free throw line where youve mentioned how good he has been tonight six for six so far this Music evening one thing about this Virginia Tech Team back you look at it yes there are a lot of underclassman and some new players but a lot of veterans Couture senior Baron senior kid senior maai long malel potit a lot of chemistry and continuity from the previous year to this yeah and that really helps bring the newcomers the three transfers and the freshmen that are playing that helps bring them along much quicker when youve got the core that Mike young has excellent defense there from Sha Padu had his hand up the whole way nice job there against Dylan Music Bailey Dulla Cuts in might a been tripped there as he goes falling down nows going to go on Jeremy Loren is the ninth team foul one of those Talent talented freshman coach Perry to the line for Music one RS only with five points and a couple rebounds but uh has played well runs the floor battles down low cormak drives in hit the rebound out to Collins numbers nickel goes soaring in and will go to the free throw line third time Tom Nichols really has gone strong to the rim Vis in the free throw line again where hes outstanding 84 from the free throw line go strong like that I think he intends its a dunk in that basketball 84 when he was in Carolina a year ago we have seen some dunks tonight a couple of Music attempts cure finished one pretty strongly he did Shan poua thought about one he did hell get some nichel the takeaway theres MJ C right on Q up everyone getting in with a dunk tonight and again Tyler nickel doing a little bit of little defense really nice pass trip picked up by Music Applause Collins fwit with five great defense from ly kid as Walker comes away empty yeah nice job of not fouling just use your length and contest that shot kid showing his range feeling Applause it hes got 20 points hes not satisfied with those career highs he had last time out three rebounds away from a double double and 24 and 15 now hes got 20 and seven thats an airball from the junior Applause trip Z in transition throw it ahead Collins so athletic you know him is a Defender and a great Handler of the basketball this time he shows you what he can do when he gets out in Music transition 85 to6 Virginia Tech leading wford little over four minutes to go cins somebody who had such a big freshman season M he had to play those extended minutes Couture paddled injury coach young said those minutes theyre going to benefit him for the duration of his career yeah and and and he certainly has been a capable scorer in in his career you know prior to getting here and he does a good job of practice that hasnt converted to to game production yet but hes a guy that Mike young trust he trust him to be in the right spot on offense the right spot on defense to defend his man uh and to and to keep the offense flowing and those are important parts of winning basketball now if he can also add you know being a double figure threat to this thing then Virginia Tech takes a big step forward as to how theyre going to be playing in January and February in the ACC you think about this matchup Virginia Tech wford ma what we talking about before the broadcast you think about the people that have come to blackburg Virginia because of wafford two great schools Mike young storm Murphy Kev Aluma Hunter Couture cant forget about Kevin gilner on Mike young staff this Im sure just what do you think this game has meant to all of those people yeah you you named a lot of big contributors and you and you may have even saved the best for last CU Kevin gildner is outstanding and again you know you you have to have the kind of trust uh in your the coaches trust in the players the players trusting the coaches but the head coach has to trust that staff that theyre saying the right things to the players and Kevin gilner is one of the really bright young assistant coaches in the country love watching him Coach because he has such energy its infectious he does he coaches got such a good staff and coach Webster Coach B you mentioned new to the staff coach Olinger coach custus what a good group one of the best players in program history again a takeaway for the hokes Collins goes soaring in knocked out of bounds designs again Im taking it to the rim check back wild number two by wford to get a piece of that ball and not commit the foul left Rex Steiner getting a little run at the point guard spot again here toward the end of the Music game Collins gets the friendly drop off the rim and backb hes got a really nice midrange game and again you know hes not counted on the score a little bit but if hes a little bit more of a scoring threat that thats a big deal to Virginia Tech Mesa unable to float it bearing the outlet to Collins T has been pushing that was a nice look flatten the defense on the Baseline kick it out but wford did a good job recovering to Reiner Kai long whistled for the charge KY long still looking to get going plays so hard does a little bit of everything step aside for our fast Hokey 88 Terrier 60 evanes M McCarthy our entire ACC Network crew lot of offense a lot of great things for both of these teams to take away from this game yeah I I think the thing that coach young emphasized since the Campbell game especially the the defensive effort has come to fruition and you know wford managed to shoot the a decent percentage but but Virginia Tech has done a really good job here in the second half finally created some turnovers and made it really tough on wford to score the bats Tech comes away with a turnover speaking of ball loose Longs takes it and scores it I was going to say that was textbook right three people on the floor one guy reaches down picks up the ball and lays it in just like coach Young Drew it up El shaker playing with four Music fouls foul drawn by waer thats going to go on maai long lets go back to the hustle play it was a hustle play ball gets knocked loose everybody gets on the floor for it m long says hey I got Applause this fun player to watch The Old Dominion transfer who led the Sun Belt in double doubles a year ago hes always around the ball and then you know that was a little bit of a fluky example but he is he he is so active on the offensive glass defensive glass loose balls in transition started his career with Rhode Island then ODU now at Tech he can play multiple positions and guard multiple positions Sean Camden getting his first look tonight for the Music Applause hookies I think the officials have seen enough here a little bit that you know its got a little bit aggressive so going to call a little bit closer and the players will Music adjust shaker has fouled out both teams will be in the double bonus from this point Music on well the back court right now for Virginia Tech couple of freshman Hokies are going to see number 10 and number 13 for many years yeah coaches like this group Jaden young has been really impressive and can really shoot the ball of course so can Rex Steiner and he has shown the ability to to play the point the temperament to play the point guard spot you you a nice conversation with jadden young before the game yeah we were talking about the best barbecue in his hometown at Goldsboro debate between Wilbur and McCalls its important stuff it is important all the way in Dylan Bailey a layup and a foul drawing and just for clarification he liked McCalls because its the buffet but I liked Wilbur because its true barbecue shooting what is true barbecue Mac well its a I mean you know if youre a barbecue joint you dont want to have too many side dishes okay you got to focus on the barbecue under three minutes to go long Camden extra pass young and a rebound for filwit itll be wford basketball one to the free throw line for the double bonus oh foul for 31 filwit started his career at Southern Illinois not great from the free throw line hes done a good job Yans work down there hes had to wrestle with Lyn kid and malio potit this is not his specialty and the castle guard trying to make some noise a lot of them gone for Thanksgiving break hell be a load in the Southern Conference Phil will not a lot of great big bodies in there Rex Steiner hell try a three splashes at home again didnt need much range not a real big guy at six Applause one offensive rebound third chance foul drawn fwit going back to the strike yeah made his last one see if he can continue that streak here sister plays professional basketball parents are both coaches Basketball family good looking stroke this percentage might start to go up a little bit clearly working on that thing that looks good two three in a row three in a row very impressive itll be important cuz hes going to get fouled in the Southern Conference going forward January and February March in Asheville for the Southern Conference Championship Camden releases a triple drills it he two for two on the year maybe John cam can really stroke a transfer from Memphis hes gotten bigger and stronger fowt fouled on the way up hell have a chance for more free throws Robby Baron picks up his fourth Music foul baren had had an active he doesnt have a lot of stats three points four rebounds fouls see right here yeah got some ball but bumped him with the body thats four in a row for filwit its one for eight coming into the Music Applause game W Steiner hell try a contested three yeah Im not sure that was the one coach young was looking for lot of freshman on the floor for both Music Applause Music sides NJ Collins will come back on in place of Rex Music Steiner hes approaching that Sentry Mark again theres Reiner understanding that that was not the shot the coach wanted Bailey knocks one down for from the corner Jak Collins get a little point guard action here for the last minute and 20 seconds Baron turns it over Bailey gets it Music back one minute to play one minute to play Lorens High arching triple wont fall this filwit playing really well here the last four minutes hell take it himself lay it in and a foul he had the big size advantage against Tyler nickel right there he was wanting the ball that whole possession finally got it chance for the threepoint opportunity two points away from a double double well hes hes earned a double double cuz he is hes been one of the harder workking men out there on Applause court and pushes it himself hell try the three again I dont I dont necessarily think that was the shot coach was looking for C pushed it down was open from long range likely the final Watford possession of the game and civil trains the three Mike young pointing to the midcourt strike holds out his hand tells MJ to Wi that the game in which there are so many connections between Watford and Virginia Tech and on this Sunday night in blackburg the greatest coach in wford history Mike young knocks off his former program wford 987 six the final score yeah more more of a competitive game than the final score would indicate but uh Mike young has to be
