Jaylen Harlson Officials today Tommy Morrisy Shawn Hill Kellen Milanick and Notre Dame will control Haroldson was playing on the wing but with Burton out more ball handling duties for him Something he did when he was in high school Sir Mohamd after a big game against Miami the other night getting the start And that is Carson Talant who cant finish inside The Irish have struggled to get production from their bigs Starting lineups for Virginia Tech We have seen the star turn for three in white Ben Hammond 15 per game in conference That leads the team in ACC games Gerak the freshman on the inside Thats too easy Yeah Going inside taking a play out of Miamis playbook on Tuesday They absolutely gutted the Irish inside Had 26 points in the first half Points in the paint cheering Youll see the starting lineups for Notre Dame Braden Shrewsbury the coachs kid Logan IMS seeing more minutes with Burton out Theres Mohamd And thats what they want from him They want him to be more aggressive They feel he is an elite passer but he needs to seek his own offense more Yeah they put him in the starting lineup He came in he was he turned the energy in that game on Tuesday 11 quick points in the first half Coach Rusberry says I got to get this kid uh on that starting lineup This is Bedford a 22 Wednesday against SMU and he picks up where he left off I like this kid Pat He moves well without the basketball finding his spots on the floor right where they can distribute him the basketball where he likes to get his good looks and he cans His first jumper of the afternoon Here comes and the tough shot plus the foul going right up against the 610 Gak Well you can see has been told to these Irish players We are going to do better at attacking the basket Three players going to the rack for the first three field goals IMS has got to be better protecting the ball than he was last time out with the six turnovers This time ultra aggressive and going to the basket Concentration after the contact trying to create uh complete the threepoint play which it could not Yeah thats been a thing with Notre Dame this year IMS was a 46 free throw shooter entering play They have not been a very good free throw shooting team Virginia Tech Wednesday went down to the wire again Lost on a buzzer beater from half court at SMU Almost became the first team to win on SMUs home floor this year Ammani Hanssbury their leading scorer left the three short Mike Young calls him the straw that stirs the drink cheering Now Tout leading rebounder in division one last year while with Northern Arizona Mohhamd from the outside that goes I love that right there Right You go inside you get a bucket inside youre feeling good about your shot on the outside Next time it co you get the ball right on that right wing there You knock one down Hey give Tout a lot of credit for finding his shooter out there on that perimeter Just the sixth three of the season for Mohamd Here is Neo AD Dallas the freshman from Greece 69 with vision Bedford Another three Doesnt go Mohamd there for the rebound So Sir Mohamd rewarding Micah Shrewberry and the decision to put him in the starting lineup today Well he has earned this opportunity and he is making the most of it He had five already Was looking for seven Heres Hammond Virginia Tech still without Tyler Johnson Missing his fifth straight game with an ankle Hanssbury Theres the quick double A Dallas Hammond The three rattles in I like that ball does not stick in Neos hands Bang bang Swing that thing over there and Hammond knocks it down Just 511 170 lbs Watch this kid Number three can absolutely fly up and down the floor and he is fearless at taking a shot from the outside IMS misfires Bedford cleans Well Virginia Tech wants a open pace in this game They want to see this thing played up in the mid 80s low 90s if they can get it Hanssbury over the smaller Shrewberry taking advantage of the mismatch Big strong young man 235 245 lbs Slams that shoulder right into the defender Creates a little space and then knocks it in He step in the back court cheering Wow Pressure by Virginia Tech at half Gourd gets a turnover but look at my guy Ben H not afraid to doubles on the season Over 15 and a half points Plays good defense Grabs nine music rebounds a game have four offensive rebounds at SMU We asked Mike Young do you worry about a game like Wednesday where Virginia Tech music look to have it locked up and then you blow it late Boopy Miller hits a halfcourt three as time expires Do you worry about a loss like that beating you twice and he quickly said no And the why is the leadership of Anammani Hanssbury Yeah it really gave this kid high praise Not only for his play but youre right for his leadership ability to get these guys back refocused ready to come out here and compete this afternoon on Saturday Look at these numbers on Hansbury last season This year nine and a half 98 points last season 15 12 and nine rebounds this year cheering That time Hanssbury walked Hes not immune from the announcer Jinx We slap that on him there a highlight on He certainly did get praise from his coach and he was out there and he turns it over Toby Lewal who since coming back from a foot injury has been coming off the bench is into the game for Virginia Tech Ammon defending Shrewberry Well Shrewberry has not had much space to operate He knocks down that jumper But the domino effect of losing Marcus Burton its one less guy to help off of if youre a defense And so Shrewsburys had to work harder for his looks Yeah Shrewberry hes absolutely fantastic Hes number one in the ACC shooting that thing for up 45 for the first couple basketball games But look on the wall his footwork down there his patience his size goes inside for a hard plot bucket All he did was have 10 and eight at SNU and to see right now quickly get into the scoring off the bench this afternoon He went right at Cole Serto Lal with that 50in vertical is fouled on the way up Oh you gave him another half inch I did 49 12 graduated above 49 12 All right Well look at this right here Look at his footwork down here Takes his time surveys the defense I love that little step through duck underneath the defender for easy bucket And then this one right here Smart decision to slap that ball out of his hands before he parted that rim home with him on his drive back after the basketball game The foul on the freshman Harelson Hes a pogo stick 49 and a half inch vertical when it was measured Mike Young has called him the best athlete he has ever coached Well I like this player I I I mean I theres theres one thing to start basketball games and theres another thing to impact basketball games and I think whether this kid is starting or hes coming off the bench he has a big impact on the game And he does it with a British accent Even better Its a little extra spice on top I like that little Austin Powers or or something different Sundra I I think its a little more elevated than Austin Powers Here comes IMS down the lane Hanssbury the denial And now Tech wants to push Yeah a lot of contact at that rim I love the fact these officials are letting them play Wall just got away with switching his pivot Lal had a size advantage there on passed it up Now the 69 F Dallas down low Hanssbury goes right at Sundra The double from Serta and Hansbury dips into that wardrobe of low post moves Yeah given the old youre too small down there to Sundra but that was a nice move He saw the double team coming from the middle and he broke it back Came back baseline but there was no help Got a clean look for left shoulder turn right hand hook another turnover Hanssbury forcing the steal Here comes up Dallas to Hammond Its a 132 run by Virginia Tech Timeout Notre Dame I love that though The little pokey Turned that ball around Got it going the other way Easy bucket Ill tell you what these Tech No no hangover from that tough loss on Wednesday Theyre fired up Good defense there on Mohamd Over and back Call the back trying to get the ball to his point guard so bad but he had crossed over the half court and Hammond had yet to establish himself Oh Ill tell you what I dont know about now that I get a second look at that Im unsure of not quite sure he had the ball in the front court yet Coaches have a challenge but that is not a play you can challenge I saw it live time just like the official Well I thought he had thrown in the back court but uh that young man did not Shoot commits the foul on Serta Micah Shrewsbury in his third season at Notre Dame If James Franklin were to make an appearance today he and Micah Shrewberry crossed over at Penn State Yesterday at Notre Dame shoot there were some Virginia Tech football staffers who Shrewberry knew from his Penn State days Heres Kaylor talented freshman from Fisers Indiana Shrewsbury their best threepoint shooter off the dribble That doesnt go Knocked out of bounds It will stay with Notre Dame but resets the shot clock to 20 Yeah Shroomsberry is a much better threepoint shooter when he is a catch and shoot threepoint shooter when hes got to dribble to a spot on the floor to get his shot off his percentages drop off dramatically He came into the game shooting just 10 for 38 from the field cheering in ACC play Thats 26 Thats a long three by Shrewberry It almost felt like he forced that one Case in point trying to dribble into his own shot Very inaccurate You can see he came up with the air ball on that one And these Virginia Tech fans letting him know about it Shrewberry 45 from three The rest of the team 34 Lwal lines it up too strong And the rebound to Shrewberry Yeah its only L He can make a threepoint shot but thats not his specialty Look at that Shrewberry to Sundra And thats a goend on Gak And for Garrett Sundra give him two points in his previous three games a span of 66 minutes two points total 0 for eight from the field Well I like the fact he used his wheels And after that long shot the Irish were able to get out and run before uh Virginia Tech could set their defense And thats why they got that bucket They had been stuck in mud offensively for a moment there And they use that good rebound to get out and run in transition Find Sundra under the basket for the easy bucket And to some degree as Lwal gets fouled on the drive Notre Dame has to play in mud without music Marcus Burton It has changed the complexion of how in the final minute in all three Yeah that one against SMU You are the best player Bloopy Miller went off for 22 points in that gamewinning half court shot but they had their chances They snatched the feet from the jaws of victory You mentioned the baseline turnover They missed the front end of two separate free throws uh the one inone situation and then I dont understand how you let Boopy Miller get a running shot of the threepoint shot or half point shot Thats all these kids practice anymore Digest this for a moment In all three ACC losses Virginia Tech was either tied or leading in the final 10 seconds Sundra has the three rim out Theyre 40 in overtime this season The last six games for the Hokes have either come down to the final possession of regulation or the game went into three overtimes as was the case in their win against Virginia Yeah three ACC losses by a combined five points and thatll make the coach want to pull what little hair he has left on the top of his head Heres the super freshman short on the front end 0 for seven at SNU Uh you said two for 17 Hes now two for his last 20 and Shrewsbury lays it in at the other end Okay now Dane trying to pick up their offensive production here They they realize yes we got to slow this thing down but we got to run off of these threepoint shots that are missed They defend the threepoint shot better than anybody in the ACC And they get out and run and get buckets quickly And theyve done that twice here this afternoon Gerak coughs it up Thats another thing Notre Dame doesnt do a whole lot They dont force many turnovers Serta from deep He can get hot Hes a threepoint shooter and when hes on he can carry an offense for a stretch Yeah Certified on that particular shot That was quick We talked about scoring after misses Thats about as fast as you want Not Notre Dame wants to play right there Letting them play through Jump ball Possession arrow to Virginia Tech Yeah sir Mohamads got a little fat and a little nasty in it right Got a little sandpaper a little grid hard hat fudge pale down there strapping underneath in that paint But music look at this one here Thats like a logo three from the hash mark right in front of coach Young He didnt like the results of that shot at all Coach Young should have got a hand up Whats he doing over there Hokes without a field goal in more than three minutes Bedford too much The drought continues Well Irish doing a better job right and getting that taking care of the basketball Dont commit those live ball turnovers Now we can get our defense set Make them have to play in the half court You can see Virginia Tech doesnt like to play in the half court Sundra too much Rebound by Hanssbury Heres Bedford coming off a 22point game Jaden shoot and Lal turns it over Toby Lewal is saying it didnt hit my foot He would like Coach Young to challenge whether or not that ball actually did go off of his foot Coach Young decides he will not challenge A little more time we can look at it looked like it may have gotten off Kaylor Yeah right off the top of Kaylors foot right foot and out of bounds Lost opportunity Sera thought about it Hammond in his grill Yeah Hammond said I got to get out here three four feet in front of that threepoint line after knocked that one down Shot clock down to four Mohamd left it short Follows the miss Mohamd through traffic Loose ball picked up by Kaylor Bumping with Lwal And its a twopoint game Got a rebound that ball Virginia Tech couldnt put a fork in it It goes right to Taylor who puts a nice shoulder into the defender Goes off glass Just as we were reminding folks that every Virginia Tech game comes down to the wire Notre Dame on a 70 run Hanssbury the face up Yes Oh get the ball into the hands of your most productive player when things are going arry And he knocked down a little midi off the right side Six points for Hanssbury cheering Sundra boy his shot just has not been there Another turnover and its Mohhamd whos got seven to lead the Irish Oh Sir Mohamad is flexing play with his daddy Nazi in the NBA with the Philadelphia Sixers You know hes at home watching this one with a big old smile on his face while his son is out there competing here in Blackburg Dad was a standout at Kentucky 18 seasons in the NBA and Abdales gets fouled It is on Mohamd Its his first today It is the first of four on ACC Network Big day of college basketball getting started with Notre Dame and Virginia Tech at Castle Coliseum Ben Hammond with his second three Hes got eight points and he has taken off really since the start of December Yeah like Hammonds game 15 points a game in ACC action Finds that one on the right wing Great job by Coach Young and company dialing that one up with a threepoint shooter Now Mike Young telling us last year when they played Hammond as a freshman Young said he made mistakes and he had to play through them and he said those reps Young was confident it would pay off Its paying off now Yeah he was over amped I think at some of those basketball games He already plays at a break neck speed but you got to play under control He was out of control too often Harlsons been quiet Notre Dames leading scoreer And the freshman stepped out of bounds Hes coming off backto back 18point games 16 12 in conference play And without Marcus Burton lets be honest he has been the offense for the Irish Yeah hes had to do a lot Panel tote that rock up the floor get his teammates involved look for his own offense Thats a lot to put on the plate of a freshman and he has handled really well Kicked that one right back into the other freshman superstar Harlson 67 the highest ranked recruit to sign with Notre Dame in the modern era a McDonalds AllAmerican He does not have a field goal attempt so far Abdales has not scored but hes got four assists Hanssbury kicks it out from a double team A Dallas with five launches and hits He was due He was two for his previous 20 from downtown I I think thats over two But a nice job getting himself on balance Got himself right where he likes to shoot from the top of the floor And Harlson traveled So perhaps eager to get going Uh one too many steps Yeah backto back turnovers for Harlson But I love that one there Look at the precision passing right in the shooters pocket All hes got to do is catch and stroke Its a long threepoint a free throw rather That threepoint shot becomes a long free throw when you can get those feet set prior to receiving the pass A 6 run for Virginia Tech Ansbury goes to work on tout The tip by Abdales No Lal fighting for the rebound Bodies fly will get a foul on the Irish Well they kept it alive It was Neo that kept it alive and then Lu he used that Would you give him a 50inch vertical underneath the sky to get his balls on that ball and I think Iris got a little bit of his arm and then they got that collision there But I love when big strong young men play like big strong young men You have teeth clacking together underneath there giving it all for their team and their university Lal heads to the bench Gerak in the foul on Serta His first fourth team foul Hanssbury coming down the lane Too easy Eight points for Ammani Hanssbury Hes like a truck He got that 240 lb frame and is just playing bully basketball in the paint And a foul on the floor Now one thing with Braden Shrewberry last year they encouraged him to do more of that Take the ball to the basket take his man off the dribble Yes hes done some of that but with Harelson with Burton you can be the perimeter guy hunting your threes Well now with Burton out theres more impetus for Shrewberry to create for himself Yeah 113 of his 140 field goals behind the yard So hes still got to do more of taking it to the rack But you can see his mindset is there when theyre going to close out on my threepoint shot I got to put the ball on the floor and attack Serta and that goes over the backboard Tout setting the screen Something else Micah Shrewsbury told me at shoot around last night he wants his forwards and bigs to be more aggressive and really help guys get open with the screen game Yeah you got to set those solid bigs Thats one thing that uh you know I couldnt play Couldnt jump over a phone book but I could get my shooters open You Michael Jordan or John Pax and come off one of my screens Theyre going to get a good look And thats cheering a good bucket inside Largest lead of the game Now theyre just banging away in the interior on the smallest Irish defense Its a 100 run for the Hokes who are shooting 63 from the field Tout denied at the rim by Abdales Batted in the air Sundra had it kicks it back to Shrewsbury Shot clock at nine I I believe there should have been a reset on that shot clock and thats where the stoppage comes in Yeah you Yeah youre 100 right That that ball hit the rim and it should have been reset and to 20 seconds and it was not reset Uh so theyre probably going to add an additional four or five seconds to that shot clock Well Tal goes in here and you can see it almost looks like an error Does it hit the rim I I think it does on the tip right there and that should have been 20 and they kept it at 14 So theyre going to add six more seconds probably uh to this shot clock Yeah there they go They got it right This officiating crew theyve been good They letting the kids play and um they get some good ACC action as a result cheering Notre Dame more than four minutes since its last field goal Tout tough pass to handle Shot clock back to five Serta on the drive through the contact Draws the foul Yeah you got hands trying to come over and challenge at the rim But hey let lets give this young man a lot of credit He came in there realizing he got a big defender coming over here and try to block my shot Im gonna take it right to the body of that shot blocker and get myself to the line Sera one of the best free throw shooters in the conference Hes automatic for his career Now he is 46 out of 49 Weve got a quadruple header today on ACC and Syracuse music and BC And then UNCC and Duke continue their West Coast swing North Carolina goes to Cal after losing to Stanford the other night Duke goes to Maples Pavilion in the night cap Now hard for these East Coast teams to go all the way out to California and get victories Talent Stanford aint no easy win Im Dallas looking for help Turns it over Yeah should should have looked for the shot Tried to find his big underneath Gerak and coughed it up Shrewsbury has it poked away by Hammond Shoot ahead of the pack Throws it up and draws the foul Another live ball turnover leading to easy opportunities for Virginia Tech to get their fast break going And Shrewberry as we mentioned does want to try to take it to the hole but you got to worry about that defender coming out of the corner clamping down on you and he coughs it up And then they are off to the races I like this kid shoot right here He can stroke it from the outside Hit a big threepoint shot at SMU to put him up by four with just moments to play You would have thought that was going to be the dagger field goal but then as we know they they gave up the victory Yeah he had 15 in that game four of six from three a transfer from Duke in his second season with Virginia Tech But to your earlier point about the live ball turnovers Notre Dame the way its presently built doesnt have a big margin for error And when you look at how theyve played they turn it over a lot They turn it over at the highest rate in the ACC They dont force many turnovers They dont get many steals They dont get many blocks They havent been a very good free throw shooting team So you have to find a way to make up that margin somewhere right They dont get many points in the paint They dont get many fast break points The only way that they can compete is when theyre knocking in their triples and they havent done that early They just turn it over again They turned it over again 10sec violation And look at the turnover margin amongst the very worst in division one And you know for the Irish in three of their four ACC games theyve had twice as many turnovers as assists Yeah 33 There aint but what 365 diffusion one college basketball squad So obviously they got to pick it up here I think theyll get Hannah Hodal to come out here and the point for them I love the way that gal plays She torched my Tar Hills earlier in the week Yeah well see her on ACCN later this week Hammond That would have been his third three Mohamed is there for the rebound In conference games the Irish with a minus7 turnover margin Serta you cannot leave him that open Thats another three for the sophomore Yeah his second on that right side there And again not trying to create his own threepoint shot letting one of his teammates help him get a good look Hammond splits the D screaming and one Like a cheering bayonet through the heart of this Notre Dame defense Oh my goodness This been hammering is an undefeated champion the way theyve played this year they are in the conversation Best team ever for I dont know if its best team ever but amongst the very best weve seen in college football You way you just laid that out You got me excited Im going to be in Miami Im leaving straight after the game to go to Miami Does the huddle need somebody to run some stats or hold a mic so I can get to the game Thats how you do it Thats how you do it Put it out there on anybody listening to me Hello Is this thing on Get Scott Williams a press Press pass Thats all I need I dont even need to see Just give me a press pass Tout no good down low Boy I tell you what Irish theyre just theyre not turning the ball over They just seem they cant finish inside Bedford launches offensive rebound Hanssbury shoot puts it on the floor Thats not really his game Lal back in there cheering How do you like that Made me throw my hands up in the air like my goodness Came to a complete did stop Looked like he was stoned by the defense and then just uses those pogo stick like lays Got 50in vert and just jumped over the top of the defender Shrewberry with a deep three in and out It will stay with Notre Dame Virginia Tech with its largest lead of the game Well Lo got himself in some trouble He was shooting threes so he decided to put his head down and he was stoned down there on that right block But look at the footwork to get back into a power position and jump right up over the top of the defender for the jam Serta coming off a screen and he is fouled Thats going to be three shots Toby Lwal committed the foul and Well the wall makes the Cardinal send after a great play offensively They really wonder is Lwal Okay Yeah hes a hes a Remember he missed more than a month with a left foot injury He definitely I think it was a knee on knee thing situation where they his knee slammed into Seras knee in the air there Hell be able to walk that one off But uh yeah you would to close out on a threepoint shooter You dont block too many threepoint shots so stop a little short balance the shot and make sure you dont commit the foul Lower legs collide with one another 11 points for Serta who is perfect at the free throw line He leads Notre Dame in scoring Hammond with 11 to lead Virginia Tech Abdales five assists Hammond with that lightning quick first step No good on the three Haroldson with the rebound He has not attempted a field goal in the first half And Mohamd continues to shine He had 15 Tuesday against Miami Hes got nine in the first half today Yeah Mohamd has done a nice job playing under control Right and hes knocked down the outside triple Hes gone inside all the way to the basket That was a little floater from about 6 8 ft out So really good rhythm to his game offensively Abdales the baseline drive and hell go to the line for two That was a lowife move he made down along the right side But lets go back to Mohamd and sing his praises because this kid and along with Serta have been the bright spot for coach Rusberry and staff and trying to keep Notre Dame within touch of Virginia Tech But that move along the baseline by this kid right here young freshman from Greece Uh thats a prolike move to sneak through there and music finish not on the same side of the basket but the opposite side of the basket and drawing that contact The foul on Haroldson his second And Scott when you watch Neo out of Dallas hes not quite as tall but I posed this question to you off air Do you see a little Tony Cuck coach Yeah you did And listen I Ive watched this kid now for about four halves of basketball And I started to see the way he moves his vision the way he passes the ball with precision Another live ball turnover Uhoh this is trouble Lal with that pogo stick vertical there for the put back How about it Two Going to be him or Hansberry on that particular play And theyre just really just taking a lot of the life out of this Note team with these live ball turnovers Now theyre running into one another out there Mohamd did everything there but finished Now hoist the three Offensive rebound Harelson And he gets his first two points of the game with about a minute to go in the half And they needed that offensive rebound and put back Virginia Tech was really starting to grab a lot of this momentum Maybe thatll give the Irish a little something to smile about here If they can get a stop at the score and take it to the locker room Shoot Dangerous Curling off those screens and another foul down low Yeah I got a push in the back Name any Irish you want down there trying to keep Hanssbury off of that offensive glass Theyre going to give it to tout the big fella Hes just Its just like wrestling an alligator if youre trying to stop hands very down low You got to grab him Listen Im the alltime ACC fouls leader I know something about grabbing and and scratching and clawing down there for those rebounds Hanssburys got nine in this first half We remind you womens basketball Thursday on ACC mentioned Hannah Adalgo Yeah they get to see her at 600 pm Eastern when Notre Dame hosts Miami and then North Carolina Georgia Tech at 800 pm Adalgo at uh Iowa State too Audi Crooks Audi Crooks No shes at uh at USC Who Who am I thinking of Audi Crooks Shes Iowa State Iowa State Okay you nailed it Yeah she she can go as well I love her You ever follow her on social media I do not Shes hilarious Serna no good Haroldson on cleanup duty Backto back offense A rebound for the Irish Getting some points in the paint They get a stop here I know its an 11point deficit but they get a little bit of life No quit in the Fighting Irish Final 20 seconds Hooks have led by as many as 14 shooting 56 from the field in the opening half Three players in double figures led by Hammond with 11 Heres Hammond splitting the D again His pass almost picked off Itll stay with Virginia Tech 36 on the clock Yeah they couldnt couldnt get the ball in bounds Lets see what they do here with 36 to work The skip pass They wanted Lwal Its picked off by Harlson and he chucks it down court And thats how the first 20 minutes comes to an end Three players got to get it going if the Irish have any chance of chewing into that 11point deficit Haroldson their leading scoreer in conference play And without Marcus Burton whos out with a broken left ankle suffered last month Haroldson has been the focal point offensively for Notre Dame Hes out there with Shrewberry Touts and Muhammad who got the start today Well the good news for as they turn it over Shrewberry steps on the sideline The good news for Harlson is point guards uh have been absolutely torching Virginia Tech especially in the second half So they get a little lacadasical and if Harelson excuse me if Harelson can get a couple shots to go inside maybe thatll open up his jumper from the perimeter Yeah weve seen Boopy Miller do it We saw I Bua Okorei do it We saw Nate Calse do it Hanssbury kicks it out of the double Abdales rotates to Bedford who knocks down the three Thats six dimes for the Gresian Neo Abdales Yeah they only shot four of 12 from behind the yard But that gives them their first triple and it gets them off the launch pad quickly here in the second half And this young man right here was that Serta That was IMS I he was fearless at taking the ball to the basket Now he gets a little jump shot coming off a good solid screen right there at the free throw line A Dallas quick pass Hammond Look at the ball movement Its Bedford again The corner three This time it doesnt go But Virginia Tech getting good looks when Notre Dame doubles Yeah but they dont want to fall in love with that outside shot Theyre so good at going inside They had 20 points in the paint in that first half And thats thats where they want to live against this smalish Irish team Notre Dame wants them to shoot that outside shot and knowing that uh they wont get pounded in the interior Hanssbury picks up his second foul Quiet first half for Tout Did not score only one rebound He averages 10 a game Mohamd from the corner and that goes second three for Sir Mohamd Hes got a dozen to lead all scores Ill tell you what this is a a really great job by Muhammad You know he like I said he had 11 points in the first half on Tuesday Gets the start here uh on Saturday afternoon and he has not missed a beat This guy is bringing his game to the yard the son of 18year NBA veteran Nazi Mohamd Hanssbury a handful down low and Tout picks up the foul Notre Dame really has not had an answer for Hansbury in the post No he he he and hes a smart player right Hes a vet Hes a pro I could see the leadership They had a 14point advantage Soon as Notre Dame cuts it to single digits Hanssberry gets the ball in his hands and says Let me attack inside No more threepoint shots Lets pound this smallest Irish team in the interior Now thats something weve seen him do all season He finds a mismatch or a matchup he likes down low Hes not trying to put anything on tape for NBA scouts Hes going to go get the two and punish the matchup Yeah And and thats exactly what what he does And thats why he goes for 15 and a half a game Thats why he gets nine rebounds And you can plug that guy in it at those numbers every night Hes going to give you exactly what you what you need 12 points three rebounds today Shrewsbury the floater Tout there for the follow He was the nations leading rebounder last year at Northern Arizona Yeah And the ACCs leading offensive rebounder He gets 37 offensive rebounds a game I was wondering when he was going to put his fingerprints on this basketball game here this afternoon He finally gets one to go Now the 69 off Dallas Hanssbury and one 15 for Ammani Hanssbury who was coming off a season low against SMU on Wednesday 68 240 lbs of steel down there amongst the bodies of those Irish They trying to get him off of that spot but they just cannot And look at he got muscles on top of muscles flexing underneath there I used to look like that kind of I was waiting for it That was about 610 You know everyones posting their pictures from 10 years ago 2016 Bring it back Scotty Go into the vault I got to go back 40 years I dont laughter know if they even have color pictures back then Theres a swad in They also keep their challenge and they can challenge one more time now A great challenge by coach Young and get this basketball back Lets see what he drew up there during that long extended break there Now Dallas from the outside His second three His stroke looks good Like I think as as far as the form goes when he gets on balance I mean it looks like a an NBA style shot largest lead of the game for Tech Shrewsbury gets a pick in and out Theres Tout on the glass And now he goes to the line which uh has been adventurous and of late hes been practicing his free throws by using the backboard Scott yeah it aint the prettiest free throw shot but boy did he set a mansized pick on little Ben Hammond Ben Hammonds twist just went flying backwards the way Tout leveled him And as you can see by trying to hit the backboard first it is uh an inconsistent shot And if you dont put enough air into that ball get it high enough up into the square it comes off flat just like it Then you have no chance for that ball to stay around the rim and then fall in Hes a 48 free throw shooter on the season and he missed them both 43 for his career Yeah I shot 55 at Carolina Here I am trying with him out there Im going to give this kid free throw shooting instructions Theres Hammond using the baseline Denied You know that might be the next itineration you go and try the Rick Barry underhanded style Nobody wants to see that How effective was it though Thats one of the great free throw shooters weve ever seen for him Yes I think he did that one right out of the cradle but uh now when youre trying to get it going I theres a kid that has a little hitch in his shot over at Boston College I wouldnt advise that either but its just confidence Its stepping to the line One thing I realized I was a not a confident shooter in college When I got to the pros I was a much more confident free throw shooter And thats what you got to have Toby Lwal heads to the free throw line as he draws the foul OKs look to threes here to kind of get him going Cut to that 15point deficit cuz Lwal and Hansberry Barry and the rest of the company have just been attacking and gutting the Irish inside Lwals got 11 to go along with seven rebounds The last foul on Tout hes got three Harlson with three fouls as well And Virginia Tech a perfect 16 of 16 from the free throw line Well thats something they didnt do against SMU No theyre knocking their shots in And then Sertas got to get going again as well Its another guy for the Irish that can make threepoint shots Theres a little foul out there on the perimeter Unnecessary Is that going to be on Hammond Thats a reach on Hammond his second No just Okay I thought that was his third but again get sort of a clean look here at a triple Kaylor no call Another strip by Hanssbury A turnover by the Irish Hammond to shoot And theres an injured player Oh it is ADA and his entire team running to the other end of the floor A Dallas is down on the ground Yeah the freshman superstar from Greece for Virginia Tech Slow to get up Yeah you got to bang bang knees down there when Cole Kaylor went to the uh basket Um thats one that just hurts like the Dickens and you then you got to try to walk it off It looks like hes going to go to the bench for a short period of time See if that pain doesnt subside Maybe put a little ice on it Go one more time here Kaylor goes inside there You could see that that when you get hit on the inside of your knee it is the absolute worst place to take a blow Looks like somebody music just hits you with a little baseball bat And um hell be fine Some dirt on it as they say As he was walking toward the bench he kind of waved everybody off as if to say Ill be all right Bedford comes in for Abdales to give him a breather Theres probably some pro scouts in in here held their breath when took that shot was down on the floor He has been drawing upwards of 2025 scouts at his games Lwal with 14 points to go along with seven rebounds Its a 100 run for Tech This Toby Lewal is impressive He takes his time He doesnt hes not in a hurry down there He surveys the defense and then he delivers a winning play And you could talk all you want about that 49 12 in vertical but the kid is also has uh some skills Yeah he started playing basketball right before he turned 16 Was a soccer track guy as Sundra drops it in While he was in school overseas in England he and a few guys got banished from the soccer field so they needed to find a new sport He comes to basketball Wise decision Best thing that happened to him was getting kicked off the pitch Huh The pitch to the hardwood and they love his upside as Hansbury is able to draw the foul on Sundra Well if youre telling me basketball was not his first sport growing up as a kid and that he was a soccer player and hasnt been playing all that long his potential upside is uh tremendous because his basketball IQ is not lacking Obviously hes got the athleticism to go with it and he seems to be a hungry aggressive uh player thats only going to serve him work his way through mistakes quickly had a breakout season last year and you know was on his way to another one this year before the injury sidelined him for more than a month 17 points now for Hansberry So you know coaches asked me to give him five and five I get you five and five You ask me to give you 10 and 10 and 10 I get you five and five This kid Hanssberry he goes out there and delivers the same numbers on a consistent basis upper teens points and then close to 10 rebounds a game Matthew Mlelen into the game for Notre Dame Virginia Tech 13 Thats his third personal Hanssbury picks up his third foul Something to watch Fifth team foul on Virginia Tech you know with Harelson we kind of knocking him for not scoring points for his ball club today but he has been distributing that rock and after that good pick uh and a hard roll to the basket he delivered that pass on time and on target and got one of his partners an opportunity to gain a couple points from the free throw line cheering Mlen had only played in three games entering today So youre telling me Coach Shrewsberry is hes rolling all the all the uh pages in that playbook and calling everybodys number he can And as Lwal continues to punish the Irish inside Jaylen Har and that is on Harelson and that is his fourth So 1355 to go in the ball game and Harlson with four fouls You lose him again for a team that doesnt have many scoring options Thats one you might not recover from Yeah I I dont think I know Coach Shrewsbury is realizing hey were about to go down 20 I maybe got to keep my my super freshman on the floor but I dont think he can keep him on there with almost 14 minutes to play Again we got a sub Sir Mohamd coming in here for Harlson You cant keep him on the bench too long but you know at about eight eight or nine minutes if this deficit hasnt shrunk you got to get him in the game if you want any chance The lead is 19 That matches the largest of the game And Virginia Tech a perfect 20 of 20 at the foul line They were only 11 of 18 Wednesday at SMU Yeah you can see the star stories down there on the season 15 for Harlson 11 for uh Shrewsbury And tonight they got less than 10 combined points So a big drop off in point production for the Irish Kaylor knocked down that last three Bedford to shoot You look at the five on the floor for Notre Dame Theres not a lot of bonafide offensive options out there Mohhamd lost it Youre almost looking to Mohhamd to be the guy And then if you could get Serta maybe open for a three but Shrewberrys on the bench Harlsons on the bench with four fouls Burtons out with the ankle Yeah And that was just a little pitch and catch that uh Hines and Muhammad could not connect on And another turnover It wasnt the live ball turnover variety but still when you in such a large deficit just cant have those unforced errors Mohamd picks up the foul That is the sixth team foul on Notre Dame So the next one puts Virginia Tech in the bonus Its two on Sir Mohamd And thats why you go inside right They were shooting a couple threes to start the second half Then Hansbury said No were going to attack inside Wow Was going inside You put all those all that pressure on the end here You get guys in foul trouble and you get yourself into the bonus situation early in the half Lal wants it Goes to work on Kaylor and draws the foul on Kaylor Thats his third Thats the second time now Lal is taking his time down there kind of with a jump stop almost like a a little bit of a pregnant pause and he gets the defender to think that hes going to go into an offensive motion and then just Kayla just gets offbalance and he gets enough of the body during the shot and the officials blow that whistle It wasnt a lot of contact but it was just enough after the hesitation shoulder fake to get himself to the line Meanwhile Abdales back in for Virginia Tech applause and cheering Now for Lal this is only his fourth game back from that foot injury and hes been coming off the bench And Mike Young told us having a guy like Lwal coming off the bench having Shoot off the bench that deepens the team It gives you an added element Shrewberry wide open has not had many wide open looks lately and he misfired badly Yeah but that thats not the first time you touch the ball And I realized hey the Tech fell asleep defensively got a clean look but you might want to get yourself lthered up a little bit get a sweat get a rhythm touch the ball once or twice pass it around Bedford using the window and Tech has its largest lead of the game It doesnt matter if its Wall or Bedford or Hanssberry or a number of other guys I mean they put five or six guys and double figures in scoring They share the ball real well I like a lot of things about this Huskies m Hokees basketball team Lal whistled for the foul but Virginia Tech I think Miami gives them a game Miami is going to be at home but Im riding with the Hooers Poor Michael laughter He has been enjoying this ride to the fullest as he should Listen the U is back The U is back Mario Crystal may not want to say it but the U is back Yes Uh but could could somebody make sure we have somebody there for uh Michael Irvin if this thing does not go the Kanes way We got to have some two maybe might might take two or three people to watch him after the game Hes had a lot of screen time lately Last foul on shoot the free throws by Serta Heres shoot at the other end and the three doesnt go Mohamd tracks it down All right so you get some free throws You get a stop and now you got attacking here underneath Mlen puts it in for two Hey thats what I like No fight uh no lack of fight here in the Fighting Irish coming out of that break there They got a little something cooking here Little momentum Theyve gone back into a little zone defense to give uh the Hookies a different look and they get a second stop in a row Mlelen a grad transfer from Nia Madonna Thats a school in Michigan Mohamads teardrop not there And Lal has to pull the rebound away from his own teammate Gerak Yeah he said Hey I got to get my uh double double Thats my eighth board You know let me have that one Gak at the other end And it flushes home Well good basketball After getting stopped twice defensively uh Virginia Tech does what Virginia Tech has been doing all afternoon and punishing the smaller Irish inside at the rim Mohamd looking for help Lost it Numbers for Tech A Dallas almost traveled Shoot That is knocked out of bounds by Notre Dame No they say Virginia Tech I thought Mohhamd got a piece of it Well that was about the ugliest fast break youre going to see after a live ball turnover And neither anybody for Virginia Tech could get a good handle on it And you can see yes off of the fingertips of Gerach and out of bounds That was the right call Shrewberry back in there Harlson in there as well with the four fouls as Mohhamd gets a rest Here is Harelson working on Lwal the freshman posting up too strong Nine rebounds for Lwal closing in on double double number four on the season Yeah good positive move by Harlson and uh he had a nice little look little right left shoulder turn of that right hand jump hook Just couldnt get it to go But I think thats where the Irish got to go So they got to try to get some buckets inside get themselves to the free throw line and then try to steal some outside jumpers late in this game Bedfords three not there Shrewberry skies for the car Better defense here the last three minutes for the Irish Long triple for Shrewberry That hits the front rim He has not been close 0 for five from three but the follow is there Yeah the offensive rebounds is one of the things that the Irish did real well in the first half Now theyve gotten a couple offensive rebounds here in the second half Plus its still a a 15point deficit but you got to like the way your teams playing if youre Shberry A Dallas looking for Lal Tech getting sloppy Theres Serta His three not there Rushed it Now shoot You nailed it Rushed it and never got on balance It was like I I got to get this thing up quickly cuz we dont have a lot of possessions left Well with 18 excuse me 8 minutes and 45 seconds left to play that is a ton of time in college basketball They got to help themselves knock those threepoint shooters down shots down by sharing the basketball not trying to dribble in the shots Bedford now the fourth hokey in double figures with 10 Right on his season average the UNLV transfer That cheering doesnt go Heres AD Dallas Quick trigger threes is not the way to get yourself back into a ball game Dallas defended by Harlson Tout comes over to help now A turnover Hanssbury had a mismatch down low Yeah I I dont think Coach Young liked that pass out of his young superstar Haroldson puts it in for the easy two Hes got eight Thats how you get you cut it to a deficit Not threepoint shots Pick and rolls Punch it inside Attack the interior High percentage shot If youre Virginia Tech are you going after Harlson knowing hes got the four Got to right Like thats a smart basketball Theyre going to do everything Hes going to do everything to lay off of players Look at Hansberry going inside Tout just picked up his fourth foul Seven and a half remaining in regulation Virginia Tech up 15 What is he doing on an exercise bike over there on the bench That should have a an ice pack on his legs or something Not trying to keep him warm This kids going to overheat Hanssbury He just hes just keeping the beat rolling He knocked that first one in didnt he A perfect 23 of 23 Lets see if the common Terry Jinx doesnt get him here Mu he flirted with it but he got the friendly roll 24 of 24 from the line Hanssbury now with 19 to lead all scores to go along with four rebounds Kaylor from inside 15 Ammon wants to run Yeah and they are running And but thats the one Kaylors got to take all the way to hole No little floater in there Go in there and try to jam it Thats why you push all those weights in the in the summertime You get on that sled and the leg press Dak kept it alive It comes to Hanssbury Fresh 20 Bedford over Shrewberry Follows his miss Hes got a dozen Hes just faster to the ball He had a little more want to than Shrewsberry did after that initial miss He just went in there and snatched it and put it back in And a tough game for Shrewsbury on both ends offensively Just two for nine from the field He was 0 for8 and went scoreless against Virginia Tech last year And we get a foul on Hanssbury and that is his fourth Virginia Tech Well I I thought it was maybe going to go down on shoot and Kaylor were down there wrestling on the block as well but they youre right They got Hansbury out there on that perimeter Now Notre Dame is in the bonus situation Going to go to the line and shoot some free some freebies here But for Ein its a mystery whether or not hes going to be able to knock them both in A career 68 free throw shooter but this season 46 cheering And he gets the front end Notre Dame as a team below 70 and you know you you start asking why Well you take a really good free throw shooter like Marcus Burton 92 What does his injury do Coaches saying Well now a guy like Jaylen Harrisons getting to the foul line more because hes driving and now you go from a 92 free throw shooter in Burton to a 62 free throw shooter in Harelson Yeah And look at Virginia Tech here now with a little over six minutes to play Theyre slowing down their attack Theyre theyre going to be patient use a little bit of that shot and game clock Looks like Notre Dames in his zone The lob for Lal and he is fouled Going up to catch it What a luxury uh to be able to take 28 seconds off of that game clock and then just throw the ball up to number one Youve got that huge vertical leap that can just sky over the top of that zone defense and snatch that ball Now the wall Well you mentioned hes already 10 to 10 from the line after missing a I guess I want to say an opportunity on at SNU had he made two free throws to salt the game away The young man steps back in here today and goes 10 of uh 11 from the free throw line So I I like the confidence that he has showed in his ability to knock in the free throws 24 out of 25 today 11 of 18 in the loss Wednesday One out of two 19 points nine rebounds for Toby Lwal Yeah he hes got 19 Hanssbury on a bench with 19 Got three other players uh in double figures for Virginia Tech Im liking what Im seeing out of this Hokei squad Uh Anish I laughter what about you Are you liking the way theyve come back after a tough loss on the road on Wednesday and performed here this early afternoon It says a lot about what this team can be and where this team is at as Lwal picks up his third foul But we asked Mike Young do you worry about a loss like that where you had victory snatched from you late snowballing and a loss beating you more than once and he said No not with this team And he pointed to guys like Hansbury their leadership their messaging on the floor off the floor Now they came out from the outset you wouldnt know what happened to the previous game Yeah And I Im going to give a lot of credit to Ben Hammond as well The way hes played today I remember first time I got a chance to see him was his first game back He was completely helter skelter He was out out of control I got a chance to meet his his folks after the game his dad And I didnt want to talk bad about his young man whos out there trying to compete in his first game but a night and day difference from what I saw a year ago to where this kid is today Now he just turns the ball over Kaylor gets the steal and Bedford does not commit the foul 7763 5 12 to go And then think about this Tyler Johnson whos missed the last five games their best wing defender kind of a jack of all Theyre hoping to get him back soon Hes out today but Mike Young told us hes really progressing in his recovery Bedfords three raises the rim Well this little uh zone defense Notre Dame has slapped on Tech has made a little bit of a difference Whether or not its enough to get them back into this game here as they still face this 14point deficit yet to be determined Lal got the block but Taylor was fouled beforehand I was wondering Yeah I was wondering if that might have been goalending Lel got up so high to get this one But look at this one more time Just stepping in that passing lane coming out of that zone defense and Kaylor like a blurt to the other end gets a a quick bucket So yes you want to play that zone defense to create some turnovers and to be able to try to get on the glass yourself Um but you got to worry about hey if we sit back in that zone were not going to force any turnovers um quick enough to cheering have to fight against that game clock thats under 5 minutes to play now One out of two for Kaylor Hes got 10 which matches his careerh high Yeah Wall with that uh snatch of that board gives him a double double on the season Now 19 and 10 Fourth time hes recorded a double double this year Third act with great position down low No good He rushed it He got down there in good position and just squirted that thing hard off the backboard Another stop for the Irish This thing aint over yet Serta Rebound by Bedford If they want to take 26 ft threepoint shots this thing will be over Lal through the contact and hell go to the free throw line These will be the 13th and 14th free throw attempts of the night for Toby Lewal Well you would a little bit by snapping his head back to make sure the officials knew he did take a shot on the chin How good has this kid been from the free throw line today My goodness Im losing track He got double digits on uh free throws made today 12 of 13 at the line 20 points matching his season high Yeah you can see the rule book there on those flagger ones and the officials they generally stick right to that rule book They they dont deviate too far for you would think okay hey listen this teams up by 15 music Maybe we give the Notre Dame a little bit of a break but they say no Theyre going to give two shots and Virginia Tech gets the ball on the baseline Lal now just two points away from a careerhigh Hes got 21 Thats deflected Haroldson whos playing with those four fouls just hasnt been the same offensive threat today and Mlen down low seeing some big minutes here in the second half Weve seen the Irish here in the last five minutes share the basketball with some good interior passing much better than we had seen all game long So like I said no quitting the Fighting Irish Theyre going to keep playing hard for themselves uh and for their head coach Hammond knocks down a three Its his third triple Hes got 14 Well we were talking off air about who we wanted to get for a little post game and uh Hammond says Hey dont put my hat and my name in the in the ring for a little postgame interview Whats that Three triples now for Hammond Jaden Shute commits the foul Both teams in the double bonus Yeah Shoot He can stroke it from the outside Weve seen Hammond do his damage today uh Hanssberry and Lau have had heck of a basketball games A young freshman from Greece right Hes been content to just try to get the victory He knows hes got enough post scouts here to see him score You want to show him how he leads the team and makes winning plays Got seven assists on the afternoon eight points Did a real good job of making sure everybody got off And then Hookies are going to get this victory Little backcourt pressure now of the Fighting Irish and a little over three to play Theyre looking at a big uh uphill battle to try to come back here and win this one Benford No A follow by Hanssberry Hes got 21 Just chewing glass Just the six boards to for uh Hansberry today But if he wasnt grabbing balls Lal would have been right there to grab that one So theyve been a great tag team at on the offense and defensive glass today cheering All right now Virginia Tech trying to make the case it went out of bounds on Notre Dame Mike Young wants to challenge minutes Any play involving a basket interference goalend or restricted area play challenge is not needed That is subject to official review Once youre under two minutes and you go to overtime the only play that a coach can challenge in that spot is an outof bounds play But again Mike Young has already used both challenges We get a foul on Notre Dame and Toby Lwal will be paying rent at the free throw line by games end Yeah he can get a little Sharpie and write his name on that free throw line He has marched to the free throw line so much this afternoon But how about Coach Ruseberry right He says All right we we lost the challenge but were still going to come out here and fullcourt press you see if we cant turn you over and we are going to foul immediately on catch to try to extend this game Lal 13 of 15 at the free throw line We remind you this is just game one of a quadruple header on ACC and a full day of basketball Weve got Boston music College and Syracuse coming up You got a Syracuse team thats won three straight in ACC play Donnie Freeman is back They look like they can make a move BC still searching for answers Yeah I want to see how North Carolina after a tough loss to the Cardinal can bounce back against Cal this afternoon My old teammate Scotty Pippens kid has is much improved for Cal Hes at his plus 10 and a half to his scoring average from a year ago Kind of been that kind of day Yeah its been that that kind of week I think for Coach Shrewsbury and and uh they got to get back in that lab and and one work on their their their game but also they got to get their head right Um theyre not a real confident bunch at the moment Lal picks up his fourth foul You feel for Micah Shrewsbury who we all know great coach There was one guy in the team they could not afford to lose and that was Marcus Burton And you hate to keep bringing it back to that Theyre about to be three and five since the Burton injury And they really felt that Burton had unlocked another staircase this year as a basketball player where the game was slowing down a scorer a facilitator was doing a little bit of everything for them And he was their most indispensable guy And you know talking to some of their assistant coaches now guys like Shrewsbury for example you move up a line on the opponents scouting report as we get yet another foul and Lal heads back to the line Yeah you you just lost 18 12 points per game production there right They went from scoring 766 six points with per game with Burton down to 683 without him A drop off of 83 points and you lost your playmaker You lost your extension your coaching staff on the floor Guy that got everybody involved at any level of basketball uh the point guard is important but at the college level it is the most important position on the floor All right now youre asking Jaylen Harlson to handle the ball a little more Bigger role for Logan Ims Now Lwal has now missed a few free throws in a row Makes that one 14 of 18 at the line A season high 22 points One off a careerhigh 10 rebounds to go along That drops in for Kaylor Hes got 14 the most points he scored in his freshman season Hammond to Bedford Knocked out of bounds by Ims Yeah Bedford tried to put a little extra sauce on that play there by taking it from one side of the basket underneath the rim to the other side and put a little English on it And but hes just so quick even after his misses It seems like hes quick to the basketball And thats the second time hes followed up his own shot with an offensive rebound There goes the little big man inside He throwing in lefty hooks now Thats not fair 16 for Ben Hammond Shrewberry at the other end Answers Now now were getting into a little YMCA action here after uh neither team was just kind of walking it up Now theyre just racing it down the floor and trading buckets at the rim Its impressive what Virginia Techs been able to do 51 from the field against a Notre Dame team that was holding ACC opponents to 40 shooting in four conference games Bedford adds a little punctuation Well again this is my first up close personal look at this Virginia Tech squad And after dropping a heartbreaker not even a heartbreaker a gave away a game on Wednesday You never know how a teams going to respond And I can say this Virginia Tech team is impressive the way they have responded here at 1200 on a Saturday after a tough a tough giveaway loss on the road Another three by Kaylor 17 points for him Five of six from the field Hanssbury blocked by Mlen comes back to Kaylor for three No good Its out of bounds They will stay with Notre Dame For Virginia Tech this was a game when it comes to resume was not going to help them a whole lot Notre Dame was a quad three opponent but look at what they have coming up Syracuse Louisville Duke NC State In fact five of their next six against quad one opponents Yeah thats gonna be a tough stretch to be sure But its a tough stretch Scott But those are games where if you lose doesnt hurt you If you steal a few or if you win a few that boosts your resume And this is a team again its too early for Lonardi but theyre bubble out right now They got a chance to make a move Bubble in Yeah And its never too early for Joe uh Lonardi but I got him at Groundhog Day When the Groundhog comes out thats when I bring Lonardi out and I love Joe Yeah but a game like this gives you a lot of confidence to go in against those quad one performers What a what an effort Total team dominance here by Virginia Tech Four players in double figures Hanssbury with 21 Lewal with 22 and 11 Hammond continues to turn into a star in the ACC with 16
