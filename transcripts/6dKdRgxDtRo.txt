everybody in the Dome on their feet until the orange scores its first bucket of the night Lee Cel the official at Center Court to throw up the ball and we are underway Syracuse controls the tip thanks to its 7 4 in Center nahe Applause McLoud the orange in their home white going with the old school script lettering Syracuse again for a third straight game and underway is Syracuse with a three ball Chris Bell gets the orange on the board Syracuse fans will remember Ryan Moffett Keegan records especially who have been so good the last two years when Colgate has done just that come into the Dome and knock down threepoint shots and you may notice no Benny Williams although he is going to play tonight his two games to suspension is over he warmed up he is suited and in talking to coach ay yesterday it sounded like he has an opportunity to play regular minutes here tonight but coming off the bench not in the starting lineup and defending the threepoint line thats going to be huge uh for Syracuse right now theyre in manto man but uh thats going to be key in this game uh limiting dribble drives and then getting out and defending threepoint Shooters five on the shot clock Smith separates little strong on the shot offensive rebound for the Applause Raiders B goes out of bounds Syracuse the last to touch Colgate will have it with 12 on the shot clock well what a job Matt langle has done now in his 13th year former pen Quaker and there are three more points for his C gate Raiders last season uh they LED college basketball over 40 from the threepoint line again that was top of the list for Coach Audrey when we spoke to him they must defend the threepoint line early on o getting some clean looks Justin Taylor got a clean look left it short quickly the other end the Raiders take an 83 lead Nicholas Louis thats excellent transition offense that time thrown over the top of that Syracuse D quick shot by Syracuse no balance nobody back Colgate takes advantage and throws over the top Syracuse is beating New Hampshire and Kus this year as JJ Starling gets his first two 85 Colgate but this is a much different test here tonight against the Colgate team that has been off since last Monday they played opening night managed to get by Browns 7270 and they have just been prepping and getting ready to take on Music Syracuse Keegan records the Patriot League preseason player of the year gets his own Miss and lays it in thats the second chance opportunity that time getting his own rebound and early on Colgate getting some quality looks Taylor gives it back to Applause mince dangerous pass Bell able to track it down six on the shot clock Starling penetrates tough shot and he gets the roll Doug I really believe uh Starling and Judah menz uh if those two guys get it going going they can be not only one of the better back courts in the ACC but in college basketball both of them able to beat you off the bounce and that time you saw Starling strength able to get into the lane and finish through contact Jeff Woodard the 611 senior from mton high school in Pennsylvania picked up that foul his first the first of the ball game Taylor back to minz pull down by Braden Smith the sophomore point guard out of Seattle prep brings it into the front Court coming off a 17point game hes got three man this year Colgate is undeterred knocking down threepoint shots Bell tough Baseline Drive for Music two Mett being hounded by staring got a big height Advantage at Music 67 and they go records with two on the shot clock he missed it tried to use the window Tracked Down by Woodward another three ball up and in by Ryan mofin 169 Colgate Music early on Colgate knocking down the three ball up five over the past two years Jersey Mikes fundraiser for feeding America the favorite in the Patriot league and its just remarkable they in Hamilton New York Malcolm what this man has been able to build its really been remarkable youre absolutely right hes done an outstanding job and I think the biggest thing in this day and age with nil and so forth guys transferring out hes been able to keep guys uh here and big thing he talks about his family and the academics uh certainly though uh the three ball has been huge for them and part of the success that theyve had here is theyve been able to knock down threes and early on in this game right now Doug theyre four of four from Beyond The Arc and again thats going to be a theme in this game for Syracuse can they limit the open look for Colgate from Beyond the AR then theyve got two big guys inside who can really work although going against a 7 4in defender in nem McLoud changes that a bit back at the other end three ball is good by Starling St thats excellent transition offense and thats something that uh coach ay when we talk to him they want to get out and run that time all set up by the defense and then get out and get early opportunities before that cold gate D can get set up Woodward gets the 74 defender in the air and draws the foul the senior from oton PA will head to the line to shoot two well its early but Colgate once again shows all the indications of being a team to reckon with not only in The Patriot league but outside of it thats a program record a year ago 26 wins while going 17 one in League Play they have gotten to the NCA tournament each of the last three years and uh its going to take another team in that conference to step up Malcolm and knock them off but you think its not necessarily a slam dunk that Colgate is just going to cruise to the title again this year well theyre certainly the favorite but I had a chance to watch Lehi against North Carolina I called that game Lehi on the road vers North Carolina and theyre going to be a formidable opponent for Colgate as well too uh for folks that are not familiar with the Patriot League though Colgate and weve talked about the resume that coach Lango has put together uh this is not an easy out a lot of teams I dont care what conference youre in they are a very balanced team they can shoot the three ball but they also have some bigs that can do some damage down low on the Block yeah records is 610 250 Ryan mofet is 6 72 to the bucket mince missed it Matt langle told us in our conversation yesterday that its on him to get more minutes for wooder it can be hard in college basketball now to have two bigs like this Colgate team does he has for the most part had mfet and Woodward play opposite each other chance for a threepoint play as the orange continue to show life well this guy right here one of the best guards in in college basketball Judah Mintz and thats what he does right there his ability to get into the lane and then take contact and finish thats why hes a special player speaking with Coach Lango Colgate he said look that was going to be the problem area for them he said it doesnt make a difference sometimes you can double them try to back guys off he just has that ability to get into the Lane right down the nobody stopped him its an easy two for Ryan Music Moffett Bell lets loose hes got a three eight early points for the sophomore from conquered California once again unmolested right to the buck it this time with the Throwdown it is Keegan records and thats beautiful pick and roll basketball that time slipped right down in the outside defense for Syracuse late another uncontested off the Taylor Miss Here Comes Colgate on top by four 12 and2 minutes remaining in the first Syracuse knocked it out of bounds Colgate will have it as we get our first look at quader cop another one of the sophomores hes from Southwest Philadelphia and has been a stat sheet stuffer here in the early part of the Season 7 and A2 points eight and 1 half rebounds coming off the bench hes probably the teams best passer as well Brady cumins has come into the game for Colgate number one in Maroon deep three gold Gates missed its last two from long range Starling who has been very good on the glass has to start the year misses at the other end now Syracuse changed it up that last possession went to the zone now it looks like yeah theyre back in looks like theyre playing some type of matchup but Chris Bell has had the hot hand early keeping Syracuse within four of Colgate at the dome in game three of the Adrian red ay eras head coach at his Alma Moder a McDonalds and parade AllAmerican out of Harlem had a marvelous career in Orange He was a fouryear starter still among the alltime leaders in a number of categories then a 12year run under coach beheim as an assistant and associate head coach before finally this past spring replacing his mentor to become just the eighth head coach in the history of Syracuse basketball and there is red with Jerry mcnamer right next to him and he is part of well its been a wave of younger coaches getting their opportunity replacing Hall of Famers Legends who have moved on from the ACC Rick patino was the first from Louisville and then Roy Williams Mike shashy retired and then Coach beheim joined his friends in retirement thats an awful lot of coaching talent and knowledge that the ACC has lost in recent years Malcolm yeah it really has and I think when these guys have taken over in particular you look at Hubert Davis sh and then now thr R Ary uh the timing again you look at the demands on these guys not only just to recruiting but now you throw in things like nil they went through the whole coid uh area and you I had a chance to speak with longtime uh sports information director Pete waren I asked him I said whats the biggest difference youve seen between you know coach beheim and and and and Coach red ay and he said look probably the biggest thing is the guys always on his phone now because of with the nil and and recruiting never sleeps now and with transfer portal the demands on these coaches are just so different now and I think its the times that were in right now theres so many demands on these coaches to stay on top of so many different things another transition bucket for Colgate thats Brady Cummings the sophomore from York Maine 2317 Colgate Doug early on Colgate has had a really balanced attack uh theyve ran when theyve had their opportunities and theyve thrown over the top or beaten Syracuse down the court before they can get set and then in their half court sets theyre doing some really good things out of the pick and roll theyre either getting open layups or theyre getting quality looks from Beyond the threepoint line Music Jaylen Cox a firste guard is into the game for Colgate Here Comes Syracuse trying to push the tempo again able to get the ball in the rim but unable to get the finish and this is part of the game plan for Syracuse right here push the pace obviously with Jud Min thats a strength of his get him out in transition and hes one of the best in college basketball and doing that right there pushing the pace take a look at the resume right there may Smith Bob Koozie award watch list and preseason all ACC second team but hes one of the better guards in college basketball so fun to watch and Syracuses success is going to be really riding on his shoulders how far he can take this team not only scoring but I think getting other guys involved in the offense and and he had a busy summer went to Chris Pauls CP3 camp in Los Angeles also the Nike skills academy in Portland of course that was after going through the draft process and ultimately deciding he wanted to come back to Syracuse and work on some of the things in his game that the scouts told him he needs to if he wants to be an NBA player down the road that certainly is his Focus but I thought it was interesting coach autrey told us yesterday that he didnt come back because he had to come back he came back to Syracuse because he wanted to come back yeah absolutely right I think that youre right its interesting a lot of guys come back because you know they really have to he wanted to come back and certainly its a huge news for Music Syracuse Woodward an excellent passer out of the high post he had eight assists in last years Colgate went at the dome in they go again and a foul against the orange will send Sam Thompson a senior forward from Canada to the line this is all set up a beautiful post entry pass that time great angle in there and then the helps side is late again quality offense by Colgate early on in this game and high percentage looks all around theyre going inside and outside very balanced attack early on foul on Kansas transfer Kyle cuff Jr and the big round of applause is because Benny Williams is making his season debut for the Applause orange because of a violation of Team rules Williams missed the first two games by a team suspension but again in talking with Coach ay yesterday he indicated that he thinks Bennys going to be able to step right in didnt miss that much time and could play his normal role he did start the one exhibition he played against Damon college but coming off the bench here tonight and here is Williams thinking about it puts up his first shot of the year its no Music good out of bounds an unforced error by Chandler Baker a senior guard from Woodstock Music Georgia Judah minz has had no trouble the first first two games of the year getting himself to the free throw line 10 times on average each game coming in 17 out of 20 he is one of two so far tonight and he spent awful lot of time this summer working on his shot mainly the threepoint shot but he went back to Gonzaga Catholic High School in Washington DC where he had played and uh just spent time with his childhood friend Devin dinkin who is a sophomore George Mason and they just shot countless threes to work on their form one thing coach autrey said to Mintz dont look to create a three this year take the easy ones that come to you youll have better shot selection and invariably your percentage will go up and even though he only shot about 30 last year he did improve as the season went on and the expectation is that he will shoot even better than that this year and I think thats a great point the a lot of times guys come back and think okay I got to force things to show people that I can do uh something but again his strength is always going to be his ability to get into the paint but when you get your opportunities and I think thats what coach ay has talked to him about thats when you want to let him go Copeland with a pretty shot first field goal for the orange in over four minutes and they draw to within two of Colgate Applause with the shot clock at one some more good defense by Syracuse and now the orange can tie or take the lead Copeland tries his second three Off the Mark again Colgate started the game eight of 13 from the floor but now only one of seven since allowing Syracuse back to within two tox no another offensive rebound carving out space inside is Sam Thompson for two more and thats been a problem area for Syracuse Second Chance point thats 10c chance points for Colgate in this first half zero for Syracuse right now Colgate doing a great job on the offensive glass creating extra opportunities Copeland cut off along the Baseline brings it back out Starling it goes to the corner CN offensive rebound for Syracuse quader copelan lays it Music in well he did not get regular minutes as a freshman was not of the rotation for coach beheim for the most part last year but I dont think theres any way coach ay can keep Copeland off the floor with regular minutes this year he has developed his game and does a little bit of everything Baker makes the shot Colgate gets three more Cox feeds into the front Court spotting up for three and there is once again quader Copeland averaging eight and 1 half rebounds per game grabbing another Music Miss Williamss pass gets deflected Starling able to save it still time on the shot clock Starling lost it Colgate with numbers Ryan Moffett is more than just a spot up shooter at 67220 the fifth year shows great body control and thats a tough finish that time youre right body control was excellent able to finish that was not an easy two he made it look pretty easy through ATT Off the Mark again M with a good look Kate looking to build its sevenpoint lead wide open Jaylen for three three more timeout called as the lead is stretched to Music 10 its an 80 run for Colgate after Syracuse had drawn to within two Ryan mofet third Team all Patriot League a year ago leading the way for the Raiders time that its not just on him its on all the rest of us and and he and the others have really been supporting autri and and Adrian yesterday talked about DC and Billy Owens and Dennis Duval Jim Lee Howard Trish John Wallace and Lawrence mton were at the opening game to show their support and and I thought that was a good way as a program to look at it that when a legend retires you cant just replace him with one man its got to be everybody in the Syracuse family trying to help move this thing forward malcol key word family and it is uh heres theres no faking about that whatsoever uh these guys really love each other it is a family uh situation and nobody happier but to see this than the Hall of Fame coach Jim beheim this is what he has created and its going to continue on with Coach red arrey Syracuse has missed 13 of its last 15 shots 420 remaining here in the half Colgate has won the last two in this longstanding series dating back to the early 1900s and they are looking to make it three in a row more three balls this one from Keegan records Doug theyre putting on the clinic right now I mean offensive execution to Perfection they are breaking down Syracuse and they are getting wide open looks right now they are close to 60 from the threepoint line 58 to be exact s to 12 and theyve all been pretty much wide open looks off of great dribble drives offensive foul against Bell and thatll take us to break but the fifth year Keegan Records who has been Central to all of what Colgate has done in recent years looking to lead another Colgate win over Syracuse here Applause tonight AMA Wireless dome in this rivalry that dates back to 19012 this is the 175th meeting between these two Central New York Rivals and for the better part of 60 years from the early 60s until a couple of years ago it was all orange but Colgate has won the last two and looking like they are ready to make it three in a row here tonight on top by 13 the big problem right now for Syracuse uh stopping dribble penetration and then defending pick and rolls right now of The Bigs are not hedging and stopping the ball and then Co is just breaking them down and theyre getting wide open looks after wide open looks thats got to change they have to adjust I think the bigs either have to come out and heads either trap or at least slow the ball down and then the back end of that the rotations have to be better for Music Syracuse the orang has been playing catch up throughout they did manage to get it down to two but Colgate has rattled off the last 11 straight points good ball movement from the high post mfet steps through lays it off the window for two more Doug that time uh Syracuse went to the Zone Colgate again very patient broke it down got the ball right to the F line area kick it out to the wing and then they have a oneonone situation take advantage of it but they are just picking apart this defense right now Syracuse Taylor trying to back his way down draws a second Defender shot clock at three lets go lets go able to get the runner and that snaps the Colgate Music run smth gets into the paint finds an open teammate who then rids himself the defender but Sam Thompson called for the traveling violation Doug that was a better defensive possession for Syracuse still though again they need to be wary of the dribble drives that is really whats hurt them early on in this game they must contain the dribble drives of Colgate looked like Malik Brown had a chance at a layup instead it comes out to a three thats missed by Bell under two minutes to go in the half Smith wide open three is good and dug that set up by a gamble that time judment gambles tries to go out or excuse me try to gamble and get the Steal dont contain the dribble drive and then give up a open three on the other end right now Syracuse shooting early into shot clock and theyre just really out of rhythm right now on both ends and then after missing the three mince commits the foul in the back court and itll be a non shooting foul Doug it looks like theyre going to look to see if this was an intentional yeah I think listen thats really not a play on the ball really not sure why Jud the men would do that now again flagrant I dont think its flagrant I think though definitely not a play on the ball now the unnecessary part definitely uh definitely not a legitimate play on the ball again hes by him and hes grabbing him on his shoulder and it definitely is a hold from behind so again uh although I dont think it was ex it wasnt something that I think where he was trying to hurt the guy but certainly if you read it by the rule uh theyre going to probably assess him a flagrant one and indeed it is a flagrant one we will have two free throws for colate well I just read that as frustration first of all Judah took one of those threepoint shots that we just talked about a few minutes ago that coach ay doesnt want him to take forcing it with a defender on him and then he commits the flagrant foul coming back up the floor and thats the area coach ay really when we asked him about Judah men he said look thats the area that we want to see him continue to grow in and I think thats the leadership piece right there not a good play at all again the previous play the gamble the give up the three and then youre right a frustration foul right there things arent going your way but certainly that is not a good way to try to close out this half where youre really struggling brayen Smith only gets one out of two as Jud Min takes a seat on the Syracuse bench those faces with McLoud and Williams flanking him tell the story as Colgate leads by 17 late in the first Music half air ball once again a Colgate offensive rebound for two records is all over the place 12 Second Chance points in counting in the first half for Colgate again when Syracuse does get stops theyve been unable to defensive rebound that is another problem Music area Colgate will keep that young man 610 250 from South kingt Rhode Island had zero division one scholarship offers coming out of high school he went to prep school St Andrews prep then wound up getting a Colgate offer tell you what he went into the transfer portal this past spring and he had 50 offers including some from the ACC in the Big East conference after looking around for a couple of weeks he decided you know what I dont want to mess with happy Im going back to use my final year of eligibility back where Im comfortable and where I know we can win at Colgate Justin Taylor for three Sunday catch a womens college basketball double header on acc Network up first number 25 Oklahoma visits Virginia at two Eastern followed by Bucknell taking on 19th ranked Louisville at 4 Eastern both games are also available on the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere with Malcolm hakabe Im Doug Sherman from the JMA Dome Syracuse down by 16 and its not just been the defense the offense has been an issue for Syracuse as well settling for a lot of contested threes and they just have had no rhythm on that end of the floor Malcolm for several minutes no they really havent and credit Colgate and again speaking with the coaching staff of Syracuse yes col Gates offense is really good but they were concerned about their defense as well too theyve done a good job keeping Syracuse out of the paint in particular in transition and then they forced them in to a lot of contested shots a lot of work cut out a lot of work to do for this Syracuse team to get back into this game but I certainly these last 20 seconds are going to be huge to see if they can get any momentum going into the half shot clock is off as the sophomore point guard from Seattle Braden Smith works it down under 10 seconds fires it up I have a feeling he lost track of the time Syracuse can get a shot off here Starling with the half court Music he ready for the start of the second half between Colgate and Syracuse the orange down by 16 and Malcolm hakabe what was the message in that locker room for first year head coach Adrien Autry for his team well I I know red aery he is not happy with that performance and I think defensively a lot of this is just uh taking a you taking it personally uh your defensive assignment a lot of these dribble drives were not off of screens they were just getting broken down off the bounce that cannot happen and then communication the communication has to be better right now The Bigs theyre not really hedging theyre flattening out and theyre giving open looks up and then offensively you have to be patient and red talked about this yesterday when we spoke to him they have to be patient on offense he was concerned about this Colgate defense but right now theyre shooting early in the shot clock and not getting anything in the paint theyre settling for a lot of jumpers I think those two areas have to change in the second half cut down on the dribble drives and open looks for Colgate and then be more patient on offense Colgate outrebounded Syracuse 252 in that first half and clamped down in the orange to make them Miss 15 of their last 19 shots We Begin the second half as Colgate looks to beat Syracuse for the third time in a row brayen Smith the sophomore point guard goes to the left hand tough to get it up and over Applause McLoud and thats a quick look right there if youre Syracuse and staring you want to try to drive the ball dont settle for a three that time quick in transition and then on the other end you see what colgates doing again patient and then theyre getting high percentage look that was Woodwards first made bucket of the night stretches the lead to 18 one minute in here in the second Bell Taylor mints around the perimeter with Starling the cloud inside Taylor catches just the front rim one and done for the orange for Colgate its Smith Lou jacqu records Moffett and Woodward same starting five in the second records the Patriot League preseason Player of the Year with the turnaround hes into double figures well theyre just spreading Syracuse out and then theyre just going at the matchup they want and help not there another high percentage shot for goit hell no good defense by records to stay with him and keep the hand in his face Music ball goes out of bounds and itll go the other way individually for Coach ay Bell leads the way with 10 points Starling seven mince with six and the crowd still on its feet waiting for Syracuse to score its first field goal of of the half heres Bell again this time from the corner and McLoud with a foul on the rebound Jeff Woodward is a fine young man by all accounts just marvelous Stories We heard from coach langle talking about the senior from aabon PA get into that some of the things that he does to help the community when hes not working on his game but Taylor misses McLoud kept it alive Holgate though comes up with the basketball its Jeff Woodward thats not a bad look that time by Taylor wide open three off of a kickout just unable to knock it down Syracuse gets the ball back mince turns it over to Colgate numbers for the Applause Raiders another offensive putback balloons the lead to Applause 22 14 Second Chance points of for Colgate the boo birds are out in the dome as Colgate pulls away from Syracuse early in the second half Music is a veteran player and you look at the career that he has put together at Colgate really remarkable that this guy had no scholarship offers coming out of high school first team All Conference last year preseason Patriot League Player of the Year and Defensive Player of the Year this Music season contested three comes up short for the Music orange Music Woodward much bigger than Taylor rids himself the defender gets McLoud in the air and scores hes another one you could describe as working at his own pace Malcolm yeah and theyre just isolating matchups right now they have Taylor out there really hes a guard and they got him matching up against the post player and theyre just going at that matchup they havent spaced out and theyre just attacking him defensively again making it really difficult for Syracuse to get anything going this right here great help defense and then the recovery in Block was Lou Jac young man from South Florida patient descent with that rejection go good attack and the follow mcclouds got the layout first two points for the junior center from Philadelphia who transferred into into Syracuse from Florida State somethings going to have to change and it starts right here Syracuse defense well Judah men could do Applause that he led the ACC a year ago with 18 steals per Music game Music six to shoot here goes Smith using the screen to the Elbow his pass goes off the hand of Moffett and out of bounds itll be Syracuse basketball when we come back to the Dome as Jud Min tries to Rally the orange from a 20 plus Point deficit Dome Colgate 54 Syracuse 34 the orange came into this game having won consecutive games to start the year New Hampshire last Monday was the first victim 8372 then they uh beat kishis 8977 last season this is what the orange did missing the NCA tournament for a second straight year and its not been since the late 60s and early 70s since Syracuse missed three consecutive NCAA tournaments and certainly they have not looked like a tournament team so far here tonight Malcolm in game number three of the red ay era no they really havent I think on both ends they are struggling I think the glaring thing for me yes you knew Colgate was a very good offensive team you know theyre going to shoot the three they have some guys including this guy with the ball right here that can create matchup problems but to me the story really has been the rebounding deficit Colgate has dominated the glassis Chris Bell with three more he leads the orang in offense with 13 points a little over 14 minutes to go but right now theyre going to have to string together multiple stops obviously defensively and then continue to try to get highquality looks like this right here nine unanswered points for the orange as mince gets right to the basket met at the rim by Bell who picks up the foul but Jeff Woodward will head to the free throw line for two and this is a breakdown in communication right here again on the screen oh thats on Jud men right there hes got to be communicating with his big let him know either you got to help or slide under give him room but again a breakdown in the communication on the defensive side that time leading to another Colgate player driving down the lane mentioned earlier Jeff Woodward spends six weeks each summer working a camp for special needs children young man at the line is especially bright a considerate man he plans to become a clinical psychologist has also been chosen as one of 13 student Representatives by the Universitys Administration not only that hes pretty good basketball player and helping his Raiders to a 16point lead but the orange making a push trying to make a game of it there is Woodward with the block shot someones lost a shoe Alik Brown retrieves it tries to get back defend defensively well thats a nice looking drive by Braden Smith the sixfoot point guard off the fake laying it off the window 5739 the score and hes played a great floor game for Colgate last year had a great freshman campaign all freshman in The Patriot league as you take a look at another three but he has really been the key for Colgate in this game he has ran the point guard position great got these guys in position controlled the pace and been able to get into the paint and either score for himself or set his teammates up H meanwhile with 16 points one shy of his career high which came last season against Notre Dame traveling Applause violation the defender pulled the chair out from underneath him exactly right here great yeah and thats again thats a pretty good play giving up a lot of size to Woodward absolutely right pulled the chair out was able to come up with the turnover and the Syracuse right now on a run 1236 and certainly would like to try to get this thing to within single digits Benny Williams has come back into the game number 13 in white for Syracuse played only 5 minutes off the bench and his return from suspension orange continue to try and Whittle away at what was once a 24o deficit its now a 143 run and Chris Bell young man out of D Lael High School in Northern California has a new career high with 18 points and I like this change up by K thre ay they have picked up the pressure and their energy has picked up thats something that has been lacking in this game Doug see seemed like they were not playing with a sense of urgency that has changed in this run right here Moffett double team down the post bring it back out with 12 on the shot clock Smith rejects the screen puts it off the window no and a foul is called against Syracuse thatll take us to our next media timeout but red Autreys team getting back into this thing but still still down 13 to Colgate with plenty of time on the clock against this Colgate team that really quite frankly Doug has had their way with them throughout this game but not in this last stretch this last 5 minute stretch Syracuse has picked up their energy and and now theyre trying to make a game of this 12 minutes to go still some work to do but uh certainly uh the energy level coach red ay has to be pleased with with that change in this last 5minute stretch and so Malcolm with that energy change is it a coincidence that Colgate is 0 for three in threepoint shooting in the second half absolutely and I think a lot of it has to do with again uh theyve cut down on some of the dribble drives and just taking it personally again the guys were getting beat too easy in that first half and really to start off the second half that has changed now in this last stretch and theyre going to need more of it Braden Smith only one out of two from the line the lead is 14 Colgate 58 Syracuse 44 Under 12 minutes to go in regulation here goes Bell who hands it off to Benny Williams Copeland to Starling Bell off the bounce and he was fouled hell head to the line to shoot a pair after the personal called against Brady cumins the sophomore from York Maine who attended the Brooks School in Massachusetts before moving on to Colgate University and Doug if you as you look at the numbers in this game and we talked about it in between breaks the rebounding discrepancy again yes the threepoint shooting numbers are there for Colgate but 14 Second Chance points to four for Syracuse really to me that has been a big storyline in this game their ability to get Second Chance opportunities off the offensive glass Colgate big reason why they have the lead on the road Bell extends his career high with now 19 points and the orange offense still is not firing shooting 37 from the floor only six of 24 from Beyond The Arc and theyve gotten only four bench points so far all from pader Copeland heres that fullcourtpr causing Colgate some trouble Raiders able to get it across the time Music line Smith off the side of the Applause Music iron m to the corner Bell for three give him three more 22 points for Chris Bell and Syracuse is back to within Music 10 knocked out of bounds Colgate will retain it and this is a beautiful play by judeman breakdown by Colgate thats the one guy you cannot leave alone and the Dome loving the energy from this team right now trying to cut this thing to single digits Applause Sam Thompson went down and Syracuse comes up with a basketball a chance to get it back to single digits M picked up the dribble finds Williams Starling has his pass deflected out of bounds Syracuse will keep underneath with 11 on the shot clock another change uh end this stretch Syracuse has been much more patient offensively early on in this game shots were taken early in the shot clock not much ball movement theyve been much more patient on the offensive end as well Kyle cuff is return to the game number zero for Syracuse mince gets it back with three on the shot clock Music Applause Thompson hands it off to Smith bounce pass to the Big Man Records who hands it off Moffett down the lane had it blocked Cox saves it and the whistle comes weve got a foul early on Colgate a lot of uncontested shots that time good team defense by Syracuse and then they were able to rebound and again thats an area theyve struggled in this game not in this last stretch though theyve defended and then they finished the play off and secured the ball with the defensive rebound last time Syracuse was within single digits of Colgate it was 3225 Williams has yet to score tonight in his return game to the lineup gives a it off and the driving bucket is good by JJ Starling its an eightpoint game the pride of nearby Baldwinsville New York now with nine points the fans inside the Dome are starting to believe I wish for the amazing new iPhone 15 pro se you mean this one the one with titanium no way I could trade this busted up thing for one maybe stealing wishes from the birthday boy its not your best plan switch to Verizon and trade in any iPhone and get the new iPhone 15 Pro on them what yep and on an amazing Network and I dont have to ruin any more birthday parties yeah that ship is sailed lets go get you that iPhone here we go come on now trade in any iPhone in any condition for a new iPhone 15 Pro on us only on Music Verizon back in the dome as as Syracuse is pulled to within eight with 9 and 12 minutes remaining as the ball movement was good here Malcolm then thats been a difference in their last possessions the ball has swung left to right and then the key thing Doug dont settle for a jumper Colgate is trying to force them to shoot contested jumpers theyre swinging the ball around theyre getting everybody involved in the offense better movement and the end result a high percentage shot in the lane that pass was kicked by Malik Brown Colgate will keep it his full court pressure for Syracuse has helped to spark the energy in the building its now a 204 Syracuse run Smith is fouled but here Copeland and the fans dont believe it well its a heads up play by Colgate again Syracuse face guarding nobody back playing safety and yeah there a lot of contact on that yeah theres definitely contact now the fans do not like that call but certainly there was a lot of contact but I still again uh agree with your point Doug the fullcourt pressure really has been the change uh in this run for Syracuse its created some problems for Colgate and really has led to some good opportunities on the other end for Syracuse offensively well in this matchup of Premier sophomore point guards Bren Smith has done very well for himself and again hes taking on a bigger role in this back court for Colgate after the graduation of Tucker Richardson and Oliver Lynch Daniels and he has been undeterred filling a bigger spot for colan he was a high school quarterback take a look at the threepoint shooting right here for Colgate the difference the pressure defensively they put put up resistance Syracuse and that is a big change in numbers credit to Syracuse defense B around and out Syracuse catches a break as a couple of Raiders fought for the rebound and so the orange will keep it with 20 on the shot clock Benny Williams Music cing attacks heres Williams from the corner now lets see how Syracuse defends these ball screens that was problematic early in the game much better job that time by Jud imens keeping Smith out of the paint off the high ball screen that time Smith got around him the help defense came and that left his teammate wide open for the easy two inside Colgate back up by a dozen and you can see why the coaching staff of Colgate so high on Braden Smith thats a beautiful pass Ken Cox turns it back over to Syracuse minz finds a cutting teammate the reverse layup is good for Malik Brown down to 8 minutes on the clock Smith mop it for three and out of bounds to Syracuse staff parents and fans 400 pm Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN with Malcolm Huckaby Im Doug Sherman its been a career night offensively for that man Chris Bell 22 points and Counting hes been about the only consistent offensive threat for Su so far tonight you see five of 10 from Beyond The Arc Colgate trying to keep the orange at armed length great Drive In Reverse by Judah minz its back to an eightpoint game and thats where hes at his best early on I felt like he was shooting too many jumpers uh thats where he can do the most damage attacking the rim and then on the other end using his athleticism and speed to create Havoc with defense Syracuse now has got this thing back to single digits Doug 733 to go and question mark is uh can they string stops together and then keep Colgate off the offense defensive glass Malik Brown back out nahem McLoud the 74 Center back in he defends the Music paint Cox a runner from the foul line as an airball he gets it back this time gets the roll its back to a 10o Colgate lead and thats exactly the problem again getting stops is one thing but then can you secure the defensive Applause blast been a quiet night for Justin Taylor whos been so consistent all year so far as she turns it over back to Colgate Ive been impressed as you expect though look at the spacing that Colgate has on on offense on the dribble handoff weve got a foul its on Jeff Woodward with the moving screen Taylor and Mintz bring it up McLoud with the basketball now give it to Starling Bell camps out in the right corner sitting on his careerhigh 22 points in the paint tough shot and a chance for three for Applause minz beautiful jump stop jumper Judah men right here in the paint through contact and one thats a big bucket of for Syracuse a 24point lead has been cut to seven how will Colgate Applause respond pressure hand Hand by Braden Smith whos been so good tonight a careerhigh nine rebounds near a double double six assists as well here he goes thought about it now puts it up from 15 hes got it he has played so well under control at the steering wheel for Colgate tonight stat line one of the best out here Applause tonight thats a break for Syracuse one of the few mistakes Smith has made but otherwise he has played a clean floor game 14 points six assists but the D Doug thats really been impressive hes got nine rebounds in this game hes done a little bit of everything for Colgate hey you mentioned the fact that he was a high school quarterback at Seattle prep and Coach langle really feels like those skills are trading this year as he becomes one of the leaders in the back court again gone our Oliver Lyn Daniels and last years Patriot League Player of the Year and defensive player of the year Tucker Richardson they were both guards and so its Smiths show and here tonight he has looked very very Applause good Judah minz at the line crucial stretch right here for Syracuse every time theyve tried to get this thing below seven Colgate has had an answer theres a takeaway by the orange Taylor picks up the dribble now mince attacks back out to Bell he fires a three Off the Mark no good Jaylen Cox with a rebound The Freshman getting an extended run here in the second half and he turns it over Mintz again on the takeaway Coast to Coast its a fivepoint Applause game this 504 remaining in Jud helping to spearhead the comeback for the orange doing it again Malcolm with his defense and the one thing Colgate did not do early on in this game turn it over that plays right in the hands of Syracuse judment again a great anticipation and right here he is so good in the open court thats his strength able to knife through the defense and finish at The Rim we got a fivepoint game and again the pressure giving Colgate trouble Taylor goes for the steal Syracuse basketball and a foul the storyline in this game in the second half the Syracuse pressure has been key to getting back into this one Colgate has not had an answer in this last stretch they got to do a better job obviously if youre Colgate you do not want to catch the ball in the dead corner that way and then you need to try to run somebody long again like they did on a previous possession uh but you certainly cannot catch the ball in the corner if youre P Music gate mince now eight of 10 from the line tonight he makes it a fourpoint Applause game poked away Brown was the last to touch Cole will keep with under 5 minutes to Applause go red ay trying to orchestrate a come from behind win from a 24point deficit Smith lost it another takeaway for the orange Copeland back outside they find the open man Bell no off the back iron Smiths got the basketball for Colgate you cant ask for a better better look if youre coach red ay off a turnover how about the understanding how to play the game by Braden Smith to find records underneath and thats just great Movement by records and youre right recognition by Smith Syracuse very aggressive theres Smith picking the pocket of Taylor on his way up Syracuse will keep possession forget about the double double Braden Smith might get himself a triple double tonight he really has been the really the best player out on the court well at times in this game you look at what he has put up 14 points 10 rebounds seven assist just a complete game for Colgate vce came into the game averaging 23 points hes got 20 heres Starling on the drive a round and out everything but the Finish Keegan records came over to contest and you see there Colgate has turned it over five times in less than the last two Applause minutes Woodward taking his time and the whistle comes before the shot can Syracuse complete the comeback can Colgate hang on for a third straight win over the orange in the Music Applause Music Applause Music dome after making eight threepointers in the first half Co gate has been shut out so far by an energized Syracuse defense in the second half that has forced 12 turnovers since the intermission Colgate or Malcolm rather it has been quite a change since we came out of the break well we discussed it coming out of the break you asked what was the issue in the first half and I felt their energy Syracuses energy they didnt play with a sense of urgency in that first half there were breakdowns off the drive I think the change up by coach red ay to go fullcourt pressure and then theyve not settled for jumpers theyve attacked the basket and been opportunistic when theyve had their opportunities in Music transition the last time Syracuse rallied from a 20o plus deficit was in 2021 at the Dome against Notre Dame they were down 24 to Colgate now making it a ball game but a great offensive set leads to an open jump shot by Louis Jac coming out of the Music Applause timeout thats a great response by Syracuse off the dribble drive but on that previous possession Doug uh Syracuse went to the Zone Colgate patient again and youre right another high percentage shot but thats a great response by Applause Syracuse seven of the shot clock and a foul out beyond the threepoint line against JJ Music Starling that is the sixth on Syracuse the next one will put Colgate in the bonus Smith no Syracuse with the basketball Starling quickly into the front Court to mince they find Bell in Rhythm no Starling no on second effort hes got Applause it Syracuse back to within Applause three and that is not there you see the reason stoppage yeah at all for a good portion of this game Braden Smith has been the best player on the court really I hope hes okay to get back on the court but certainly not a good news and not a good look for Colgate right now in this stretch of the game lets see what happened just looks like he came down awkward and certainly with him out of the game the pressure becomes a issue for Colgate immediately turned the ball over without their point guard they give it back to the orange who now have a chance to tie Applause it mince comes and gets the basketball gives it back to Starlin Miss off the shot face Drive strong cant get the roll Colgate has it 212 to go in regulation two quality looks of for Syracuse Woodward is fouled near midcourt and although you like the aggression Doug in that situation you have to understand uh that theyre one fou away from Bonus you do not want to do that that bails them out again you like the aggression but thats not a good foul to put Colgate on the line Applause the foul on Brown was the seventh on Syracuse so its a one and one for Jeff Woodward missed the front end and again the orange with a chance to tie Taylor minson Bell out there with Starling and Applause brown darling into traffic Goes Down fight for the basketball in the paint and its tied up the possession arrow belongs to Applause Music Syracuse nine on the shot clock lets see what Syracuse elects to do here nine on the shot clock plenty of time got to imagine dents get the ball back in his hands now Bell just fires away for the tie deadlocked at 70 a piece with just over 90 seconds to Applause go records back outside the three missed by Mett Syracuse is Led just once at 3 nothing Starling attacks and hell go to the line with a chance to give Syracuse the Applause lead Doug when we started this second half and it looked like Colgate was going to run away with this thing going up 20 if youre coach red autrian staff you have have to be pleased with how your team has responded they could have easily folded this thing up qued their way back in and it all began with their defense Smith appears to have a limp as he comes back in but they need his steady hand holding on to the basketball if now theyre going to come back to win this game Colgate trying to win in Syracuse for the third consecutive year they led by as many as 24 but Syracuse has come all the way Applause back Woodard picks up the dribble 15 on the shot clock moffets in trouble out of bounds Colgate will keep with nine to shoot Doug the biggest difference ball screen defense early on the bigs were not hedging of Syracuse they are hedging and showing hard and they are locked in as a unit uh they are making it very difficult for Colgate to run their offense theyre going to go and review that call in a game that Colgate has led for 36 minutes and 40 seconds Syracuse trying to steal Music one and I like this make sure you get the call right now from that angle tough to tell even that one still tough to tell were blocked now that Referee on the and at the hash mark has the best angle in pretty good position so he would have had the best angle to see that well the call on the court was that it was Colgate ball and that has been uphill and so again with nine on the shot clock if youre Colgate here Malcolm where do you go well you do what has been uh your goto and that is uh Braden Smith put the ball in his hands I think the key thing now you have to be careful of 9 seconds left Syracuse has been really aggressive on the ball screens if Im Syracuse Im blitzing hard do not let Braden Smith come off clean and if your judment also try to deny him dont even let him get the ball the steel on the inbound and the dunk Malik Brown makes it a fourpoint orange lead Louis jacqu missed it Syracuse has it and the orange can taste it with 319 to play remarkable unbelievable the turnaround in this second half contested Applause shot and so the sophomore from col pepper Virginia Malik Brown gives Syracuse a fivepoint Music Applause lead Syracuses defense has clamped down on Colgate the Raiders who made eight threes in the first half have not hit a single threepoint shot in the second half and the orange trying to put it away from the free throw Applause line Lou Jac on Q cuts the lead in half with a triple 7673 Matt langle says Nicholas Louis is as hard a worker as Ive been around coming off the bench the last couple of years a starter this season and he hits a huge three to make it 7673 and thats great execution right there in the game situation understanding time that time quality three off of an excellent execution in their Applause offense well we go back early in the second half to the judment steel and slam that has helped to spark a 46 to 19 orange run well he took it personally again uh Braden Smith was outplaying him in this game and then he took it upon himself on the defensive end to pick up his energy and then this is what he got back to end the first half settling forth contested jumpers hes at his best when hes attacking the glass and out in transition and that was huge for Syracuse to get back on Music top after a quiet first half mince has come alive in the second 20 points 8 assists three rebound and that energy has been evident since the intermission so now Colgate will pressure with the shot clock off Taylor runs the inbound mince draws a crowd Starling in trouble and Syracuse will use its final timeout neither team now has a timeout for the rest of the second half well for s the schedule gets a lot harder going forward next week they will head to Hawaii for the Maui Invitational that of course has been moved to aahu and will take on the seventh ranked Tennessee Volunteers on the 20th and then theyll face either for Gonzaga and its as good a field as youll ever have and for this Syracuse team theyll feel a lot better going to the islands 3 and0 Malcolm than 2 and one and I tell you what Colgate is a team again weve talked about the success that coach Matt langle has had at Colgate a tournament team over the last three years and they are going to be a tough out so this is a really if Syracuse is able to hold on uh talk about character building wins uh nobody including me and you Doug I think felt like Syracuse had any chance of getting back into this game and this would be a huge momentum Builder and confidence Builder not only for these players but I think uh coach red ay and his staff I think hes learned a lot about this team uh in this game no timeouts remaining for either team Taylor has to get it Music in mince is fouled in the back court fou 14 Colgate was trying to get the ball out of Judah mens hands they wanted to get somebody else on the free throw line they did that on the previous possession as well too and then they realized they werent going to be able to get it out of his hand so then they had the foul but and to come down to Judah menz being able to knock down free throws to ice this game hes 26 for 31 already this year from the line calmly making it a twopossession Music game he and Bell have been the offensive catalysts in the second half bell with a careerhigh 25 points mince with 21 and Applause cting 10 seconds to go ball in the hands of Smith Goes to the basket a three ball from the corner by Moffett is no good the tip is good with two and a half to go records keeps Colgate alive its a threepoint game Taylors got to get it in he does and mince is fouled with 15 Music remaining Doug one things for sure with this Syracuse team well their strength definitely will be their ability to come out with energy and try to create turnovers and that to me really was the story of this game in the second half for Syracuse their energy and then their ability to get out and pressure Colgate and create some offensive opportunities off their defense thatll do it Colgate will not beat Syracuse for a third time in a row the orange erase a 24o deficit and
