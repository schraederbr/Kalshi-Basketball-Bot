Meanwhile Georgia Tech they snap their threegame losing streak trying to win backtoback games after that win over Monmouth And Moila controls the opening tap over Jason Scoffield And away we go The holiday break has begun And so is Holiday Hoops Moila guarded by Scoffield Now Kesi Reeves backtoback 23point outings His first shot does not drop And for Meis they have made one change to their starting lineup Jason Scoffield has been inserted replacing Harvey Kabamba Its the first time Maris has changed their lineup since opening night After the turnover Amar Washington brings up the floor He was the lone change in Georgia Techs lineup last time against Monouth and theyll run back the same five here tonight Washington making his first start of the season Mai Fleming crossing over goes up has it stripped cheering Quick hands by Dore digging in from the perimeter defensively Georgia Tech in that win over Monmouth They shot 48 from the field 40 from three and had their best free throw shooting performance of the year 81 to continue that hot shooting 5 seconds Craft cuts it loose and buries Well nice ball movement by the Jackets They find Craft wide open in the corner High release Quick release on that one WY He got it up Lard crosscourt pass Lewis denied by Craft and Dory swirls home a triple Dorri is a veteran guy Over 100 plus games started in the Red Fox jersey So uh hes he can definitely step up Got a lot of minutes under his belt And Washington gets the roll in midrange Thats where he did his damage against Monro his ability to work off the ball screens and dribble handoffs and get into the paint Jaden Collins Roberts Maris captain got the point Lewis hits Lewis leading Maris this year in minutes played Hes got a smooth stroke Preseason all metro Atlantic Mai Fleming is fouled He will have two free throws Lewis as you mentioned the preseason second team all conference selection by the coaches Hes shooting the ball at 53 from the field on the season So from the guard position thats extremely efficient Theres coach starter in his third season as head coach previously with the Boston Celtics And you know he had 10 days off while he had a lot of time to watch film get after it get some guys some shots individual work and more importantly theyre trying to get healthy Georgia Tech is without by Dongo and Jaden Mustaf tonight by out with mean maintenance Jaden Mustaf also with some maintenance and again whether its load management trying to stay healthy Its a long season but they think in the best interest of the team this year its better they did not play tonight get them fully healthy Thats not insignificant You know Jaden with nine starts on the season and by has started all eight games he played in So essentially Tech without two starters Lenard tough shot And theres Lamar Washington on the glass again Hes been a phenomenal guard rebounder Yeah five rebounds per game uh to go with his four assist average as well Hes a balanced player on the offensive side Reeves the senior leading scorer for the Jackets Hes really stepped up his game wy this season averaging just shy of 15 points per game Yeah 23 points each of his last two He had just two career 20 point games in his four years in school before this year Its Manard feeds back to Scoffield Wing three of Lewis Its short and CE with the rebound Did he step on the line Yes he did Painted the baseline with the back of the heel Seal is a guy thats leading rebounder for the the Yellow Jackets Just shy of nine rebounds per game Almost averages a double double as a true freshman Hes been impressive Hes got five double doubles this year and top 10 in the ACC in rebounding into Manard Hell let it fly And thatll stay with Marish You know we talked to coach John Dunn You see in his eighth season now at Merist coming off a 20 win season most games theyve won in his eight years But you know he mentioned with Menard that he just wants to score Thats thats been his goal put up 27 points last time out Dangerous pass Rajan Blackwell gets it over to Menard who drains a three And unfortunately for the Jackets a broken play Reeves Reeves almost had the steal on that And Maris catches a break Makes the Jackets pay for the gamble And Washington comes up empty on the other end Kick out Manard He got it again and Justin Manard with six quick points as opposed to the last one That was assignment defense A breakdown by the Jackets The first one you can live with as a coach Coach Dtomire knows that second one weve got to be there on the catch for that shooter And Mo there to flush it down and tie it up That lob entry is going to be a critical part of the game for Georgia Tech offensively not just tonight but throughout the year Yeah just points in the paint tonight Emphasis on that playing inside out offensively really hammer the ball into the paint whether off the bounce or post play like that Quality look but Tariq Watson cant finish it Both teams shooting the ball well over 50 in the first four plus minutes as Aai Fleming reversed He had a tough night against Manmouth John went 0 for nine from the field but you know coach Datamire committed hey played good defense got after it on the glass was still a positive contributor Im high on Fleming Hes got a big ceiling high ceiling as a player Can score the ball inside and out Hes one of the few guys on the Jackets roster you can go ISO late clock and he can make a play Little bit of trouble Dory with the handles and he draws the foul Well have a break in the action Georgia Tech in Meris five of eight and all five starters with a bucket for the Yellow Jackets as Payton Marshall and Chaz Kelly have checked in and Manard gets it into the corner Too strong from Roberts Offensive rebound for Watson and hell be fouled from behind So Watson will go to the free throw line Hes just three of four on the strike this season Averages about 11 minutes per game coming in this one His names Tank Looks like a tank right there Battling inside cheering A rare miss for Meris Theyre also top 10 nationally in free throw percentage shooting 79 cheering And they were 20 of 21 in the win at Bryant on Saturday So Watson hits one of two One thing Lamar Washington has brought to Georgia Tech here as of late its not just the scoring John but its the way hes taking care of the basketball Averaging over six assists per game over his last five He was a leading assist guy in the West Coast Conference for Pacific And of course you know you know he cheated him up nice WY He just threw a a turnover on a penetrating pass into the paint Bad angle Well a quick one and done for Merit on the offensive end He does have three assists in this game And in transition is Dory up and under and he lays it in We asked coach Dunn about his game and he kind of describes Jaden Dory as a guy whos playing in a New York City park Kind of brings that attitude Washington from one block to the other and theres Payton Marshall Jackets doing a nice job with ball movement player movement Thats five assists now on six made field goals So their pace and flow minus a few turnovers pretty efficient And six different players have each made one shot Got a whistle Its going to be on Peyton Marshall Thats two quick ones on Payton Marshall Hes looking a little confused Didnt think he had enough contact to get the foul on that one But you know Wy coming off exam week as a former student athlete here former basketball player Its the time of year where you improve the most You have time to dedicate Youre kind of a pro player now You you watch film with your coaches You can get a little extra sleep the rigors of the academics at an institute like Georgia Tech I mean thats thats fullon all the time I mean your class practice study hall over and over and now its a reset button just 100 basketball So this is where the good Georgia Tech teams will make their stride heading into league play Quick entry Curac can test the shot but Scoffield on the putback Scoffield with the vertical bounce Caught it above the rim No steps Impressive Didnt know he had that in him Not bad for a guys coming off a really bad ankle bone bruise at the end of last season and lingered into this year Get that athletic trainer race I mean there was He laughter looks good He looked pretty good right there 7 seconds to shoot Maris bench getting loud at this defensive effort Its Kelly Zips it to Wy in the corner Reeves got it Count the basket A fourpoint play opportunity for the senior Blackwell pick up the foul Just uh close that out a little too aggressively Well get a look at it here again Jackets doing a nice job attacking the paint Blackwell you saw at the end his momentum carried into Reeves and Reeves holds the follow through takes the contact chance to go to the line for the fourpoint play It is hard to believe how well he has shot the three these last two plus games Hes now hit 11 of his last 20 And theres the fourpoint play There are the numbers right there One for one tonight So impressive And you know I think just coach starter predicates you know development of the player skill set in the off season Hes got a great assistant coaching staff led by associate head coach Carl Hobbs Um and Nate Babcock a guy who came from the NBA is is a guru in player development So I know the reps are getting in in the off season And now with classes out finals done all the players will get some reps And historically you look at Damon Statmires team its not just a Georgia Tech but even in his time at Pacific they do tend to get better as the year moves forward Hoping to make a jump here Theyve only got two more nonconference games after tonight Face Lafayette College on Saturday FloridaM in about 12 days And then its on to Cameron Indor And Scoffield trying to get his own miss but Curwak boxes him out How about the lift pole Kirwowak gave Georgia Tech in that window Yeah that was a nice job of him holding his ground there Staying vertical Did not give an inch to Sco little out of control Misses wide left Now Eric Chatfield Jr freshman point guard from Pace Academy right here in Atlanta Really guarding hard on Roberts He takes him on and Scoffield recovers Elijah Lewis drills a three Thats now two threepointers for the Red Foxes that have come off broken plays Uh Chadfield a nice job speeding up the Red Foxes but the ball bounced Marisay on both those possessions They got threes out of it And Maris now four of eight from three Craft and answer No weve got a foul on the rebound Theyre going to get Jason Scoffield for shoving Carowak in the back Yeah Carowak gets the hustle play Just the effort alone gives the Jackets a chance to get a whistle See right there pushing the back Scoffield right place right time He was had the position for the offensive rebound Kuroak will get a break Cila back in 20 seconds on the shot clock Baseline out of bounds situation And Chaz Kelly transferring from Boston College gets it into CEA Kelly trying to go baseline on Miles Parker He draws a foul have been solid with their ball movement thus far in this one Really moving the ball around the perimeter and then attacking the paint Another inbounds Kelly goes to Cila Fine skills from Moila around the rim How about that lefty touch Beautiful footwork was phenomenal on that play Miles Parker number five a shooter coming in for Maris Manards already hit a couple of threes Fleming stays with Lewis Now Watson against Cila trying to bump him out of the way He cant finish it Tricky pass attempted by Kelly looking for CEO and thatll bring us to a break Georgia Tech in Maris tight early named after Kmans court Georgia Tech reached the sweet 16 that year before falling to LSU in the Omni See the numbers from that game Mark Price with 20 points And for what its worth the only other two times Georgia Maris has played in Atlanta Georgia Tech has gone to the Final Four in each of those years It was December of 03 in January of 90 And what an athletic play Elijah Lewis hes a born scoreer Coming off an 18point outing hes now got a game high seven working hard underneath and this is going to be a foul on Watson whos trying to hang with him Well get another look at Lewiss last basket Hes shooting 53 on the season from the guard position Thats outstanding And he does it by taking high quality shots like that Well executed offense Hes great moving off the basketball timing these cuts his great change of pace in his game Wy uh just has a a high IQ on the offensive side of the ball Love Cila goes upstairs for it So the alleyoop from Moila Thats now eight assists on nine baskets for Georgia Tech Its good to see Kelly learn from that The last one was a turnover He gunned it at the midsection and that one he uh threw it at the rim on the lob But the answer right there number 13 getting it done Elijah Lewis in his second year at Maris transferred in from Adelfi University a division 2 school in the Northeast 10 Conference We asked Coach Dunn how he found Lewis Said Well to be honest with you I love watching NE10 basketball I watched him a few times This guys pretty good 10 seconds to shoot Fleming trying to break down Parker Menard comes over to help and theyre going to get him on the foul Don was not happy about that Felt like his team bailed out by reaching Theres the lob play Throw it when no one else can get it Thats where Cila does his damage And you see Lewis the pace to his game going off the bounce Stops on a dime elevates and drops it Thats the second foul on Manard Looks like hell be subbed out Lewis with that field goal He has nine points now in this one Four of six from the field Leads all scorers on the board Substitutions for the red boxes Guy Fleming hits the free throw and a bunch of changes Jason Scoffield and Jaden Collins Roberts coming in as Bernard takes a seat Eric Chadfield Jr back to the bench for the Yellow Jackets Lamar Washington returning And Georgia Tech so far perfect from the free throw line tonight Five for five Theyre shooting 64 from the floor On the break After a press Collins Roberts cant get it to go off the glass into the corner Kelly drives in the paint Tough shot Wont drop Now Rajan Blackwell we havent mentioned his name much tonight yet to score but hes their leading scoreer on the team And he comes off the bench Also leads the team in rebounding Yeah he plays just shy of 28 minutes per game Second in minutes played per game Again coming off the bench hes real smart Corner three ball Another dagger from Jaden Dory who came in two for 12 from three So far tonight John hes two of three from distance Go figure Sila facing up Puts it on the floor and from behind Jaden Dore on both ends getting it done Number 12 Dod is a veteran guy 100 plus games played in the Marrist uniform and hes high IQ great defense off the ball You see him knocking down the triple in the corner and here just making a play effort You know Scoffields given up some athleticism and size Good team defensive effort by Maris at the end of the clock and thatll be a shot clock violation for Georgia Tech Well right now youre seeing a Maris team and you can see why theyre top 10 defensively in a number of statistics in the nation They really pack it in They talk They have great talk from all positions Their positioning is is outstanding And then they hustle They play hard Theyre not going to give up anything easy It puts a premium on early offense for the Jackets in this one Tech applying a little pressure here Blackwell gets Cila in the switch and he hits it Good legs by Blackwell Stayed low got the hips under it created space and hit it with an extended arm of Cila Tough shot Fleming to the free throw line A pass a little hot for Cila And itll stick with Georgia Tech as we step aside Meris a threepoint lead Weve also got the ACC player of the year Haynes King will join us close to a decade When you think back to your time at Tech I mean what do you hope your legacy is Really just being a a great human being Uh obviously a great player but more importantly a great human being And uh you know just gave it his all And not even just for himself and his family just for the teammates and the people around him and the people that believed in him Cam Craft gets a bucket to drop down Georgia Tech back to within one Well all right So the season regular season I should say ended a couple weeks ago How do you spent your time Uh first and foremost you know trying to get my body right rest Uh I probably had a week or so where I kind of rotted on the couch a little bit uh trying to trying to rest up get the body back right but other than that now were were on to BYU and going to try to get this 10th win of the season Sure you watched a little BYU film Whats whats going to be a key in that game you think Uh you know win on first and second down Um if we do that and protect the ball I feel like offensively you know were going to be in pretty good shape They they give us a lot of different looks uh with with the fronts and coverages and stuff like that but like I said if we execute and and win the first and second down and and be in a good position for you know if it were a third down or not uh I I think were going to be in really good position Well a week from Saturday 330 on ABC we got some hoops tonight And we were talking before we came back from break but you got a little basketball background right A little bit I I played a little bit in in high school Whens the last time you got shots on Uh Id probably say probably about a year ago Okay Went home and uh playing with with some of the boys but it its been a while for sure Uh and but you know if you pass it to me I Imma shoot it for sure laughter Well Hanks you dont know this but uh the first I I played basketball here in the late 90s same class as Coach Key Brent Key and uh first guy I met on campus we were in a freshman we were on top of Peters Parker a barbecue with all the student athletes Im from Boston Hes from Trussville Alabama We met that first night 1996 Ive been friends ever since Hes had great success here Just signed the contract Whats one takeaway or one comment you can have about what does Coach Key mean to you What does he mean to this program Whats something you learned from him that will stay with you for life I mean just being genuine you know he hes not going to change for anything Um and it it doesnt matter Like he hes just going to be himself and it it shows from day in day out Um but for him to just do that its its a certain level of of realness I guess youd say that that he has and that you respect because he he doesnt change for anybody and its its just like he hes going to keep it real tell you and and shoot you straight and whatever happens happens But you know hes going to tell you the truth for sure When you look back in the last three years and you guys won a lot of games uh what is your most vivid memory your your favorite memory from aside from winning the PopTarts in a week and a half but what are your favorite memories you think of over the last three years Um I mean I one of them is that first bowl win Um that that was the first bowl that I actually played in in in my collegiate career Uh but you know just getting that first win win win with the boys to to I guess youd say overpass that that 500 level from 6 to6 and now 76 and then uh you know now I Id say theres a bunch of games this season Uh and to even you know take that next level and that next step to for for what weve accomplished this whole season its its meant a lot Um you know th those go down to some of my best memories of my collegiate career Ill tell you what that performance uh you had against Georgia in the eight overtime game was outstanding Uh you know just when I played the memories I have were some some of the losses because we took a Duke team that was number one in the country right to the wire a couple times And although we lost the game when I look back 25 years you know into uh the history books those are the ones that stand out because we went toetotoe with some of the best And Georgia was obviously tops in the country at the time I said favorite memories Michael Favorite Im just saying the older you get you have an appreciation for your accomplishment And we want to win and we won plenty here And thanks thanks Hannes for joining us for sure But thanks for your contribution to the to the institute and the excitement around college

coached And uh one of those being that thats been in the league for a while is Trent Williams and you know whatever team hes going Im Im usually rooting for them Is there uh anything that youre going to be able to do once the season is over that you havent been able to do that youre looking forward to I mean obviously I know youre not going to eat bad cuz you got more things coming up but whats one thing you dont have time during the season for but are going to get to do once the seasons over One of the first things Im going to try to do is go hunting hunting or pushing Uh I I enjoy the the outdoors and and being in the woods and you know the peace and quiet but you know also just having fun Um and whether its deer hunting duck hunting or hawk hunting and just squirrel hunting whatever it is just just out in the woods and getting a piece of mind and separating yourself You taking any teammates out there who may not have as much playing experience trying to coach them up We have talked about it before Uh we havent finalized anything but you know we we definitely have talked about it quite a few times Uh so that is definitely a plan that that weve been talking about for a while All right Well I look forward to hearing more about that Again Hannes King joining us Hannes its been such a pleasure to have you Its been a lot of fun to watch you over the last uh three years

halftime It has to be fun to watch him Thank you All right thats Hannes King A big thanks to him for joining us here today and excited to get a chance to watch him shoot up one more time for the Yellow Jackets Meanwhile still tight here little over four minutes to play as Marshall goes up and a jump ball cheering Quick tie up on that possession Payton had the drop step and step through Thats tough call for the Jackets Maris walks away with it Maris shooting 50 from the floor Both these teams have shot the ball extremely well tonight John Blackwell has it knocked loose Washington up with Ramigan Feeds Reeves instead cant finish Ramagan with the rebound Its one area where Georgia Tech has struggled tonight Second chance points Lamar Washingtons going to have a chance to pick up a couple Maris still protecting that Big smile right there as Lamar Washington at the free throw line You mentioned Kenny Anderson Neta Scott is not the only Kenny Anderson teammate in the building tonight John head coach John Dunn played with Kenny at Archbishop Mallaloy He was one year ahead of Kenny Anderson And when they were both coming up coach Dunn had just finished his freshman year getting into his sophomore year He felt like he had the starting point guard job and the junior varsity all locked up In fact when he heard that Kenny was coming in he said You know guys hes not taking my JV point laughter guard spot Lo and behold 6 months later Kenny Andersons wearing an MVP of the varsity tournament And so no Coach Dunn held on to his JV point guard spot Kenny decided to take varsity Thats pretty good huh Thats awesome Archbishop Malloy the legendary head coach Jack Curran one of the greatest high school coaches in the history of the game New York City basketball at its finest Theres a lot of New York City flavor on this Maris team as well by the way Jaden Collins Roberts Dory nearly lost his footing cheering Blackwell three to shoot Throws it up No Greavves rips away the rebound Payton Marshall on Scoffield going up short Had a good look at it Neither teams been able to create separation in this one Wy you got to feel like maybe the first team to 70 in this one Walk away with the W In some ways it reminds you that Monmouth game from 10 days ago where Monmouth and Georgia Tech were just entangled back and forth We went nearly I think 20 minutes of game play with the margin being three points or less Yeah I think for the Yellow Jackets obviously without two starters and Dongo and Mustaf you know whos going to step up off the bench Just two points coming off the bench for the Jackets in the first half Eight points from Maris off the bench theyre one of the best bench scoring teams in the country They get 33 points per game coming off the bench And the way they have shot the three its kind of following up the second half they had against Bryant this past weekend They went six of nine in the second half against Bryant after going 0 for seven in the first half That three rounded out but so far tonight they are now six of 12 Kelly lines up a three and connects cheering Mentioned threepoint shooting Thats a stat to watch in the second half Maris only averages seven threes per game and theyve already got six in this one So certainly Yellow Jackets got to keep an eye on guarding the threepoint strike Georgia Tech three of five So theyve picked their spots well and near down low Battle for the basketball Cila tied up with Gabriel Good hustle by Maris And we got a jump ball cheering Get a little chippy down low Yeah physicality is up The officials crew letting them play The zone has been good to Georgia Tech Just uh the ability to create space Cila with the big wingspan and gets down Theres a lot of arm right there Got away with it So we play on Georgia Tech pulled back in front Maris hasnt scored in two and a half minutes Kelly another alleyoop try Cila has to come down then back up Second time this half Kelly has made that driving and kick pass the lob to the rim Again he threw that first one at CIAs midsection His last two have been great passes Blackwell around to Lewis whos got nine points to lead Maris goes up tough shot and cant find the touch Rema again and Kelly draws the foul Georgia Tech in the bonus Thatll put Ch the free throw line Foul trouble Fouls are stacking up Its 10 team fouls now on the Red Foxes Scoffield with two Menard with two fouls Parker with two Yeah its five guys with two fouls each oddly enough for coach John Dunns team Watson with two as well Kelly to the line shooting So Jazz Kelly at the free throw line number one Jason Scoffield coming in sophomore from Pikipsy Cam Craft to the bench Kellys first free throws of the season gets the second one Final 90 seconds here in the first half Georgia Tech has put up 40 points Theyre averaging normally just 33 points this season in the first half as Blackwells three is off the mark Remagan the rebound Kelly calling for it I said its the freshman Remigan and he turns it over on the break Jaden Collins Roberts high off the window No Scoffield and a foul Going to get Remagan downstairs on that one A little too much body Oh theyre going to get Theo over the top Coming in late in the action So thats only his first The Yellow Jackets with fouls Craft with two Reeves with two Thats Silas first foul Marshalls on the bench with two Scoffield trying to snap an 80 run for Georgia Tech Scoffield just one of six on the season Really the only Maris player that is not shooting great on the season Theyre top 10 in the nation in free throw percentage Well hes gotten off to a slow start this year He did shoot 72 from the free throw line last year Halfway down and out That shot build a little tension didnt it One minute to play in the first half Cila gets it to roll Interior passing for the Yellow Jackets has been outstanding Thats now 11 assists for the Yellow Jackets on 14 made field goals and a 10 to one run for the Yellow Jackets in these final minutes of the first half through Scoffield and on to Collins Roberts Shot clock is ticking Lewis in the short corner and the rebound from Osilla Scoffield really does a nice job utilizing his body to create offensive opportunities with those screening situations on the handoffs Yeah Maris has not made a bucket in over four and a half minutes Lamar Washington with eight Carves in a tough layin Cila trying to go up Gets it And thats the end of the first half The Yellow Jackets close it on a 121 run and theyll take an eightpoint lead into the break Cila wins the 5050 ball Jackets getting it done on the defensive side of the ball that half Red Foxes only with 36 points Jackets up eight Well step aside Georgia Tech shooting music 53 from the floor Buckets raining everywhere for most sila with a dozen points and plenty more to come tonight Its Georgia Tech in Meris Yellow Jackets up by eight after 20 Defenses I think points in the paint The Jackets had an eightpoint advantage Uh Maris bright spot was 13 second chance points on eight offensive rebounds Uh so theyre hustling theyre battling And Lewis is fouled out of the gate here by Cila his second first team foul Thats two on Cer now Elijah Lewis to the line shooting two Well no surprise they go to Elijah right out of the first possession in the second half The leading scorer and nine points in the game Give him 10 Coach Dunn dialed it up and Lewis is answering misses the second free throw Scoffield with the offensive rebound Harris tonight five of eight from the free throw line But second chance points here for Justin Manard He cashes it in Thats the first field goal for Maris since about four and a half minutes left in the first half And Manard now with eight points again Hes coming off a careerhigh 27point effort on Saturday in their win against Bryant And Scoffield denies the lob entry You know coach John Dunn hes got a reputation across the conference as being a defensive coach and the numbers would bear that out Theyve been top three in the MAC the last couple of years but we asked him you know would you call yourself a defensive coach He kind of bristled a little bit felt like you know we work on both Its a balance but he did concede that I do get especially I rate when we give up easy baskets I think our players recognize that theyd like to avoid that if possible Well I think number one hes a competitor and his you know his resume speaks for itself Uh the balance of Mars is what impresses me Theyve had 10 players on their roster have double figure games this season Uh their ability to share the ball theyre very efficient offensively They very rarely beat themselves Theyre going to take care of the basketball Theyre going to dig in defensively and youre going to be in a dog fight Lamar Washington six points and four assists in the first half for Georgia Tech Cam Craft seven points on five shots His shot looking more improved here inside MCMish Six seconds Reeves has got to let it fly Bullseye That was a great pass by Cila A crosscourt pass thrown away from the defense Finds the senior Reeves for the knockdowns Reards thinking about an answer here Hell penetrate into the lane Feeds outside Collins Roberts got Kesi Reeves in the air and draws an easy foul Savvy play by Collins Roberts on that one Maris could get him going Reeves theres a guy that can get going Knocks down the triple He now has 12 points in this game but hes also got three fouls after picking this one up here from Collins Roberts And Coach Dunn had the highest praise for Jaden Collins Roberts obviously naming him captain He felt like that was an organic leadership development for his program But he pointed out he theyve never really played to Collins Roberts his strengths They theyve based their offenses around other players a little slower as opposed to playing at a faster pace which youre trying to do this year which better fits Colin Roberts offensive foul And coach Duns point was hey he never complained and we were not gearing our offense towards him He did the best he could at ask and doing what we asked him to do and I think hes earned a lot of respect especially for sticking around after a pretty special year last year Yeah And he started every game hes played for Maris and I believe its the first solo captain named by coach D since hes been in Maris First captain of any type that since coach Duns been there That pass jarred loose and here comes a Kai Fleming Reeves playing with three fouls Goes up Good money Draws a foul and loses a shoe Harris now I bet hes putting his shoe Hes been putting that shoe on just like that for about 20 years Just shoving his foot in there trying to bend that laughter heel I only say that cuz thats how I put mine on And thats where the similarities stop Yeah laughter true words never spoken Colin Roberts with that foul Thats his first personal Reeves goes to the line on the season shooting 77 from the stripe coming into this one Hes 21 of 27 prior to his attempts this evening And watching what hes doing this really puts into perspective how badly he was missed last season leads Georgia Tech in scoring threepoint shooting free throw shooting steals He started every game this year That was a pretty big loss last year but because he sat out he comes back this year Lead up to eight for Georgia Tech And Elijah Lewis got a step cant lay it in a tad too strong off the window in transition Collins was trying to fight through the screen Reeves with a little foul money and he cashes it in Last two and a half games besides the fact the balls going through the net Well I think his maturity uh you know in baseball they say hit singles in basketball make layups He makes layups He doesnt force anything He knows his game He knows his role And hes got great rapport with his teammates You saw Cila find him on that skip pass Hes in the right place at the right time And that comes from experience Coach Dunn he knows this ones getting away a little bit Jackets putting on a run Yeah First time weve seen a double digit lead for either side Yellow Jackets pulled ahead for good in the final four minutes of the first half and now they have stretched it in the first four minutes of the second half Kelly the seas parked Oh no but Dory comes in and blocks out the sun at the last minute And now a traveling call Itll be Georgia Tech basketball Dods been a do it all guy for the Red Foxes Eight points five rebounds in this one His defense off the ball Thats the second time hes come from behind the action to make a hustle play And he gets on the floor get the travel jackets based on out of bounds situation But you can see his size his athleticism on display there Jackets number 12 So Cam Craft replaces Kesi Reeves Hell head to the bench with 17 points eight shots Kai Fleming trying to go up and he walked with it So Jackets will pick up fullcourt pressure Just trying to burn some clock stay aggressive defensive minded I think that was something coach Dmar hoped to incorporate a good bit this year as Lamar Washington knocks it loose CREATES THE TURNOVER AND THE FINISH FROM Chaz Kelly cheering Jackets smell blood right now Or honey theyre swarming laughter Defense is getting after it You ever dropped that one before I dont know It just came to me Not sure if it was good or bad Wy You laughed after only what laughter 30 years at Georgia Tech It took you that long I did like it Thats going Thats going on the mantle 7 seconds to shoot Menard into the corner Lewis cant get it to go Dory on the offensive glass The extra pass Cutting in Collins Roberts cant handle it Thats a nice cut off the ball Craft took his eye off it but Jackets substitution for the Red Foxes number four Blackwell So Blackwell back onto the floor Yellow Jack gets into their half court and an offensive foul coming here on Lamar Washington Lamar Washington whats it going to take for Mars to get back in this game you think John Well its been a while since theyve hit a threepoint Theyve been stuck on six made threes and all those came in the first half I think their threepoint shooting theyre going to have to be voted for someone to knock down the triple That was a long two that didnt fall You go back to the win over Bryant They were six of nine in the second half from three but prior to that they were 0 for seven And Cam Craft splash Ive been impressed with Georgia Techs collective effort defensively The energy is up physicality their rebounding a lot of one and done and theyre forcing turnovers like that Fleming takes it to the hole and coach Dunn wants another timeout as the lead has swelled to 18 Georgia Tech they forced five turnovers this half Theyve been picking pockets and hitting buckets music Well a lot of Yellow Jackets feeling good so far tonight up by 18 And Georgia Tech without two starters tonight and Jaden Mustaf and by Dongo But how about the play of Cam Craft Hes got 10 points now Four of six from the floor And John he has just struggled for whatever reason here on his home floor Take a look at the numbers This is entering tonight Shot the lights out in the three road games down at Destin for that two game or two team two game multi teamam event and then of course in Athens But good to see him finding comfort here at home Justin Manard knocks down a two Manard in double figures now And that was a big bucket Maris five turnovers leading to six Georgia Tech points in the second half has been a story Reeves leads all scorers in the second half with eight The senior continues to step up for the Jackets Kelly left takes it tries to drop it off to Kiraak and a turnover for Georgia Tech Youve seen a lot of young guys come in over the course of your playing career your coaching career When you look at a guy like Cole Kiraak what do you like and and what do you think the forecast is for him Well I like that hes out here competing and theres nothing better or more valuable than playing time playing experience minutes played and for the last couple weeks hes been getting those minutes And you can see his development The confidence comes with experience And hes playing in practice against two guys that are potentially all ACC guys And Sila who could be a first team all ACC uh all rookie team I think we know Boozer is probably going to wrap that up uh for player of the year or rookie of the year or both Yeah he might win both And Caleb Wilson not too shabby himself But for Kiraak to battle against Bango and Cela daily and a Peyton Marshall with the wide body when he gets out here hes ready Hes game ready By the way talk about those threepoint shots Dory just nailed one Hes three OF FOUR BIG BALL Oh skying high above the rim Tell me hes not having fun Oh hes called for the foul A little rise smile He thought he got that clean Cole you got to keep the left hand up He came down on the basketball Caught some arm Look at the elevation Well above the room You can see why the jacket staff is high on him Hes got great hands great bounce Hes growing into his body Continues to work in the weight room And again playing experience is whats key for him Hes getting meaningful minutes Cole Kirowak Hes coming back to the bench different man You knew that for the first time in your college career Gets a little break during the holiday He can show that highlight reel right there to his family and friends And the effort defensively John leading directly to that turnover Yeah Ive been very impressed with Georgia Techs defense Uh their intensity theyre swarming to the basketball Theyre closing out when the balls in the air on the skip passes Uh it its been fun to watch it is raining here in Mamish dropping hammers and Washington just held the ball for a split second extra to have the Maris defense commit Uh that was a veteran move trying to withstand the fury here Manard with eight and he cheering gives it right to Cam Craft The Jackets are on THE BREAK AGAIN ANOTHER OH REEVES THE OFFENSIVE REBOUND Hell go to the line applause Its so loud in here right now that Reeves didnt know if the whistle was blown or not kind of looked at the official in the stoppage jackets all over the red foxes right now Like the roof beginning to shake One more look at CEO Oh look at the bench Theyre fired up Reeves hits the first free throw Substitutions for the Red Foxes Jaden Vance Roberts Jason Scoffield and Miles Parker Scoffield back into the game for the Red Foxes Hes been hes been the guy that has kind of been the neutralizer in the paint So good to see him back there on the defensive interior Play with three fouls here And Dbby Reagan coming in replacing Kesi Reeves Parker gets Kelly in the air long two Tech controls the rebound Under 12 to play and the lead at 19 Reagan the freshman from Germany No you got to Blackwell almost walked with it Lewis gets it to fall Finally the Red Foxes get off the wagon there They They were struggling from beyond the arc Saw by Dango there on the bench out with some knee maintenance Jaden Mustaf also out tonight with maintenance Tech down two starters No problems so far Lamar Washington He nails one And Georgia Tech from three John They are seven of nine tonight And not just seven of nine but seven of nine against one of the top defenses in the country at protecting the three Its been impressive Lamar Washington you know that was his ninth point but hes got eight assists one turnover Hes been outstanding I mean that assist to turnover ratio over his last six games has got to be nosing up against four to one And to be honest with you John I think that was kind of the hope when they brought him in was that you could have this type of production It did feel like he had got off to a little bit of a slower start but he has found his footing Elijah Lewis hes got the only one theyve been able to go to consistently for buckets tonight Six of 12 from the field Hes got 14 points 10 to shoot Green all types of room and he knocks it down And thats the type of pucket thats really going to drive coach Dunn nuts Get back Scoffield out to Parker Hes a threepoint shooter Off the mark Another look Lewis bottoms cheering Inside out three for the Red Box they got to get it going defensively and they just cant Fleming gets in on the duck best We talked about the dunking Dutchman earlier Rick Smith played for Maris in the 80s might be paying a little bit of homage Rich Smith is not walking through that door You need the seven and four to protect the rim on that one and coach Dunn and the Red Fox is in uncharted territory right now On the season theyre holding opponents at just 61 points per game Georgia Tech already with 74 and we still got 10 to play Kiraak battling for the rebound as Kai misses the free throw Got to feel good about that knee Got it surgically repaired about 12 months ago and hes obviously made a full recovery Blackwell A loose rebound Lamar Washington How does nine points 10 assists and four rebounds sound to you Purac another room attack Flex big man Reeves with the assist Jackets getting off the ball tremendous You know theyre really just theyre not pounding it Theyre passing the ball running their lanes and theyve created space Only thing theyre pounding right now is the rim Georgia Tech in full control Oh Lamar Washington The piouette wont fall Parker in the corner Come on Maris led by three with about four minutes left to go in the first half And since then Georgia Tech has run away with it Still eight and a half minutes to go Skip pass to Remigan Nifty moves as he takes it in Not sure thats quite on the level of Ple Thats his great uncle That was pretty impressive move How about Jean Pul No kidding Its too bad he cant kick balls in the basket Lewis and His Reeves rips away the rebound And a lot of one and done That was not the case early Build a lead on based on second chance points And the way she reached out telling head coach David Statamire Hey I got it I got it under control coach Washington goes to Kiraak Oh look at the big fella Pretty good move West Miles Parker Parkers first basket in the game Hes got three points coming into this one The freshman at 17 points against Army averaging just over six and a half per game Oh no Lamar Washington goes down in some pain Just now back to his feet as Parker bangs another three and a timeout for an injury here Freshman Parker with backto back triple Jason Scoffield and Justin Jackets have done a nice job she sharing the basketball Theyve got 20 assists in this one on 29 made field goals I mean from an offensive standpoint and I know they shot the lights out against West Georgia a few weeks back but if you combine the ball movement the shot selection and of course the overall scoring this has got to be one of the best nights Georgia Tech has offensively this year Yeah the offense is clicking Defense has been solid I mean theyre theyve held Maris to 42 from the field This is the first time this season where when Maris has 15 assists or more they were 50 Theyre 22 and three uh dating back to last year when they have 15 plus assists And if the Georgia Tech keeps doing this it looks like that trend is going to break So Cam Craft picks up the foul Thats his fourth And puts Collins Roberts at the line shooting two Jaden Collins Roberts heart and soul of this Maris team Washington and Jaden Collins Roberts I mean obviously his play speaks for himself He was named captain but we heard quite the story too about uh what he did for his stepfather Keith cheering as he misses the free throws Georgia Tech coming the other way But you know he was Jaden Collins two years ago and then his stepfather Keith Roberts he added Roberts onto the back of his name legally changed his name and then invited his stepfather up to Maris over the summer In fact it was his stepfathers birthday and revealed to him through a jersey reveal that he had added his last name to his Pretty moving stuff Little play fake down low Scoffield Was nice work by Collins Roberts Points in the paint One of your keys John And Georgia Tech has dominated that area tonight Yeah thats been the story for sure And its come through dribble penetration And weve seen big CILA especially Kurowak running rimto rim a lot of dribble handoff ball screen action and then the roll to the rackets have exposed them a little bit but one of the best defensive teams in the country early on in the season Well I dont think its crazy to say that Im sure some of the size particularly of Mosila has played a role in that You know coach Don was candy He said you know were going to be undersized on some nights in our league much less against a team like Georgia Tech that features a couple of great bigs by Dongo not playing tonight Blackwell hes heating up The lead is down to 14 with a little under five minutes to play Dont sleep on my boy Cole Curac Hes laughter been a factor tonight He sure has Lamar Washington back on the floor for Georgia Tech after that apparent ankle injury and he hits the floater The basket is good and I think we have a foul call there Im not sure I missed I missed that I didnt see a number called to the to the score book inadvertent whistle Yeah thats what were told No foul Blackwell How hot is he Cila cant save it Well stick with George or with Merist Coming in tonight the Red Foxes top 10 in the nation in uh holding opponents 619 points per game Theyre holding opponents to 25 from beyond the ark Uh and then one of the top 10 teams is free throw shooting at just shy of 79 And theyve struggled there too tonight Washington called for the foul and he is in disbelief Lamar Washington his second 18 foul That thats what makes the statistic Georgia Tech shooting 61 in this game Coming into the night Maris was holding a bonus to 37 You thought they couldnt have shot the ball better than they did in the first half but theyve shot even better here in the second half Front end of one and one is missed as CILA skies for the rebound Its now got eight boards Fleming drills it Three now Five Yellow Jackets have knocked down triples in this one Manard comes off the screen a little too much Georgia Tech five of five from beyond the arc in this second half Eight of 10 for the game Washington high off the window Thats what I thought we were seeing And the next thing you know its off laughter to the window and Menard buries one Thats what he does Hes a shooter Thats his third triple in this one Hes got 13 points Five of eight from the field coming off a 27point effort against Bryant If you told Maris they were going to shoot 48 from three I think they feel pretty good about it Problem is Georgia Tech put up 85 points By far the most Meris has allowed this year is Kelly He gets it to fall Everybodys hitting Jackets have dominated with their size in athleticism A plus N advantage on the backboard Points in the paint in this one Its been a big stat 40 for the Yellow Jackets 16 points in the paint for Maris Lenard feeds it to Lewis 40 points in the paint tonight And a rare couple of points for Maris there I just shoot for Kelly Feeds it down low to Reeves and Manard with the rebound Georgia Tech just two points of their season high They had 89 in Athens Parker lines up a three on target Thats three triples now for the freshman Parker Yeah he came in there leading threepoint shooter shooting 40 At Georgia Tech a 13point lead with a minute and a half to play The Yellow Jackets plenty content to kill some clock here Maris was 72 coming into this one Bryant scored 74 points on them Thats the most points theyve relinquished this year until tonight Jackets 87 points in this one Georgia Tech Theyll face Lafayette College on Saturday That twopoint basket falls for Miles Parker Man the freshman he is heating up right now He is the offense Hes now got 11 points in just 17 minutes played Time out Well step aside for a final time Georgia Tech on the be on the arc coming into this one So final minute Reeves a three Saved by Kelly 12 on the shot clock 32 on the game clock Jackets might just take the shot clock violation Well see Yep they will turn it over willingly The highest percentage Georgia Tech has shot from three is 78 If Kesi Reeves hadnt taken that last one would have set a school record Man thats tough No dont dont tell Kesi Reeves that They shoot 73 tonight They went seven of nine a few years ago How many years ago Oh only 35 years ago against Texas in 91 Jeez you got to deflate it like that Thats thats how were going to sign off Im just reporting the news Jeez way to bring it down Its all right Ky They got they got bigger prizes in mind Heres a look at the upcoming schedule The Leopards the Rattlers and then the Blue Devils And how about that first week at home in January Boston College Chaz Kelly going to face his former team and of course Syracuse former yellow a couple of former yellow jackets on that team Thatll be interesting But tonight Georgia Tech triumphs 8776 behind a lights out shooting performance and they score 87 points on one of the top 10 defenses statistically in all of college basketball Yeah they brought it the entire game 50
