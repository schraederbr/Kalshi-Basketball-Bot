because of a hip flexor suffered last week is back in the lineup Jaden Taylor will not start roll his ankle last night they are hoping that he can play he did go through warmup something to keep an eye on DJ Burns guarding Armando Bott Bott needs to go right at him put him in the position where he has to guard Casey Morel on RJ Davis Kevin Heats wants to put some size on Davis and Morel is that considerably bigger than Davis gdau into the paint forces it up no and Mohamad diara whos been a rebounding machine in this tournament comes down with the first one for State Michael oconnell four of his five highest scoring games of the season have come in the last four days heres the double on burns they put the double on then took it off quickly just to stop the back down turn around by horn will drop through but DJ horn has to be a little happier to be playing in an uptempo game so difficult to go against Virginia where he had eight points but he was 0 of five from three wol pack were down five just over a minute to go Virginia going to the free throw line it looked like state was done and then everything that could have gone wrong for Virginia did the huge shot by okell and they just took care of business in the overtime and thats why they are still here Harrison Ingram with that tap out out on the offensive rebound I thought ello had a chance to get it but he didnt Orel fouled by Applause Davis so again the status of Jaden Taylor unknown at this time the left angle hes got it taped up he did go through warmups but now hes sitting got it wrapped up even more this is a guy who averages better than 12 points per game dont know if hes going to play tonight and he had 22 points against North Carolina in the last game between these two teams both he and DJ horn were having their way with Carolina in the first half before they got shut down in the second this is Taylor before the game literally a game time decision and Kevin Keats has not been using that deep of a rotation and its their fifth game in as many nights so obviously they would love to have the services of Taylor but if they dont theyll have to go a little bit deeper Brion pass we got a few minutes last night cam Woods who played earlier in the Applause tournament Ingram unguarded misses the corner three and another rebound for the wol pack this time its morcel facing morcel had a really good game last night against Virginia hes an excellent Defender but he needs to be a scorer in this game at 25 in Tuesdays game against Louisville we were talking to Kevin Heats earlier today theyve been here so long long played so many games he was like is it Friday or is it Saturday as Burns turns it over but what a ride NC state has been on and just for people who may not know around other parts of the country States not going to the NCAA tournament unless they win this game tonight so if they win it not only do they get the automatic birth they get the ACC tournament the banner the trophy and the whole thing Elliot Kau has had two very good games against North Carolina State and his p ation is excellent right on Q hes averaging 132 points against the wolfback without having made a three in the two games they played but hes also averaging close to seven assists in those two games Im rounding up youre so generous okon Lopez knocks down a three and he continues to score at a much higher rate than he did during the regular season hes a different player in this tournament hes gone 16 16 12 and 12 in the four games coming into this one and again those are four of his five highest scoring games of the entire season Davis doesnt need much space this is the three and morcel the rebound okell has made more threepoint field goals in this tournament than he made the last 17 games combined Davis got caught on burns bot over to help porn o and what a start for the pack thats why why you dont want a double at times I mean youve got to pick your poison if you double DJ Burns hes a really good passer out of that Applause double Ingram open for a three cant hit it and so far nothing doing on the offensive glass for Carolina always a big part of their game well theyre taking long shots and those are longer rebounds North Carolina needs to get a piece of that paint and go inside and play inside out thats their game which is what states doing now with Burns no double here Big Fellas going at it and burns wins and its stayed by nine remember NC State got out to a huge lead playing against North Carolina the last time and then Carolina not locked them down in the second half when DJ Burns gets the ball he catches it off the lane and he just backs his defender in there its oneonone in the post and theres not much even thats good of a def as Armando Bott is theres not much you can do youre given ground otherwise youre going to get run over first foul on burns Kevin aats in this tournament has gotten some really good minutes especially last night from Ben Middlebrooks as Bott steps to the line Burns getting about 21 minutes per game middle Brooks about 19 and I thought Jay that middle Brooks playing so well last night thats what allowed Burns to rest and maybe be so effective in the overtime middle Brooks was huge against against against Virginia we had 12 points six rebounds and three steals in that game against the Cavaliers and he made some really good defensive plays hes a really good pick and roll Defender 114 Applause Wolfpack and again a touch for burns getting bodied by Bop boy these are two guys who they dont shy away from the physical part of the game the kick to Horn its short and Bott the rebound Ingram running Morel comes up with it though great job by NC State to get back and for that break diara for three yes and state leads by 10 boy you couldnt have drawn it up any better if youre Kevin PS spinning Bott lost it it will stay with Carolina as we go to the Carolina by one in the final and look at the remarkable similarities Jay between the regular season in 87 and the regular season this year for the past its incredible I mean the numbers are almost identical in 1987 the ACC was an eight Team league so it was a Friday Saturday Sunday event bot going to work on midd Brooks whos coming to replace burds midd Brooks is really physical there but at least Carolina got the ball inside the first time theyve gotten a piece of the paint through bot horn defended by cormack Ryan the RS hit a three in the early going now the kick to oconnell the floater off the rim and still loose and out of bounds to the Wolfpack Mohamed diara INF fighting Armando Bott really good shot fake by Michael oconnell to open up that drive and now Bott is going to sit Jaylen Washington has checked yeah Carolina has more depth and theyre going to use it they want to send fresh bodies at NC State and wear down a team that they might think is already worn down a little bit but theyre not showing any signs of it right now third game in his many days for the heels fifth game in his many days for the wolfback horn got Trimble in the air then got blocked from behind by Withers Davis the kick Withers the drive off balance itll go Withers have made has made a great contribution of late coming off the bench last three games hes averaging over 6 and 1 half rebounds DJ horn is hot in the early going he averages 16 and a half hes got seven already tonight well anybody thought that NC stay was going to slow the tempo down theyre not theyre trying to get down the floor and get something early Morel went flying and then RJ Davis knocks down the jumper went right into his chest and a step back move to the right corner RJ Davis is actually better from three than he is from Two Against NC State this year Davis reached the 2000 career point mark last night as he continues to climb up the Carolina charts middle Brooks the reverse cant get it to go but Washington couldnt squeeze it but it belongs to Carolina anyways Davis again oconnell ahead to Applause diara and Hubert Davis is all over one of the officials maybe they hanging on the rim there by Middlebrooks but or the but you can hang on the rim if theres somebody underneath you its a safety thing and they play on well Lee Cel was trying to warn diara he dont hang on it that long afterwards but I like the fact they didnt call it technical Washington Banks won home and that gets Carolina back within seven the more North Carolina gets the ball inside the better it is for the tar horn off a screen floater oh boy DJ horn off to do a great great start tonight already with nine his movement has been excellent he was handcuffed in the game last night against Virginia not so so far now he reaches in and commits the foul and now we understand it was not diara hanging on the rim it was Kevin Heats being on the court that Hubert Davis was upset about and then hum went on the court to say he was upset about being on the court if you go on the court Im not moving you do whatever you want well some coaches do get a little too far out there and start playing defense witherss passed up the three too in so RJ Davis has gone to the bench for the first time and an immediate Carolina turnover really good job by both DJ horn and Jaden Taylor there of playing off of both kadu and Trimble you know theyre not playing him for the shop theyre playing him for the drive so they there to help they took away the drive and recovered late and thats what helped cause that turnover from Trimble so lets see what Jaden Taylor can do he has checked in with the bad left ankle and the Big Fellas back too DJ Burns Jr then Middlebrooks back to the Applause bench eight minutes in and the underdog with a 9point lead good Music fade and the B battle resumes between Burns and bacot soft touch but it rolls off the rim good defense by Bott good not to have his arms there so that could Burns could go through them and try to draw that foul just put him straight up so CAU and Trimble the two guards neither one of them really an outside shooter Ryans not in the game Davis is not in the game a different looking offensive lineup for the heels too Burns wraps it up think North Carolina needs to start putting DJ Burns in some ball screens get him away from the basket get him moving Morel frees himself pretty good look rebound down to Applause Withers Bo trimbles been good in this tournament for the heels especially two nights ago against Florida State and great defensively B cut with the jumper his first field goal of the game when he steps away that puts DJ Burns in a bad spot if he goes out there bacock can drive around him Burns comes out to get a touch he can hit it and he does not just the post guy got a soft touch in the midrange too well Casey morcel just came up almost set a ball screen on it and that freed him up for that little short jumper Ingram draws the Applause double Ingram gets it back and hits the three how about that passing around the horn twice to get it back to where the ball started for a wide open jumper hes really the only threepoint threat on the floor Withers can but hasnt taken him any this year they got RJ Davis ready to check in at the next whistle diara offensive Applause fou its going to be that kind of a night here but to Washington the heels in the pack for an ACC Applause title he scored 41 points against Iowa State today 6941 Cyclones who win the Big 12 tournament Championship now the the only team that played well enough to win in their game was Purdue they lost that one in overtime and had multiple chances to win that one everybody else got run Tennessee Got Run Duke got run in this event by NC State so here Carolina the one seed they had a magnificent game against Florida state in the quarters beat him by 25 and then beat a very game in DET terid group of pit Panthers 7265 in the semis the one thing that North Carolina has to deal with in this game DJ horn is having fun out there and hes got a smile on his face hes the one guy who didnt play on Tuesday because of the hit flexer they sat him out they were playing Louisville they were able to win without him so for him just his fourth and fourth for four days Jaden Taylor bad ankle and all a great cut from the weak side slot and burns found him what a great pass by DJ Burns so worried about him backing you down you dont have your hands up you just threw it right over Armando B Jay how about for and we know hes a great passer how about poist already for burns but he couldnt keep up with Davis there Davis has extraordinary speed with the ball not only in transition but in the half court changes speeds incredibly well Ryan trying to deny wh now hes going to keep him to one Music side and the foul on Ryan first on Ryan just the second on the team only three on NC State okell returns as Brion pass who got a couple of minutes its down this first half looking a little bit like the first half at North Carolina between these two teams where DJ horn got off to such a quick start that one rattles out hes already going 11 in this one Davis again being defended by morcel thats the matchup coach Keats wants Ryan no okell the rebound and again youre not seeing any crashing on the glass by the heels in the first game between these two they dominated on the offensive Applause glass Davis steps back and hits it how good is that boy great help by NC State Michael oconnell but RJ Davis just made a spectacular individual play the wolf pack had led by as many as 10 its down to three Morel with a tough one on the Baseline and when casy Morel plays aggressively NC States a different team kadoo and this is what North Carolina wants to do get the ball B down Court quickly and attack in transition make NC State run horn turns the corner Good Help by Armando bot now it going in to Burns instead itll be a Baseline Drive by horn left and short Davis another three hits again and Carolinas coming come back to TI more blue than red in the house here tonight and theyre getting noisy its out of bounds good effort by kdo but it is still State ball as we go to a timeout North Carolina showing some life and injecting that life is RJ Davis great help by Michael conell but the great step back and three another step back in transition goes into the body of a thats mid Steeler situation right there this is a bid stealer situation right here if NC State can win this but Carolina has come back J from a 10point deficit and youre looking at the biggest reason why RJ Davis has just exploded hes got 11 points hes three of five from three and those last two he hit were big ones marel well defended by Ryan okell misses the three Bott the rebound and now Carolina looking for its first lead of the game oconnell just got a little pin in screen from DJ Burns he was wide open for that three bot coming out to set a ball screen it looks like now goes to the bucket and and morcel reaches in and fouls him thats why you want to put DJ burns into ball screens Marcels got to come over and pick up that roll and he picked it up reaching instead of putting his body in the way as the tag guy and just bumping Armando Bott to stop his progress but DJ Burns has to stay with the ball so Casey morcel comes over from the weak side there were two on the weak side for North Carolina Ingram guarded by diara good match up here off the foot of Ingram he Dives to the floor to keep keep it and gets tied up by Mar Morel and the possession arrow will give that over to the Wolfpack returnc Taylor who is just in for a little bit again hell sit and DJ horn back in ALA state but just the fact that he can gut it out he gutted it out last night against Virginia after he injured that ankle ly stay personified by Taylor giving everything they have in this tournament conell trying to get something started finds horn the shot clocks inside 10 Crow around DJ Burns now hell take the 16footer short the of the tip Davis runs it down for the heels a touch for bacock little shovel pass Davis not this time tip back out though ped out by padone Davis driving on diara and we head to the free throw line so good at getting past the defender diara he had an advantage there but put the brakes on just a little bit so diara had to go over his back to try to get that block shot and picked up the Applause foul 89 on the season from the line weve been kind of updating you uh here and there as he continues to climb up the scoring charts started the year at 48 started the tournament at 10th on Carolinas alltime list came into this game eight and Jay tonight hes passed the great Charlie Scott and has moved into seven on Carolinas alltime score RJ Davis has just had an incredible career capped off by this year where hes not only led the ACC in scoring I think his leadership for this Carolina team has been Exemplar on and off the floor Carolina on top for the first time tonight Taylors coming right back in Taylor was terrific in the last game against North Carolina he had 22 points in that game he and Horn combined for 42 70 run T Applause heels and four guards around DJ Burns right now for State boy burns look like he lost it and almost kind of volleyball tapped it up into the bucket his footwork is fantastic it doesnt look like a guy that size should be able to move like he moves six points for burns tied to 30 but North Carolinas gone away from the double team theyre going to go oneonone in the post thats just a two but if hes picking youart for multiple threes thats where the problem comes in Davis another step back fre not this time burns the rebound under four to go in the first half horn another floater and another basket its really up to Armando Bott to step up there he kept ret reading toward the basket aot walks into a jumper and ties the game hes got six smart shot by Armando bot coming down as the trailer DJ Burns right in the middle of the lane he wasnt going to get out there he might as well take it cuz he can make that shot as he just proved a good defense to stop that drive by RJ Davis burns into the paint Bott shuts him down tremble helpful as he was coming by to reach in shot clock running down Taylor slips Burns for three oh Applause boy his first threepointer of the season is there anything he cant do out there and he had to take it and he knew he had to take it but he hit it burns started his career out at Tennessee and then transferred to win where he played for Pat Kelsey whos now the head coach of Charleston headed back to the NCAA tournament for the second consecutive year tremble the runner short the follow no but a foul how quick was Trimble to that second jump DJ Burns showing all of his skills Jay here tonight the body of an offensive lineman maybe two and the footwork of a ballerina goes to that left hand inside and then with the shot clock going down he knocks down his first three of the year has 13 points in this first half hes six of 10 from the field his counterpart RJ Davis 13 points hes three of six from three but North Carolina state is shooting 58 in this first half and I think Hubert Davis is going to be asking his team at halftime to make things more difficult on DJ horn and NC State one thing again North Carolinas only got two team fouls its not the only indication but its an indication that theyre not getting as physical on the defensive end as Hubert Davis would Applause like 3534 NC State here with two and 1 half to go in the first Carolines LED this game for 15 seconds thats it states led by as many as 10 little horn set two at the elbows two in the corners good help but open is Burns and hes got two more 11 points and five assists for DJ Burns tonight well that was overh helped by armanda he cant stay on the ball that long Carolina is scoring quickly in transition they actually have its 12 to2 in transition points for North Carolina you know what else is different about this Burns has played 15 out of 18 minutes usually hes kind of 10 to 12 and a half and middle Brooks is like 8 to 10 but has been leing Burns in there hes been playing great tonight fif game in his many nights for the wol pack as weve got another foul going against State well he didnt complete the play but smart move by Harrison Ingram to take that ball to the basket draw that foul and theres something going on with Armando Bott slowly and gingerly making his way back onto the court after the third foul on DJ horn thats big and it looked like Harrison Ingram knew exactly what he was doing going right at DJ horn and putting him in a position to foul or to back off in transition Harrison whatever it is Bod trying to walk it off Harrison Ingram the transfer from Stanford whos had such a great year for Carolina horn will Applause and Ernest Ross is into the game for the first time as again due to foul trouble and trying to monitor Taylors minutes Kevin Pets rotation j a little bit different here tonight different players are going to have to come in Off the Bench and provide quality minutes this is Rosss first appearance in the tournament has not played in any of the previous four games North Carolina going to go with some full court pressure try to Rapture things up on NC State crimble on oconnell crimble is a great Applause defender Taylor with Davis on him now burns with Bott on him going to work again and the foul called on bacup hes first a hard foul to get called on you kind of going what do you want me to do here you know the offense is dislodging the defense and and the clear out here comes the double good recovery by North Carolina Taylor tough shot rebound Withers Carolina looking for the lead and for the most part Carolina has limited NCC state to one shot neither teams done a much of any in the offensive class States got one Carolinas got two Trimble open missed the three and Morel holding his ground well to get the Applause rebound NC State could have gone for a two for one there but they just dont want to rush anything right now with DJ horn on the bench with those three fouls and again its Burns and again the double good pass and another assist for burns the bucket for Ross and state backs up is back on top Ross just made a cut from the left side of the floor to the right and made himself available to an excellent passer DJ Music Applause bur the buzzer beater that moment when time stands still our Collective breath held as the ball hovers Above the Rim but almost a third of of those shots were set up by a passer who made the Smart Choice throwing an assist takes trust IQ and total confidence in your decision and the greatest one my pastor lner in 92 wasnt too bad continent the Smart Choice en tires coming up later tonight at 1130 Eastern Time to be specific that nothing but net crew will have a complete breakdown of tonights Championship action that comes you a post game as a champion will be crowned here tonight inside Capital One arena in Washington DC will it be RJ Davis and the Tar Heels will it be Michael oconnell and the Wolf Pack how about Ernest Ross playing for the first time in the tournament that basket that he just scored Jay thats his second field goal of the Season he had only played 46 minutes all year coming into this game tonight know it came at the right time he made a really good cut to make himself available to Applause Burns Carolina if they get a score here can tie or take the lead but the second half for North Carolina I think Hubert Davis wants to see a different defensive team than he saw in the first the do to Davis Davis toyan gets it off and hit it for mat briyan bangs home a three at the end of the first half sending Carolina into the locker room with a onepoint lead how about the shop fake by cor M Ryan when playing defense theyve been to the line just one time so we need to make them feel us and get the physicality up all right J thank you amazing uh that States only been to the line one for two just two free throw attempts and amazing how few offensive rebounds theyre hip in in this game as well either end kdo no and Bott just got called for a foul thatll be number two on Armando bacot well kadoo had that right hand drive kept it in one hand tried to Loft it up the top of the backboard above the square just couldnt get it to go how about Burns playing over 16 minutes in the first half Bop playing over 177 and theyre going at it again Bo is hes skilled yeah hes big but dont let that take away from the fact that he is extremely skilled as well but North Carolina deciding to guard him oneonone in the post because those are tough twos see they dont want him passing out for open threes oh a steel by B Ingram a corner three oh and what a mistake there by state an unforced erir a turnover that just hands three points to Carolina Music Applause horn well defended by kdo goes at him again and draws the foul good job on that second effort now watch this steal by Armando Bott diara just a lazy pass trying to get it to Michael oconnell and Bott takes it away it leads to a wide open three and DJ Burns isnt going to be able to cover that distance to put any pressure on Harrison Ingram and burns going oneonone in the post hes got a fabulous touch but I think Hubert Davis is willing to take that tough two wear him out a little bit rather than have him passing it around getting open threes horn at the line for State late free throws on Thursday to seal the win of auk and kind of lock down the victory in overtime against Virginia last night by making all four free throws that he had better than 18 points per game in conference play this year fourth in the league DJ horn guarding corack Ryan right now I think North Carolina needs to go at him wherever they can make him guard playing with three Kau driving again cant hit it again di with a rebound he went right into the body of horn just couldnt draw the foul or complete the play but the action was good and was smart they Gott pushing burns out almost to the threepoint line he gets where he wants to get and he banks it home what are you going to do all for assistance Bott at the other end is fouled by Burns and that will be number two on him and thats how you attack DJ Burns you know one of the ways that you kind of defend against him is you make him guard on the other end put him in B screen actions make him guard in the post put him in a position to foul but Armando Bott is a big strong guy using his leverage but muhamed diar just steps in there actually sets a little screen to pick him off and make it a little bit easier for DJ Burns to get to that left hand Bott misses the first hes shooting a career best 78 from the line this year Burns Out scoring Bott 15 to8 Bott out rebounding burns look at the assist tot thats thats part of it as well some of those are probably for three so between scoring and assist at minimum Burns has been involved in 27 points in this game well hes touched the ball just about every time down and rightfully so hes making things happen I wonder what hes going to do here Dad good pass the kick to oconnell contested Baseline jumper rebound Ingram nice recovery by RJ Davis to take away that three and they dont stop Davis in transition he got a clean look doesnt miss many of those does he here they go Applause again and he hits again state by three as Burns is kind of having his way right now with a bot down on the Block extraordinary that touch with that size this is what he did to Duke he wound up with 27 points but Duke played him oneonone in the post to shut everybody else down Burns goes down they play on in Bott banks at home boy these are two really good really big really physical guys battling in this game yeah the mop guy is down at the other end thats a pretty wide SWOT hes having to deal with down there horn draws the foul Applause now DJ Burns this is a back down the likes of which you dont see very often you know he reminds me of Josh Smith played at UCLA then transferred to Georgetown same kind of player and theres a little flop right there the led to the easy basket for Armando bov each guyss played big minutes each guys got two fouls and DJ horn getting ready to go to the free throw line for two hes tying his shoes I think hes just buying a little bit of time to get some rest smart five games in 5 days is extraordinary I you cant understate or overstate excuse me you cant overstate the difficulty of this for NC State and yet they are giving maximum effort its really impressive to watch and again the only other school that has ever won five in five days to win a conference Championship the Kemba Walker Le Yukon Huskies back in 2011 even a little thing like Carolina played at 700 last night State played at 930 plus its their fifth game in F five Applause days Davis trying to get free morcel trying to stay with them and doing a really good job look at this defense against one of the best offensive players in the country and then a rejection horn and a foul but how about Casey morels defense on RJ Davis Casey Morel is the best on ball defender on this NC State roster and you saw why there he started his career at Virginia but staying in front of someone as quick as RJ Davis he made it looky easy it is not and it was a multiple effort defensive exchange that finished up with a block shot that started transition that ultimately got DJ horn to the free throw line what a great sequence for Casey morcel 5e senior two years in Virginia three in Raleigh four in the Miss and a couple of Subs now for Carolina Ryan sits with three and this little chess match between Hubert Davis and Kevin Pats continues Burns went out now Bott goes out get him some rest in advance of the under 16 timeout as Applause well state by four Harrison Ingram needs to get more involved on the offensive end be more of a threat for North Applause Carolina Davis running around a couple of screens got free for a moment Morel recovers beautifully and Good Help by Ben Middlebrooks and that is a block called on okell you can see where hes looking he wants to see a Applause replay Jen P well hes a primary Defender there and those are the charge calls that shouldnt have changed from last year but seemingly they have but the the change in the charge block r on secondary Defenders Not only was good it was great Ingram to the free throw line diara forced him into a tough shot and comes down with a rebound kind of one of the unsung heroes of this tournament for NC State is Mohamad Di has been spectacular on the glass at a 16 rebound performance at a 14 and a 12 and hes got seven T night Morel the turn around and its back to a sixpoint Advantage for the 10 SE where is this energy coming from for NC State Davis steps in and buries it well you take a gamble which Casey Morel did to shoot the Gap try to get a steal and RJ Davis Burns it but it was a two he had to step inside the threepoint line to get that shot casy morcel by the way Jay is the only player who has not come out of the game contact as he kind of swung his arms through looked like maybe an elbow got RJ Davis but they play off just the rip through Washington tries to save it and does Kau will try a three state will give him that the bodies are flying in this game Taylor went flying diara took a shot to the Head hes grimacing as o Carell walks it into the front Court RJ Davis still guarding Casey morcel morcel is bigger A Little Bit Stronger middle Brooks not an outside shooter now Taylor OK Connell to step in draws the foul all made by the shot fake that got kadoo off balance and opened up the middle how about the impact Casey morcel is having on this game and its been on both ends of the floor little turnaround jumper and that is not an easy shot thats over the left shoulder if State wins theyre in the NCAA tournament obviously they win this championship for the first time since 1987 they would become the first double digit seed to win an ACC tournament championship and just the second program ever to win five games in five days to win a conference tournament it is remarkable what they have done since Tuesday and incredible absolutely incredible boys Sydney low and derck whittenberg that was a pretty good high school back car what play for the great Morgan wooden at the MAA one of two and a fivepoint lead for the Wolfpack Carolina needs to get the ball inside more often they do right there Kido with an empy feed into Bott this a little side pick and roll two on the ball and Bott was wide open but Carolina shot a lot of Threes in this game and some guys that have been taking them are not the shooters you would expect RJ Davis on the bench right now for the Tar Heels DJ horn and DJ Burns both on the bench for the wolf pack B cot down with a rebound thats who eight really good defense there by Seth Trimble he is one heck of a Defender and switch out on just about anybody good do nice look Trimble passes up to three and Applause Lon diara finds it okell takes it whoa first kadu went flying then Middlebrooks went flying I think the Calls going against the Wolfpack well wait for the signal from Bill Applause Covington take down 23 Mohamed diara Mohamed diara of NC State the foul his Applause third meanwhile look whos Music back so far Burns tonight eight of 10 from the field 17 points and six assist trying to put DJ Barnes in some ball screen situations BAU goes the other way finds Trimble misses the three bot the rebound trying to go back up with it he lost it and weve got a held ball the possession arrow will give it back to the pack really good defense by NC State Converge on the ball all around Armando bot to knock it away and Seth tremble that shot from the right corner thats not the shot that North Carolina wants it was a pressured three from a guy who can make open ones but hes only made 10 threes on the season RJ Davis returns you saw Middlebrooks come in for state but its not for burns Di has got three so for the first time tonight we see Middlebrooks and burns on the floor together and guess who gets a Music touch a foul on bot his third you just cant bring your arm down there its hard to keep yourself from doing it but you just have to stay straight up when he goes up with it and try to bother it but once that right arm comes down automatic foul and thats already 16 fouls on Carolina here in in the second half as Burns goes to the line first time tonight 68 on the season and the problem Carolina has is botts really the only matchup they have for DJ Burns were not going to put Jaylen Washington on him theres just a strength difference and he might be able to put jayen Withers on him and he might be able to try by getting low with leverage but Bott is the natural matchup for DJ Burns and if its anybody other than C its almost an automatic double right you have to well if you double then you put yourself in a position middle Brooks pushed off Jaylen Withers but you put yourself in the position of of him hurting you as a passer Y and its a pick your poison exactly it sounds like its such an easy decision of course go double him but you go double DJ Burns hes such a good passer that he can find a guy like DJ horn or Jen Taylor somebody Michael oconnell and all of a sudden NC States getting open threes and youre trading two for three horn on the floor with three Bott on the floor with three and a whistle away from the ball and a foul on the wolf pack and Bill Covington is bringing DJ horn and cormack Ryan together is this on horn it should be I mean he he sort of grabbed he grabbed cormack Ryan he was he trying to come off a screen that was being set by RJ Davis along the Applause Baseline I mean thats a foul and it is on horn and its his fourth and that is a major loss for the Wolfpack no question about the Applause call so they will be without their leading score for a while Dr returns Middlebrook sits as well wonder what the officials wanted to talk to those two guys about tell corack Ryan dont cut Ryan just went down hes hurt and Michael oconnell was the closest Defender looking around saying I didnt I didnt do anything here looking up at the scoreboard but Ryan still shaking up and may have hit his head on the court we will have to get a look at a replay he was the inbounder and then came in to be able to go off one screen or another hes being guarded by Applause oconnell like whatever it was was before he hit the court yeah it didnt look like there was any sort of ankle issue they will take the media timeout now as Ryan continues to get medical attention well be back block watch Ryan trying to get around oconnell and just runs into his shoulder and thats where you as you can see the injury happened no foul on the play Ryan on the bench looks much better than he did just a few minutes ago hopefully hes okay and back to the action yeah thats called floppy action he could choose which side to come off of off of Baseline screens and oconnell was trying to send him out to the right but Ryan wanted to go to the left and thats when he caught his Applause shoulder morcel into Burns its B out thats got those three fouls burns up and in does it again he ultimately wants to get to that right shoulder and you have to bring a gang to stop him from getting there I mean botts a member of the conference all defensive team hes a very big strong guy and a very good Defender and DJ Burns is 9 for 11 tonight but if hes going to back you all the way down there theres nobody that can do anything about that and now a turnover and this is the decision do you bring a double to get the ball out of his hands but when hes such a good passer he can hurt you that way as well and maybe hurt you more Bon grunting him for a moment they cant get him the ball so Marcel will drive it Chase it down theara over to Applause help boy are they trapped down in that corner though itll stay with State 49 on the shot clock and mohammd Y saved that possession by making himself available to Applause Morel Burns playing the game with a smile on his face too he is having the time of his life this Applause week Morel for three Davis the rebound for the Tarheels back from kdo and Davis lays it in that is Carolina basketball how beautiful was that the give and go and another creative finish around the basket for RJ Davis wol packed by four everybody in the building knows whats Applause coming short this time Bott did a great job not letting him get too close to the bucket Davis draws the foul we have Bott to his left running the floor and DJ Burns trying to keep Applause up now this is the previous one where RJ Davis gives it up gets it right back and goes right around the NC State Defense just a beautiful finish to avoid the block shot by diar Carolina and now Davis this Carolinas alltime leader in free throw percentage is at the line for Applause two midd Brooks in for Burns and Cormac Ryan has returned for Carolina and you have to think when North Carolinas in the half court they want to go into Armando bot Applause one of two for Davis DJ horn is coming back here with four Applause fouls or does he have to be careful he just has to be Applause smart Im guessing they try to keep him as far away from RJ Davis as they can on the defensive end okell pulls up and hits RJ Davis went underneath that screen by Ben Middlebrooks and Michael oconnell made him pay okells been a different player in this tournament than he was all year long double figures in the first four Davis no great rebound by Ingram Ingram for three diara runs it down and saves it a lot of threepoint shots for North Carolina Bott never touched it pass the Midway point of the second half and the underdog the 10 seed with a fivepoint lead on the top seed in Carolina horn short out of bounds to the Applause Tarheels Michael oconnell now watch RJ Davis go underneath he actually got picked off but tried to Gap that ball screen and Michael Connell made him pay with that extra space to knock down that three he has been fantastic in this ACC tournament and as you just saw on your screen Kevin kej hes already starting to play offense defense with DJ Applause horn he grabbed him on the way by and said dont go too far sit in that first seat if we get the ball back youre going back in and they got the ball Applause back offensive foul on Jaylen Washington and horns right back into the game a little too aggressive on that Music screen the free up Cor M Ryan just leaned in to Jaden Taylor and got Applause called different game with no bot and no Burns right now NC State playing Five out horn sizing up Ryan and hits it what a big shot and hes got a huge smile on his face how much fun are these State players having this week Carolina needs to put him in some action go right at DJ horn Davis from the corner with the answer its a long two for Carolina and when he needs space just creates it for himself with that step back great Applause separation Morel to give and go okell has it taken away by kdo that steel save the layup now Davis to slow slow it down and set something up crossover floater yes got the switch Michael oconnell came out to get him he just crossed over went right by for the little floater RJ Davis whos taken over Carolinas offensive possessions the DJ Music horn offense defense substitutions the offense is working and then on the other end the step back that was a three initially counted as a two heres the floater as horns got 21 Burns 20 RJ Davis Now 23 they changed the two to a three Armando bacon 13 and N so you give Carolina the extra point after the review its now a threepoint game 6158 P Carolina bring full court pressure got the initial trap and now NC State breaks it and a great bounce pass but diara missed the reverse got it back and puts it in it looked like he got fouled as well but thats 10 rebounds now for Mohamad diara well he has been a machine just cleaning the glass throughout this entire tournament kdo gets inside little bit short and burns gathers it in for the wolf pack North Carolinas offense has been out of syn in the half part A give credit to NC States defense horn again playing with four fouls 21 points tonight for State takes a bump and Music hits what a sensational game he is having oh they were icing that side action Applause Music and DJ horn just gets all the way to the bucket and finishes diara first goes to the other side of the basket but gets his own rebound I like he got fouled there but still puts it in and DJ horn just getting between Defenders split as DJ horn finishes this play Casey Morel looks to me like hes cramping up there and who could blame him after five games in five days but he had to leave the floor to go into the hallway and that looks suspiciously like a cramp and he is still there so at the moment theyre without Morel Taylors in the game with a bad ankle horns in the game with four fouls yet NC State is up by eight can they just find enough bodies to play the last seven minutes at the level they will need to to win this Applause game he needs to take oconnell down in the post Harrison Ingrams got okell on give it to him and let him back him down Taylor on Davis now Ingram is doing that theres the help from diara to swat it out of bounds Carolina ball with five on the shot clock oh what terrific help defense by Mohamad diara right under the basket comes over gets vertical and knocks the ball away with his left hand Big Applause Time Again State not only playing for an ACC tournament championship they need to win this game to get into the NCAA tournament one would assume Bott Banks it in to make it a sixpoint game and here comes Morel jogging back to the bench a good play by Carolina they got RJ Davis on the run and then Armando bot could face up and just take DJ Burns off the dribble horn fouled by Ingram thats already nine fouls on Carolina so its one and one for horn and any further fouls will be two just ran a little Iverson screen over those two screeners at the elbows and there was a an open Lane to the basket with a rip through for a lefthanded drive and Ingram just reached in and fouled so youve seen a lot of State you had them a couple of weeks ago in a regular season game why are they playing at this level now they lost their last four coming into the tournament why are they playing at such a high level right now well remember who they played remember they had a Saturday at North Carolina and then they had to turn around and play Duke on a Monday then they had Pittsburgh at Pittsburgh they had a really difficult schedule in a very short time frame but theyre just in a great Rhythm now they got some momentum going beating Louisville and Syracuse and then that big upset of Duke and then Virginia in overtime last night another tear drop for RJ Davis its a fiveo point game and North Carolina has to make a defensive stand and you have to think that NC State wants to go inside the DJ Burns let him go against Withers folks starting to stand in the building wearing both blue and red what a pass diara gathers blocked from behind by bacock good recovery by bacock tried to help out on burns and burns made a great pass but negated tipped away and stolen Taylor Tiara runs it down this s NC State and you can tell Kevin Keats thought his team was losing their Poise a little bit just wants to calm him down 523 to go State NC State try to win a title for the first time since 1987 if its Carolina it would be the first time since 2016 really important for NC State to get good shots down the stretch you take good shots North Carolina less likely to be able to get out in transition where theyre extraordinarily dangerous and J Casey Morel back on the floor for the wolf pack that gives NC State their best individual defender on the perimeter back on the floor Applause stagger action to try to get it to Horn Ingram on it and Horn is say o get out of here DJ horn wanted to take Ingram but instead its into Burns hes doubled there goes the double theres the open three and morcel hits it and its state by eight thats the reason that doubling is so difficult on DJ Burns Davis rejected by diara and Horn is going to slow it down Morel not this time and that was not the shot even though he was open make North Carolina guard they caught oneonone with burns the spin the bank the tip and diars got it again how many times has Mohamad Di come up with the ball on the defensive BLS he has made so many big plays in this game not just on the glass but blocking shots has helped defense looking at the official say hey man I got hit in the head there do that not count nearing the 4minute mark horn is fouled this is truly remarkable fifth game in his many days the 10 seed dealing with guys who arent physically 100 And they just keep playing you have to think theyre operating on fumes right now fumes and emotion and just straight up want to but a terrific job by DJ Horn of refusing that ball screen going Baseline drawing the foul and hes a terrific free throw shooter right about 80 every opportunity that NC State gets to steal a moment you got the massage gun wow Le say hey I know he needs it he cant do that being told its a groin issue for Casey morcel and he is coming out right Music Applause now and now midd Brooks getting ready to come in and again this feels like with the four under four timeout coming soon you get DJ Burns a decent amount of rest here as much as you can theyre going to need days of rest after this made them both and its back to a 10point lead matching their biggest lead of the Applause night does Carolina have an answer bacock going to work on Middlebrooks and a foul as B count will be heading to the line when we come back State wolf pack had to play on Tuesday is the 10 seed and theyve made it all the way to Saturday against the top seed from Chapel Hill back and forth theyve gone but the wolf pack have led most of the night and trying to pull off an incredibly improbable Championship here tonight these two schools second and third all time in ACC tournament championships Duke leads with 22 Carolina 18 State 10 but as weve said on a few occasions none since 1987 they are up 10 with 351 to Applause Music go and Dan you have to think that if Armando bot makes this Carolinas going to come with full court pressure theyve got to do something to change the rhythm of this game they started to double team DJ Burns that has not worked out particularly well but I think they have to bring the pressure full Fort here it comes horn to oconnell and they get it Applause over is he going to back him down from that far out good pass into horn who lays it in assist number seven tonight for burns what a fabulous cut by DJ horn what an incredible week both of them have had Burns and Horn heres diara and it stays with State and Kevin Peach is probably saying something like take the time just a great cut from the weak side just a step and go all the way to the rim Harrison Ingram couldnt block Applause it and youre worried about DJ horn coming off for a handoff and he just cut the other way just a beautiful cut and a great read Carolina came all the way back had the lead briefly here in the second half and now States up 11 but a steal by Davis to get it down to nine under three to go and Hubert Davis wants to pull court pressure well thats old school the Trap by North Carolina shooting the Gap as an intercept its still in bounds but Carolinas got it now Davis Ingram Ryan for three and who else but diara with a rebound NC State B for him there oh and if youre Kevin Keats you just want to see Poise in good decision making right now back to Horn hell take a three and its out of bounds as horn and kdo got tangled up and DJ horn is still down seems to be all right its Carolina ball with 216 to Applause go for the Taylor sits horn is staying in the game hes been playing a long time with four fouls morcel has come back in and once again hes on RJ Davis right now its about to staying in front no threes and no fouls Ingram the step in Kau wont take the three Davis the pull up and a battle for the ball between Davis and morcel and its getting heated as the officials get in and try to break it Applause up two guys fighting for the ball and if its just a held ball it will stay with Carolina on the possession Applause arrow good job by Lee Cassel and BT Smith Bill cumington all getting in there quickly now Jay Burns has gone to the bench right now for State middle Brooks is in two minutes to Applause go Davis gets a clean look and it is North Carolina ball says BT Smith and were under two minutes so they can check it DJ horn has been everywhere Applause he covered a long distance to go after that ball Music will possession call The Possession Applause Carolina wow the call is Carolina when Ingram made that last desperate reach for it did he touch it does look like he did but theres theres not enough there to overturn it yeah agreed I mean it it kind of rolled off the hand we saw from the other angle that it didnt look like from that angle that Ingram touched it but I dont see how theres anything there to overturn the Applause call doesnt look like it but I agree with be 100 just not enough there to overturn and again the initial call is Carolina and BT Smith and I think this is great I mean he took an extra beat an extra pause before making the signal wanted to make sure that he called it the right way because the call on the floor can be obviously huge here if theres not enough to overturn it however its called is however it stays and its Carolina ball the is confirmed possession to North Carolina so theyre down nine theyve got the ball with a minute 51 to Applause go Ingram to windbound screen for the screener action well defended to keep it away from RJ Davis botts going to drive it and he is fouled by Applause Middlebrooks number three on him one and one coming for Bon right now NC States got to be thinking about inbounding the ball being strong with it and breaking pressure as Carolinas coming with it full Applause court a reminder Sports Center is coming up next here on ESPN and oh boy will they be talking about this one no matter how it is Applause two big makes for Applause B turned it over Davis for three got it back now Ryan is wide open in the corner and diara another rebound and a foul boy Carolina gets the turnover off the Bad pass from Michael okon at a wideopen three from RJ Davis just couldnt knock it down what a momentum play that would have been and Jay I believe they are going to go to the monitor to see if there was anything flagrant on the foul it looked like it was K on the Music foul under official R you can see Kido kind of trying to swing he was trying to tap the ball back out but he got a big piece of diara yeah it would be really it was a it was a pretty wild swing but I I think thats what he was trying to do is knock it back out but since there may have been contact around the head often times thatll result in an F1 to see what the officials their judgment is Applause and its going to stay as a common foul so it is two free throws for diara who has not been to the line tonight he is 13 rebounds now in this game he is a 62 free throw shooter on the Applause season makes the first Burns Out Middlebrooks back in so they want Middlebrooks on defense right now and burns on offense maker missed North Carolina wants to get the ball down for quickly just get a score it doesnt have to be a three two huge Maks for Mohamed Applause Music Applause diis a good help there by Middlebrooks that forced him further out on the floor Davis revers his Direction missed it okell the rebound and a foul what a big rebound by Michael OK and NC State can feel it something that has never happened in this league five games in five successive days incredible absolutely incredible they appeared to be down and out last night against Virginia in the last minute and a half of regulations somehow found a way Miracle Mike found a way thats right the guy at the free throw line bked home of three to force overtime as the Hall of Famer Roy Williams looks on here in Washington two more its an 11point lead Ryan got fouled and will shoot three and DJ horns out of the game thats his Fifth and can more s come back theyre running out of bodies well I know horn didnt want a foul here just got a piece of his arm just couldnt help himself and hes going to have to take a seat but Ill bet you sitting Downs going to feel good after after all this play and it does not look like Casey morcel is able to play Brion pass a junior from Reedsville North Carolina is going to come into the game what this I know weve said it a times what theyve done this week has been remarkable there just arent enough platitudes y so theyre without horn theyre without more cell what do you think Kevin Keats is saying to DJ horn right now hey next time we play five games in five days and you have four fouls dont reach in at the end do me a do me a favor would you remind me to talk to you about something tomorrow three for Applause Ryan they beat Louisville by nine they beat Syracuse by 18 beat Duke 7469 in the quarterfinals Thursday night the overtime win over Virginia and now a minute 11 away up by nine one more free throw with corack r right now its about inbounding the ball Applause cleanly o dangerous pass and okono gets fouled and hes going back to the free throw line Brant pass with that dangerous pass but got away with itth Carolina F haris two free throws the of the way for Music State pass is in his third year in the program its his 82nd game hes never started a game generally he plays a handful of minutes here and there he actually played a lot against Louisville but part of that was DJ horn didnt play so he got 22 minutes against Louisville but he is in for a big minute and eight right now to say the least and they just keep making their free throws well thats how you Sal the way a win and win a championship its that close Ingram for three tipped out to Davis hell take a three and deara with yet another rebound and hes fouled Applause again and now everybody wearing red in this Arena can really feel it there are more Carolina fans here than State fans but its the folks in red having the best time right now and they should what an effort by North Carolina State and not just tonight but this entire Applause week and Dan you know assuming they hang on this last 54 seconds who do you give MVP to theres so many deserving candidates one of thems right here at the foul line the r has been huge you could give it to Horn you could give it to Burns Brian has to hoist Davis the rebound and he draws the foul thats the last thing you want to do there is foul and stop the clock Carolina in all likelihood I mean I I dont even think I have to say it on all likel theyre one seed win or lose tonight right dont you think no question yeah but none of the guys on that bench have ever won an ACC tournament Championship hes won three Hubert Davis two is a player one as an assistant coach they came in this week really talking about wanting this title not wanting a onec they wanted this title but like four other programs this week they have run into a a team that is just on an unbelievable role right now in the it felt like a a Destinys Darlings type of thing and the shot last night by Michael oconnell Miracle Mike Bo a turnover here for NC state has stepped out of bounds thought he got bumped out of bounds he might have but you got to be strong at this point in the game youre not going to be given anything this last minute and a half probably feels like an eternity for Kevin Applause pach well you dont want to foul there pass called for the foul he just jumped right into the body got tangled up with the arms RJ Davis he wants to take away that three but you just lock and Trail and run him off the threepoint line if he gets a layup who cares and Davis of course almost automatic at the line its just the idea of stopping the clock and extending the game Applause thats his second Miss tonight five of Applause Music seven still a ninepoint Music game and a turnover diar is saying to okono come back come back to me diar couldnt get it to him and he threw it away well even if he doesnt come back to the ball take the 10second violation rather than throw it away like that at least more time comes off the clock that Applause way heres Davis now Kad now Ingram for three Middlebrook swats it out of bounds andc the call is NC State ball but theyre going to have a look at Applause it with 299 seconds to go that looked like it went off middle Applause books thats one of those tricky ones I mean Middlebrooks caused it to go out of bounds but he did graze a finger F on on the way out for 38 minutes of the game thats off middle Brook thats sort of the difficulty of Replay he you know rolled off his finger and they have confirmed the call itll stay with state any guard for North Carolina state that catches the ball should not give it up to a big guy in the back cour you when Michael oconnell catches the ball he cant give it to muhamad di keep it you stand there and let them fou you right thats one thing but you know you dont want to give it to a big guy and then all of a sudden you got to get open Applause again into pass back to Taylor a few more seconds come off the clock and now Jaden Taylor will head to the line Indianapolis native transfer from Butler going on a bum wheel hes really GED it out has he everybody has but especially Jaden Taylor yeah theyve got a guy with a bad ankle theyve got a guy with a sword grin theyve got a guy who fouled out theyve got a guy who hit his first three of the season tonight and they got a guy who scored only his second bucket of the entire season tonight its just crazy everything thats gone on and yet they are 25 seconds away from a championship youre rounding down now round yeah Im sorry weve had real rounding issues this week Applause America Davis cant get it to go middle Brooks The Rebound theyll foul him and now I think they can finally relax its been 37 years since this program won the ACC tournament Applause championship and they knew coming into this week that they had to win this T tournament to go to the NCAA tournament there would be no at large and Kevin Keats obviously feels a little more relaxed here come the WalkOns including his son KJ Keats well this is a an ACC tournament Championship that will never be forgotten historic he hey still knocked out of bounds steel Carolina ball 82 to Applause go coaches you better let those guys sleep in tomorrow they have had an unbelievable week Ingram for Applause three and that is going to do it a remarkable astounding week from the North Carolina State wolf pack and let the celebration begin in Applause car they earned every bit of Applause it and each guy each shot we show Jay tells a different story each guy contributed in a different way and it was enough to take home a TR the combination of elation and exhaustion and what had to be an exhausting week but one that none of us will ever forget just extraordinary
