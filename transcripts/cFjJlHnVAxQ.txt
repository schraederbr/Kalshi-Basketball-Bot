usually a sellout of over 14000 tonight may not be the case with students on the break for the holidays so the tip is controlled by the huskys Chris Dy at the top of the arc Dy a transfer from Notre Dame and John look for him to be able to operate there at the top as we just saw he likes to distribute the basketball and share it uh and he keeps balance to this North Eastern offense and Jared Turner hit the three he is their top threepoint shooter one of the best threepoint Shooters in the Colonial Athletic Association reys beakman one of the best guards in the country gets it back on the deflection and the drive is Off the Mark here come the Huskies the Huskies will really look to run and push the basketball uh although this year theyre looking to play a little bit more half court basketball than what they have in the past that lineup led by Dy and sakota sakota number nine in Black hes a Harvard transfer was a captain for the crimson and Tommy aner last year steal by beatman no surprise there thats one of the Hallmarks of his game the Virginia lineup with beakman ro McNeely Dunn and Groves basically they play five guards it could put Groves at forward but what what they do they really spaced the floor extremely well uh as you see beatman and thats thats something hes really worked on with his game he went to some NBA tryouts last year and stepping up and knocking down that midrange jump shotting and expanding his range yeah hes averaging 11 and a half points per game thats second on the team mide Troutman for three and hes got it so nor Eastern with two threes in the first 1 minute and 55 seconds the huskys averaging nine per game Virginia likes to run action with the ball screen where you can either uh pick and pop or you can try to come off the ball screen and then they have thre Man action on the weak Applause side with Eastern offensively what do they want to establish D he has the ball and he gets double on the Baseline thats their offense get the ball to Dy make other teams have to work to try to figure out how to stop him and he does a great job of either scoring or Distributing the basketball and an outstanding block by dun whos averaging two and a half blocks per game our Spotlight Player and he is a tenacious Defender well hes a big time athlete hes got a high motor and uh he plays it hard at both ends of the Court comes from an athletic family his brother Justin dun is a pitcher and the major leagues was a starup pitcher at Boston College the three by sakota Off the Mark and here comes Virginia so the first three minutes Perry a feeling out process for the Cavs offense well you I I talked to coach Bennett about his if the team was playing the way that he wanted them to play and one of the things he said he said we know how we want to play and this Virginia team has always had this identity theyre not going to play any faster than what they want to but they do such a great job of executing great pass by Dy on the Baseline and the bump but a good look by Dy who found PID as Groves is called for the foul but Dy this is what makes him a tough matchup well he does because he shares the basketball whenever you get a post guy that not only can can score from the elbows but all in the low post but also can pass it it makes it awful difficult to guard and hes a veteran player like you said he played at Notre Dame hes got a lot of experience with him hes a graduate student Joe Pon at the line 9 for 15 from the foul line hes missed a few games due to a injury nor Eastern as a team shooting 75 for Bill Cohen from the foul line you know bill for years has run a lot of flex action as he came out of Al Skinner at Boston College where they ran that a lot and now hes opened up the floor a little bit more so he can get better spacing with this team Isaac nearly number 11 in white for Virginia has been a redot shootter 12 of 16 from threes in his last two games second ranked threepoint shooter in the nation at 58 well MC is really a key for this Virginia team because they need him and Groves also to catch and shoot and knock down jump shot which then opens up driving lanes for beakman and makes them a lot more effective huskys off to a good start the put back by Dy and a sixpoint Northeastern lead how if you attribute the slug Offensive start to the 11day layoff for Virginia well I I dont know if its that or just the the this Virginia team is not a physical low poost defensive team and Ds taking advantage of it right there by putting that body on people and scoring at The Music Rim welcome to college game day built by the Home Depot what a smooth hand off theyre taking that to the house nice Music technique and football snacks the perfect Music Saturday

said thats what I attribute a lot of this to and perseverance thats what I attribute a lot of this to he says hes learned a lot since he came from BC as a longtime assistant under Al Skinner but with those 181 conference wins Perry second all time in the Colonial Athletic Association well one of the things that bill has not taking credit for he can always recognize talent I mean they did a great job at BC hes done a great job at nor Eastern and to have more wins than the great uh Jim coun is is something special Lake Buchanan in the ball game for Virginia heres a deep three Off the Mark for Andrew roie who shoots 35 from distance so the scoring drought is now 316 for the Cavs yeah it it seems like right now Virginia is operating about a foot further out than what they normally like operate they like to send a lot of curls and ball screens and operate around the elbows and a little bit closer than what theyve been operating and on the other hand it looks like nor Eastern is really doing a good job getting the ball in the paint area weakness for Virginia has been rebounding offensive rebounding theyre giving up 13 per game and nor Eastern already has five well yeah the the really good Virginia teams their post guys were a lot more physical than what folks real I or recognize cuz they would put bodies on you and they would get Guys open and they bang this front line is not quite as physical in their development as uh the other Virginia teams have been and thats why youre saying all as times its almost like theyre playing with four guards out there because they are on the perimeter so much pman to McNeely hell take the 25footer off the back iron and the rebound For a Moment by Dum but then punched away North Eastern on the break Pon takes it and its a go so its an eightpoint Huskies lead Joe PID credited with the basket yeah yeah they have bu Canan in there uh hes really a big strong physical guy and uh that looked like it was done that got his hand on that one but again the physicality on that front line is something that has plagued Virginia so far in this early part of the Season theyll take a look at that during the next break to make sure it was a goalen violation but heres Andrew roie last years freshman of the year in the summit League good drive by beatman who gets the rebound for the putb that ends the scoring drve of over four and 1 half minutes its hard to get your defense set the way you want when when youre not scoring the basketball cuz a lot of times and so far this Northeastern team has been in a lot of transition and again being able to attack the basket you just dont see people attack the rim like that against this Virginia Defense that was MSI Troutman who has five points so it looks like a part of their game plan you mentioned it Perry is them attacking and heres a steal by the Huskies but taken back by Buchanan an uneven start for 22nd rank Virginia good pass though by Buchan into a Cy McNeely and we have contact and a foul normally when Virginia gets in starts like this they become even more determined and patient to get the ball where they want which is normally in the pain area or get your defense to have to change sides of the floor and they dont normally attack or shoot the ball on the same start that side of the floor that they initiate from MC nes rough start continues after the foul was on Rashad King of the huskys is Applause Music Applause first Troutman good bounce pass and the reverse Lane boy that was pretty ball Movement by nor Eastern it really was bman got beat that time on a back cut and you really dont ever see him get beat on a back cut cuz hes such a good Defender how Woods the beneficiary of the pass you see right there beatman kind of gets caught ball watching and he gets beat on the back cut normally hes off and hes on hes on the triangle so he can see ball and and man and all Tony can do is kind of blink it that cuz thats just not their normal defensive style you know I will tell you this sometimes as a coach you dont know what youre going to deal with coming out of exams uh guys have different approaches to it and sometimes your team comes out and theyre anxious to play and theyre flying all over the place and sometimes they come out a little mentally fatigued beatman from the elbow Virginia has made one of its last nine shots shots theyre only shooting 18 as a team they shoot 46 what a nice Cut Again by the huskys man theyre finding the open man at will yeah Virginias not doing a very good job collapsing to the ball right now normally you want to stay at the line of the ball wherever the the ball is all the Defenders are at the line of the ball so therefore nobody can back cut you and get to the rim easily you can in the jump hook and gets the hometown roll this young man is is going to be a factor for Virginia hes physically hes strong he can pass the basketball but he also can finish right hand left hand around the basket and the son of a coach Steel by Virginia good hands and Elijah gertrud a freshman guard finds beatman on the the cut pan and rugged in the post and a foul so Joe pigon one of the many huskies shining in the early going as theyre shooting 50 he has four of their 16 points and nor Easterns off to a good start in Music Charlottesville you know it never bothered me that Michigan didnt have a mascot but after living in this house for so long you start to feel a little different this is going to be so fun this is just going to be the best seeing these guys and the way they interact I started to feel a

seasoning just right Im telling you holiday that flavor is always popping celebrate the Christmas season together with ChickfilA catering and a new animated Adventure on Evergreen hillscom nor Easterns offense has been impressive Perry Clark in the early going well it has been because theyve been able to attack the basket there you see a back cut right there for a layup there you to rotation they dont drop to the line of the ball they get it uh nor Eastern is able to get another layup uh normally the famous packline defense means that the defense is at the line of the ball so no ones able to get behind it and so far north eastern has found a way to get behind Virginias defense foul before the break was on metf with Buchanan at the Applause line not a pretty attempt by Blake Buchanan those are ones you you want to forget quickly yeah and as a coach I mean and this and this is what uh you know coach Bennett does so well hes always encouraging his guys and he keeps it on a positive note and theyre able to respond and play the way that they practice and the way this Virginia program is developed to be able to play you know part of being a coach John is is inspiring and sometimes when youre a little flat and youre youre a little bit out of sync you got to find a button to push that will get the guys to kind of line up and focus and and lock in and play together and a turnover for nor Eastern you play Virginia you have to expect many turnovers five anything easy but today North Eastern has found a way to get some easy baskets which has been surprising step back was a beauty buried by Bond so hes off the schneide Leon Bond averaging seven points shooting 57 and thats a balanced offense theyre not explosive offensively 68 points per game 46 from the field 39 on threes but they are balanced they are and and Bon does a great job with his athleticism and uh he helped them on the glass he and done give them two really good athletic guys to play on the wings mcne still scoreless for the Cavs averaging 13 points thats first on the club screen by Buchanan good take and that layup by Gerards off the line here comes nor Eastern Dy hands it off to Troutman who has five good defense by Virginia how about Joe PID he looks skilled hes coming back from an injury but man no worse for the wear I take that was a big time move by Pon but whats more impressive of Northeastern not settling because Virginia made a couple really good checks on drive but they stayed but nor Eastern stayed patient and got the shot that they wanted that was off the line again for the Cavs and a quick three by the Huskies Way Off the Mark too quick for your liking Perry especially in Charlottesville I think you got to come down I think you have to get high quality shots because thats the type of shots Virginias going to get they just happened to miss that one uh I think that was bond that missed that one but those are the type of shots Virginia normally works hard to get so you have to match that that with high quality shots Virginias doing a better job now keeping the ball out of the paint Troutman top of the arc missed on the three nor e is not shy theyre two for nine from threepoint range Virginias 0 for three McNeely with his first two points of the ball game they really need to get that young man going hes got really big time range and when hes knocking down jump shots like that it just opens up so many other scoring opportunities for this Virginia team and shooting numbers are staggering I mentioned earlier at 58 from three its second in the nation behind Reed Shepard of Kentucky and heres a steal by the Cavs gertrud had a nice night against NC Central with career high 13 Dy the rebound for the h a lot of times Virginia is able to get easy looks in their transition because they like to have the bigs come up and set like a drag screen on the ball handler so he can get downhill Isaac McNeely as Perry mentioned theyre going to need him to score in volumes and he has his first two of the game a sevenpoint lead for the Huskies of nor Eastern every year thousands of ath disappear in clutch moments due to Fallen hydration levels I used to go

and again you know coming off of the exams and all it just looks like defensively theyre a little bit out of syn and uh I think that that will come as they start to get a little bit more continuity and one of the things about coaches he knows what he wants from his team and so he can identify when things arent working right he knows exactly what buttons to push to fix it and and they get a layup perfect pass by beatman to a cutting Jake Rose the Oklahoma transfer thats Virginia basketball isnt it without question and uh you you know coach Bennett has been running this system so long thats one of the things with continuity and knowing your system when its not working you know what to do to fix it and its not a matter of a fishing Expedition you know exactly what buttons to push n2 Run for the Cavs Groves cannot hit but hell go to the line Jake Groves has been a nomad two years at Eastern Washington two years at Oklahoma he took a long drive to Charlottesville this summer and hes loving life with the Virginia Cavaliers with passes like that its not coincidences that coming out of the timeout the last two passes have been the post guys rolling in the paint and Virginia is really looking now to attack that paint instead of settling for threes Good Friday night mens basketball double her coming your way beginning at 6 PJ Hall number 13 Clemson hosting Queens University then Marcus Burton and Notre Dame host the Maris red foxes should be a terrific evening of Hoops right here on accn and the ESPN app Clemson its first loss of the Season earlier today against Memphis who will by the way will play against Virginia on Tuesday night I just think its great these teams are play in such high caliber games early in the season I just think it gets you better prepared for conference play it gives you more coaching points and it gets your guys ready for that long stretch which is January and February in college basketball huskies are cold three minute scoring drought for them well they havent been able to get any back Cuts Virginias taken away a lot of the back Cuts By by staying on the line of the ball and not extending so much number two in black is Glenn mclintoch hes coming off an upper body injury a guard for the Huskies so they expect to stabilize their bench and another turnover for nor Eastern they are piling up nine turnovers for the Huskies whenever you dont allow the ball to get into the paint defensively you wind up being able to be pretty Applause Successful dve by beatman and the blow by by Reese beatman the wooden award candidate he is so quick with the basketball hes a lot quicker than what people think offensively and a lot more athletic how about the quick Hands by gerud so Virginia seizing momentum after the 4minute scoring drown and seven turnovers in the last 6 and A2 minutes by Northeastern Virginia is starting to play classic Cavaliers basketball well you know dun and Bon are two guys that athletically step up and I think they changed the type of Team Virginia uh really is because of their athleticism and their ability to finish and Elijah uh Gertrude also gives some quickness and Applause athleticism heres this weeks featured womens college basketball matchup on accn in the ESPN tomorrow number 14 Notre Dame they won seven straight they square off against Purdue at the joy Center our coverage begins at noon Eastern dont miss a moment of outstanding womens basketball on accn after the foul was on pigon Gertrude cannot give Virginia the lead would have been its first lead of the game you see the def the defensively Virginias picked up with the intensity nor Eastern is initiating their offense a lot further out than when they did in the first 3 four minutes of the game how about the rebounding Edge Perry plus 12 for Northeastern P planked it on the blaze Baseline yeah thats something definitely Virginia is going to have to really work on and straighten up but again you see Virginia aggressively going to the basket and uh again you know when when you go with certain lineups with d and ger true and those guys really attack the basket it gives this Virginia team a different look I thought earlier in this in the game they were much too perimeter oriented and now theyre just putting their heads down theyre getting the ball in the paint theres your first lead of the game for the Cavs the lay in by gerud in the threepoint play after the foul was on mide Troutman is first a 162 Virginia run they were tenative on both ends of the floor Perry and maybe that was an attribute coming off the extended exam break you know and sometimes guys come out and they think that they can win easy and they want to do the easy stuff to help them win and obviously that didnt work early for Virginia now theyre getting into their grind where theyre defending theyre keeping the ball out of the paint theyre offensively theyre attacking the basket they getting to the foul line and uh you know they theyre going to have to work for this win the jumpers stemming the tide for the Huskies good shot there by Lucas seot to the Harvard transfer hes putting up 12 points per game second on the team behind Chris Applause Dy take by Gro but an offensive foul good defense by nor Eastern as we will take a quick timeout and a good one brewing in Charlottesville between the in the catch Arbys big cheesy bacon

football snaps the perfect Music Saturday theres a reason why Virginias Rees peakman was a preseason all ACC selection Perry Clark I tell you with his ability to share the B basketball create for other people and when his time comes and he needs to finish hes got the ability to finish you know he surrounded by some really good Shooters he recognizes and keeps them involved but this guy is really special in his ability to lead offensively and defensively is really really important and I just cant help to think that it looked like Virginia coming out in this game thought they wanted to win and thought they could win easy without doing the tough stuff and coach Bennett pulled them together and said you know weve got to play Virginia basketball which is defend which is move the basketball attack the basket and they started to do that and they put themselves in a much better position and Virginias Force Northeastern to be flustered on the offensive end the huskys five turnovers in the last 5 minutes and 18 seconds only two field goals in the last8 minutes heres Turner though helping the cause his second triple of the night Turner can heat up in a hurry for nor Eastern well he can and again I think this Northeastern team really does a good job of space in the floor and theyve got some guys that can shoot the basketball but again getting the ball in the paint if you want success keep the ball out of the paint and offensively get the ball in the paint it seems like its just so simple but its not quite that easy that foul was on Turner who voiced his opposition to no avail with Blake Buchanan at the line this young man is going to be really important to Virginia buan as the season gets on because you know hes got the physical makeup to give him some size on the glass hes versatile enough where he can step away from the basket and score acpm with Mark Packer and Taylor tan bomb weekdays from Mark Charlotte studio in his basement at four Eastern theyll continue talking college football and have a wi is from around the conference right here on accn and the ESPN app were going to take a trip inside your basement sometime Perry Clark what do you think I well I dont have a basement but Mark but Mark Packer he does a tremendous job hes really a knowledgeable basketball guy as well as all sports but thats a very funny show a lot of times when hes in there he used to have his dog and everything it it was very interesting but he comes from a great family yes he does and that is a entertaining show each weekday but Reese pman trying to be entertaining for Virginia finding Isaac Applause Music McNeely too much dribbling yeah too much dribbling Virginias known for moving the ball on the pass and thats just a little too much dribbling for the way they normally play give nor the Eastern Credit I mean theyve not shied away you know they they got off to a fast start now one of the things theyre doing really well is transitioning uh their transition offense has been really good today that foul was on roie after the N1 opportunity for Harold Woods Woods had a career high 21 points for the huskies against no against Princeton rather on November Applause 25th you know you talk about roie Ros one of those guys I think that again is once he get in the league play is going to be really important for this Virginia team hes very crafty hes a good shooter hes a good basketball player and can create a lot of Separation offensively uh the way Virginia likes to run their offense another misfire of the rebound to Music Dy Music second meeting between these two schools the last one in 1989 won by Virginia good dribble by Dy and the crafty Lane by Dy and nor Eastern lead to seven well I think you know a lot of times Virginia will double the post but where Ds getting the ball from is not a normal double situation as beatman goes in there and scores do you want to see more of that for beakman the oh without question uh uh and and I think that um hes capable of doing that and thats the Virginia offense right there but I think more important defensively this Virginia team needs to tighten up and take away some of these opportunities that nor Eastern is getting Chris Dy with four points swings it corner and the three goes see right now North Eastern Joe PID is feeling and he has nine points and we will take a 30C timeout eightpoint Northeastern lead on acc Music Network welcome to college game day built by the Home Depot what a smooth handoff theyre taking that to the house nice technique and football snaps the perfect Music Saturday so Chris Dy has led nor Eastern to an offensive Renaissance in the first half period I tell you what he has made life awful tough for Virginia because if you dont double him hes been able to score at The Rim and when you go to double him he hes been able to find open guys and get them open looks and you know what you dont want to do is that one guy be able to dominate the game and right now Dy has dominated the game offensively for nor Eastern rebounding numbers 21 for nor Eastern 114 Virginia thats the one area weakness you want to pinpoint something against Virginia its rebounding minus 24 rebounding against the opposition beatman the fade away and hes got it hes in double figures with 10 so re beatman has been a bright light theyre shooting 38 for the half yeah the the biggest difference in this game the way Virginia normally plays is defensively I mean where and its not the point total nor Eastern has but its how and where theyre getting their shots from called timeout and we will take another break Bill Cohen takes a timeout out north eastern up by Music 6 welcome to college game day built by the Home Depot what a smooth handoff theyre taking that to the house nice technique and football snacks the perfect Saturday Music with Terry Clark Im joh me to Perell fewest points nor Eastern has allowed in a half this year theyre four and six 24 points right now for the Cavs before that was against Old Dominion who had 35 Perry so a stifling defense for the Huskies well yes and a lot of it has to do I think with the fact that uh Virginia has not gotten the same amount of quality shots that they normally wind up getting in the first half inbounding to sakota with a shot clock off and a Reach In by pman sakota pretty clever with that basketball uh and protected it well that time beatman is going to continue to put pressure on on shooting foul sakota will inbound on the Applause sideline finds Applause Dy and the air ball in the three attempt not what they were looking for but a terrific half for North Eastern a surprise as Tony Bennetts Cavs have some work to do trailing at the half of the first three or what H we jined him a little bit but Im sure hell come out for a better second half were going to start to call it the Curry Clark jinx as Virginia starts with a different look after the first half break with Blake Buchanan in the lineup he did not start the game number zero in white so they go a little bit bigger for Tony Bennett theres Buchanan The Freshman yeah he hes got to play for him I mean he does so many things and you know the tapes that I saw I thought he was very very effective and what he did and I think youre seeing Virginia now a little bit more patience offensively uh to try to get the shot that they want its hard though John when you dont have a dominant low post player to get the defense to collapse uh the way that you want them to so that you can get wide openen threepoint shots the cut by Chris Dy the Notre Dame transfer lays it in Dy has six a high basketball I Q Tony Bennett says he was really impressed watching his tape a spin move by beatman who gets in the lane but its Northeastern ball yeah yeah again you see the back cut right there and Dy is able to lay the ball in again normally with against Virginia theres at least one or two guys in the paint to deter you from getting a a shot in the paint we havent seen that as much today as we normally do threepointer is good the huskys lead is up to 11 points yeah right right now this Virginia Defense is on roller skates I mean when when they extend they get back cut when they dont go out and pressure the ball they knock down threes and I just think they have to kind of settle in and guarding the basketball oneonone and then putting guys in the paint to make sure that they dont get back cut but they got to do a better job on the ball oh and a foul the first of the half against North Eastern but Lucas sakota good range for sakota and they expected him to contribute and he has this year averaging 11 points yeah I mean the scouting report on you cant really go underneath screens on him because hes a pretty good shooter but again once you get back cut a couple times you have a tendency to go underneath the screens McNeely had a rough first half and he misses the bunny here comes the Joe PID nine points and seven rebounds in the first half the Baseline Drive is Good from messai Troutman largest lead of the game for nor Eastern and a timeout Virginia boy the Huskies are energized

nor Eastern has this Virginia team on roller skates Applause defensively is it something that Virginia has to do defensively that theyre not they havent done their first nine games what whats been the key for them in their first nine as beatman rolls to the rack and picks up a foul well I think for tonight I think putting better ball pressure and containing the ball and having the help side in the paint so you dont give up layups or uncontested shots at The Rim I think they have to challenge nor Easter more at The Rim by not having guys extended right now it looks like for whatever reason theyre extending their defense which is creating back cuts and driving Lanes we got a great what you normally see no question we have a great Friday night mens basketball double header beginning at 6

one out of two at the line for bakman who leads Virginia with 11 points but the Steady Hand of the Huskies coming off a twopoint loss to Vermont before their 11day exam break heres Chris Dy and hes called for a fou much to his chin yeah I tell you what he really worked at that time and Im surprised that normally Virginia if the ball gets in that post low post area they will double it they call tenning it and and but theyre not doing it with him and they may have to do that a little bit but his ability to pass the basketball has made it difficult the 11 turnover for nor Eastern nice pass by ro and the lay in by Bond second bucket of the night for Bond Applause good look by roie yeah Bond and dun I keep repeating I mean need to be more assertive in the pain area and Ro and McNeely have to step up and start making some plays on the perimeter for this Virginia team either shooting the ball or passing the ball they have to step up now the Huskies seem a little bit flustered on the offensive end after another turnover well all those easy cuts when theyre not there then all of a sudden nor Eastern has to run some simus of offense and thats when they begin to get a little flustered Ro to beakman guarded by woods and he blows by him for the DK what an athletic move by Reese beatman thats that athleticism that I think a lot of people dont realize that Reese beakman has hes got a second gear there that is very very explosive beatman leads all scores with 13 hes averaging 11 and a Applause half Chris Dy the take against Jake Rose and out of bounds a pman trying to

nor Eastern going for its first win against the top 15 opponent since 2015 and their assisted coaches Brian McDonald mannyo and Joel Smith only division one school with three former players as fulltime assistants they all played for Bill Cohen how about that Perry well one of the things is they know they know the coaching staff they they know the program and a lot of times for assistance they can better explain what the head coach wants once youve been through it Jim beheim had that last year at Syracuse coach beheim has had so many tremendous assistant come through his program three by Turner is Off the Mark here comes beatman what does Virginia have to do to get back into this one further Im surprised that off of transition they havent run more drag screens to try to get beatman downhill and to be able to get some quick scores but I think what theyre doing right there is attacking and getting the ball in the paint they still have a lot of time left they dont have to do anything out of character they just have to do what they do better and they got to protect the rim seven to nothing run for Virginia scoring Dr of over two and A2 minutes for the Huskies Harold Woods rims out the three and the rebound toes beatman North Eastern led by as many as 13 theyre up six at the half Jake grow the Oklahoma transfer and Dy grabs the loose ball that shot right there has been a staple for Virginia in their transition for a long time getting the big to come and set that screen and then popping and getting a good look foul on Virginia but how about this Bond dunk he has six points and a good pass Again by roie again thats what you need you uh for B to come in and affect the game with his athleticism but you also need Ro as a good pass hes got to step up hes play 21 minutes and has two points and hes a much better scorer than that so a three by Turner he has three threepointers and five attempts and a counter by Virginia as they swap buckets sakota to Applause Dy they like to go to Dy right here on this isolation I think thats the perfect time to double him and make him give the ball up good Hustle by McNeely another guy that Virginia needs to increase his scoring output he has just two points in 23 minutes on one field goal and seven shots in a Northeastern substitution as Rashad King checks in for the Huskies but mcney red hot is last two games 12 for 16 from three but just two tonight and Virginia has not made a three theyre 0 for five from threepoint range and shooting the three has been so much a part of this Virginia team and program and they need that because when the guys are knocking down the three is it opens up the defense for driving Lanes Roy takes the three the rebound for Dy too quick for your liking Perry no because it came off the flow of the offense and you know you cant be gunshot I mean you have to do what you do and you just got to do it with conf confidence and and and aggressiveness Dy guarded by Groves King on the Baseline to for the pass out of bounds thats the Virginia Defense that most coaches come to know I mean you know if you drive the Baseline they just shut everything down and its no place to throw the basketball and they just kind of smother you there its the vaed packline defense three no good for Pon whos red hot in the first half with nine points now you scouted Virginia when you were assistant at South Carolina what did you learn that you have to get high quality shots you got to move the basketball because they do a great job of protecting the basket and uh you got to try to score some easy stuff out of transition theyre really good at what they do defensively and that man is really good at all areas of the game reys beatman a Onan stabilizer for Virginia youre not going to believe this but he was not heavily recruited uh you know and hes from Milwaukee although he played basketball in in Baton Rouge and the relationship with uh Tony Bennett and and and his history had played a lot in him coming to Virginia 17 for beatman to lead all scores on eight field goals and 13 attempts the rest of the team not so Applause Music good hes always been a leader I mean hes hes always been

with sales jewelry thats made to love and made to last love real sales with Perry Clark Im John Perell and some losses by ACC squads last week Miami stunned against Colorado then there was the Louisville lost to Arkansas State today Georgetown and Ed cooli Edge Notre Dame by four and Clemson loses its first to Memphis and oh by the way North Carolina is trailing Kentucky at the 15minute Mark 5543 those games are so important because yeah when it comes down to the NCAA tournament having people in your league with good nonconference wins it kind of helps everybody especially when you get into February but you got to do well in the non conference to kind of put that in your belt smothering defense by Northeastern but out of bounds good read by Joe pigon on the Baseline Perry yeah uh and again I I think that this Northeastern team defensively has come in and has come up with a way to play Virginia that is not allowing them to get some of the clean looks that they normally Music get Patman and the floater by Groves whos been quiet but he converts he has six points in 78 and thats one of those short roles that Virginia likes to do when they come off their post guys to get good looks in the foul line area and Groves is one of those guys that can do it again we talked about dun at the beginning of the game his ability to do that and thats been the missing Peach piece for Virginia getting those uh short rolls from their bigs and getting some of the flare action and the drag screen action for some of their perimeter guys he was just whistled for a foul thats the third on grov as you look at Elijah gertrud The Freshman guard grov to the bench for Tony Bennett a 133 Virginia run a game of runs nor Eastern had a 164 run then UVA ripped off a 162 then nor Eastern a 12 to4 now were a 133 in favor of the cats Chris Dy facing up Lake Buchanan back door and the layup is good by droutman see but that just doesnt normally happen where a guy loses his man and that and thats been happening to Virginia a couple of times uh gertrud lost his guy that time on the back cut uh youve got to be able to see both man and ball and not and play below your man so he cannot back cut you Virginia still does not have a threepoint of the row for seven after that Miss Pon cut off by Buchanan now doubled and it forced to turnover Batmans got it deep three Mr three mcne misses bridon the rebound anything you see from mcne the reason why hes off uh you getting his feet set that time he rushed at his I didnt I didnt think his feet were really set where he could get underneath the ball he shot it he shot a little flat but um just a lot of times its just shot preparation um yeah I you have to concentrate I think a little bit more when youre shooter especially when youre behind to shoot off the action that you practice and what they practice with McNeely is him coming off of pin Downs or Fades uh screens and getting looks that way foul on prison is third Nifty ball handling by Elijah gertrud who theyre high on he should have quite an impact in his career in Charlottesville as Chris Dy heads to the bench and its replaced by Johnson first run of the night for Johnson mcney and the block by Brion Troutman taking it to the hoop and a foul so the defense triggers the offense for North Eastern yes and again McNeils having a tough time of getting some separation and thats the kind of the footwork and utilizing the screens her with a foul is first beatman gets a breather for the Cavs the bond back in three by Turner no and here comes Elija gerre Virginia has not LED since it was 20 to 18 that was back Music in the early stages of the ball Applause Music Applause Music game first half mark at 432 heres a three by mcne hes got it first three of the game for the Cavs after eight misses Isaac mcneel Ed second in the nation in threepoint shooting and that time he got he got it in Rhythm he came off the pin down and thats where he normally gets his shots from when whenever youre struggling you want to go back to the shots that you practice and you normally are used to getting Troutman out standing pass and they convert Johnson with his first two Off the Bench but trevins played very well well he has and I think the fact that theyve been able hes taken advantage of back cutting hes taken advantage of being able to dribble drive and hes got some really good looks that normally you dont get against this defense gerud foul on extended and hell go to the line Troutman can call for the foul but Virginia finally off the schnide from distance yeah you see the spacing mcney was able to get that time he got the defensive guy on his back he was able to rub him off the screen and he got space Shooters want space tonight at 10 Eastern after our mens basketball quadruple header of the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and a look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the

he makes life Look So Easy they play two three free zone he wins 20 games he goes to the tournament and he hes a hes a scratch doer he just has life made I know hes enjoying being in the studio are you sure hes a scratch impressive if he is Yeah by off the line yeah maybe now especially in pseudo retirement for Jim Bay but thats a shot that Lucas Dakota probably shouldnt take Perry no um especially with the quality of shots that theyve been getting uh I I think right now as we start patience for uh Northeastern I think is extremely Applause important roie and the rebound for Dy should D should Ro rethink that one well yeah you I cant sit here you cant coach every play but I just think that offensively V needs a little bit more movement and getting the ball from one side of the floor to the other is when theyre most effective I think theyre shooting it a little quick for the way that they like to Music play time is running out for limited time savings on the Hyundai youve

Music folks Music its time SE work drink on the The Color Purple R PG13 only in theaters Christmas day sliding strong wow turn around and stick it upow f specimen wow it down it up it down Pi it upow always an energetic crowd at jpj and always a tough place to play for nonconference opponents a staggering 96 10 home record under Tony Bennett and those 10 nonconference losses says a lot about where this program is Perry Clark and their six and0 this year against nonconference opponents but nor Eastern pound for pound punch for punch has given them quite a ball game well they have you know we used to always say buildings dont beat you players do and theyve had some pretty good players playing this building now and uh and theyve been able to take advantage of that and made this a very difficult place for anybody to come in and try to steal a game Lucas sakota guarded by beatman to Chris Dy shot clock down to three hoisting one is Turner and McNeely engulfs the board so were flustered on their offensive possession and havent seen that often from the Huskies and thats strange because thats the way Virginia normally plays and uh and for whatever reason theyve wound up extending a little bit more than what they normally do and been back cut and taking advantage that Isaac mcneel the Deep three is second in the last four minutes and Virginia has grabbed the lead just the second time theyve LED since leading 20 to 18 in the first half but John thats the action that I was talking about I mean when its not going well go back to your action that normally gets you the looks that you want and gets you the shots that you want and again uh thats what coach wound up doing that time on that offensive possession why not go to the second best threepoint shooter in the nation Isaac M Neely Woods forcing a shot another good defensive possession by the Cavaliers this is a very T important time for Northeastern right now because the fact this Virginia team knows how theyve got a Killer Instinct theyve been real successful they know what theyre looking for beatman eyes the Deep three scoring drought approaching three minutes for the Huskies has it been a change up on the defensive end for Virginia as Dy tries to shovel the pass and the turnover is four course Beakmans got it well theyve got there you see Virginia transition but theyre going underneath the screens and theyre not giving back Cuts up which is taken away a lot of the success nor Eastern had earlier and theyre not letting dribble drives theyre coming over and helping in the lane an explosive dunk for Ryan dun those were his first points of the night in 23 minutes as the defense triggers the offense as we keep it here after a timeout but pman marvelous on the break yeah and and thats what dun does I mean again integrating this young man with his talent and his athleticism off on the offensive end is is really important for the success of Virginia this year D is ranked 18th to L ESPN marck draft in the first round they have New York taking Ryan dun we know its early ranked as high as 10 on some other drafts so ryot Dunn clearly has turned some heads in NBA scouting circles well without question I mean um one thing he does I mean he runs the floor extremely well he can finish but he also can put the ball on the floor and go get his own shot he has not had the opportunity so far today to really go get his own shot as much as he normally does but uh right now he needs to step up especially on the defensive end Virginia riding a 237 run since the largest lead of the Huskies which was 13 Applause points Dy The Cutting and out of bounds it goes again tenacious defense by Virginia lot of hands on around the ball something we didnt see throughout the majority of the game but now you but now you have have dun uh and hes playing Dy you know and thats the matchup that you want to see and again we talk about Dunns ability to defend and hes the guy that I think can shut Dy down Fade Away by Lucas sakota is good that that was a tough shot right there and that was uh that was really good action sakota has seven in 23 minutes drive by beatman and Dy carals the rebound rebounding Edge 31 23 in favor of nor Applause Eastern again you see him going through Dy yep point forward broses cuts it off and problematic for Northeastern track down by S 16 turnovers for the Huskies when you take away the paint it creates a lot of problems for people offensively and thats what Virginia is starting to do right now this is winning time right now when the games on the line look for them to step up and play their principles and take advantage of the things that they do well 19 assist turnover ratio for nor Eastern tied for fifth in the country with Yukon and a bump by dun causing the offensive foul as it was good defense by Turner who was hounding dun yeah he he got his uh chest in front of dun duns got to learn to just to pull up and and explode right over the offensive the defensive player right there you see hes just trying to get a little bit more leverage and its tough to do Applause Music sakota to Dy with a lefthanded laye thats something that theyve been capitalizing all night when you get the weak side help that guy the weak side has to come all the way over in the paint and make them have to skip it at this point in time in the game North Eastern has has proven that they can make that pass into paint You got to make them skip it Applause and a foul before our timeout nor Eastern in Virginia locked in a tight one in Music

stats and scores together and now you can get it without a satellite one more reason to finally get rid of cable but getting rid of the cable guy might not be as easy oh yeah visit directvcom for up to a Music 400 rebounding has been an issue for number 22 Virginia when they beat Syracuse 8462 was positive tonight theyre trailing North Eastern by a point and its minus 7 so the Huskies have been tenacious on the glass Perry they have and thats something Virginia is going to have to really clean up especially as they get into the league play because everybodys going to see those numbers and even guys that dont rebound the ball well are going to go after them physically to be able to do that and if youre in that Virginia huddle during ourmedia timeout when the foul was called by on Turner of nor Eastern we have done at the line whats the organizational philosophy of Tony Bennett going through the shenanigans in that huddle well I I think what hes saying is we cannot give up any more shots in the paint I mean weve got to contain the ball weve got to come and help every time weve done that weve either turned them over or frustrated them but we cant give up any back Cuts nor do we give up any easy shots in the paint and hit our free throws air ball by dun theyre eight for 15 from the line thats huge tail on the game it really is especially for a team that are defensively has been known to be able to shoot the ball very well anying the night at the line just 68 so its been dicey for them all season Dy goes Baseline The Crafty move by the transfer from marbor Mass Chris Dy a twopoint North Eastern Edge they I I think theyre going to have to go down and double Dy uh hes just been too comfortable and too effective and the games getting down right now they have to go down in Dublin and shot by Groves was his foot on the line theyre going to review it an official review as Jake Groves calling for the three as as expected but well take another look uh it looks like its a three from that angle the ruling was two looked like it might have been a three from that angle but thats what Virginia wants to do with their post guys they need their post guys to be able to set those screens and then be able to fade and knock down that shot when that happens then theres driving lanes for beatman roie uh it also can free up McNeely as far as um coming off of those screens for looks you know one of the things they like to do is come down with the pend down there you see it right there ooh what do you say partner thats awful close that is CL close I think you have a better batting average than I do well you know the officials never listen to me I mean when I I used to try to help them all the time and they used to just say Perry just sit here were working out so uh they onine say the lead official Roger SS yeah capably assisted by Tony Henderson and Adam Floy four so its a two and the game is tied B is 18th year for North Eastern man he was a little bit pessimistic to be brutally honest entering this one is well youd expect facing the 22 team of the country but his huskys have come to play well they have and the biggest thing is their ability to rebound the basketball again they go right inside 30 guarded by Groves heres a three by sakota and dun has it look for Virginia to try to run some action for a pin down or where they can get beakman oneonone they can get him some oneonone off some flare action beatman the back door and dun has another dunk D was quiet for the majority of the night but he gives Virginia a twopoint lead he has five points in 26 minutes now its really important for Virginia to keep the ball out of the paint theyve got to make Northeastern wind up taking a tough shot pigon good defense by Dunn but pigon gets it back and he lays it in Joe PID his first two of the second half he has 11 but hes been so aggressive on the glass and hes really just been too physical for the the Virginia Defenders a double double for Joe Pon whos been injury plagued heres a three by Gro Way Off the Mark what do you make of that one Perry well but thats why its important for the Post guys to be able to hit that shot because if they knock that shot down then they cant help on Beakmans drive and it just opens up a lot of other things for for Virginia sakota guarded by beatman now a switch but beatman picks him back up and Troutman on the Baseline Drive picks up contact foul against the Cavs every time Troutman is getting the ball hes driving it uh you know hes really not looking to shoot it again hes just putting the ball on the floor and driving it so you got to come and rotate over theres another the counter punch after the foul on mcne as nor eastn Music converts so a twoo lead stunning for the Huskies with under minute to play beatman in the lane and a foul tman was all over yeah well at this point look for beakman he may try to use the screen he also is very good at rejecting it and looking to drive but hes going to try to get to the basket right now hes a senior hes been here before hes hes going to try to to put Virginia on his shoulders and carry him thats it for Troutman thats his Music fifth side Troutman nine points five rebounds two assists outstanding game as Billy Cohen gives him a nice pat on the back but he fouls out so theyll play the last 527 without him with beatman at the line be pman leads all scores with 17 also has five assists and five rebounds wooden and N Smith award canidate converts but as weve mentioned theyre just nine of 16 from the line which is not up to their normal standards and uh right now theyve got to really look matching up wise theyve got to figure out whos going to play Dy because they have to figure out a way to get the ball out of his hands cuz Im sure nor Eastern is going to try to play through him uh on this possession and Virginia takes a 302 timeout with a game TI at 54 season High 19 points for the first team all ACC guard preseason reys pman all right where you going here with the huskys and Virginia as we take our game summary look Northeastern hot shooting theyve made 63s the two threes by the Cavaliers the free throw issues for Virginia the plus eight rebounding department for nor Eastern but more the same for both teams or what are we doing here in the last 52 seconds well if Im North Eastern its not going to be fancy I got to get the ball to Dy and uh whether or not I get it to him in the low post whether or not I get it to him in the high post and let him make some moves and look for Cutters and take advantage of some things that that went for them earlier but the ball has got to be in Ds hands and play off of him and if Im Virginia I Ill try to deny him the ball as much as I can and if he gets it in a sweet spot I think you have to send somebody down there and double him and make him pass the basketball eight fouls for nor Eastern six for Virginia just saw moments ago the big number two 32 minutes plus the amount of time of the lead for nor Eastern Dy hes been outstanding guarded by Gro he takes it nice move cant convert done grabs the rebound and heres beatman with it shot clock off Virginia has a chance to win it this has got to be beakman some sort of ball screen here he comes beatman the take and the B with 51 remaining my goodness that wasnt a whole lot of thought that went into that one no sir that would be coaching oneone give it to your best player give it to your best player create space let him attack the basket where he can make a decision to either score or Applause pass so a timeout by the Huskies with 31 remaining degrees Patman an AllAmerican move and thats a tough shot there right there and thats what Im saying his athleticism I think not a lot of people give him enough credit for because thats a tough shot and he hes gotten his upper body strong enough where he can take the bumps and be able to finish and uh hes just so unselfish that I think some things he can do individually just he doesnt do to make the team better until until its necessary now defensively right now its really important how Virginia is going to play this because you know you cant just go double Dy because he will pass it and you dont want to give up a three in this situation in late game situation so I think you got to contain the basketball I think youve got to make them work to get the ball into the post area I think you got to front the post with three quarter them so that Dy doesnt get an easy look Dy has 12 the huge story has been Rees beatman 63 guard for Milwaukee with a career best 21 points so efficient 9 for 18 from the field three or four at the line six rebounds and five assists in 34 minutes you know Reese does so many things and I I can tell you as a coach that coached a lot of really good players you know when you miss them the most John is when theyre gone is when theyre gone I mean you we had a guy named Mark price at Georgia Tech we had a GU Dennis Scott uh you know I had some really good players at Tuan and and you really miss them when theyre Applause gone and Virginia counters with a timeouts of the chess match between Tony bennon and Bill Cohen with 32 on the clock North Eastern has missed its last five threo attempts but the Huskies have been feisty this has been a stunner I dont think either of either of us expected this score with 3 seconds left in the game well I tell you um you know North Eastern has really played well I think right now you you take the time out your assistance have scouted all late game situations and so what they want to do is try if Virginia is see what the setup was anticipate what the play is going to be and what the options are off the play and try to disrupt it as best you can North Easters last win against a ranked opponent 2015 against number 15 Miami its amazing in school history they only went twice and you think about the story career of Northeastern basketball go back to the late great Reggie Lewis those NCA tournament teams under Jim Calhoun before he went to Yukon and then theyre coached by Carl fille after Music Calhoun I tell you what this Northeastern program has had some really some outstanding players and great success and uh and and Coach Cohen has just done an outstanding job you know since hes been there Chris Dy 12 points and nine rebounds for the Huskies here we go final 32 Dar trying to grab it I goodness a tough pass on the crosscourt they tried to run some action where they where Dy was able to trying to run a fade to the corner and uh it just looks like they werent as successful with it as they want Virginia did a really good job of recognizing now they they have to get the ball in bounds beatman to inbound finds roie who is scoreless the transfer from St Thomas was the summit League freshman of the year last year Andrew roie the inbound to Chris Dy a high pass by Harold Woods After McNeely flustered him on the sideline it was a good action instead of him instead of Dy just going to the low post to post up he faded on it and uh it was a bad pass but you know it looks like Virginia you know my old coach Morgan Wooten used to say sometimes you learn an expensive lesson inexpensively and this was one of those lessons I think for this Virginia team and that guys happy to walk away with the win yeah what a scare put in by the northeastern huskys they led the majority
