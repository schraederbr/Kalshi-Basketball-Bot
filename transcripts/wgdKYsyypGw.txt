just about set to go here there you see Hunter Tyson one of the starting five for the Tigers Music in the home whites nice and the road red Applause this matchup to I think the first four minutes is going to tell us a lot about the pace of this game with these two teams well I think right out of the gate what youre going to see is Bellarmine is going to swing that ball from side to side whenever they do retained possession its a very methodical very slow team when it comes to attacking the rim tigers have it first about Chase hunter in the open hes been facilitating there a nice feed and middle Brooks misses gets the follow Ben Middlebrooks with the first bucket of the night that was an excellent excellent pass to the roller Middlebrooks needs to catch that and make the first one that might happen against Bellarmine whos a little bit undersized compared to the Tigers during ACC play hes got to go up and dunk that ball you see the starting five for the knights all good ball handlers very interchangeable number five starting lineup Im sorry clock number five Peter souter the leading scorer for this squad didnt score in their opener against Louisville but Clemsons Off to the Races this is when they can be good in transition but you got to make layups Hunter Tyson a very good rebounder there a lazy pass heres sooner on the break and he ties the score and sooner like I mentioned zero points in their opener 2324 in the second and third contest somebody to keep an eye on he can get out in the passing lanes and get easy layups but where he excels is as a big guard they can post up within their offense you see the Tigers starting five same unit theyve used throughout the season PJ Hall preseason allconference will come off the bench shortly still working his way back Hemingway stepped on the line and as we change possession how about a look at some keys to the game Teo but youre gonna get a peek at bellarmines offense here on this possession Clemson needs to guard the full 30 seconds and I as soon as I say that they get really close to the cup but this is how its going to happen Bellarmine side to side offense make that defense shift and then they like to take advantage of cuts off the ball in mismatches when theyre whenever theyre able to attain them Applause Music on the left wing this is Tipton theyll swing it around pull up twopoint jumper off the mark no good from Suiter and out of bounds of the Tigers a lot of ball reversals here for Bellarmine good ball movement for the Tigers to get a bucket and there he is just exerting his size and physicality middlebrooks not a small dude 610 230 pounds 235 pounds he has that physical Advantage but bellarmines tough theyre going to start boxing out at a higher rate hes got to make that first one its important Hemingway thought he had a three and fell down and Galloways shots blocked but a foul I think Galloway got a little fortunate I thought that was a clean block coming over on the side Tipton closed out a little bit late but Galloway getting ready to go well thats as bad as clean as you can get he did get the body after he blocked the shot though Galloway a Boston College transfer has been a pleasant surprise so far not only because he can shoot the basketball struggled last year from the field Quark but defensively just a really strong young man he can guard multiple positions him and Tipton are going to have a nice matchup second free throw up and good for Brevin 92 percent in the early going small sample but 11 for 12 interesting I know were only two minutes in the Tigers have missed twice but the guys had missed the shots have grabbed their own rebounds Clemson could get after the offensive glass theyre going to be tough for Bellamy Music here go the knights again lots of ball reversals a few dribbles youll see the ball moves consistently Clemsons work off the ball has to be ready you cannot lose track of your man especially on some of these Shuffle Cuts is Hunter Tyson gets in position and draws the charge thats two on bellarmines Tipton thats big Music Hunter Tyson getting out in front hes a terrific Defender the teams best charge taker little embellishment never hurts Quark but he was in right position and a little forearm doesnt help from Tifton oh youre right about that he may be uh helped just a little bit but as you said when you beat the offensive player to the Baseline youre entitled to that space Music Hemingway quick trigger first rebound of the day for the knights and a technical foul called Already against Scott Davenport Applause head coach Davenport really irate Applause and as you could tell hes not happy now watch this hes on the bottom side and he chases the referee down hes obviously upset about a call it didnt seem like it was too outlandish clock but nonetheless Davenport hes won a lot of games defending his guys and he wanted a foul on the arm I just want to say I think a lot of people watching were as inquisitive as I was in that replay looking at coach Davenport trying to explain what he said 1714 to go in the first half and when youre a head coach youre bringing your team to an ACC school like that thats a rough way to start Galloway we mentioned hes only missed one free throw all season he missed a couple you found the knights with the ball the ball just continues to move side to side Clemson not going to get out and pressure the passing Lane so much so they have to Shell up and be good off the basketball Applause floater air ball long for Suiter Here Comes Chase Hunter hes so good on the break making good decisions hes gonna fire three knocks it down and thats where hes really improved clock so far this year hes hit absurd percentages 636 percent and he has his feet set hes playing with confidence and really good balance on the wing bash Leland whistle and it looked like Kurt Hobbs stepped on the line rough start for Bellaman right now just not able to get what theyre looking for offensively and when you as you talked about when youre playing a low possession game you got to make sure you maximize those thats exactly right and Clemson maintaining their pressure off the ball pushing those catches out a little bit more and out of bounds call for Bellarmine but Clemson offensively too its been a nice opening so far the balls moving quickly and I thought that Alex Hemingway got fouled on that jump shot clock yeah sure looked like some contact there but no call the embellame gonna work the ball Clemson doing a good job in rotation here in the early going Applause Corner Ben Johnson deep three good Justin Betts knocks it down the grad student Justin Betts the preseason preseason asun defensive player of the year he has kind of an awkward shot he holds a way out in front of his face but hes fairly effective but hes a big switchable car really gets up forces turnovers at a high rate for Bellaman Applause Music Tigers a lot of ball fakes early and then the three like that one from Tyson and Bellarmine plays a version of the pack line theyre not going to get too far out in front a little bit like Virginia and Bellarmine as they move to basketball the slowest team in the country as far as Tempo is concerned but it doesnt matter if Curtis Kurt Hoff is going to be able to knock down shots as well couple threes for the knights here to answer the Tigers and weve got ourselves a track meet at the moment track meet is relative to these two things relative to expectations well say you got to keep me honest here Hemingway trying to answer middle Brooks goes up for a rebound and a foul is called on the board as Middlebrooks got him with the body Chase Hunters three going to break here and its just ball has been moving at a high level nice bald fake Hunter Tyson and Chase Hunter hes been doing that well this season Tigers up early being the best takes hard work it takes early mornings planning precision sweat sacrifice and teamwork thats why Old

extraordinary love Jared love brilliantly Applause Music Applause true story this early season Banger isnt just a battle of all the marriages these guys know how to play its between two of the best teams in the Land Experience number four Kentucky number two Gonzaga Sunday at 7 30 on ESPN Clemson and 11a Lead early now heres a look at what happened as we went to break and already a technical foul for Scott Davenport obviously Tio not thrilled with that well he thinks Clemsons being overly physical on the perimeter shes a Rick Pitino disciple hes been hes been around some bigtime coach hes been at Bellarmine for a while but was with patino at the beginning of his time at Louisville an excellent coach in his own ride hes done it at a high level for a long time and won a national championship at the division two level okay he just won his 400th career game quite a Marcus 753 win percentage so he knows a winning ball looks like and certainly hes got the knights off to a good start this season see the ball just continues to move this is going to be a reoccurring theme today and a big ones going to be how the big man for Bellarmine shoot the basketball can they pull out Clemsons five men three to shoot got a hoist it three off the mark and a rebounding foul as Whelan missed the jumper hes going to go against Langdon Hatton sophomore from Georgetown Indiana William and Mary transfer then you get your first look at PJ Hall trying to box out a little push in the back quality defensive possession little embellishment never hurt anybody two embellishment references if youre keeping track at home Im all for a little embellishment as long as its flop technical isnt cold and I like this lineup out for Clemson right now shiflin and PJ hall both in the game shifflin number four for the Tigers typically more of a fiveman who can step out and knock it down playing at the four tigers go ultra big and look to dominate on the boards a little bit more Applause nice little hook look at that move by Justin betz to the Baseline Justin Betts going old school with the hook shot in the glass you dont often see that from a guard standing about six three quarters but thats where Bellarmine can beat you on some of these Baseline Flex Cuts they come out they get you in the post and then because they use some of their length at the guard spot inverting their offense if you will gets the shooters roll they call that a members bounce clock so far Hemingway oh of three guy who puts in as much work as him hes going to get the benefit of the doubt with the rim on some of those BJ Hall with the deflection Tigers looking to run here Chase Hunter no look feed to shefflin and thats just a quality rim run by Ian sheffman getting out past his man Chase Hunter has excellent Vision especially in the semi break theres nobody playing with more confidence this season so far in Chase hunt now 16 assists to three turnovers for a guy who really is more of a combo guard theres an answer three thats Johnson who delivers for the knights and leads cut in half hes the only freshman on the team thats going to get any any sort of significant playing time Mr basketball in the state of Kentucky last season he can really knock it down from the perimeter just another cerebral player for the knights PJ Hall trying to move it somewhere skip pass lots of extra passing for the Tigers no good from shuffling out of the corner I havent seen one bad possession offensively so far for the Tigers ball is moving at a high level shots arent falling as much as you would like but youre still getting quality looks Music Applause Music Bellarmine working the ball late in the clock theres a three left Point Way short bets missed it but a second chance here with 15 to shoot now and a steal by shefflin and Here Come the Tigers Applause nice decision Chase Hunter realizes the defense is back get back settle your guys down and get it to the horse inside watch PJ work Hall a little bit strong on the hook still not 100 healthy learning to play with balance again after having some trouble with that right knee you see the band or the legging rather compression sleeve I like leggings I like legging more its coming up towards Christmas big leggings guys make a note three on the way knocked down and just like that were tied as benj Johnson rips the cord Mr Johnson has come ready to play it seems like he shows up against ACC teams two of two so far and that one wasnt that close to the threepoint line call PJ Hall looking to respond yes sir cut the key is his spot if hes going to shoot one from Beyond the yard PJ Hall right at the top of the key he sees it hes even with the backboard quality shot quality pass to set him up eight for 15 the two teams combined from downtown right now great start if you like Sharp Shooting which I would say both of your broadcasters do theres another one how about Hatton getting into the air it wasnt necessarily the smoothest shot Ive ever seen clock but it doesnt matter if its effective had plenty of time and that goes back to what I was saying the five men if they can pull PJ all out hes gonna have to defend out on the perimeter a lot today Music double team on shefflin Chase Hunter too strong and a good box out there by Bellarmine Alec frame clears the glass Applause and a shot clock issue is going to lead us to a Timeout on the floor some good threepoint shooting to both teams are knocking him down at a high rate early here quall knocking down shots ball movement has been crisp and Bellarmine coming out ready to play Clemson as well PJ Hall top of the key you can forget about it we got a battle Music took a while to get up here we started out around 1959 then we took a hard left in East Africa a right at Baja Applause a 180 in the empty quarter and that 65 degree incline at hells Revenge but we didnt do all that just to get here we did it to give you a truck thatll take you anywhere

the Tigers head coach shes got a team he really likes to trying to get back to the postseason for the seventh time and hes got some freshmen he really likes some of those guys checking in right now Dylan Hunter Chase uh Chauncey Wiggins both coming into the ball game but somebodys had a tremendous amount of success here got him to the Sweet 16 a few seasons ago made the tournament over the past several seasons or a few seasons if you will uh defense first is obvious with Coach Brownell but for the most part consistency guys are graduating and theyre doing a nice job as far as competing now in a night to night basis in the Atlantic Coast Conference interesting to see Wiggins on the floor he has played three minutes in the season thus far and Coach Brownell told me I want to give Wiggins in the game in the first half because he deserves it hes got good length he can get out and defend and hes got a lot of talent clock six nine 205 pounds long wingspan can shoot a little bit somebody thats going to have to grow into a bigger role because hes not quite ready yet but when youre that big and that skilled there are times youre going to have success as Hunter Tyson knocks down another one another three for the Tigers thats five and Hunter Tyson continues to play well hes got six hes been Mr Dependable for this team this season right hes somebody that these young guards whenever they enter the game they can rely on a little bit at the fourth position I mean he should be reliable hes 30 it seems Alex Hemingway whistled for the foul another look at that Tyson three good give across the floor from Wiggins 100 Tyson always moving with his hands in position ready to fire away hes turned into into a consistent threat from Beyond The Arc that wasnt what he did coming out of high school its something hes worked towards well hes off to a bit of a slow start in that regard this year hes just three for 14 coming into the game tonight from three you wonder if you know a guy makes a decision to come back maybe pressing a little bit coach Brownells talked about that a time or two Applause yeah late in the clock Dylan Hunter guarding nice move inside kick to the corner and standing on the line is Suitor again the Tigers you mentioned it theyve got to defend the entire clock theyve done an excellent job of that the first 11 and a half minutes especially off the basketball Chase Hunter getting out showing towards the ball bets trying to penetrate a little bit and then forcing fireman to play further away from the basket and that makes things a lot more difficult a couple of Subs in the game for the knights foreign Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause the winner Music Applause took a while to get up here we started out around

Tebow in a verbo Music where you get the whole place to yourself so its always just you and your Gators already a good start for Chase Hunter you see him there right behind his brother and uh boy oh boy uh Dylans getting a heck of a tutorial from his older brother this year about how to improve from one year to the next well both from the West Lake area in Atlanta and Chase Hunter is an interesting story he struggled with injuries for the majority of his time at Clemson took a medical red shirt but in high school his AAU team it was him and Anthony Edwards it was one and two and both of them were scoring a lot and hes never really been able to catch his footing until this season and Buddy is it paying off especially in this game here early knocking down shots three assists so far but hes been brutally efficient hes passed the ball at a high level and hes always been a good Defender and he has all those physical tools that you want in a lead guard Knights continuing to move the ball side to side getting into scoring time now this is Tipton gonna have to throw it up there Tipton from Deep High rebound and Tyson clears it Clemson has just built a wall with all five guys moving at a high level and theres a theres got to be a flopping situation and this is a new call this year and Im sure everybodys whos watched college basketball for its been its been an emphasis for the officials and heres the rule if youre called for a flop you get one free throw ball does not change possession the other part of that rule is you can get three of them on the third one you are ejected from the basketball game so that is something significant that Im not sure a lot of people really realize weve always talked about the One technical per guy or but if he gets to three and it gets egregious that player is now disqualified from the basketball Applause so in other words its not prohibitive to get one and especially if youre gonna miss a free throw there lets look at it and there was a little contact after the ball was released but theyre trying to get rid of this extra Music just let it go now Im just going to be honest with you clock if they did this while I was playing like I would have averaged two technicals a game just off that but it is a Class B technical its not a class a technical so that it is one free throw ball doesnt change possession and you continue to play well the best thing about it is it makes the officials job easier because ultimately the goal is you get the you know you get the flopping out then the official didnt have to worry about it so when a guy falls he actually needed to fall Applause nice Downs four deep three straight away knocked down beautiful stroke from Sam devault how about that Sam devault pulling out PJ Hall like PJ hes not somebody that loves to guard out on the perimeter when hes inside about 15 feet he can be solid Defender but whenever hes pulled out hes gonna have to move his feet and especially coming off Avenger equal thats going to make it more difficult he can be a quality rim hes getting mauled but he can be a quality rim protector but at the same time hes got to get out and cover it but this was deep hes on the Paw thats Terence Oglesby range right there once upon a time clock Once Upon a Time but nonetheless right now you can hit those yeah of course its ridiculous thats a ridiculous assumption to think youre what Music Applause I want for PJ Hall here already got a threepointer on The Ledger and knocks down his first free throw such a talented player clock and bellarmines going to send a lot of guys at him whenever he receives the ball in the post theyre going to double him or come from the low side sometimes from the high side sometimes hes got to be able to read the defense and make the correct decision but he thats something hes proven he can do hes become a better passer since he arrived on campus Applause PJs still working his way back he didnt do a lot of basketball activities in the off season a lot of cardio and doctors originally said he wouldnt play till December and this its his third game of the year Applause foreign bounce pass to the block Suiter up in traffic gets it to go consider so diverse in how he can score I almost said thats a great defensive possession by Brevin Galloway getting out contesting making the ball go back out but Peter sooner he is a quality threeman inside outside he can do both of them now a chance to take the lead as the knights move into the four chord Music and a whistle underneath here thats on Duvall now look at this shot got a spin move and maybe a little heavy there its close might have been an extra step but regardless sooner be at six five and pretty broad shoulders he can get over top of somebody like Galloway whos more six two six three range but Alex Hemingway cant leave him open thats what happens Tigers back up four on another three thats seven in the first half for Clemson Music Applause Knights continue to run this offense really the Tigers have not been out leveraged theyve been in good position throughout the shots that the knights have hit have been deeper contested and theyre capable of making them and they continue to be in the right position defensively have been pretty good but you have to take care of the ball thats a big time block shot by BJ Hall you have to finish out possessions with defensive rebounds you can get out and run use your athleticism a little bit first block of the day for PJ Hall another look at it off the Miss from Tipton you have to take care of that its obviously hard to rebound an air ball I understand that clock but at the same time you have to be able to see both the ball and your man put a body on your guy they didnt make it happen PJ haldo able to clean up the mess Music e denied at The Rim that time Music deflection there out to Hunter from 100 to another that may have been tipped I think Suitor got a piece of it Here Comes Bellamy one on Three Suiter thought wisely of that and Galloway thought he had a cheap steal that time and Im not all that mad at that defensive possession they had numbers Galloway comes back hes able to foul and what happens then is Clemsons able to get back well excuse me maybe not such a good foul you had your defense back in position you were matched up got a little undisciplined you wouldnt expect that from a fifth year guy Brevin Galloway a twotime transfer interesting story of Brevin he was going to give up basketball realized he had an extra year at Boston College theyd already a lot of his scholarship and so fortunate enough to transfer back home to play and an interesting substitution on that last dead ball getting Chase Hunter out of the game right before the four minute timeout try to get him a breather so he can finish out the half Dylan Hunter running the point this time down Music I love the pace and another thing you enter the ball in from the top of the key like that PJ once he gets his explosiveness back hes going to be able to go one on one and finish that Music Applause cut set Applause looking to get the ball inside the first 20 seconds of the shot clock and then work it back out a lot of heavy breathing yet you have to stay so engaged on the defensive end for the full 30 seconds theres no simple pick and roll plays when playing Bellarmine but continue to do a nice job two two strong for Hatton Here Comes Hunter Applause Galloway probing and thats a hook pretty easy call Galloway getting a little over eager hooking around the defense trying to create an advantage but hes got a big body he gets in there he doesnt have to do that in order to get a bucket Clemson trying to hang on against a tough Music Music Applause it took a while to get up here we started out around 1959 then we took a hard left in East Africa a right at Baja Applause a 180 in the empty quarter and with that 65 degree incline at hells Revenge but we didnt do all that just to get here we did it to

Echo pepperoni extra cheese on that thing oh from every chacaroni to the Papa Johns Foundation Music all right lets see Tigers up four lets take a look at the anatomy of a three right here with Teo you see Alex Hemingway was able to get loose at the top but keep an eye on number 33 for Bellarmine he has put in a pickle this is a nice roll replace set for the Tigers PJ Hall putting pressure on the rim aggressive towards the basket let it run and Alex him away number 33 hes put to find he doesnt really know where to cover next late rotation results in an easy shot for the sniper from Indiana you know nine different players in this game have made a threepoint shot so far its interesting Clemsons been able to get a lot of good looks does it help the tigers that theyve had to game plan so much for Virginia and several other pack line teams that they see every year in the ACC well a lot of it the rotation was good and to go along with what youre saying every game whether its Bellarmine or its Florida State obviously contrasting Styles but you have to you have to perform in a certain way to get open shots right at the same time having diversity in your nonconference schedule only boats to help Clemson three Off the Mark for bets sheflin to rebound and diversity as far as the opponents style of play because you look at the ACC from top to bottom Syracuse is going to play his own Virginia is going to play the pack Line North Carolina and Florida State theyre going to get up in the passing Lanes so being able to play different types of defenses throughout the season only helps things rebounds ball will go to Bellarmine you mentioned not a lot of poor possessions that may be the first one for the Tigers tonight well theyve moved the ball well and keep in mind too ball movements not going to be overly difficult when playing against the pacline defense but if you move with pace and youre able to move the back line the help side if you will then shots are going to come easier Music how goods a freshman Ben Ben Johnson I mean hes been quality so far Ben middlebrooks a little too handsy trying to guard out on the perimeter somewhere hes not overly comfortable with Bellarmine has those guys number 12 Langdon Patton excuse me he can certainly put it on the deck as well theres good length for Bellarmine too you know they could tell theyve done a good job of finding guys that fit their system and that tristate area a lot of Kentucky a lot of Indiana influence here but they are tall and long theyve got some good size to be able to finish some of these shots late in the clock like you talked about well you look at Justin bets hes the smallest guy on the floor right now and he stands about 6263 but at the same time long and strong and they can find ways to finish in Hunter Tyson got a foul call there but I thought he got an extra step I did too I thought the whistle was going to be for a travel instead Johnson ends up drawing it lets count the steps for Hunter here but hunter this is what makes him valuable for the Tigers too one two three adds to travel I know the ball is supposed to be floating and all that thats a travel picks it up with two takes three gets the benefit of the doubt but hunter Tyson thats what makes him valuable hes somebody who can grab and go hes a grab and go rebounder and you look at throughout college basketball I was at the Texas Gonzaga game Timmy Allen can do that grab a rebound initiate the break on his own and what it does is it opens up your offense in semibreak situations to where guys are having to guard at different spots on the floor and whenever a floor man is having to pick up out on the perimeter and grab the ball sometimes you can get some MixUps shooter back in the lineup for the knights here late in the half Tyson with seven make it eight points to lead all tigers in scoring in the first half now Betts will run the show Erman looking to respond here and the Tigers had their largest lead Geo and the style is not going to change I mean consistent in their approach and this is what can beat you you can do an undisciplined thing and PJ Hall tries to go for a steal and what that does is it puts his teammates out in a bond so help side has to come over and then as a result guys end up fouling late in the clock look go for the steal defense has to come over late schiffon does a nice job and then Chase Hunter tries to stay vertical but the ball fake by bash Weiland puts him in a bind and if youre disciplined against Bellarmine you can guard them if you try to get out and get steals in the passing Lanes thats where they kill you because theyre not a team thats necessarily going to force the issue theyre going to play off your mistakes that time PJ Hall getting a little overzealous for his teammate Chase Hunter thats his first middle Brooks and Galloway with two fouls for Clemson here in the first half Bellarmine with a little bit of foul trouble as well Applause Music Applause big possession here for the Tigers you feel like theyre trying to pull away but the knights keep answering and I know that looks like an early shot but knowing development is going to use the full 30 what that does is that allows Clemson to get their full clock on their last offensive possession Applause on the right wing this is Nick thielen seven to shoot down the Baseline loose ball picked up by Tyson Music and now you can do something early if you dont get a nice quality look at the beginning of this clock I like this time out right here Brad Brownell got 26 21 seconds left on the clock and Clemsons going to be able to figure something out when we come back to close out the first half Clemson in a battle it took a while to get up here we started out around 1959 all right at Baja Applause a 180 in the empty quarter and that 65 degree incline at hells Revenge but we didnt do all that just to get here we did it to give you a truck thatll take you anywhere this is the new Nissan Music dont even think about going anywhere at halftime we got a load of information for you we got analysis we got stats were going to take a look at whats happened the first couple weeks of ball in the ACC and of course lots of highlights lots of good shooting who doesnt love good shooting I love good shooting and I know clock youre you were a high level high school shooter as well so thats right uh you need all those qualifiers by the way thats high school and if you have to go to the bathroom at halftime you can do that you get about two and a half minutes so make sure you get back for halftime but hunter Tyson good defensive possession setting up his team for not the last shot but a chance to get a quality shot to close the half I was going to say so here you want to use the whole clock if youre Clemson and make Bellarmine Rush with less than 10 to go look at the second difference here Bellarmine coming out in a Zone just to kind of mix up what Clemsons been doing they dont play a lot of Zone just kind of a change of pace to make lumps and make some decisions well you saw there delayed Clemson about eight seconds and getting into any action and a foul whistled and the entire Bellarmine bench really pleased with the way they defended there but the foul at the end of the clock by Phelan lets take a look at it this is a pretty nobrainer call quack has his arm around number 30 you see that left hand getting wrapped around trying to get position I actually like the adaption by Chase Hunter he got rid of the ball really quick made the defense shift gets it back and looks into PJ whos battling against the center guy in the 23 Zone Music free throw for PJ a bit short well see what substitutions we have coming in 12 seconds to go Brad likes to switch somebody in maybe get a little bit faster Music its like Dylan Hunter is going to go to the table and free throw is good and theyre going to get PJ Hull out of the game so a smaller line up here you get smaller you get a little bit faster the only thing is developments able to get shot up with about four seconds youre going to really have to box out youre a little bit smaller at this juncture make sure you take care of the full possession here on this last possession foreign by Tyson good defending there on Justin Betts well take it a halftime get you caught up on the first half right after this Music it shouldnt take a storm of biblical proportions going along with Towson thats going to be a much more difficult game than I think people realize on paper they had three players on the CAA preseason first team I mean thats a talented Squad they should win that league and what a lot of people dont understand scheduling is so vastly important if you look last season I thought Wake Forest in the Atlantic coast was a tournament team but they scheduled so weak during the noncon it really come back came back to bite them are you calling you calling game Clemson Towson a lot of good notes I actually will be there I was gonna say man basket counts PJ Hall whistled for the foul good start for Bellarmine there as they get a nice backdoor cut here and if you just build a wall around that threepoint line dont get lazy thats not a good possession to open up the second half if youre Clemson you have to come out ready to go you know what theyre going to be are they going to vary up some of their immediate actions maybe but if youre disciplined for that full 30 seconds like we talked about at the beginning of the game you should be able to guard this team bash wheel into threepoint play hes got five now the Tigers looking to answer theyve been able to do that throughout the game heres Galloway in and out Tyson the follow cant get the roll and now once again a chance to Tire take the lead for the knights Buffet drive and kick heres where your discipline comes into effect dont go for shot fakes get in position and play good defense make them shoot over the top the Bellarmine Knights theyre capable of making shots six in the first half but at the same time make sure that you stay disciplined for the duration of the clock and if theyre going to make shots like that like bash Whelan like thats a tough cover in and of itself but all in all you guard for 30 seconds you give a spinning fade away you have to be happy with that super shot for Wheeling hes got the first five of the second half Tigers reversing the ball Galloway a hanger Tigers back on top second side offense Clemson moves it from one to the other and Galloway attacking a closeout shot fake and making a difficult one for about seven feet lets see how Bellarmine responds they have tied this game four times but have not taken the lead Galloway tried to take it away and this would be for the lead too strong falls on the deck and Betts has it Suitor missed it the tap back is good I actually think Hunter Tyson was the one who tipped that ball in but sooner got away with a pushoff in the post there ball came loose he pushed over Galloway gotta Embrace that physicality whenever hes in the post youre gonna say we showed Mike Noonan while ago that was an on goal this was a high level pass him away is not able to convert skip two passes that time Applause oh billerman again looking for its first lead of the night they have found a matchups they like getting Galloway in the post Applause thats going to be a foul inside on hop and theres your rebounding foul Applause heres a tip and I was pretty sure that Hunter Tyson was the last one to touch this ball comes off the rim and he tries to grab the rebound and sure enough Hunter Tyson Im assuming the Garrett Tipton gets credit for that basket you got to get in you got to do your early work coming from a nonrebounder you got to get out there and put a body on so there maybe somebody else could get the rebound if youre me at least you knew your role Chase Hunter another skip pass to Tyson thats a second pass in two possessions that hes made from the 45 to the opposite corner he just sees it so well can thats something that Im not sure he developed as much during his time in college but its something that he had coming here but hes now that hes LED at the point guard position for the Tigers a little little change with some departures in the off season hes been get handed more responsibility Betson wheeler now leading all nights with seven points Music whistling a foul there a lot of body contact from Suiter hell pick up his first but second side offense Clemson you swing it from one side to the other and you put the defense in a tough closeout sooner Music Hemingway hasnt really put it on the deck today so were gonna load them to sleep a little bit there Music little Brooks at the five now for Clemson Music Chase Hunter five assists in the game today and a good pass there to Galloway and how about Galloway getting his feet set but thats all from Chase Hunter making his guide troll win putting him in a little bit of a desperation closeout Galloway able to deliver Tigers back up four and again the knights had it square at 35 but unable to cash in their opportunity and now theyre down two possessions foreign going to work nice cut down the Baseline and a foul will result in free throws when we come back and you have to maintain that discipline you have to maintain that discipline defensively but a lot of people are saying the bank has been closed for years the fundamentals are gone not in this game called you can forget about it both teams using the bank in Galloway over top

tigers by Ford Tio its good to make threes but its better when theyre set up well a lot of the actions before the shot actually happens look at Alex Hemingway right here this is one of the most selfless and intelligent basketball plays Ive seen in some time look at hes calling for the screen and Chase Hunter is able to find him but calling for a scream that far away from the basketballing knowing where the rotation is going to come Alex Hemingway that is a selfless play for a player that just understands the game and where the rotations are going to be Chase Hunter has done a night or yeah hes done a nice job of finding his teammates but at the same time some of these other actions go not uncalled for thats the right wrong word but they go unwarranted or uncredited credited thats what Im thats the word thats the word Im looking for Alex Hemingway what an intelligent basketball play he comes from Indiana I mean you would assume those sort of things would happen thats true foreign but in the flow of the offense even more so right this wasnt something that Brad Drew up this is something Alex Emily saw in the defense finds his open teammate and helps him get more open well it helps to have a shooter whos not necessarily shooting the ball but who understands how to get his fellow Shooters open he knows what he needs Chauncey Wiggins Applause its another good look for the Tigers screen roll action that second guy coming up gets an easy look is not able to convert again Bellarmine looking for layups Wiggins just needs to hang with it I mean hes young hes going to figure it out all the skill is there that you would need just needs to stick with him clock Tipton three to shoot back door cut no urgency right there from the knights thats just a poor mistake and another quality defensive possession the full 30 Clemson continues to rotate even with the freshman and youre still able to find or not fine but maintain your effort level for that for that entire shot clock Applause characteristic of Bellarmine they dont typically turn the ball over to have 11 short for him and way there Music shows Clemsons defensive presence you know we talked about at halftime Clemson plus nine and points off turnovers and how about Tipton okay so Im watching that play develop the ball is moving quickly thats where you have to communicate on the back side number 21 Chauncey Wiggins he has to if you cant find your man you at least have to communicate where youre going to be next right thats one of your learning curves as a freshman if nothing else be loud and then you can help your teammates figure it out Chase Hunter off the bounce at three he was frustrated that whole possession can the knights Take the Lead another chance here under 14 minutes to play they have not LED this game has been tied now five different times nice cut they can lead Wheeling delivers hes got nine and its the continuous movement its a cumulative effect when playing Bellarmine its theyre never going to change the way they play theyre going to continue to whittle away Tigers down one as Brad Brownell wants to talk it over well come back to Clemson in just a moment Music big

has more taste than only one more calorie than Michelob Ultra Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music foreign Music Applause up one they get the layup here Tio walk us through this play well this is something that doesnt happen at the beginning of the game Chase hunter in the middle turns his head and its a cumulative effect whenever youre playing Bellarmine theyre going to continue to run their stuff you have to stay engaged lose the side of the ball lose the side of his man and that ends up being an easy layup for Bellum and thats kind of what happens after 30 minutes of playing maintaining your discipline for the duration and I feel like Im beating a dead horse and Ive said it a thousand times but at the same time thats whats happening I cant change whats in front of me envelopment if theyre able to attack you in the last 10 minutes and you wear down thats where they can beat you Ive got a followup here once possession changes and now it does you know the knights ran a lot of offense and just didnt get any shots for about 20 seconds in their arm and thats what they do that was a rare early clock play you wonder if Chase relaxed his body knowing maybe I dont have to guard quite as hard until about 12 on the clock well even in their game against Louisville theyre opportunistic theyre just not going to force the issue back cuts a lot of screens exchanges late in the clock what a shot there I dont care that he missed and how about number number 42 Kurt Hoff just maintaining his effort disengaging from schifflins box out if youre not as big as the opponent you better outwork him people needs to get around and work before that ball hits the rim Wheeling just got that ball to the rim and now a lob and a miss there is hop hit the deck and a whistle and a foul as shefflin again that was going to draw the whistle that was a heck of a draw up pop coming from the corner a very good screen you have to communicate that screen probably should have dunked that clock Im not sure he was quite high enough but a little push in the back good call schifflin getting both hands on him quick fouls for Ian thats his first two of the game and hell come out as PJ Hall comes back you know Brad Brownell not happy about that at all and I cant really lift from the back of the head but Im not sure I need to after that exchange I can assure you you dont want to correct Tigers havent scored in 317 and thats allowed the knights to go on a 70 run and build a threepoint lead foreign Applause Music a little bit of nerves here in the little John crowd PJ Hall a tough catch and he will get free throws as hop has whistled for his fourth like that set you get Wiggins with the ball in his hands and a baseline Runner so what it does is it drags the defense with you got away with a little bit of hold of a quick decision though Quark thats the key whenever he gets the ball in down low because that double teams coming quick if hes able to make a quick decision like on that possession he can either score or get fouled they got bets for that foul from behind the contact on the arm not the body from Hoff so thats a good news for Bellarmine as hop goes back to three and Bets has just one foul EJ Hall very talented player from Spartanburg pulls the Tigers within one and here it comes back Brad Brown now in the first half I mentioned that he calls Bellarmine like a team that loves the option or runs the runs the ball a lot in football right youre not going to get that many possessions and once they get the ball back theyre going to run it all the way down so its hard to make runs its a wear down effect theyre constantly whittling at your defense three on the way in and out no good from bets Tyson with a rebound Hunter Tyson now 11 points and six rebounds today Music Chase Hunter Music pom fake nowhere to throw the ball nice feed on the entry PJ Hall is going to go back to the line after a Timeout on the floor thats a tough song trying to post up in the post maintain his strength and either gonna need him as they try to battle back down one the with more rental listings than anybody else it was just

this place discover the strange creatures a strange world dont touch that hey stop pushing buttons Music 11 57 to play PJ Hall going to the line to this one of the best players in the league second Team all conference hes not a hundred percent right now really gutting it out no hes a tough kid and he is working his way back from injury and you can see it whenever hes trying to post up and hold this position that right leg has really been bothering him now he is coming back I talked to the strength coach today he has worked his way back to where his strength was prior to the injury so thats a big thing just getting back comfortable to when hes playing in the low post is going to be huge and theyre going to need him clock I mean not just this game this game is obvious but as they move into December and those games we showed that schedule earlier how its starting to ramp up and youre going to play a lot of my major opponents hes going to be a major part of what youre doing because what he provides for you offensively well Clemson goes down three and where does the ball goes into PJ he makes four free throws and all of a sudden youre back up one thats exactly right Applause incredibly important piece for the Tigers 10 points Off the Bench tonight in about 16 minutes of game time ball reversal again for the knights with 10 on the clock this is scoring time bets puts it on the floor 43 over Wiggins in and out no good a tough Miss for Wheeling every part of the rim and out and look at this semitransition where do you go right at The Rim Chase Hunter not able to connect a lot of in and out on both sides here in the first few minutes we might not have seen that at all in the first half the shots going down in the first 20 minutes both of these teams efforts defensively I mean they stay after it and theyre continuously alert thats a big time move by Peter sooner we talked about his Inside Out versatility remember Galloways a strong player and hes a fifth year player and hes still able to take advantage in the post you know pseudo probably a little bit more motivated tonight hes the leading scorer on this team but he didnt get a point against Louisville as the fouls whistled against him right there you know thats a bit of motivation against a high major and he gets buckets like this well I mean thats a nice move Galloway getting a little bit too high and thats just sooner playing Big Boy ball 65 I would venture to guess maybe even closer to six six big broad shoulders good balance footwork and a finish Music freshman from Carmel Indiana this really a veteran team you mentioned it only one a freshman getting time yeah only one freshman he happens to be on the floor right now and Ben Johnson whos hit a couple of Threes but if you have to settle into this system to realize that the offense is going to find you if youre patient and thats not an easy thing to teach a lot of freshmen as patients tough shot from Tyson and the rebound batted to Galloway the floater in the lane and the Tigers back on top Applause Music Reverend Galloway not seeking his shot as much tonight but eight points hes been efficient suit or no look righthanded hook good contest by middle Brooks there on hop and meadowbrooks just using his strength on the interior nice play now the double teams coming you have to recognize where its going to come for him a nice move the big fella from Florida thats not a big part of his game mostly a dirty word guy good balance spin to the Baseline uses his size to get over the top now the crowd getting behind the Tigers a little bit here and a foul whistled against Music see who this is on here its going to be on middle Brooks but his activity Quark has really helped this Tigers team he stays active Taps it out Galloway hell pick it up and gather it a little floater next possession down middle Brooks ends up with the ball in a semibreak good fake uses his weight finishes over the top occasions its a development bucket right there last year he probably travels when the double team comes or throws it away or kicks it thats one of those things but he he has developed into a better player in large part because hes needed to over the summer with PJ Hall being out Grandma now wanted an illegal screen out there on the left wing didnt get the call its been a physical game Buck if you look around the floor guys are bleeding Alex him away hes got a big patch of blood that is a physical move how about that strong righthanded move puts his shoulder in the defense has the advantage finishes over the top Music one point game wheres the ball go inside out from PJ Hall Chase Hunter gets the roll thats where hes made that stepwalk is being a reliable guide when the game is sort of into balance staying poised maintaining his composure and knocking down a big shot and its physical this has turned into a physical basketball every cut has been physical guys are playing extremely hard on every cut trying to ramp up that thats an interesting trip right there I dont see that too often middle Brooks I mean thats a good call but you can see theyre trying to embrace being more physical here in the last five or so minutes clock after giving up a couple of easy buckets early in the second half last foul on Wiggins how about that back door cut Wiggins again defending six to shoot tough shot from Johnson Tyson going to lead the break and now going to slow it up a little bit I like the decision get what you want out of this break right here find a way to get PJ the ball little floppy action as Hemingway works his way off and you have to be more responsible with the basketball youre only up four Wiggins comes off the screen you got to make a better inbounds pass but this is a grown move and sooner he can knock down threes sure he shoots it at a 36 clip so far this season but where hes really good is attacking the rim and using those broad shoulders sooner 65210 you already pegged Hunter Tyson is 30 years old PJ Hall a grown man Junior and he had a shot over both of them Lefty three yes sir how about big 42 hop coming in hitting his second three of the night and he does it with consistency this is not some luck of the draw shot he hit big shots against Louisville and theyre upset PJ being forced to come out and guard after a lot of movement not an easy cover Galloway downhill foul on the give Tigers will go to the line and Bellarmine knocking down shots Mr hopp stepping out the fiveman every part of the rim and Bellarmine battling and theyre fired up about it are

special Music sometimes you just have to take a leap Formula One cars are like aircraft but upside down theyre creating lift but theyre creating lift in the opposite sense were pushing the tires into the ground the only bit that actually touches the ground are the tires so as much downforce as you can have its just key to going faster through those phases aerodynamics is doing a prime performance differentiator on a Formula One car so thats also why we dedicate a lot of resources a lot of focus on aerodynamics foreign about Chase Hunter I just think part of his development is trying to be a good example to his younger brother Dylan and then youve got the nassifes on the Clemson roster as well so he got two sets of Brothers which makes for an interesting Dynamic its the only School in the country with two sets of Brothers on a team theres several teams with Brothers on their respective Collegiate basketball teams but having two says a lot about the family atmosphere here in Clemson kind of bringing that extra guy and Chase and Dylan were both highlevel recruits both top 100 were Crews to be able to get both of those guys in the fold regardless of of if they were brothers or not was huge the Dylan was committed to Baylor for a long time at the end of his process decommitted and ended up here in Clemson and Brad Brownell certainly appreciative of that as weve got a foul inside on hop and this will be his fourth foul this is significant now Clemsons in the bonus theyre in 11 this game could very well come down to free throws because of how physical its been played away for the basketball and thats where the majority of these foul calls have occurred Paul Applause Ian shefflin going to the line knocks it down shuffling 73 points 67 rebounds a game as a sophomore he had a great opener with a doubledouble 20 and 14 against the Citadel he was excellent against the Citadel and he he is what he is I mean hes a strong kid a little bit undersized at the five position but he can step out he does his early work Music and theyre going to need him to be big here in the stretch run at this ball game trying to implore his team to defend here up by three with seven and a half to play for the time way too strong there and quick from Suiter tigers on the brakes and that is another Remeron shuffling getting out in transition and thats where he poses a different threat than PJ PJ in the half court in a set offense youre going to be in better shape but shefflin out in transition the balls moving up the court and he ends up with a nice nice one around the rim 30 second timeout for Bellarmine what makes for a great story a great story has magic power and every once in a while it has Miracles its an opening that sucks you in and a mindblowing ending that has you hanging on every snack thats what makes for a great story and as luck would have it thats our story Applause Music walk us through how Ian shefflin turns defense into offense right here too this is all about effort youre going to see number four highlighted on the screen shot goes up it comes off he does his early work boxes out and look at his effort running the floor Chase Hunter nice Advance pass and Sheffields rewarded thats a big time move whenever youre struggling in the half court some those extra effort plays and running the floor hard give you extra opportunities to get easy looks Tipton nice pass underneath Applause bets pump fake now again nice will take their time tipped in a deep three in and out another one Applause scramble on the floor shefflin gets rid of it to chase Hunter three on three Chase will do it himself even he was shocked transition Bank from the top of the key toes on the line it was a twopoint basket Clemsons opened up its largest lead now seven its a big possession here for the knights 6 20 to play bets nowhere to operate and Hemingway two handsy on the drive Hemingway a little bit too much but Chase Hunter you need him to hit big shots hes hit some in the past few possessions but how about this whats that saying clock its better to be lucky than good oh Im not sure they might need to go back and look at that one yeah is open from the top of the key no less Music I still prefer the wheelchair Bank that was my favorite one I like that one too free throw Ive been good for Wheeling hes now got 10 he leads all Bellarmine scores Brad Brownells asking Raymond Steins right now if they can look at that theyre going to look at to see whether it was a three and I think Brad Brownell is going to like the result here he certainly has a point I thought he was behind 6 16 to play and now the Tigers are up five look where Clemsons gotten their points here in the recent possessions playing with Pace getting out and running a little bit and then making quick decisions and even sheplin a grown man move Chase Hunter an excellent pass from the top of the key schifflin doing shifling things with his effort and strength around the bucket Ian shefflin what a second half for him look at this strong move with his back to the goal thats an excellent entry pass bets getting up tries to maintain his verticality hes fired up that was a big time finish by the sophomore shuffling now with nine points and the Tigers up eight 6153 Applause in the corner Wheeling hes been the hot hand Applause bets sheds a Defender and a foul not a travel crowd wanted to travel but its going to be Hemingway that gets a whistle and himaway got off balance thats what happened on that possession did he was there a lot of contact no but whenever you get up over top like that its really tough pleading his case over there not going to win the argument thats Alexs third Applause bets will head to the line foreign end of the one and one Applause thats four of five on free throws coming in this Bellarmine team just a hair under 74 percent of the year and theyre right on that tonight eight of eleven thus far Applause Music second free throw to even move the net Eve the Bellarmine nice credit I its its consistent their efforts consistent oh wow Fallon Chase Hunter and that was a heck of a tumble by Suiter wow I want to see this because there was a lot of contact but at the same time that is I mean its a good call you cant run directly into him and he did sell it sure thats about as much of a moving screen as Ive seen thats the first empty possession for Clemson in a while they made six straight shots its turned into a really physical basketball game fatigued maybe playing a factor in some of that all poked away Galloway tried to chase it down it will be nice ball with nine to shoot and 5 13 on the game clock check out the hands here getting out in trade Galloways done a nice job in the early season of getting out in the passing lanes and trying to initiate the break but theres not a lot of mistakes for this Bellarmine team almost able to capitalize difference there in a run out dunk and a ball out of bounds is inside outside hand right foreign Music Applause Drive no go for Tipton tigers by six Applause Music crowds starting to really get into it while the energy in the building over the last two minutes has really improved and a lot of it is because of how physical bellermans plan Tyson off balance theres a rare Miss first and seven shots for the Tigers Knights playing with a little different energy right now a little different pace to him three on the way no good Applause I dont like this call at all Balkan and Im not sure Applause a foul by Hemingway Hemingway trying to box out and hes been guilty of this but they are coming up underneath and hooking his arms you see on the on the left arm of Garrett Tipton he gupps up underneath and that results in the Falcons I feel like him anyway hes holding on for dear life and thats happened pretty consistently over the last three minutes I mean the fourth foul in hemenway again youre late in the game so no need to really sub but Middlebrooks with four and him and way with four right now for Clemson you see it Alex with six points on a couple threes Music its in hits both free throws and here come the knights again just chipping back into this one a fourpoint game Applause Music Hemingway looking for a three finds it thats the same play in the first half a screen and roll and then you have a replace guy as Hemingway coming up getting his feet set and knocking it down Applause physical Drive no good on the layup by Suiter but he earned a couple of free throws foul on Galloway big three for him and way here to you and its that same roll replace

went to break the Tigers were up seven and went back and reviewed Chase Hunters bank shot that was originally called the two and theyve ruled it a three now thats a good call and by multiple angles they have more cameras in here quality a lot of other places youre right that way yeah an excellent look right here just behind the line and were gonna get one more look at it terrific camera work all the way around but right behind it in a bank on this occasions worth three Music that gives Hunter 12 points he leads all Clemson scores we talked about balance in the open for Bellarmine Clemsons got balance theyve got four and double figures and two more with nine tonight what you have to whenever you play a team like Bellarmine its really good on the health side that ball has to move right and whenever you swing it gets a second side offense the beneficiary is going to be the whoever the open man is not one particular player and on a night when PJ Hall has been good but hes struggled because he just doesnt seem to look or feel right you have other guys stepping up in his place Music Suitor splits a pair of free throws hes got nine now Whelans got 11 theyve got three with nine one with eight so again the balance theme holds true for the knights inside Feet Again shuffling block but a foul and I know he was going to try to dunk it but going up with your left hand you get an end one opportunity nonetheless nice job in pass BETs just not big enough to compete on the inside thats a heck of a mismatch right there bets is 63 and he was hes the ace on Defensive Player of the Year in the preseason so I mean hes switchable hes strong hes smart but at the same time sometimes six inches in height I mean that thats a lot to overcome shefflin looking extend the lead to nine and does and matches Clemsons largest of the night Applause Ian shefflin with 11 points a lot no good Suter cant find it and he never really grabbed that ball fully and just hope to tip it in but nice set coming out of a timeout you get a good look you have to convert if youre Bellarmine Music Hunter lob inside another paint finish for the Tigers and thats schifflin being physical even though theyre playing in front of him and what happens is you get that ball on the top of the key or towards the freethrow line its hard to send help over that direction especially when you make a quick decision to score Applause Chase Hunter get a good call for a bump you could see that a mile away Applause lets look back at that shuffling play and this was a great pass but youll see coming from the top of the key where the help side is number two prime or friend gets over a little bit too late and thats what happens it makes that rotation a lot longer coming from the corner thats two for two from the Line rims it out tonight with four missed free throws and just two for ten on threes after the half this has been an impressive display by both teams but Clemson to be able to after theres about a four minute stretch at the beginning of this half cloth where Clemson lost focus a little bit on the defensive end especially off the ball gave up a couple of back doors theyve stepped up that intensity back and its led to easier buckets Hoff back on the floor with four fouls billerman though needing his presence inside hes guarding shefflin down the floor right now Music and chases it I mean hes just so good with the basketball putting him in screen and rolls with a lot of room to operate Galloway strong move and finish thats a big time move Galloway he has shocked some people with his ability to put the basketball on the floor thats a big time move he didnt do that last year at Boston College struggled with some injuries certainly capable how about Wheeling with a nice move just couldnt get the roll and all those shots all those little Bank shots that were occurring in the first half not falling here in the second theyre still getting the same opportunities the same looks and I I think I counted seven or eight times where theyve just hit every part of the rim and out Hunter thats an exclamation point and who else I mean Galloway realizing what he could do setting up Chase hunter in the corner Music Applause thats a hard foul there on Galloway I dont think that was intentional truth be told looked like they ran together and maybe he was trying to keep bets from falling there Galloway playing exceedingly physical but here on the opposite side Alex Hemingway seeing the floor nice move attacking a closeout he didnt have that in his bag last year College of Charleston he did when he played Nickelodeon moves up to to the ACC level and now things change a little bit but his ability to put it on the floor is a welcome addition but were going to take a look at this last foul trying to get back it looked like he was trying to hold him up it didnt seem like there was all that much right there trying to hold him up right thats what it looks like I mean the bump is the foul right theyre not calling the grab I think the foul had already been administered at that point that being said we are glass half full guys for sure right I could see if youre a Bellarmine fan where it looks like hes pushing him down on a cut to an open layup right but at the same time Music theyre gonna call a flagrant one so itll be two shots and the basketball for Bellarmine a little shocking if you ask me I didnt think it was completely intentional but it was a nonbasketball play therefore resulting in two free throws in a basketball for the knights plays fourth foul so this could be big for the knights here again theyre going to need quite a lot of things to go their way down 15 with 141 to go but Im not sure theyre a team thats really geared to do something like that if they are though theyre going to score with the clock stopped and then potentially if you can get this in a three a fivepoint possession all of a sudden the mass starts to make a little more sense but youre right though this is you talked about it running team in football thats right well you look at Virginia too are they a team thats built to come from behind not necessarily right because of the pace they play theyre still going to run some clock whenever they do run some offense whos going to be that guy for them to get them back in it quick thats the question or do they even have that kind yeah Ben Johnson who checks into the ball game number 33 he can knock down some shots as well takes his injury Clemson needs a stop here Music three of the five players on the floor right now for Bellarmine if hit threes today and Whelan wasnt one of them thats his first threepoint make and a fivepoint possession and a timeout with 138 I love that its a curl screen bringing in Johnson whos a shooter as a decoy to come off a screen and curl and he takes shiflins guy with him schifflin number four coach Brownell give him giving him a talking to but schifflins been good today though Paul hes been terrific especially in his second half hes got 11 points and a lot of us been on effort plays whether it be rolling to the basket running the floor with Pace getting easy layups and then the majority here lately have been off hard post postops and post speeds to where hes just exerting his strength and hes been good at times this season you mentioned 20 and 14 Against The Citadel in the first game of the year and hes somebody who doesnt just survive on effort places somebody can step out on the perimeter he hasnt shown that as much today but at the same time certainly bringing value with his effort shuffling a sophomore from Grayson High School and Loganville Georgia Music Clemson needs to handle this pressure and Chase Hunter has been a terrific point guard for you this is going to be a big part of what he does and his development how do you handle pressure when they send a second Defender and theres an example where he needs to grow pass miss the layout and Hunter the rebound so close from suder and this ball oh it found Galloway I thought it was thrown to space personally Applause coach Brownell motioning Chase to come over nice grab by Galloway hell shoot too but this is a part of Chase Hunters development as the point guard of this team right handling pressure in less than a minute 30 to go and your teams up theyre going to send that extra guy he doesnt turn it over much Paul but this is another part where he hasnt necessarily been in this situation as much up a certain amount of points has to control the has to control the ball just so you can run some clock at the end yeah to that point eight assists three turnovers for Chase today that gives him 23 assists to six turnovers on the season Music Applause Knights need a bucket after two free throws from Galloway and they cant afford to use a lot of clock here and yet they are this is kind of what you say Clemson up well you got to get a shot up in a hurry and thats obviously not one that you want through the Bellarmine Knights and it looks like they might let them play it out it looks like theyre not going to foul Tigers will use the clock here and get a shot up 12 and as you say this is a very good win for the Tigers and their fans certainly appreciate the effort and they should I mean this is a wire to wire game people dont understand how difficult of a game this is to play as a player and how about a cherry on top a little bit short see if the knights can finish on a positive note here this is a gritty wind call I mean for Clemson to be able to get this against the bellarmint team thats already had upsets in the early going of this season but to be able to maintain your focus theres a threeminute slip up at the beginning of the second half after that I mean you have to applaud their effort off the ball their intensity this is a much better win than I think people realize Tiger shot 54 percent in the second half they fell behind Tio like you said they had to play a little bit of gut check time they went to PJ Hall Chase Hunter and then Ian shefflin close it out for him was terrific Chase Hunter hit some big shots as well but to be able to maintain
