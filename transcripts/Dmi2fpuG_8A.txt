theres basili his first points in a hokey uniform they wont be the last this guy can really score Robinson too strong on the midrange pullup Stayton knocks it down well its Dayton just a sophomore out of Saint Francis had 12 points in the exhibition game really nice combo guard Delaware States got a big team out there too Evan Padula knocks down the triple he might be the most improved player on the team and thats saying a lot because he had an outstanding freshman year into a new role this year Sean Padula the Hokies starting point guard Applause hello air State couple of good possessions offensively Robinson trapped Somerville yes wow Ray Somerville transferred from Cal State Bakersfield is a big good looking player he was the most enthusiastic player in two practices too very vocal For A Center he was really the vocal leader of the team in practice no doubt about it he plays with such energy hasnt played in a college game since November 18th of last year Padula tries another and connects Applause you know last year he made open threes this year he can take shots with his hand in his face hes really worked hard on his game tied at eight and theres the defense on display from Grant basili oh the Hokies without one of its star players tonight graduate four Justin mutts serving a onegame suspension by the NCAA for participating in a nonncaa certified event during the prenba draft process he gets suspended on the same day Louisville gets a slap on the wrist lets dont even go there Hokies are feeling it from Deep you like three pointers Matt I love threepointers were gonna see a lot of them tonight between both of these teams Applause the Delaware State transfer is already making a big difference heres Stone Stayton contested in and out Hokies are probably not as good defensively as they were this time I mean last year they were outstanding on the defensive end it wasnt talked about enough they talked about the offense a lot but they were really good defensively this team can be really good defensively but but theyve got a ways to go to get that chemistry that last years team had Applause Music Lynn kid drawing the start for Justin Muntz basili blocked Somerville in a great spot for the Hornets Applause sometimes in these early season games you get a big size differential this time Delawares date is the team was the size advantage Couture swatted away Staton all right now Music Applause too strong there could tour the long rebound Applause s are immediately up on Couture college basketball has returned to Castle pokies leading 118 at our first media timeout foreign Waterman in his second season as the coach at Delaware State Mack you could make the argument hes the best high school basketball coach in the state of Delawares history oh I dont think theres any question about that 30 years eight championships uh he had one of the great programs there and a really interesting hire unconventional background and there is coach Mike young in his fourth season at the helm Music unbeaten and Conference Championship games won five at Wofford and of course last year the ACC ENT yeah Mike young has done such a good job you know a lot of folks said Wofford you know and they they had no idea how good a coach this guy was if they said that he said brought on a couple of Subs Couture go slashing to the rack and is fouled and two of those 10 newcomers now in the game for Virginia Tech Music Applause foreign you know hes hes gonna have to do those kind of things because everybody is going to get up in his face so hes going to have to make plays off the dribble and and not that he didnt do it last year but hes going to have more opportunities because the word is absolutely out on him Music of course Couture dropped 31 points made Seven threes against Duke and that ACC Championship Game Mack what can you say about that performance yeah its just again storybook fairy tale just just really an unbelievable situation he is a hes a hero for his life for Virginia Tech fans Applause foul on the Hokies Applause Music Elijah Poteet trying to get through a screen the transfer from rice something right down the road Reidsville North Carolina staff had a history with him recruiting him when they were at Wofford even talented freshman Muniz Robinson leading scorer that returns from a year ago and an easy tap in there for Brandon Stone yeah hes a triple chance for Lasalle Robert Morris and now hes at uh Delaware state but it grew like 10 inches or something well talk about that as you see the transfers coming into Blacksburg Sealy Camden Poteet all can make an impact this year beautiful step back from Couture Poteet the board and were going the other way a little too aggressive there Elijah motifs yeah he big old guy hes already picked up a couple quick ones and well see another newcomer come in for him OT you mentioned from Reedsville shot 62 percent last year incredibly efficient its really really skilled big body hes a different dimension and we talked about Virginia Techs got so much more depth than having a lot of it with size Applause Delaware State hanging tough only down two but Padula forces the turnover yeah fronting the pose he got switched off really nice job about Padula Music Applause good head fake and he connects once again John Padula a whole different dimension from Storm Murphy Murphy did a great job knew the system really well but Padula is a bigger stronger scoring point guard Tech is four of six from downtown Music Applause up against Muniz Somerville off the backboard Applause Couture wide open hell make you pay the last time they were here last time Delaware state was here Virginia Tech made 213s Applause Music man our officials chatting with Coach Young Tom crew tonight Jamie lucky Jerry heater Chase Shaw hes not a big name but he will be his dad Curtis long time very good official probably great official but I you know I dont want to call it him great right I wish we could have a camera before the game so you could see the officials interact with Mack before the game lemon Warren well the Hokies are feeling it from distance now five of seven yeah Mike Youngs offense has always been kind of threepoint Centric and you see a little bit of evidence of that right here its such a big part of what they do it opens up an awful lot of things when people have to guard you that far out Music largest lead of the first half by eight Applause and munis traveled a good defense right there got Munoz off hes a really good player got great skills great vision Applause Music attack shooting 54 from the floor pull up in and out from one of The Talented freshmen MJ Collins theyre going to be a really good player out of Clover South Carolina theres the height Brandon Stone you know you were mentioning that he grew a lot heres the staff for you mack Brandon Stone he grew 10 inches from seventh grade to his junior year of high school two and a half inches a year he went from playing point guard in Middle School to four of the five in high school he still got skills here he is catching in the low post got the mismatch and finishes over Padula see how much he took his time you know nothing rushed he had the height Advantage really nice post move Music wide open Vasily drills it you cant leave anybody on the floor open for Virginia Tech averaged 18 a game last year in Wright State Applause played in the NCAA tournaments Music Applause Camden Applause Music now Darius Maddox almost a fourpoint play hes headed to the freethrow line when we come back Virginia Tech leading Delaware state 2314 and Virginia Tech played its 2019 and Virginia Tech made a School record 21 threepointers and again math is not a strong suit but theyre on a pace theyve got six in less than nine minutes even I can figure out that would break the record if they continue that Vasily and Padula have combined for 19 of text 23 points yeah and Couture has the other four only three players have scored Applause 13 Darius Maddox was fouled on a threepoint shot before the break the golden rule never fouled the jump shooter last year Maddox shot over 50 percent from distance it got better every year he was here and certainly was one of the big heroes in the tournament only knocked down the gamewinner against Clemson that would be that would qualify 11 Point hokey lead its their largest tier of the first half Delaware state has hung really tough heres Perkins really talented player that could start they like him coming off the bench dad an assistant coach Shahid Perkins who played at East Tennessee State beautiful pass from Staton but stit unable to finish Applause no call and a basket for medics coach Waterman up were asking for the travel the charge something Music Delaware State theyve got size theyve got athleticism theyve got depth theyve got really good point guard play this is a good looking basketball team they only won a couple games a year ago theyre going to win a lot more than that this year Evan and Delaware State trying to snap a 24game losing streak but even though last year a tough first year for Coach Waterman they played really tough down the stretch a year ago and theres the first points for MJ Collins Applause lets talk about the Hokies transfers Delaware State they only have four players back from last years team yeah that is an infusion of talent right there and you can see the energy and effort they play with Applause foreign Applause defensively there for tacky fowles and what opportunity coming its Cameron stent who came in from Florida Southwestern his first points with the Hornets this is a really nice play makes the contact realizes the defense had a disadvantage and goes up through the contact and finishes nice play by camera instead just out of Charlotte North Carolina now he went to Juco route right out of high school now what kind of advantages can that give you before you make your next college Choice yeah the big thing is that you get to play right away some good experience gets good competition Music works for a lot of young men Applause Music Applause Music here we see Couture playing a little point guard this is where we havent talked about Rodney rice whos been hurt all fall the outstanding freshman from DeMatha Catholic he would normally be in that kind of situation from Collins and the finish a couple newcomers finishing Applause Music foreign Music first point guard played for Coach Waterman in high school nice dribble penetration and kick out to Stayton Applause Collins a lot of hype around MJ Collins fourstar recruit Sealy backs down Stitt tough bucket if you really score all three levels threepoint shot he can pull it up from midrange and you see him back back down into the post right there Muniz you know too strong freshman from Bethlehem Pennsylvania Applause Music Applause stays hot in his hokey debut it would be fun to watch he can play either position he can play the five or the four normally hed be into five if Justin mutts were in there but playing a lot of four for this lineup only player in double figures he has 15 Applause Maddox a little too much he thought about that one there Mack yeah you gotta you cant hesitate Music Applause Music Somerville cuts the deficit to 16 Applause Music Im glad to have you on your Monday night here at Castle Coliseum Avenues Matt McCarthy our entire ACC Network crew vasili another triple petite fouled on the way up silly with 15 points heres the last three a little general penetration sizes them up Grant basili one of the notable transfers of the Hokies got in the offseason you know he averaged 18 a game last season Matt he already has 15 tonight yeah youve seen him shoot the ball youve seen him post up he has a nice midrange game he really runs the floor the kind of the question is hes not as big as Aluma was offensively you know you know that probably a wash maybe even a little bit of an advantage for him facility defensively is where he could have some matchups on some nights which will be difficult but you can always move him over to the four and come in with with kid and Poteet and and get a bigger lineup in there and of course Justin mutts is pretty versatile in the front line too as soon as he gets back from this one game suspension which were not going to talk about 17point lead for the Hokies Perkins turned away Perkins played for Coach Waterman like we mentioned in high school Music one state championships blocked from Couture how about Dad tour has developed into such a good Defender you know and shot blocking is not part of that really but but it was on that flight thank you Applause Somerville feeds the buzzer what what good awareness though a big guy gets it on the out of bounds play based on out of bounds knew exactly how much time and yeah he bangs it in but give him credit for uh not only making the basket but by being aware kid through two Defenders unable to get it to go with the left hand kid is really grown and uh physically and and as a just a basketball player understanding the game and hes made a lot of progress youre going to see a lot of him on the floor this year hes not a new face necessarily but didnt play last year so I count him as one going the other way foul on Delaware State lets take a look Music erville Ray Somerville Baseline out of bounds do the shot clock was going down painted in banks still open doesnt matter I dont have any money anyway Music Couture Applause mathematics off a screen yes gets the friendly roll really nice play back here got Maddox that shot dribble handoff bumped into bumped into Madisons man just a little bit Maddox had the room to get it up there Applause but silly going to work on Stone finishes at the round thats a confident offensive player right there took his time knew where the defender was Applause Music Stayton connects on a tough pullup jumper probably really a nice player we mentioned Saint Francis as uh has a lot of good basketball players come out they have a lot of good football players come out there but high energy guy had an injured shoulder last year but youre seeing why they like him kid traveled Music Subs will come on Collins as well as John Camden Applause been talked a lot about Camden he didnt play last year in Memphis another one that the staff recruited out of high school is from downington Pennsylvania but he can really shoot the basketball Applause enough Robinson with a good look Applause Music Camden going to get involved pokeys have been so good tonight from distance Music 7 out of 12 from long range just under four minutes until halftime were back to Castle after these messages Applause for the Hokies with 17 first half points to be a consistent score you have to do different things you have to have some diversity in your game and youre seeing that from basily he can put it on the floor if you give him space he can knock down the three clearly thats why hell be consistently a good score night in and night out twotime all Horizon League second team selection and this is somebody that a lot of Big Time programs wanted to get out of the portal so he came to this big down program Applause Music you see tournament Championship has not hurt Virginia Techs recruiting at all Music no doubt about it Music Applause Music 10 to shoot kid looking for his first points and he slams it home in between two Defenders would you call that emphatic I would what about you I dont think theres any question his first points were pretty impressive Applause we talked about how much kid has improved you see the spin move right there split the Defenders and hes got the quickness to get up and finish at The Rim this is someone who played in just 10 games last year coach Young he said really good things about the offseason that hes had yeah hes grown an awful lot physically and just as a player skill wise Applause Music hes got that weight room with David Jackson who does such a great job started his career and Clemson fourstar recruit coming out of high school Applause Music Applause Robinson nearly a great take theres Tekken transition Collins rise and fire three off the front rim no look pass and kid slams it down he deserved it he got the rebound kicked it out got it back Applause 21 point lead Music Applause Staton big bucket there for Delaware State nice answer right there Music they have struggle on the offensive end for a little bit Satan has made a couple big baskets like that hes the only Hornet now into double figures Padula a little teardrop there kid basili yes Priscilla gets a credit but kid made the play Sealy with 20 first half points for the Hokies foreign facili has made a nice introduction to hokey fans 20 points in the first half four of six from Deep Mack how would you describe the first half of Grandpa silly uh hes been outstanding and there wasnt any question in my mind that he was going to be able to do this most nights not not necessarily 20 points in the first half but hes going to be a consistent score hes a really good offensive player and and did it at a high level even at Wright State and again there will be some nights where he has a tough match up on the other end of the floor but hes a versatile guy Virginia Tech has a chance to be really special on the offensive end he aint got a lot of weapons again no Justin mutts tonight no Rodney rice two big contributors to this team two guys thatll play a big part of this team in January and February and you would hope deep into March Music Robinson puts it on the deck Johnson at the elbow missed it Applause Sean Padula nine points has knocked down all three of his threepointers new role this year for Purdue yeah you know he is the point guard he played significant minutes of point guard last year in place of storm Murphy in some situations but uh now its his team to run and uh that thats a whole different level of responsibility but he has really worked hard you can see physically hes hes improved himself and uh and certainly he has worked hard on his game and uh he had flashes of Brilliance a year ago and now he needs to be doing that every single night if Virginia Techs going to duplicate what they did last season or even improve on that Music under 90 seconds Applause Music Hornets would love some momentum going in to the locker room dispatch right here Stone leans into Couture who stands tall in the defensive end but Stone Too Tall stayed with it really nice job by Brandon Stone Music Applause Music completely looking for another triple you bet foreign ER of the first half putting on his show Music Applause Music you might think this is a replay of a replay of a replay and the awareness of his teammates back to find the red hot shooter yeah Mike Youngs teams will always be unselfish they will always share the basketball and when somebodys got the hot hand they do a nice job of getting them the ball on a regular basis nine for 15 not quite on that pace for 21 but not far off of it Applause Hokies are shooting 61 from the floor Music Applause Music Applause Music Perkins Applause foul staying here on the hoagies yeah a little contact when the ball was coming off the rim but silly a little extra push Music Applause Music and the Hornets in the bonus Music now for Coach Waterman Squad Mac theyre shooting 40 from the floor theyve had flashes of good moments on offense they really have theyve just not not been able to make quite enough buckets to keep up with Virginia Tech was just on fire thank you theres 18 points difference in the game just from the threepoint arm Music Applause Music Applause Music s shot clock turned off and the Hokies can hold for the final shot youll see a little two two one pressure threequarter Court from Delaware state right here give Virginia Tech a little different look thank you Applause so you can play kind of passively or they can be aggressive and trapped Music Applause theyre a half court mantoman which which Waterman is known for Padula with five create space pagulla rattles it through Applause and that is good Perkins beats the buzzer wow Perkins a coachs son totally aware of what was going on Justin Muntz students have shown out tonight yeah really good crowd for nine oclock game on a Monday night and theyve been into it of course its an easy game to get into when youre scoring points like the Hokies are right now Applause Music a tour wide open and the stick back is there from Grandpa ceiling Ive got more tricks Ive got more tricks I can tip them in too Music 25 points Applause Music Nunes with freshman air balls Applause got off to such a good start hadnt done a lot since then Music Maddox too strong Applause back what do you think the biggest message from Stan Waterman was to his team at halftime I think the thing was just played with confidence on offense they did a lot of good things and then you didnt make shots and uh and clearly the number one message was you better find those shooters Music Padula rise in fire in and out yeah nice green by kid right there got Padula open he made tough shots when he had people on him maybe he was too far open and Muniz loves it a little too high trying to find Brandon Stone yeah Stone thought Couture pushed him in the back Applause Music the official disagree Music uh and Muniz checks out koi Parker in the game I dont remember seeing him in the first half and he played really well in their exhibition the grand transfer from Livingstone and 13 in the exhibition three for three from long range and only four players back from last years team is Padula finds basily and he stays hot from the first half foreign Applause was backing his man in the defense collapses and you kick it out to a wide open shooter thats always going to be a high percentage look Maddox in transition is foul could be really interesting to see Maddox on the floor as a starter and not coming off the bench and you know giving a lift that way but counted on every single night to produce consistently really talented young man coach Mike young told us that one of the new roles hes going to have on this team hes going to have to defend every small four yeah and and defense has been where he needs to grow the most uh but he but he really has worked at it missed some of the preseason with uh you know being nicked up a little bit Music see Jamie lucky at the scores table but in real time I thought it was on foyer Parker but Music Jamie lucky you guys go way back Mac way back Music uh one of those things yeah we had some trouble with the numbers that you know they had different numbers in practice and looks like the delay was that Parker was not in the scores book yeah its like theyve overcome that so everybodys satisfaction parkerys from Wilmington 50 minutes from Dover yep came home it was a 40 threepoint shooter at Livingstone Applause I know the Hornets are down here double figures but a team that went two and 25 a year ago Mac theres a great basket from Robinson you can see on what what theyve put on display the talent that they have oh I watched video from them last year this is a completely different organization they have revamped this program unbelievably in just one year Sam Waterman and his staff have done a really good job Applause Music Applause from Robinson finds a cutting Somerville cant finish off the glass so some size some space in there Music bothered that shot a little bit Collins great take Applause OT Music and a foul on the floor might be Brandon Stone well its almost Delaware State and how improved they are that the meac preseason poll theyre projected to finish the tie for seventh well this is a team that can certainly finish higher than that Mac yeah I like the overall that I like them finishing higher than that uh you know based on what weve seen here tonight and uh what we saw in practice I think coach water has done a nice job of this much he hes got an influx of talent and size and hes got some we just got a little depth too me Ax lost a couple teams on clown a and t and Hampton both in the colonial now Applause its Parker intercepted by Poteet connects with Maddox and the layup good thats one place where Maddox will really help this team he can really run the floor Applause Applause Stone left it short but a good looking release Applause Music Maddox steps back and finishes saw some of that last season for Maddox through 101 stuff the Hokies leading Delaware State 16 33 back after the Applause Frazier and and uh Craig leader Don Devoe was the coach hes the guy I worked for two years later I joined the staff and great memories and uh and what a great moment for Virginia Tech basketball when we talked to Coach young about that he talked about how those guys those were his Heroes growing up and what a shot that was by the way to winnings Bobby Stevens on beating Notre Dame on St Patricks Day Applause ton swatted Away by Applause Collins with the flush defense to offense gonna turn over block shot rebound initiate that fast break Applause Music Applause Poteet started him watch the squad oftentimes its the second guy heads up throwing it ahead to MJ Collins The Freshman from South Carolina Music foreign Music take a look at the ACC preseason poll North Carolina with 90 first place votes and you look at that top eight Mac itll be very competitive this year oh yeah and dont dont sleep on nine and ten and some of those folks either but uh the ACC has a lot of depth with good basketball teams they got a chance to have a bunch of teams playing in March Applause Martez Robinson goes one of two at the strike this is the first year Mack no Roy Williams no Coach K Applause EPT sometimes they are changing Applause there you see Delaware States numbers Grandpa Sealys numbers yeah they gotta they just gotta you know execute just a little bit better but uh I I give Virginia Techs defense a little more credit than coach than coach young did Music Laughter no but Celie with six three pointers if youre wondering what the program record for most in the game is nine by Couture and Justin Robinson theres a triple for John Camden I told you he could shoot it if hes open theres a real good chance that thing is going in Music and Delaware State answers right back with Staton whos been their best offensive option he really has been and Coach predicted that he told me this this guys gonna this guy is gonna really show you something because he was hurt last year and he has really worked on his game I coached against coach Waterman yeah tell us about that I was at Auburn and he played at Delaware there was a Christmas tournament in Chattanooga of all places VCU was the fourth team in there VCU finished eighth in the country we went to the Sweet 16 Chattanooga won a game in the NCAA and unfortunately for Coach we beat Delaware in a consolation match unbelievable memory and by the way who was on that Auburn team I had a few guys in the pros Chuck person Chris Moores Frank Ford Gerald white now all five starters were drafted in the NBA Staton teardrop off the glass its in well hes shown a lot of Versatility in his game too hadnt he a little two two one press try to change things up a little bit thats now a new careerhigh 12 points for Kyrie Staton Music Camden again rattles it through after that well when youve got that many weapons and you share the ball like Mike Youngs team share the ball youre going to put some points up Applause Maddox for Couture Applause Music and a whistle from Jerry heater Kyrie Staton sophomore from Baltimore how about this bucket hes a little crossover and the little teardrop off the glass Music this is someone in Stayton whos used to winning over his final two years at Saint Francis Academy of 595 combined record it could be a big piece for Coach Waterman and helping turn this program around uh no question and you can see how much better they are you know especially if you saw him last year this is this is nowhere near the same basketball team that that this Bunch only won two games with foreign Applause nice postup move created a little space Applause a lot of Subs on the floor for Delaware state Applause Music this is that one oh he checked there Ive been feeling it the last couple of minutes Hokies leading by 37 Johnson Applause and basili traveled with it Justin mutt stood up on the bench there as soon as he caught it on the wing pretty excited for his new counterpart down low Joseph buds is always excited he was probably working on another degree well its funny you bring that up Mack because he is you know he has his one undergraduate degree hes gotten two masters now hes going back and working on his second undergraduate degree in human development you and I are Underachievers I thought my one bachelors degree was good enough vasili bounced past petite and hes headed to the freethrow line when we come back opening night of college basketball Hoagies leading by 37 Applause Music Darius Maddox has had a nice start to the season tonight 12 points look good offensively yeah hes played a lot of minutes in his new role and uh seems to be adjusted just fine such a fun player theres the step back he had a couple of minutes ago named Oak Hill Academy Applause Music Applause the numbers from his first year to last year significant step forward yeah hes a hes a impressive guy and efficient player and hes got some serious athletic ability out the open floor a little Flex offense right here a little Baseline screen and Screen down Applause Muniz finds Ronald Lucas his first minutes of the season Perkins with an air ball in the castle guard will let them know about it shot clock running down he had to get something up no iron Applause Music Delaware State theyve mixed up their defense a little bit shown different looks to the Hokies play some two two one and showed it about three quarter court and then they moved it back to about half court but they always fall back into that Sam Waterman mantoman Music its coach young I dont know if hes ever played zone defense but do all with a smile there you know he comes from a family full of great athletes including his brother Brendan who won a state championship in rugby hes got rugby in Oklahoma wow gotta be tough to play rugby yeah Music so majoring in sports media and Analytics Applause and hes up to 15 points yeah hes got a really solid game got off to a really good start Applause Lucas stays with it great concentration and a layup really nice job Ronald Lucas senior out of Baltimore hes had a couple of knee surgeries that have held him back but seems to be healthy now a rare turnover from the Hokies Muniz creates space cant convert Music Applause Music Applause poteets the transfer with the foul the rise transfer got skills right here he holds his man off on the post up creates that space no problem through the contact for this big guy morning 34 you think about the options that this Virginia Tech team has in the post obviously mutts and basily but poti kid Camden I think the word is depth Mac thats exactly right deepest team Mike young has had since hes been in Blacksburg Applause Music you look at this team almost through game number one as you see the scores from tonight Mack what is the biggest difference with this years team compared to the ACC Championship team from a season ago well the the thing we just talked about depth is the biggest thing and and especially depth on the inside you know last year if a little more mutts went out the you know Pickens were kind of slim but uh and they were able to play a lot of minutes they were smart basketball players they are smart basketball players but but now theyve got a little bit more uh theyve just got more bodies to put in there and look at the height these are players that are six foot seven or taller on roster yeah and and one two three four five of those are going to play fairly regularly Applause Couture comes back in and for Hunter tonight only six points but he hasnt had to score in volume like he can yeah and hes going to be the guy that everybody really you know gives their best scouting report on dude theyre gonna try to take him out of games because he can just change it but you can see you shut him down there are other answers out there for Mike young and his staff foreign we talked about it a little bit earlier both Rodney rice hurts he plays such an important role in terms of that ball handler and that guard spot foot injury and hes a really talented young man he can play one or two and he can score the basketball but a great passer great vision good size uh hell be a big addition when he gets back and I dont think hes far from being back if if Im reading the situation like and a foul called on John Camden doesnt love the call Music he got back thought he had all ball Music Aaron lemon Warren one of the new players on this Delaware State Squad came from Mount Zion prep such a wellrespected place famous School Tracy McGrady uh I think uh is probably one big name from there theyve had some outstanding players at Mount Zion Applause thank you the tour will run point for the Hokies start of a new college basketball season it is great to have it back Collins Oh What A Move left his short you can see the potential he has yeah hes a really good offense player he you know unlike you know freshman didnt they used they didnt used to be able to play right away just physically but you see these guys they come in ready to go Applause Music Lucas into traffic knocked away but silly trying to go up ahead to Collins Applause hes had numbers got to take care of that basketball though coach coach young as a saying dont be sloppy sounds really simple right that was sloppy and nothing but nylon for Brandon Stone started his career LaSalle then Robert Morris now with Delaware State back to Castle here in just a moment Applause a little bit like Vasily he can play inside but hes pretty comfortable stepping out too hes gonna really be a mismatch for a lot of people he and Stayton the only Hornets 10 or more points you know Brandon Stone hes tied his career high twice before 17 points first time he did it Mac was against Wright State and a freshman name Grant basui how about that thats a nugget right there Music so these two have shared the court before and both of them are in double figures theyve combined for 40 points well theyre both going to play big roles for their new teams Applause poteats just left it a little short potent against Somerville thats two strong young men lemon Warren Applause side Somerville I like that no call they call the charge could you call it a block play on I like that call a lot or lack of call Couture in and outs its also the first game for our officials and you mentioned a great crew we have Jamie lucky Jerry heater Chase Shaw theyre just as excited as the players to get back yeah they were ready to go Stone Off the Mark Applause Maddox kid and Padula will all check in I know were talking about the ACC a little bit earlier Mac in the preseason poll got a trivia question for you Hokies are trying to repeat as ACC champions the last team to go back to back was who goodness gracious Im gonna take a flyer and say Florida State ah okay Maddox with the buckets Duke 2010 2011 see that would have been too easy too obvious Applause well the Hokies have a chance Music now unveil their Banner on Sunday before the William and Mary game the Rings about a month ago during that West Virginia game great defensive play basily now on the other end lost the handle Robinson Stone streaks in in a silky smooth finish really nice job of running the floor by the big guy Applause there will be many nights in the meac where they they theyll be facing two six eleven guys who start for a team they have much more size than a team a year ago Applause looking forward to seeing year two for Coach Stan Waterman you know Jay Wright called him an outstanding leader when he got hired what are some of the biggest well talk about in just a moment Padula one on one no but there is bacilli to clean it up Mac to go from the high school race to division one what are the biggest adjustments that he faces I think just the responsibilities we talked about that and and I think just all the things that are on his plate uh you know in a different way you have a lot on your plate as a high school coach too but uh but a little bit more related to just basketball not academics or or any of the things that you have to deal with in uh in high school but coach Waterman he has he has done a good job in doing this fairly quickly and he has a tie with Virginia Tech too he and Mike Jones worked together with USA basketball and really have a lot of respect and of course they competed at the at the high school level for a long time feel like the basketball World Mack and you know this its a Its a Small World small community a lot of people know each other if you dont know them you know somebody that does Applause Robinson Music Applause Ken comes out stick leaves it a little short it might be coming up on 11 oclock but the student section is still here yes they are and most have been parked behind us Music over the years the castle guard has kind of grown a little bit it used to be behind the one of the baskets Padula to the rack hes denied Johnson Corrals it Padula another opportunity yes foreign with 18 points Applause Music and inside the kid Johnson Applause Collins swiped away Stayton one on one no call Delaware state at the last second able to pour that in you probably wont be showing that highlight basket is a basket that was that one was an eventual basket Applause on the third attempts 9153 our score but Doula pulls up kid it in nice job Applause two and a half left to play here in Castle Applause lemon Warren talented freshman ball gets stuck thats a possession arrow well stay with Delaware State how about Sean Padula Mack five out of eight from long range this was after an offensive rebound defense is scrambling he just teed it up on the way to 18 points on opening night Music Applause news and notes around the ACC heading into the year how about North Carolina ranked first in the eight people they get Armando baycott back yeah that was a big recruit too Music three teams in the poll North
