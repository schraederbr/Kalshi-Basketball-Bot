so were just about set to go theyre expecting a sellout today its a late arriving crowd here at the tuck but about to get it going we just watching a little bit of the Virginia Victory early a lowscoring game they won at 4947 over Wake Forest and the Blue Devils now trying to stay ahead of Virginia they got to second with their loss for Virginia earlier this week trying to stay in that second place one win behind Carolina try to feed downstairs to Baba Miller nice feed there by Deontay green but you see the Florida state picking up full Corp applying that pressure 94 ft and this is where you can miss Ty Tyrese Proctor the starting point guard for the Blue Devils but Kayla fost are handling it very well in the first possession fosted a freshman in there along with another freshman McCain pass will be tipped and collected by FSU and jir Watkins watch him today if he has a big day FSU is going to be in it all the way and he will lay that one in and Obi that is Florida State basketball that weve known to grow in love when you think about turning defense into offense they lead the ACC with over nine steals per game and turn a steel into a bucket on that possession so a quick start for the nolles out in front for zip up top Mitchell Bowski with a touch McCain will launch and swish it in knockdown shooter welcome to the tuck here in Tallahassee Florida its the seven OLS off to a quick start as Darren Green Jr who makes 38 from threepoint land knocks that one back and its 63 Florida state has the lead on Duke Duke coming in the number nine team of the country looking for their 20th win FSU looking for the upset Mitchell went airborne and that one rolled off the iron great job by Deontay green to be able to contest that even though it was a lob that should have been finished off jir Watkins with a misfire there the big news coming in today Tyrese Proctor averaging 10 points a game the 65 sophomore guard for the Duke Blue Devils did not make the trip because of a concussion suffered on Monday in the game against Wake Forest theyre going to need a lot of that today from Mark Mitchell whos really playing some great basketball and Mark Mitchell confident never even thought about once they were playing off of him just raised up knocked down the jumper foot on the line so hell only get two for that one but more important for Mitchells confidence that he made jir Watkins 26 points terrific against Virginia Tech and a loss this week hes got it in the corner and thatll rattle home he can be deadly also at 27 against circus but a great job by Jaylen warley creating an opportunity for Watkins thats one of the things that Florida State needs is a shot creator for Darren Green for Watkins guys who can put the basketball in the hole Jeremy roach 45 from three ducas a team hits 37 beyond the line filipowski downstairs draw the double and hell be fouled right along the Baseline that was with 10 seconds on the shot clock now Duke looking for their 20th win of the season for Florida State its been a very up and down year but the conference at the very top with that Virginia win earlier today and of course North Carolina at the very top its getting fun to watch it absolutely is and Duke trying to keep Pace with North Carolina stay ahead of Virginia but this has always been a tough place for the Blue Devils to have success the last time they were here they lost an overtime game and you can believe that the fans here in the tuck remember that theyre looking for a similar outcome here today y that was 7978 Duke all time has a big lead in the series as Mitchell will draw the foul they lead 43 11 they won 11 of the last 13 games as we check in with my Mecha yeah Duke and North Carolina obviously that was a big time match up but since then North Carolinas been one and two Duke has won three games in a row and really had a lot of momentum and it could set up a regular season finale between those two teams where the winner goes home with a regular season title in the ACCC with both of those teams coming into Saturday with three League losses and myin one of the things as you mentioned that three and 0 those last three wins for the Blue Devils they all have been at home now Duke gets out on the road for three straight so is there anything that the coach has talked to about earlier that may lead to their mentality being different through these games well they know theyve had some trouble here in tallah assd Cory two out of the last three games Florida state has won and theyve kind of had their number a little bit so they know they have to have a different attitude especially with Proctor out to get this win down here so Florida State might play 12 guys today John shy and Duke might play six maybe seven well in this game I believe John shires going to have to go a little deeper into his bench simply because Florida State picks up their pressure then without Proctor you can wear down these guards so I expect to see jayen Blakes who had 17 against Florida State the last time they played I expect to see him getting in Off the Bench Ro to penetrate Here Comes McCain little shove off there but he drops it down he is a tough guard thats a guy that you may want to leave out there for 40 minutes however Jared McCain has really been Dukes most consistent performer when you can take away the first few games of the season over the last 18 games hes probably been their most consistent guy Jor and it rattles on we were watching him shoot earlier today and in practice nailed everything FSU was doing that in the game now theyve made five of their first six well Darren Green came into the game with 356 made threepoint field goals so hes a guy that has traditionally been able to knock it down from Deep yeah he had 21 against Georgia 24 against North Florida he gets rolling he can be lights out rolling to the basket up and in for two cam cor the the 610 sophomore last eight games hes making 81 of his shots theyre all right about there and another nice find from jayen warley who now has two assists early in this game Mitchell on the back down no whistle see if they really let them play today filipowski got tangled up along the side well fsus got to be delighted with the way theyre shooting it out of the gates absolutely Darren Green Jr from Beyond The Arc filipowski too far back to be able to affect that and then jayen warley dropping the dime cam corn with the easy Music two the simol here and then we talked about the overtime matchup the last time Florida state was able to beat Duke on this floor coach ham of course has seen his fair share of exciting games as we mentioned 14 consecutive yeah overtime wins for the S which is an CAA record which is a joke right I mean how does that happen how does any coach any program win 14 straight overtime games in division one college basketball road to a launch and knocked down to three thats a confident shot for Jeremy roach over the outstretched hand of the what would what would he call him 612 Baba Miller who does he does not want to be called a sevenfooter so he go he goes by call me 612 junor giving off for Watkins hes their top score at 15 a game and they just keep making shots thats seven out of eight but too easy for Watkins to get into the painted area of course already knocked down a three ball so you got to honor him from Beyond The Arc but one the accs best you got to give him more resistance as we go over to Myra yeah Leonard Hamilton was just stressing the fundamentals arms outstretch making sure youre being active as youre playing these passes trying to deflect passes so hes been doing it a long time and you can see why hes had so so much success not pleased with this start well he cant be pleased with the Offensive start he has to be Florida State started this game six of seven from the field with no turnovers and OB this is a team that comes in with a negative assisted turnover rate in ACC play a minus two on the season they have eight points in the paint here comes filipowski down the lane to draw the foul and a big sophomore who does not mind being referred to as a sevenfooter will be headed to the line out of Westtown New York and freshman Jared McCain both had double doubles against wake this week yeah the third in the last four games for Jared McCain a a 62 guard rebounding the way that he has unbelievable the way hes been able to get to the glass yeah hes become Charles Barkley on the glass unbelievable Philip howski at the line 65 I think also one of the most underrated passers in the ACC wouldnt you agree absolutely absolutely and especially for a guy that gets the basketball in the post area so much to be able to drop dimes as we look at his 20 and 10 games this season six leads the ACC alongside nor cadir of Miami filipowski has had at least three assists in a game 18 19 times in his career and OB as Ryan Young comes in for filipowski youre talking about a young man who had 20 and 12 against FS last year so Im sure he was high on The Scouting Report for Florida State this week he doesnt turn in many like that so that was a huge effort itll be a whistle here with 1403 to go in the first half Florida State having Dro their last one at blackburg despite 26 from Watkins theyll shoot about 45 as a team 32 from Music three but in reality theyre defense has not been quite up to FSU standards this year oh absolutely not I mean thats the thing with Leonard Hamilton as hes talked about really doesnt have many veterans in the program to be able to teach the younger players as the way Florida State plays and the culture that has been established here truly over the last 10 to 15 years and having veterans to show the young guys Watkins with a shot clock down to six lost the handle he turns it over to Foster Duke with an opportunity to tie it up on a three but a foul in the paints will go against the seals seals with eight players scoring five points or more and nobody more than 15 points thatll go against their top scorer Watkins but Watkins over 17 in the last five games hes become their goto guy as he picks up the foul and one of those guys that Leonard Hamilton is had to trust this season even though hes in his first year with the semal 610 Jaylen gainy into the game now for Leonard Hamilton young up top for McCain straight away well its like a lamp for him but thats just a defensive Mistake by Primo Spears you got to understand Jared McCain at the top of the key even if there is a shooter on that Baseline you got to make sure you stay with the guy whos shooting over 40 one of the best Shooters in the Applause ACC Watkins kicks for the corner b Bowen in and out hes a 610 freshman and B Bowen now three of 21 from Beyond the arc on the season oh and speaking of freshman that can shoot it this young man may be the best in the league when you consider the confidence that hes playing with right now the Blue Devils on an 80 run M Kane with another one Duke four for their last five from threepoint land in the corner Spears Watkins trying to wle free dumps it downstairs blocked by Mitchell in transition here come the Blue Devils roach oh look away pass for young thats going to be blocked by Watkins so these two teams attacking each other defensively the officials taking a look and itll go the other way 16 jir Watkins not conceding the easy layup goes up top ooh I believe he got away with one on that one OB from that angle it looked like it hit the glass first and it does hit the glass first so jir Watkins fortunate that wasnt a go as Ryan young looks at the officials wondering why he did not get a bucket on that possession well traditionally Florida state is among the best or the very best shot blocking teams in the country its not been true this year he L steals yeah coach ham talked to us about that earlier today with each you know they dont play with the same size were used to playing seeing Florida State play with either McCain again uh oh yes uhoh another three for the outstanding freshman Jared McCain who is on fire and hes the biggest reason they have pulled off an 11 nothing run and hes really the biggest reason for the Resurgence of the Blue Devils they struggled to start ACC play this year Jared McCain has been the guy thats grown up right in front of our eyes bo b with a pullup pop got it to go he was actually born in a refugee camp in Egypt and adopted by a family in Vermont a son of parents who fled the second sunin Civil War 2218 Duke well McCain just wants it and why not when youre this hot filipowski powering his way and a travel now Jared McCain the story early Jared McCain has grown to love the State of Florida not one not two but three threepoint field goals for McCain in a row have to be able to handle the pressure and Duke does a great job on this possession as you see when Ryan young catches the basketball under the basket out of the Trap Primo Spears is stuck in between two players at that point you have to recognize who is the better shooter you have to take away Jared McCain make him make that extra pass to the corner to Caleb fer who hasnt shot to basketball as well as McCain has they maybe saves you three points but thats a layup for Jared McCain at the top of the key McCain 14 points four for four from three five for five overall sizzling to begin the game here at Tallahassee for Duke Duke is five out of six beyond the three and look at this OB Duke now in a Zone defensively thats the lack of respect they have for Florida State shooting theyre going to make someone have to make threes because its been difficult to get to keep them out of the paint so Watkins has it spin out man it was in the cylinder and Watkins Was Made a three already but this Florida State team shooting only 32 on the year only Darren Green and Tom house shoot over 33 so youll give those shots Road slithering inside they it up well short in transition Primo Spears Watkins wont wait and a foul on the play with 1029 to go and its difficult to draw a charge in todays game however Jaylen Blakes sets up camp in there and just waits for jir Watkins to run him over thats a play where Watkins Watkins has to either pull up or find a way to go around jayen Blakes that was a great call by Roger a often times is difficult to even get that call todays game so Duke basketball Jaylen Blakes at 62 the junior if you mention he scored 17 points against Florida State on December the nth of 22 that was in Durham we also talked about Ryan young getting 20 and 12 and a wild one and a 19point Duke Victory which is actually at Cameron indor but both of those reserves have had some some of the best moments of their career yeah against FSU both those guys had a big game against Florida State last year and now without Tyrese Proctor theyre going to be called on even more so throughout this game help also Sean Stewart Florida native from the Orlando area now getting into the mix Im sure his dad Yogis in stands as the Blue Devils turn it off FS with the pick hell go up against the blue shirts and lay it in and he Takes a Tumble into the photo thats a great finish by Primo Spears getting to the basket this a young man who wasnt available for Florida State early didnt get eligible until December the 16th but its been a double digit score for them since his debut roach to operate finds the lane just too quick Obie when you play against Florida State you have to have guys that can just win that individual matchup off the bounce because theyre going to switch everything defensive Jeremy Rose taking advantage of his quickness against Baba Miller on the last possession nickel brury looking inside 65 senior Miller trying to make a move hell draw the whistle now back to Roach a moment ago asking the 612 Baba Miller to go out and defend Jeremy roach that far from the basket is a tough task but what Florida State normally does with their bigs even when you beat them theyre able to go block that shot that time Rose does a great job getting it high on the glass avoiding the rim protector roads tops in the ACC and assist to turnover ratio rarely kicks it over and this will be picked off by Blakes up ahead of the field goes up strong and draws the foul hell be at the line for a threepoint Play Obie when you have a big game against a team you remember it and you play with confidence when you see them again Jaylen Blakes already starting the game with that type of confidence 17 points the last time these two teams got together and hes a young man that is awesome on the defensive end of the floor turning his defense into offense two points and an opportunity for three at the line and hell knock down the threepoint play 10 out of 11 at the line this season John sire loves Jaylen Blakes toughness he says hes the one guy that he knows is going to compete every possession when you put him on the floor Miller curling in boy thats a tough shot off the window yeah especially for a guy thats 612 youre talking about being able to move in the mobility for someone that size McCain in the lane and has it stripped and FSU comes away with it that is part of their defensive DNA lots of steals for the nolles Corin trying to get free and its batted away 836 to go in the half and du on top by five Duke averaging about 81 points a game leading the ACC and shooting percentage at 48 green Jr two strong Miller went over the top and commits the foul as he went for the rebound so8 and a half to go and coming up next on ESPN are featured games roll on number six Kansas squaring off against number 25 Oklahoma then its number 22 Kentucky and number 13 Auburn and a Sonic Blockbuster weve got a timeout Duke on top 2722 at FSU the nolles looking for an upset today you really cant overstate the geckos influence on culture hes got cartoons breakfast cereals the best advice goo can help protect your home and whats it in when I see him helping people Im full of Pride and Joy he influenced an entire generation but the shoes the shoes are iconic Im getting married in these hes touched So Many Lives I mean just look at us from Cars to home to jewelry its easy to Geo Applause and back no timeout called there Duke opens up a 2922 Advantage at the line FSU with the basketball Primo Spears nibur will line up a long one in and out certainly not a forte of the nolles as Cory mentioned just 32 beyond the three and thats been a struggle for them this year but more importantly they havent had guys that really created opportunities and easy shots for others Blakes back to filipowski hell attack lost it fast break opportunity Spears getting it for Corin inside and will lay it in great recognition by kin seeing that Mark Mitchell was going to be coming in for the block behind him maneuver around and able to get it on the glass quick hands of Florida State causing some problems for Duke Duke has turned it over six times thats going to be a traveling violation no basket there 7 and 1 half left in the half well Duke got it going offensively Florida State trying to fight back with their defense turning it into offense cam corn running the floor getting the good look under the rack opened up a lot of doors for the next generation of AfricanAmerican coaches throughout college basketball fellas Leonard making history first black assistant coach at the University of Kentucky hes about 75 now and were chatting with him today and I cant believe it I mean hes in such great shape and asked him how do you do that is he still looks like a million bucks as Jackson knocks it to and he said basically clean living for many many years he said Ive always eaten the right things I atat a lot of vegetables I dont eat a lot of red meat hes way in front of people you know back in the 70s on that uh hes a man of great faith as well absolutely thats you know under Hamilton so back to my story as Jared McCain oh thats going to go knocks down his fifth three which is a career high for Jared McCain five threepoint field goals in a game has that already with still 6 and 12 minutes left to go in the first half but to my story Leonard Hamilton actually didnt when he went to be a chemical salesman he didnt even call into work and tell him he wasnt going to be there that day he got on the plane flew to Kentucky to meet with Joby Hall and forgot to tell the people he only worked one day Obie he went to work on Monday was not there on Tuesday around it out Duke leading at 3226 we talk about Coach ham and his great faith also the owner of a Christian record label jar McCain is on fire here and Tallahassee I believe the weather in the State of Florida suits him of course a California Native he must love the climate here he cannot miss Duke 35 UE Music Applause 26 Spears to the Lane with a fall away yes Obie you and I were here two seasons ago when we watched Hunter Couture hit nine threes on this floor Jared McCain already with six and believe me this young man he is looking for another one he will not stop shooting well here hell take a two off the window and a pretty scoop shot and he has something to say to the crowd who Im sure has been talking to him about his painted fingernails and one of Jareds favorite lines Ive heard him say it time and time again is yall letting a guy with painted fingernails cook yall out here and Im sure thats what hes thinking and saying to the crowd as he is getting busy here in the tuck Jared McCain knocking down the long distance three getting a home roll and then the pull up off the bounce the step back and adding the nice finish off the glass just for good measure anything in the zone McCain 22 points eight for eight everybody else 15 points but he is a oneman show it feels like he absolutely has been that OB Ive known as young man for quite some time since he won a peace Jam Championship with Russell Westbrooks team why not out of Southern California Jackson gets hit while taking the midrange jumper Chandler Jackson will go to the line for a threepoint play and Chandler Jackson getting into the painted area able to finish through the cont of Mark Mitchell and a much needed bucket for Florida State as Jared McCain had gotten on quite the roll yeah averaging 13 points a game blew through that really quickly his career high and season High 24 points against queens that was back in December but OB Jared McCain embodies what John sires looking for hes told us I want our guys to be copy on the road when youre a dke youre going to get every teams best shot so you have to be as confident off the fake here he goes again that one too strong and hes hearing it from the crowd here at the tuck hes giving it back to him I tell you what thats when you know youve made an impression thats the first missed shot for Jared McCain now eight of nine from the field was a perfect eight of eight on the entry gain he cant get it in transition Foster again if youre just tuning in tyres Proctor missing the game with a concussion for Duke so theyre shorthanded there coming up on four minutes to go in the first half Ro to penetrate thats going to be blocked G got a piece of it Spears on the other end scoots in for two a strong response from the seol tanler Jackson getting to the midrange and now Primo Spears attacking off the bouns being able to score in transition and just like that Florida state has made a fourpoint game theyre not done in the tuck theyre ready to fight back nations longest 23 game winning streak broken earlier this week Pittsburgh coming in and getting a win on that floor but Virginia back to his winning ways at home we actually have them Monday big road test for The Who in blackburg as you see Virginia now at 11 and4 Duke trying to keep Pace with with the whoos and get a win on the road here today however Florida state with a great response after the flurry from Jared McCain early Overlook Virginia at your perel I say under four this has been the McCain show here in the first half scored more points in the first half than any du player so far this year 22 heres Mitchell playing the best basketball of his young career shot clocks down to Ford roach got a look at it up it goes with no and a rebound pick by the NS they have the momentum right now they absolutely do and they want to keep it going after a great defensive stand on the last possession you want to go to some of your best offense to see if you can get a quality look at the basket remember they doing this without jir Watkins whos been out with the two foul Jackson shot clock in issue now down to six the pull up pop short pop free a scrambled for that ball still free it went right into the Duke bench and its going to stay on this end for the seminal now Watkins their top score 15 a game coming off 26 in their loss against Virginia Tech was terrific in that game he had four assists three blocks as well but in foul trouble three minutes to go so again for a to five or six minutes it looked like Duke was going to get a big lead but back came the seals and Duke without a point in the last 2 minutes and 16 seconds and showing a lot of maturity for the seol whenever you see someone get going the way theyve watched Jared McCain six of seven from Beyond a threepoint Arc here in this first half often times teams can p but the simol have had no quit in boy quick cross over there by Primo Spears battle for the rebound and itll be Duke ball Taylor ball ball thought he got hit on the play they are letting him roll been plenty physical here in the first half Jaylen Blakes back into the game giving Jeremy Ro a break Jared McCain thought he was coming in for him John shy looking as h no buddy youre not coming off the floor you stay out there this could be one where we can see Jared McCain play the entire game and youre that hot you definitely dont want to go sit in thats for sure one of the Great Performances perhap weve seen all season long and thats a really difficult shot by Foster in heavy traffic yes strong take by Caleb Foster great size for a point guard is able to finish amongst the trees using a strong body Fu a deep bench as mentioned theyve got 22 points out of it in the first half thats impressive B bone tried to make a move Mitchell cut him great job defensively by Mark Mitchell keeping B bone out of the paint five to shoot Primo Spears that missed ugly and its Tapped Out by the nolles and Duke by six under two and after the flurry of scoring we saw from both teams now weve come to a much slower Pace each team doing a better job forcing the opponent to get later into that shot clock to try to find a shot and they havent been quality looks for either team as of late Neu just two and five in their left seven in the ACC is McCain on the spin nice dish filipowski will get it in Great play by jar McCain recognizing he was going to have 10 defensive eyes on him the easy drop off to filipowski who gets the easy Bucket Jackson off for green Jr follows his own Miss theyll get a second opportunity filipowski tipped it its going to be saved to B Bowen round the horn they go for green Jr up against Mitchell to spin that wont fall b ball big rebound cradles that three men around him and a third opportunity great job by bo b and crashing the glass John sire felt as though that ball should have been back to Duke as though they stepped on the Baseline Primo on the move and draws the foul as he hits the deck 63 junor from Hartford Connecticut with 54 seconds to play in the half UFC 298 tonight highlighted by the featherweight title Main Event Alexander volkanovski defends his title against Ilia tooi check me on that one the main card begins at 1000 Eastern 7 Pacific on payperview at the prelims at 8 Eastern five Pacific on ESPN and ESPN Deportes one thing I will not be doing is checking you on I am a firm believer if the notorious do o says it Im rolling with it and by the way you said someones name was Alexander Im rooting for him in that battle this evening so itll be Spears at the line at 76 is second to strong Spears as we mentioned earlier becoming eligible December the 16th immediately had a double figure game coming off the bench for Florida State and he provides a scoring punch for them with their Applause reserves Foster looking for an opening cant stick it Florida State looking to creep a little closer under 30 to go in the half and Spears will set it up first slowdown weve had in the first 20 minutes these two teams have really been getting after it yeah Florida State doesnt want to give Duke much time on the offensive end for the last possession of this game Spears tried to Dish into the lane picked off by Duke nice give here for McCain McCain stepping back throws another triple incredible first half for Jared McCain oh and hes having a conversation with some to watch a basketball player in that zone like that every time down he wants the ball and hes going to score every time and he has the mentality OB hes not going to let his foot off the pedal because he had so much success in the first half he will be looking for another 25 if they give him the opportunities here in this second half Mitchell will start the second half first shot is off the glass Florida State down 10 and a long one coming is Switched in by Darren Green Jr he can do it too hes capable of some big scoring performances he absolutely is capable and Im sure that thats not what John Shire wanted to see defensively from his team on the first possession because he knows Darren can green get back really quick philas give it a quick answer on the other end talking about Darren Green Jr comes in averaging 12 points a game Miller cant connect green Jor as an Uncle David whos actually a quarterback at Duke in the mid90s on cut and a big deflection thats the second time weve seen Watkins go up top and deny an opportunity for the Blue Devils rley going in strong and a blocking foul as roach hits the deck as well back to the rejection on the other end this is one Caleb Foster would love to have back you cannot go that nonch lot when youve got an athlete like Watkins on the other side he comes over and cleanly rubs that one on the glass getting Florida State out into transition and allowing J warley to get to the free throw line warley 67 JR out of Philly and runs the point hes seven points a game OB often times royy not enough of a scoring threat on the floor however had 23 points against Louisville and has only had 14 combined points in the three games after that so good to see him being a little more aggressive to start the second half also at 19 in their early season upside of top 20 Colorado you think easily their best win of the Year oh absolutely but I can tell you right now they want this one this is the one theyre trying to get on their resume anytime you get du to come into your home you want to walk away with a Applause statement loster tried to get that pass off to Mitchell deflected out by warley great job by warley getting around Mark Mitchell getting the deflection unable to come away with the steel however disrupting the offensive Rhythm of the blue D so McCain will check it in the Freshman out of Sacramento California now a kick ball resetting shot clock to Music 20 and roach will set it up now for John shs offense oh and attended for him going to say it was tipped and out of bounds off FSU Ill tell you what fortunately because Kane came off clean on that possession and hes the last guy you want to see getting a wide open look for those supporting the simol here in this building Foster on the drive roach gets a look and sticks it great Poise by Jeremy roach recognizing the shot clock knowing he had more than enough time to be able to get to a spot in the midrange and knock down the jumper roach with seven at the top of the broadcast we were talking about tyres Proctor the 65 sophomore for Duke and he did not make the trip because of a concussion that he suffered in their victory over Wake Forest on Monday at Cameron indorf so the Blue Devils playing short Bley slick move the tip is up and in but by Bley getting into the painted area even though he didnt make the shot he opened things up for Cameron corn to be able to come in and get those Second Chance points Foster wants to get off a shot High arching shot that goes down great job by Kayla Foster getting to a spot but also re recognizing the outstretch and of Baba Miller he was going to have to change the trajectory on that shot its the bottom of the net Waton stumbling a bit talking about stumbling foul here in the lane 1656 to go kanaine going down and he is up gising a little bit Yeah McCain looking though his his ankle got mixed up in that one as Baba Miller falls down on him and Baba Miller going to get that foul who guys as well as Caleb Foster and Mark Mitchell all very familiar with each other had all four of these guys at the Nike Academy in Portland this summer so played a lot of pickup Im sure theres some conversation going on with bab on the other side Baba biller 611 listed at 611 listed as 6 11 Mitchell Mitchell driveing on it swatted and a whistle and a foul that was with just seven on the shot clock the foul against Florida State but if youre Duke right now you want to drive everything in the direction of Jared McCain because theres no way possible Florida state is going to help off of McCain so youre going to have a driving angle when you try to get downhill on his side youre going to have opportunities to play one on one because theyre not going to help off zero in blue four fouls on Baba Miller as Mitchell misses the front Music end so still to come weve got Kansas number six and number 25 Oklahoma at 400 then Auburn and Kentucky two teams in the top 25 had six coming up on ESPN I think Aran should be ranked higher than that myself I tell you what theyve got an opportunity to go higher and after what they did to number 11 South Carolina earlier this week beating them by 40 in the jungle if theyre able to come away from the jungle again this evening with they win over Kentucky I believe they will absolutely be higher most likely in the top 10 offensive foul on roach by the way Duke by nine FSU with the ball lets see if jir Watkins gets rolling here in the second half over the top pass its going to be stuffed in by K Corin great job by jir Watkins drawing the defense and throwing it up to where only his teammate can finish it Applause off Duke on the road for the first time since the 3D of February Foster and bat it out Jaylen Worley playing some defense here in the second half and jir Watkins providing some playmaking here in the second half getting downhill tossing it up Cameron K with the strong twoand finish as Caitlyn Clark she did it this week she broke the alltime scoring record in womens college basketball and so appropriately with a threepointer at home and she said you guys knew I was going to go with a logo three for the record right I mean of course Caitlyn Clark spectacular the most notable athlete in college athletics today I dont care what sport what gender she he is the star became the scoring leader with 3569 points had 49 points in the win by the way Watcher launching cant hit it Mitchell grabbing the board had it knocked out of his hands and warley right there warley having a very impactful second half for the seals and thats going to go the other way 1537 to go and Florida States done a great job of not turning the basketball over only five turnovers to this point but an opportunity for them to cut into this lead and give the opportunity a way without getting a quality look on the offensive end McCain so far quiet in the second half 25 points in the game though drives and kicks roach roach with a 17footer no filipowski going for the rebound and knocked out of play by FSU thats one of the things for Duke when youre talking about McCain is had a quiet second half which he has but thats by Design from Florida State but now what do you do when you actually throw the ball into the post to the preseason ACC play of the year no double teaming at this point anymore so KY filipowski should be eating here in this second half over the top to the big Applause fella McCain an electrifying first 20 PS up and didnt hit the shot but hell be at the line John Shire thinking along the same lines hes pointing did KY filipowski get in the paint had Jaylen warley guarding him he wants filipowski posting strong McCain had some nice scoring games at 23 against Carolina 21 against Clemson I think as impressive as anything for the Freshman he came into the game with only 24 turnovers Cory in his first 24 college games well hes a very high IQ basketball player Chris car well says in the six years that hes been back at Duke as an assistant coach Jared McCain is the hardest working guy that hes had throughout that stretch you go you think back the last six years Duke has had some studs some Zion RJ you got some big time names but he said Jared McCain is absolutely the hardest working guy that theyve had Watkins swings the pass on the spin War Le too strong he came with a board thats what hes been doing as well as anything yeah and didnt have any rebounds in the first half so now hes getting back to what hes been doing as you mentioned as of Applause late turned over as we go to Myron yeah Jared McCain John sh said can really take hard coaching I was talking to players before the game coaches before the game and they said listen hes like a glue guy it kind of reminds you of the players you see in the Miami Heat culture just will do anything you ask of them thats who Jared McCaine is for this Duke team hes a guy IR thats about winning has a gold medal with USA Basketball ball hes a young man that understands whats necessary to win you see right there getting into the passing Lane coming up with the steel and again hes not thinking about his own but of course when you got a guy thats on a heater like that theyre going to hunt shots Bowen hunting for him and deflected it got the block itll stay right here for Duke Crow didnt like Applause that 5143 the Blue Devils Music and just over 14 minutes to play in this contest at Applause Music Tallahassee filipowski a high post likes that move and overcame another big in jayen gain this it looks like Florida State of like the previous 10 years lots of block shots absolutely coach ham talk to us about their lack of Rim protection but thats one of the areas that jayen Gandy can provide the ivy league Defensive Player of the Year in 2019 where he led the Ivy and blocks out Bowski well short that was with a shot clock winding down look at the size for FSU theyve had bigger teams but 611 610 610 610 610 those numbers are normally over 7t when we look at a Florida State roster thats you know what weve seen from Leonard Hamilton that Sean Stewart does a great job defensively coming up with the steal Ro up ahead filipowski to slam it giv Sean Stewart a lot of credit getting out 40 ft from the basket and coming up with the steel getting on the floor to maintain possession for his team and Duke back in front by 10 again that was their lead at the break Watkins green Jor trying to heat up McCain sticking with him cant drop it down warley with the rebound couldnt finish it and now McCain in the open floor a long log around and out Watkins quickly in transition no basket there they wav that off he was foued before it for that shot 136 to go Sean Stewart getting out doing a great job defensively and as he goes down the presence of mine to find Jeremy roach whose head is up looking for Kyle filipowski the easy finish on the other end to extend the l lead to 10 for Duke here on the Music road seols get it in looking for a quick strike but air mailed by Watkins and Watkins who got off such a great start OB after getting those two fouls sat for a long time hes been quiet offensively as well Duke on the other hand just one out of eight they last eight shots just one make heres McCain Applause again Blakes will back it to the logo Applause Bowski doubled up its spits free Watkin will drive and lay it in and a foul two such a smart play by Watkins talking with Steve Smith the assistant coach for Florida State earlier he talked about how high of a basketball IQ jir Watkins has and you see it here just getting his body In Harms Way shielding off Kyle filipowski to get the contact the bucket opportunity for the n one Watkins came in with 10 consecutive double figure scoring games one thing about Duke today theyve been turning the ball over as you mentioned 11 times averaging n and 1 half turnovers a game coming into play today thats what Florida state does Florida State averages n and a half steals per game so something had to give and right now its been Florida State turning that defense into off offense 14 points off turnovers so staying connected Kane has it poked away once again its warley full ball over the top and a slam by Corin and thats another two points off turnovers great job defensively by the simol to make it a sixpoint game and now the crowd here at the tuck is back in it B bone will commit the foul on driving filipowski tell you what Jaylen War and here in the second half warley has been the man defensively yeah warley doing a great job getting his hand in and then Taylor bow B Bowen being able to handle it and throw it up to cam K whos having a very efficient shooting afternoon today K five of six from the field for 10 points for him well Duke right behind North Carolina half game back in the standings coming into play today in the ACC Virginia won a big one today as they held off Wake Forest to win by Music two so the top of the conference really interesting here as we get ready to go down the Applause stretch Music Applause Mitchell heres young back Music in roach with 10 to shoot roach will drive it amongst the trees Young retrieved it its batted free and itll stay with the Duke Blue Devils three to get off his shot 1136 to go here in the second half here inside the tuck at Tallahassee Dave OBrien and Cory Alexander with us as we follow McCains progress first half the youngster at 25 one point so far in the second half well Florida States done a much better job of staying connected with him not helping off with Jared Mccain not giving him those easy looks he hasnt tried to force it however hes had a number of other guys step up but right now Duke cannot shake the simol if they made a sixpoint game because of the 12 turnovers that they forced from the blue Dev so career high 26 7 threes closing in on a Music record that P you a big advantage in the paintt that had it knock free no but you can see the defensive intensy of the semal has picked up significantly here in this second half roach three to get off the shot off the front of the iron leges following his own Miss as he went spinning to the deck tied up possession arrow will take it to the other end of the floor theres that competitor that John Shire talks about jayen blanks getting involved and even though Duke does not get possession from that they changed the possession arrow so they would get the next one and Blakes with the offensive rebound off the Jeremy roach Miss is able to get over there and allow the Blue Devils to get their defense set so theres not a transition opportunity for Florida Applause Music State warley back up top for Corin and a turnover with exactly 11 minutes left but another careless turnover for Florida State there was nothing Duke did to force that turnover just a simple pass and catch the win a around young upet the screen oh you can see him lock eyes there with McCain to try to get in the ball Mitchell strong following his own Miss sticks that one in but great recognition by Mark Mitchell seeing that the W the middle of the floor is wide open he just has one Defender to be able to beat was able to do that and get a shot on the glass then the second jump to finish it off Chandler Jackson in the sophomore from Applause Memphis now the curl Watkins drops it two got a little extra curricular going on right now Darren Green Jr Jared McCain getting mixed up a bit Darren Green was fortunate to be able to get away with not getting call for an offensive foul in that possession both guys looking at the officials Kane finding an opening now three shirts around him forc it up there and reaches in and commits a foul but its getting chippy after that possession green putting the ball in the chest of McCain and you see green right there fortunate that was not called as an offensive foul officials are going to head over to the monitor here well take the break 957 remaining here in Tallahassee having health insurance McCain just went to the line for Duke and hit two technical foul shots heres what they call well you see after the play now Jared McCain who is unable to get the shot to go here fouls Darren Green but after the play The Whistle blown Darren Green turns and sticks the basketball into Jared McCains chest which gets him a dead ball technical foul two free throws which were made by Jared McCain and now possession for the Blue Devils allowing them to possibly make this a double digit game filipowski with the touch going strong follows his Miss thats blocked High out of the sky by Watkin long one hit by Guess Who McCain absolutely drilled it Stone Cold killer OB Five Points on that possession for Jared McCain after getting a foul on the other end we told you it was getting chippy between he and Darren Green Jr and the battle has been won by McCain so Dukes alltime record by a player is nine threepoint makes Shane Bader there hes got one for with the D JJ reck did an an 05 McCain now with eight so closing in on that record for Duke he shattering all sorts of Records in this one thing weve got to be careful of with the match up between these two guys with green and McCain cooler heads have to Prevail because theyve both been dishing it Applause out and thats going to be against Duke as green Junior went sprawling to the deck hes drawing with Philip but heres the thing Darren Green Jr already with one technical foul he went back and had something to say to Philip palski hes fortunate as the officials now I believe are going to go back and look at this no theyre not going to theyre going to play on Darren Green very fortunate that they did not go back to look at this one its going to be interesting to see if Leonard Hamilton leaves Darren Green Jr in the game or if he gets him out to allow him to cool down for a second warley nice dish and a whistle and a foul against the Blue Devils as gainy took the hit King gainy just 11 for 24 at the foul line so a real problem for the 61 grad 36 to go Ryan young to check back in now for John shy Baba Miller also at the table and hes going to get Darren Green Jr I think thats a great substitution by Leonard Hamilton to get Daren green a break and allow him to cool down a little bit hes fortunate that they did not go back and look at that last one because he actually after getting fouled which was a great call went back over to filipowski with something to say and Darren Green very important to this Florida State team they need to make sure he stays in this game his second League score at 12 game and very dangerous outside the threepoint line Baba Miller also back in now for Leonard Hamilton hes playing with four fouls eightpoint game Duke K in trouble shaking the seminal to this point roach off the dribble Mitchell Nifty fake slapped away roach picked up the loose ball ball and hits it just a veteran play by Jeremy roach sticking his nose in the middle of all the big bodies and being able to come up in the presence of mine and Poise to see the shot clock and get a easy bucket so its back up to 10 for Duke long one coming and knocked down by Jackson big bucket for Chandler Jackson as Jared McCain slows it down does not force an opportunity on that one that was a huge response from Chandler Jackson on the offensive end Kane with 31 theyll step back that one wont drop in Watkins wants to push the Music tempo Jackson just h a long triple a moment ago Miller tried to feed the big underneath warley will kick heres Jackson again but too strong and over the top of the backboard itll be Duke ball so well break with 7 minutes and 14 seconds to go still a ball game Duke 62 FSU 55 100 per chance for kids against cancer and the V Foundation tremendous events for our great friend dick vital and that Kentucky at Auburn game is a Dicky B special we can see him in the jungle at Auburn right now being carried Through the Jungle so Dicky V get well soon our guy and you know hed be loving every minute of it Foster at midcourt for Duke on top Applause 6255 young looking for someone to make a cut McCain 31 points leaning in doors still open here for the seals on their home floor FL yeah right now Florida State needs to make sure they get quality looks on the offensive end to flor this where Baba Miller at 611 so hes listed has to be a factor went for the dunk especially when hes got a guard trying to defend him in the post that basketball has to go to Miller to allow him to be able to go to work with Jared McCain defending G had it knocked out of his hands so couldnt finish the lob Caleb Foster looking to operate on the crossover the jumpers second chance it came to McCain hes dra a lot of booze here but he knows how to quiet them too he absolutely does he has become Public Enemy Number One here in Donald Tucker Center however OB this will probably be the only time he ever plays here Im not sure theyll have a chance to do that again 33 points here today putting on a show two points away from the Duke freshman record Another alley of attemp and the stop that time it was big baba Miller to slam it and thats something thats been available for the simal throughout this game when theyre able to get into the painted area just throw it up allow their athletes to go to work speaking of going to work McCain again try to get the pass free and gave it away and anytime he doesnt do something like nail a three from like 24 fet the fans are all over him here and that is what you call respect anytime you make a mistake they notice because he hasnt made many here this afternoon sure hasnt he has been Sensational warley will take his time now to drive it Miller and picked off by McCain he read that beautifully five minutes to go at Tallahassee and a timeout Duke will take one here and on top 64 57 so down the stretch we come here at the Music tuck the sidelines Im just going to put that out there now I hear Applause you and you hear McCain getting booted every turn and he loves it Obi on the drive off the window no fre in the corner FSU comes away and thats just a mistake by Corin trying to throw the basketball off of a Duke Defender and we mentioned jayen Blakes on the last possession when he got the tie ball changes the possession arrow so the Blue Devils will keep this one that was a wild sequence yeah Corin just unable to do anything with it couldnt get it to one of his teammates made the mistake of trying to throw it off of a Duke Defender think sometimes young players become infatuated with that play instead of looking for someone whos open but it also has to be done at the right angle because you want it to go out of bounds you dont want it to stay in play that one stays in play and gets the basketball back to the Applause opponent knocked out by warley Duke will keep it here 4 39 Music Kane bounces for Applause young Darren Green back on the floor for the simol hes a guy that Florida State needs to try to get going on the offensive end as well shot clock down to seven Ro sees it fires hits it a threepointer and a big one its not just Jared McCain J Jeremy roach has it too hes got that ability to get hot quickly big bucket to stretch the lead back to double figures 45 from the three picked off by McCain McCain trying to feed roach and tossed it away and Jeremy roach just looks and smiles because McCain was expecting roach to stop at the threepoint line roach was going in for the layup ends up being a turnover but how about Jared Mccain not only doing it offensively thats the second time weve seen him come up with a huge steal on that end of the floor Duke got back up by 10 here thats the lead they had at halftime Watkins with a pull up six it Watkins hes been in foul trouble today and has not been on his game but 13 points to the 67 Junior thats a tough bucket by Watkins to be able to get it back to an eightpoint game highly contested shot but he was able to make it good in the middle of the pain oh Here Comes The Bread Guy dont you to win when youre giving the basketball away its honestly fortunate for Coach ham in this group that they have a winning record in ACC play with those type of numbers seven and Six coming in in the league pressure again from the Nos and now theyll back it away tyres brocker a concussion did not make the trip for Duke Foster at the point unfortunately for Florida State Jared McCain did make the trip 33 points in a sensation ly trying to add on to that right now the floer for two and that 35 now ties Zan Williamson for the Duke record and point scored in a game but with 305 remaining he may not be done yet OB back to a 10point Advantage Hiller takes a stumble and its going to be a blocking foul on Caleb Foster so a closer look Duke freshman 35 points tying Williamson and a great chance to have it all to himself in the next few seconds B by Miller only 49 at the strike and drops in the first Applause one grew up in Spain and grew 9 Ines between the ages of 14 and 18 extremely talented thats the reason why he still has the guard ability because he was a guard until that 9 in growth spurt by Baba Miller Florida State would love if he were more aggressive both defensively and Applause offensively Foster nice pass Mitchell with the dunk Im not sure why Baba Miller went out to trap Caleb Foster at half court leaving Mitchell wide open under the basket if youre going to try to get the basketball out of someones hand Caleb Foster isnt necessarily the guy you want to do that when Jared McCain has it Jun will give it up Jamir Watkins got Philipi on him pass somehow did get to warley hell lay it up an in Jeremy Roose got a hand on that basketball fortunately for warley he was able to finish it off 215 left the Caleb Foster as you see Baba Miller coming out Caleb Foster already has an advantage over cam corn but when you leave a guy wide open under the basket Caleb fost are way too good to give him that is about as easy as going to get in the ACC game and Tuesday we have a mens basketball double header for you on acc Network and the ESPN app Florida state will be hosting Boston College right here in Tallahassee and then Pittsburgh squaring off against Wake Forest coverage beginning at 700 eastern time both wake and pit trying to play their way into that NCAA tournament field yeah that is a huge game on Wednesday night to be able to see those two teams going at it pit coming off a win at Virginia earlier in the week Wake Forest losing at Virginia this afternoon but you see Pittsburgh at 7 to six in the standings weit at wake at 8 and six one of those teams could represent the ACC in the NCAA tournament but theyre going to have to absolutely get hot down the stretch we saw Wake Forest the other night falling at Cameron Indoor but we see a lot of college basketball to me they passed the eye test Right Down the Line I agree with you wholeheartedly but one of the things that the NCAA has taken away this year as far as the committee is concerned they dont take into consideration the last 10 games anymore I think thats a huge mistake by the committee because what you want is teams that are playing their best at the end of the year that makes a better NCAA tournament not judging teams based upon what they did in November and December lets look at what they did in February and March one part of the pie is quad one wins they dont have any yet as we approach the twominute Mark 7163 Applause Duke Foster doing a really good job controlling the basketball here when the Blue Music Applause Devils have the Rock and were under two and hell draw a Applause foul Bourne will pick up foul number two not shooting yet so itll be McCain to check it in from the scores table Applause area roach warley guarding him theyve got 10 to shoot it roach on the drive and its going to be a palming violation and Duke had that set up perfectly roach attacking to the right side was supposed to deliver Del a strike to KY filipowski outside the threepoint line who was open and would have got a good look unfortunately for Roose mishandling the basketball however it is a dead ball turnover which allows Duke to get their defense Applause set green Jr way down to the lowski one and done for the seals Mitch and they break the pressure you take that layup if youre Caleb Foster you bring it back out and it ends up being what close to a turnover fortunate to be able to get it back but had a wide open layup that he didnt take advantage of foul 11 to go and some of the Florida State fans beginning to move to the exits here I believe thats what Kyle filipowski was telling Foster hey you get an easy one like that with a minute and 11 seconds left you go take that force them to be able to come over and block it at The Rim but an easy two points goes a long way forcing it to a 10point game the junior roach at the line 87 shooter there Jeremy the 68th player in Duke history to score 1000 points Coach T had a lot of them yeah best season of his career at Duke he has truly shown up as a leader for this team this year and as hot as Jared McCain has been Jeremy Rose has stepped up and made a number of big buckets here on the road Watkins has to hustle Miller ugly shot Mitchell with the rebound and another stoppage and another whistle with 579 on the clock and Duke trying to Salt this one away at the foul line and pick up a big win in the ACC on the road they had not traveled away from Cameron indoors since February 3rd but now in a stretch of three straight on the road for the Blue Devils so if John Shire and his team are able to hold on for this remaining 579 this will be a great win for them building that momentum and remembering they did this without tyres Proctor but with Jared McCain and a spectacular ball game here today for the Freshman on of Sacramento California smashing several records for a freshman for the Duke Blue Devils along the way roach making the Applause first so this to put the Blue Devils ahead by 11 and Florida state has just not been able to cut into the lead really and maintain it since halftime they cut it to five at one point but not able to get any closer that fivepoint possession by Jared McCain after the technical foul would TR truly be a Difference Maker knocking down the two free throws and then hitting to three at the end of that possession to get it back to a double digit game and Duke has pretty much maintained a lead from 9 to 11 ever since Mark Mitchell with the foul on the reach puts Corin at the line cant hit the front end of the one and one and another loose ball picked up by FSU tried that one free from McCain and spun up an in for two and going to be a timeout here by Leonard Hamilton with 45 seconds on the clock 7465 Jared McCain if youre just joining us was just incredible particularly in the first half Jared McCain got it go on OB knocking down to three ball in transition able to go off the bouns creating enough space to get his shot off and this was the one at the end of the shot clock offensive rebound after a technical foul he was able to knock down a three ball a fivepoint possession for Jared McCain that runner in the lane was the one that allowed him to get to 35 points which is tying Zion Williamson for the most points by a Duke freshman with 35 and McCain most likely will be the guy going to the basketball trying to get fouled and possibly be able to hold that record all of his own at the free throw line here in this remaining 452 yeah 25 in the first half just couldnt miss from threepoint land everything he put up was dropping good enough to become a villain here in Tallahassee oh yes he he is absolutely become that but that is the best sign of respect that you can ever ask for when you come into an opponents arena for the first time and by the time you end they boo you every time you touch the basketball that means you have left a lasting impression yeah it hardly ever happens for a freshman oh absolutely youve got to be pretty special Mitchell to the line 71 for the 69 sophomore Luke leaving the door open not taking care of business at the free throw line Watkins trying to get a shot up hell slice inside left it Applause short now roach will draw the foul 279 to go and the most reliable foul shooter that Duke has roach at 87 so hell be headed to the stripe here Duke about to pick up win number 20 go to 20 and five at 11 and three in the AC and right on the heels of North Carolina and minus the co season this will be the 27th consecutive year that the Blue Devils have gotten to 20 Applause wins and thatll R rattle Applause in handing off for green Applause Jr thatll be tipped a couple of times for State relentless on the glass but four chances and it would not go finally that one will drop by Corin but 11 seconds to go they dont want to foul that guy McCain and its fitting he ends the game with the basketball in his hands as his new favorite friends as da Staley would say theyre not booing him theyre just calling him boo
