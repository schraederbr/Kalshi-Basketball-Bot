started Ron Gruber Jeffrey Clark and John Gaffney on the whistle and away we go from camera one of the veteran pieces of this pit team is Nelly Cummings Applause very important for Duke to contain him they cant let him beat their guys off the dribble to create because Pitts got some outstanding threepoint Shooters Burton up top rimmed out the rebound for Whitehead both teams will play very aggressive mantoman defense Proctor The Freshman from Australia here is Mitchell the Lebowski and young who draws the start again here tonight phillipowski trying to work inside against Henson with the right shoulder turns forced it up and got his own Miss and Duke in front before the start of conference play Duke was doing an outstanding job on the offensive boards thats tailed off a little bit against the ACC but boy they got it done that time and cummings going to draw a foul on a drive and the foul is going to be on the Freshman from Australia Tyrese Proctor its his first its number one on Duke now John Gaffney Jeffrey Clark signaled Two Shots theres a discussion among this officiating crew about whether or not he was in the active shooting they have settled on Jeffrey Clarks original verdict so therell be two free throws coming for Nellie Cummings and John Shire talking to Ron groover with his case Applause and a free throw by Cummings front rim and in when I say veteran peace look at the Journey of Nelly Cummings three years at Colgate and now well spend a grad year if you will playing for Pittsburgh he is from Midland Pennsylvania well she got to keep him off the line hes only missed one free throw all year now 28 of 29 at the line is the six foot guard tied at two we expect this to be a very hotly contested ball game tonight in a lot of different ways as Proctor bangs the three his 15th of the year and a good sign for the Freshman Dan and he has not shot the three well this year and we talked to Jeff cable before the game and he said I know he can shoot the three I just hope he doesnt start tonight well look out yep heres Burton this is Elliott the catch and shoot and he draws pit to within a point Brad transfer from Marquette and the portal is a friend to the Panthers success this year for sure boy theyre going right at Henson with philipowski yep heres a kick to Mitchell out front Proctor and now White had a launch a little strong the long rebound knocked around and scooped up Mitchell feeds young blocked away Federico John Shire wanted basket interference didnt get it heres Cummings and now Burton Matthews West you talked about this being hotly contested youve seen it already little Runner is good jamarius Burton thats his game Wes said he can shoot the three but that is his game right there and the clear pronounced leader of this Pittsburgh team is the grad from Charlotte start originally at Texas Tech Wichita State and now at Pitt turned over by the Blue Devils Panthers in transition and here is Federico Federico for his first basket West End the Pitt Panthers dont look for Federico thats how he scores running the court offensive rebounds soft screen and rolls they dont run any plays for him threepoint lead for Pitt and now Jeffrey Clark a whistle and foul off the ball and its on Henson first on Blake Henson first on the Panthers this is a great steal by Elliot and Federico hes trailing the play but he just beats everybody else down the court young has to try to try to stop the ball and Federico just hustled down the court and got an easy one young man is from Finland born in Egypt played at Northern Oklahoma in the junior college ranks before coming to Pitt and theres Mitchell drawing a foul on Elliott and Wes early in this game weve seen that Duke is trying to exploit a couple of matchups Mitchell much bigger than Elliott just takes him inside Elliott draws the foul Elliott is a key offensive component for Pitt they cant have him in foul trouble and the same applies to Henson Duke has been attacking Henson with philipowski early lefthanded freshman from Kansas City is a 74 percent freethrow shooter Duke is third in the ACC so far in free throw percentage in conference play at better than 78 percent theyre 78 flat second in the ACC if you tally all the regular season numbers together Mitchell draws the Blue Devils to within one early in the ball game you watch the Panthers they dont really have anybody in the low post to start theyre trying to spread the court create opportunities Cummings read the screen pulled the trigger rattled out for Youngs rebound and here is Proctor leading the Blue Devils skip to the corner Whitehead thought it now will fire and phillipowski the rebound and bounces it off of Henson itll stay with the Blue Devils heady play by Kyle filipowski seven foot freshman who leads Duke and scoring rebounding and steals ironically and now Nate Santos coming into the game and thats philipowski is going to have a bigger Advantage because Santos hes six seven but he only weighs 210 pounds yeah Henson and Elliott are out Santos and Nike sabandi has come into the lineup for Coach Caples Panthers as well young reverses against Federico with a right hand Santos the rebound Ill tell you what Federico is a long six feet 11 its hard to get the ball over him yep and cummings is going to draw a foul from Proctor and Tyrese Proctor second and that is the second on Duke and that will bring Jalen Blakes to the table for John Shire and West keep an eye on that thats two fouls on Proctor in the last game we had against Boston College it was Proctor and Blake who handled the point guard duties and heres Derek Lively the second The 71 Freshman from Philadelphia on the floor for Ryan young here so Lively who played only 12 minutes Saturday at Boston College gets an early chance here for Coach Shire out front three balls Santos too strong Burton the rebound Cummings launches brought around Miss some Bandy fights through and its a third try for Pitt at the offensive end Nike hits on a three sabandi has shot the three very wells in the last few games particularly on acc play this is a guy made over 200 threes in his career you cant leave him alone four point lead now for the Panthers philipowski on the drive and the runner Good Boy Tough shot second field goal for the freshman again Wes hes been very aggressive tonight yep Cummings here is Burton Pittsburgh protecting a twopoint lead Santos on the drive all the way through with the left hand and scores Nate Santos 21 year old sophomore from Geneva Illinois played 12 minutes in Saturdays loss to Clemson comes in here and gets a quick bucket pittsley back to four Blakes had it deflected by Cummings it will stay with the Blue Devils but first a timeout two 23rd meeting all

China the number one most loved banking app well the common ground of Northbrook Illinois is John Shire who is 35 years of age and of course starred here at Duke and Fayetteville North Carolina native Jeff cable whos 47 years of age the Common Ground tonight comes full circle I dont know where the guy in the middle is watching the game tonight but I bet hes proud of the moment hes proud of both of those guys absolutely Wes yep great Stars here for coaches and now tonight meeting his head coaches and of course Jeff was here as a player and an assistant a couple times and the last time it was with John Shire what John Shire and Jeffrey Clark are really going at one another theres a lot of conversation going on and I thought Jeffrey Clark was very close to T and Shire up just before we went to went to break theres a lot of points there yeah Duke will have it trailing by three Wesson of course against Boston College Jeremy roach didnt play and hes not playing again tonight oh that is correct thats why Duke is a little shorthanded in that point guards phillipowski turned it over trying to spin through the pivot and bounce pass so Bandy Burton couldnt hang on Santos the follow of the Loose Change and draws a foul well Burton I think was excited to get that oh up before the defense could catch up he knew Lively was coming and just didnt handle the pass yep so a couple of free throws for Nate Santos one of the foul on Tariq Whitehead Dan Duke is very anxious to set its defense against Pitt West to try to keep them out of the lane and you cant do that if youre going to turn the ball over Santos the first of two rims off this is the young man from Geneva Illinois his dad a long time professional player in Puerto Rico the dad the mom the brother and a sister all basketball players so when you hear the term Basketball family well this crowd they lead the charge well Santos is the guy who came in last year with the rep reputation out of high school that he could really shoot and he hasnt shot the ball well so far for Pitt but they have great expectations for him hes got three points on a one or two trip to the line fourpoint lead turned over heres Cummings with the giveaway from Mitchell tried to get it to Burton and Pitt turned it right back over Whitehead to Carol thats tough pass Blakes loudly couldnt hang on and Burton stepped out of bounds before he made the save little Keystone coppish good Heavens Wes well we talked about the intensity out there and I think this is a product of it everybody trying to make a play those Cross Court passes are going to be hard for either team Granderson coming to the table for Duke as Blakes handles its been straight mantoman from the jump Mitchell trying to drive it Santos did a nice job finding a spot to cut him off now Whitehead this is a big time move and shot look out 173 of the year for Derek Whitehead not much you can do defensively about that thats just an outstanding play and Diaz Graham traveled with it Guillermo one of the twin freshmen drives off sabandi with the dribble and steps back behind the threepoint line that is Big Time Wes yes it is Applause substitutions both sides grandison has checked into the ball game he replaces philipowski you see Guillermo Diaz Graham with Nike sabandi jamarius Burton Greg Elliott now back on the floor for Pitt with Santos and Whitehead couldnt get the roll knocked around Lively and sabandi finally pulls it away Applause Burton into the front court with an alley on lively and one jamarius Burtons second field goal of the ball game Wes we talked about Whitehead and Burton before the game in the last couple of possessions weve seen each of those guys make an outstanding play now Lively is seven feet tall hes a shot blocker and Burton just goes right into him puts his body into him and falling down somehow Banks it in 12th best free throw shooter in the ACC at 80 percent and the free throw good five of pits points now belong to jamarius Burton Burton is so big and strong for guard West and yeah hes hes got great balance seven minutes gone in the first half grandison the most veteran piece of Dukes roster to Blakes inside heres Lively with Diaz Graham trying to bounce it back through to grandison through his hands and it will go to the Panthers on the Blue Devil turnover boy Duke is having a tough time hanging on to the ball West thats now five turnovers Lively out Ryan Young comes back for Coach Shire and you see Diaz Graham checks out and Federico Federico returns well Guillermo Diaz Graham and Jorge Diaz Graham and Federico Federico sort of make up the five spot for the Panthers theres Federico got blocked from behind out of bounds by Whitehead and again off of screen and roll Federico going to the basket and Burton finds him not very strong is Federico heres Santos in front of the Duke bench Mitchell the rebound Mitchell trying to get by Elliott had it poked Away by sabandi Burton out in front theres the lead pass Elliott soft jumper spins out dont get many free looks again not not three three looks that close that wide open and Elliots got to be careful he has a little tendency to reach and you cant do that this early with one foul Blakes and the rebound for Elliott Burton uses the Federico screen to the basket seven for Burton largest lead of the game for Pitt part of the problem for anybody playing Pitt is how do you stay in front of Burton its easy to say this is what you got to do its very hard to execute bounce pass for young tried to skip it across to grandison did Young catch Federico he did but the Blue Devils are very fortunate they didnt lose that one yep we get a break 11 35 to go jamarius Burton has got seven for Pitt early that run with the champ was magical I mean

anything else follow me wicked good good 11 35 to go in this first half Pit by six and Dan Duke a little bit of droughts they had one on Saturday we saw only two points in about seven minutes they nine minutes without a field goal happened to get Tennessee State last Wednesday night and certainly in the loss to Purdue as well and if youre a team that is not explosive offensively and at this point Duke is not you really cant afford those scoring droughts now of course we still have 11 and 35 left in the first half so its a lot of disaster yet but they got to put some points on the board here is Whitehead off the inbounds out of the timeout for the Blue Devils Granderson quick entry for young hell try and work on Federico a little Up and Under and Ron Gruber whistles the travel now part of the reason for the droughts for Duke here especially in the last couple of ball games is the inevitability of Jeremy roach Wes hes got a problem another problem with that tow hes had it a couple of times this year and theyve elected to hold him out until hes 100 healthy yeah John Char going as far as telling Dan and I today that theres a three ball by somebody thats good that Jeremy Roach will be a hundred percent when he takes the floor again its the second time in what about five weeks this has become an issue for Duke and they want to get him to 100 or as close as he is to 100 to get back on the floor and compete so hes missed now the last two games and was very limited the other night in Raleigh in the Lost NC State grandison of three that bounds away ninepoint lead largest of the ball game for the Panthers Burton rerouting the Fall Away on Blakes young clears but now Burton drew a lot of the defense into the lane there were guys open he just missed him philipowski the catch and score third field goal for the Freshman he leads Duke with six now and the Blue Devils part of their problem West is theyve been turning it over you cant break a scoring drought unless you score and you cant score if you turn it over Henson a threepointer knocks it down Blake Hensons 35th three of the year hes been double figures this year in all but one game for Pittsburgh and he pushes it to a 10point lead and its an 112 run by the visitors grandison of three phillipowski gives Duke a second chance Blakes for three Federico had a shot at it Burton pulls it away Applause Burton on the drive and now grandison will follow him as he backs out Applause hell take two white shirts with him and score nine for jamarius Burton the lead is 12 for Pittsburgh time

more Source from Partners who believe in doing things the right way together we can make a difference one meal at a time up today at butcherboxcom for a special offer West jamaris Burton has dominated this game and one of the ways hes done it is to get into life watch as he gets into the lane there are four white shirts in the lane that leaves Nike sbandi open and even though sabandi overall has a low threepoint shooting percentage his percentage is very good in ACC play and as we said hes made over 223s in his career its a 132 run for a 12point lead phillipowski on the drive grandison off the feed three ball for the Blue Devils 16th of the year for grandison and grandison is the guy who can make him as well and that sort of turnabout right there philipowski gets into the lane Gras the defense and creates an open shot Dukes third three of his first half cuts the pit lead to nine Elliott trying to answer High arcing three Applause now PID will launch him up there theyve got some guys who can shoot him oh yeah Whitehead tease one up one and done are the Blue Devils at the offensive end Burton with grandison there Grandersons got a reputation as a defensive guy but this is hard even harder for philipowski hes telling Federico to get out of the way Burton on the drive lost the handle on it an offensive foul going to be called by Jeffrey Clark on jamarius Burton itll be his first to Third on Pittsburgh well in this time we get philipowski who gets right by outside and then slips by that charge Hanson trying to take it but you got a guy down inside you got help coming and that leaves a wide open area on this end Grandersons able to take the charge because Federico didnt get out of the lane the way Burton wanted him to so he was there to help Proctors back to run the offense he spells Blake there in the dead ball the draw by the freshman and last Touch by Pittsburgh and West remember hes got two fouls right and I think in this particular situation particularly with a freshman I think everybody knows how to be careful on defense with two fouls but can you be careful on offense you know Proctors a guy whos got to drive and take it to the basket but hes got to really be careful to not pick up a third foul on a charging fight ER will put it in play on the Baseline heres philipowski grandison thought about it and theres a bounce pass back for the three and it hit the shot clock above the glass so thatll belong to Pitt well dont forget coming up next WinstonSalem Joel Coliseum will be the site for game two of our doubleheader tonight here on acc Network Corey Alexander Randolph Childers standing by the Corey cast tonight with wake in Florida State Corey cast two Corey cast two yes Applause and a foul called and it will be on Federico Federico one of his jobs is to set screens Wes and when youre going to set a screen youve got to get yourself stopped and you also cant be shoving your opponent in the neck sometimes you want to I understand that but you cant do it its against the rules yes its its forbidden phillipowski lost it on the dribble to Henson pretty good post defense by Federico Federico can move west heres Cummings now Elliott nine point lead for Pitt theres the screen from Federico filipowski switches to Cummings gonna try and take him off the dribble the scoop too strong rebounded by the Blue Devils heres the rookie Proctor ahead for whiteheads catch and shoot three there is a lot to like about zero for John Shire boy there sure is man sabandi the triple cuts it to a sixpoint pit lead so Bandy almost lost himself on the bounce now a spot up two how about that thats pretty tough shows you the kind of confidence though the Duke has in filipowski they switch him out on guards first Cummins the point guard and that times the Bandit so Lebowski gonna try and answer a three and does for Derek Whitehead 15 of Dukes 23 and only philipowskys second threepoint Basket in ACC play 15th of the year for the freshman lead cut down to five Henson working with Mitchell spins at the foul Lane got to do something shoots it out to sabandi shot clock at eight Applause Mitchell defends a Bandy air ball Federico followed it four for Federico back to a seven point Pitt Advantage unless if that hits the rim I think the Blue Devils get the ball but the air ball allowed Federico to put that one in Proctor out front phillipowski challenging on the drive and a foul ticketed on the Panthers thatll get us to a timeout Federico gets his second it is the fifth on Pitt Blue Devil shooting threes Whitehead a moment ago and then philipowski from Deep back in a moment Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont feel seen hey mom look mom oh my God Mom you gotta look at this nope keeping my eyes on

other good things hes doing hes four of five from the floor of the rest of the Blue Devils four of 17 the rest of the Blue Devils 417 theyre certainly glad they brought filipowski along tonight yep Wes its interesting Duke is staying in this game with their threepoint shooting we showed you there theyve turned it over uh eight times and theyre only theyre shooting under 40 percent theyre only shooting 36 percent overall yeah but theyre shooting over 40 percent from three and theyve made five threes and thats been the key so far by the way the uh Panthers have six steals from six different players theres philipowski at the line the 13th best free throw shooter in the ACC and it rattled out hes coming off of 15 nine and three blocks on Saturday at Boston College and he made a big play at the end of that game tell the truth right and everybody says well you know they only won by one at Boston College let me tell you now with Quentin postback Boston College is a different team theyve got a bunch of hardnosed tough guys and particularly in Boston I think theyre going to be hard for anybody yep 10 points now for philipowski Blakes almost got the steal and got enough of it that Burton touched it last said Jeffrey Clark turnover number six on Pittsburgh here in the first half and of course this is Blakes reputation as a defensive guy and he thought he had that one and again it just tipped off Burtons fingers Livelys coming to game they try out for the lob and theres the dont and thats what Lively does and he does it very well and thats the first time weve been able to see our Duke execute that against Pitt tonight pick and roll and Lively at The Rim out front nice fake Henson he will get to the basket for the scoop and score West it looks like he made that a whole lot more difficult than it had to be I thought a little pullup jumper is fine but thats a heck of a move by a big man they list him at 67 235 Deltona Florida native Blake Henson theres a three by Proctor that bounds away philipowski cleans it up and hes fouled by Diaz Graham Guillermo will be ticketed with his first and the sixth overall on pit you see Lively sets the screen and then just slips to the basket when Guillermo Diaz goes with the ball and they have theyve worked at very effective effectively for lies Lively almost all of his baskets this year so far have come on dunks philipowski hit one or two a moment ago now with 11 points Applause and uh this young man from Philadelphia Dan its uh been a little scrappy these are the last three games and these are the averages you see the point totals in the rebounds Livelys you know there was so much expectations the preseason Rookie of the Year in the ACC now but theres a lot of expectations Wes and what hes discovering is if you can only dunk it its going to be hard to get score and hard to get minutes in this conference Cummings a step back too rings the bell Wes one thing were seeing out here was Whitehead and philipowski for Duke and Burton and Elliott and cummings for Pitt weve got some shot makers out on the court sure do heres Proctor on the drive and a whistling foul on the perimeter Two Shots coming against Cummings his first personal seventh on Pittsburgh with 437 to play and weve seen weve this is what were talking about with the Panthers they get good ball movement and Cummins he doesnt hesitate he drives Mitchell back with the dribble Mitchell of course has to be concerned that the little guy will get around him he drives Mitchell back with the dribble and then can step back and make that jump shot fourth point of the game for Tyrese Proctor dont forget Thursday night is ladies night womens basketball takes over ACC Network NC State and the conferences leading scorer tonight and Lawson or Latson rather a Florida State thats at six oclock and then Miami and Georgia Tech now Fortner and Katie Myers score up on acc womens Hoops here on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app really nice job by Duke West they were down by 12 and theres an offensive foul on Burton itll be his second and thats big for Pitt 4 26 to go and the second on Burton so he becomes the second Panther with two joining Federico and Jeff Capel was concerned about foul trouble reeling from the Clemson game on Saturday and now his leading scorer in conference play in the accs leading scorer in conference play at 214 is on the bench more than likely for the final 4 20 and there is a moving screen on lively for his second hes the second Blue Devil with two and thats the fifth on John shires team at the 417 Mark lets remember we said that John shires guys were trying really hard to stay in front of Burton well Blakes did and the result was a foul now lets see how the Panthers are able to do here without their leader Cummings waves off the Diaz Graham screen here is Henson with Mitchell defending and he traveled drug the pivot foot turnover will be number eight on Pittsburgh there have been 17 combined here in the first half nine on Duke and eight now on those Panthers man Hinson has a couple of those turnovers and again heres the matchup philipowskys matched up against Henson Mitchell Diaz Graham got a piece of it second try no good tap follow Lively four for lively the pit bench thinks that that ball was on it was in the cylinder the West were talking Duke was down 12 now theyre within two heres Cummings Elliott attacking on the drive and were going to get a reach I believe called is that Lively or filipowski itll get us to a break Ron groover on the whistle here and it is against Kyle filipowski sixth on the Blue Devils twopoint lead for Pitt when we continue with a Bojangles family meal like our delicious scratch made biscuits thats more flaky buttery buttermilk

and new ground come for it all we are all in on the moment when Papa trades in the driveway to getting buckets in the court all in on the ACC and the conference that raises and the teams theyre Shapers we are all in for all time come for it all Wes the rules say you cant touch the ball when its in the cylinder above the basket or its on the rim and in this particular case Derek Lively got both of them its on the rim and its in the cylinder you can see why Jeff Capel was upset about that so thats thats a gift wrapped for the Blue Devils right there yeah Blue Devils get one on the house and now after the foul a moment ago on philipowski by the way hes on the floor with Lively Proctor Mitchell and Blakes it belongs to the Panthers and here is Henson trying to drive in traffic almost worked himself into a theres a push and a foul off the ball on lively third on Derrick Lively with 321 to go seventh on the Blue Devils thats a trip West and thats one of those things where it doesnt matter whether hes trying to do it or not it was accidental but if you make contact with somebody and through that contact you gain a significant advantage and he did because he knocked Henson to the ground then thats a foul couple of changes for the Blue Devils as Blake Henson Dan already told you terrific looking athlete 67 235 Deltona Florida front end of the one and one dramatically Falls in another look and you see he just Falls over the right foot of lively Lively but he didnt realize he was there yeah but again its contact that gave him an advantage so thats a foul Henson hits the second one hes got seven here in the first half Blake Henson by the way Dan out of Deltona Florida was a highly recruited college football Prospect you can certainly see why tight end had some SEC offers 3632 fourpoint lead for Pittsburgh grandison back on the floor heres Proctor by the way playing with the two fouls philipowski thought about it on Diaz Graham puts it on the floor turns it over and a second foul on philipowski as Elliott got knocked down eight now on the Blue Devils second on the Freshman from West Town New York and the 10th Duke turnover this first half and theyre still only Trail by four points this is a great job by Diaz Graham moving his feet in Philadelphia again he didnt mean to do that hes in the wrong place at the wrong time and now the place hes got to go is the bench one and one for Greg Elliott no good and the rebound from Mitchell Elliots been double figures in five of Pitts last seven games and has just a single field goal here in the first half Proctor a deep three rebounded sabandi pity shooting 56 percent from the floor and leads by four Dan theyve turned it over theyve missed a couple of free throws and Duke has shot it pretty well from three Cummings here is Santo step in two from the elbow another rebound for Whitehead and WESH you play in this building and weird things happen oh yeah happens to your offense yep Mitchell squares rebound for sabandi Pitt trying to flip the floor to create numbers right wing Elliott pushes up a three and its good Elliott has been struggling to shoot a little bit West but you get a guy like that a threepoint shooter like that open in transition thats going to be a positive just about every time it is not a confirmed three and Blakes cant hang on to it in front of the pit bench with under two minutes to go so the Blue Devils another turnover and a half court so that last bucket by Elliott is one theyre going to want to confirm at the monitor but theyre not going to do it I think until we get toward the end of the half here what do you think hes behind the line thats what I thought too not that my books The Gospel here but I already marked it up as a May 3 okay all right well you were right yeah got that one right which is good for me in math Elliott sneaking Baseline Applause got it to Santos takes it in hell feed Diaz Graham for the dunk Guillermo the older of the twins flushes home his first field goal back to an eightpoint lead for Pitt just as duke responded to pit pit has now responded to the latest Duke runt White had the drive bothered by Diaz Graham young gives Duke another chance Mitchells three and young scrambles inside were going to get a whistle and a foul and youre going to get it on sabandi oh its going to be on Diaz Graham this is really a nice play and again this is where Pitt finds their post guys on drives to the basket the defense goes to help the post guy just slides in there neither of the Diaz Graham Twins or Federico Federico get inside and post up in the traditional old school way theres the thats Jorge Jorge the younger brother yep the smaller brother thats well yeah by an inch so here is Young at the line front end of the one and one Ryan young left it on the rim boy he never misses a free throw no so it seems just his sixth Miss in 36 tries final minute now this opening half Pittsburgh protecting an eightpoint lead and Pitt has made this response without Burton sabandi jump shot good that is 10 now for sabandi its an eightnothing pit run to push the lead to 10 here young rolling against Diaz Graham dumped it into the corner Blakes is three Mitchell the rebound block from behind Diaz Graham itll stay with the Blue Devils Wes Diaz Graham has been very active on the inside hes only got that one bucket but hes done a nice job rebounding the ball hes done a nice job moving his feet and hell come out of the ball game as Henson reports back for the final 269 here its suddenly very small Applause heres Whitehead theres about a eight second differential shot clock to game clock as we wind down the first half Whitehead on the drive and thatll be an offensive foul Nelly Cummings stepped in to draw the charge second on Tariq Whitehead he is the fourth Duke player with two or more he just doesnt get stopped in time you know he tried to make that jump Stop west but he couldnt get stopped and as a result he gets another foul and Pitts going to take the use it or lose it with a 10point lead final possession of the half coming up in a moment well Pittsburghs going to have the final possession of the first half its a nine nothing run in the last 307 for Pitt but maybe more of a concern another drought here offensively for the Blue Devil with two droughts offensively in the first half and Pitt West theyve got 43 points in the first half and thats a Duke doesnt usually give up 43 points and a half in this building blue devils little extended pressure here against Cummings Whitehead with 10 seconds defending Nelly seven theres five seconds Henson trying to set the screen Cummings from the parking lot front rim Miss Henson collects and the horn sounds before he can reset for a shot I think they wanted Cummins to create something but not a shot from the parking lot a 30footer yeah not I dont think that was the play nope Panthers in the half on a nine nothing run they lead by 11 4332 jamarius Burton went to the bench offensive rebounds but they have four Second Chance points and the turnovers have really hurt Duke all right go to the second half Mitchell young Proctor philipowski Whitehead out there for the Blue Devils Federico with Elliott Henson Cummings and jamarius Burton now Federico and Burton both have the two personal fouls Proctor playing uh with two as well for Duke and there is Young his first field goal little ball game starts the second half just not a lot Federico can do Brian Young had averaged 12 points and eight rebounds and was 18 of 22 from the floor in his last four games coming in but he has just two points from that basket there heres Burton sizing up filipowski step back good 11 for Burton and he heard Bonner talking about it fifth field goal for jamarius Burton heres young scoring up on Federica Lively is the only player in the ball game with three hes on the Duke bench and theres a illegal screen yep Ryan young picks up his first and number one of the second half on the Blue Devils you know Wes Pitt is not going to drop down on young to help Federico out and the Panthers and excuse me the Blue Devils might want to consider exploiting that you have to get yourself set you cannot be moving when you set that screen so Barton gonna handle the ball here against Derek Whitehead a burden place for me he can do anything he wants working on philipowski reroute skips for Henson slides Baseline Burton attacks off the dribble skip for Cummings out front Elliott open pushes up a three and Mitchell the rebound Elliott looked off balance when he caught that ball he was leaning forward philipowski the dunk hes got 14 now and the Blue Devils need to get easier baskets and thats one way to do it nine point lead for Pitt young defense Cummings Nelly squares for three and hits now he is not a high percentage free throw shooter but he he shoots him up there so you got to make sure you stay close enough that you can bother that he had 22 against Syracuse in a road win for Pitt this year including six of 11 from behind the line I think the Blue Devils would be wise to get Mitchell a little more involved philipowski squares and turns hes got 16 four of Duke six here in the second half you know Mitchell hadnt made a basket tonight hes over five yeah its only pointer at the free throw line heres Cummings weve tried to weave through traffic and John Gaffney with a foul and its going to be on Proctor and thatll be his third Ronnie Proctor this is just a really nice pass to philipowski I dont know how you lose filipowski but the Panthers did really nice job by the big guy to run the court and say on Tyrese Proctor to find him heres Henson collects for a two off the left side and the rebound for the Blue Devils Henson is the Panthers have seven steals West by seven different guys Hinson is the only guy whos played for Pitt tonight who doesnt have a steal young kicks for whiteheads three Miss badly Mitchell the rebound Federico tried to bomb Rick theres the first field goal for the Freshman Mark Mitchell and Mitchells a guy whos just going to keep working Wes hes not going to get upset if things arent going well he is a hard hard worker theres another offensive Rebound in that time the Blue Devils cast it in Cummings a step back high arcing shot is good for Nelly Cummings hes got five in the half nine in the ball game and its still a double figure Advantage for the Panthers well he likes that step back doesnt he yep seemingly its a feels like a basic part of what they do offensively yes and remember Cummins is only six feet tall so this step back has to be an important part of his Arsenal hes going up against the 610 guy but there was a lot of arc on the ball rock girl put it in play the foul was on Elliott it was his second theres young weaving through with the right hand jump hook and its his second field goal hes just too strong for Federico yep Cummings hes telling everybody get out of the way working against young passes on the three Henson trying to drive Mitchell into traffic tend to shoot for Burton wants a screen Federico obliges Burton on the attack foul line with three on the shot clock spins out rebound phillipowski stop Burton almost made that one but thats the way you have to defend him nice job by the Blue Devil eightpoint game young again its been effective here at the start of the half phillipowski has as well the three goes begging in the rebound for Federico wide open one for filipowski because Hinson dropped down into help pit trying to spread the floor here Burton against philipowski off the screen into traffic John Shire wanted travel three to shoot Cummings on the drive the scoop bothered phillipowski the rebound ball never reached the rim heres Proctor and Duke Proctor the initiative and swatted out of there by Federico thats some play by Federico Timeout on the floor Pit by eight early second half its bow time look closely and youll see

Wes back in Cameron if youre going to defend jamarius Burton youve got to stay in front of him first of all you cant let him get by nice job by Young to stop him and then Whitehead Moves In Front youve got to stay down you cant go for those ball fakes forces Burton into a very difficult shot this guy is a key for the pit offense not only with his scoring but he creates you see hes got five assists in the game tonight you cannot let him get by you again easier said than done and you have to stay down on his ball face theres phillipowski got trapped Whitehead slashes left it on the rim and young couldnt control it and young says last Touch by Pitt so does Jeffrey Clark well Youngs opinion really isnt the one that matters there I understand but he offered and Jeffrey Clark obliged so there you go Whitehead with a fresh 20 young the rebound Duke going to get a third crack and philipowski fourth crop yeah on the drive and hell get free throws not enough Pitt is ahead in this game Wes but theyve got to get this offensive rebounding figured out Duke is just dominating the offensive boards pair of free throws for philipowski who is three for four Duke now with 18 offensive rebounds and heres the first one that is good five and a half 17 in the game now for philipowski dont forget Thursday nights its ladies night nothing but net of course our terrific womens basketball show Kelsey Riggs the Hall of Fame coach Muffet McGraw Kelly grahamlink Ivory latted now part of the team as well all the coverage you want the games the schedule the analysis and all the highlights coming up on nothing but net tomorrow night 10 oclock Eastern following our womens double header on acc Network and always on the ESPN app now lets see if Pitt can blunt this Duke surge and a foul will be called on the Blue Devils and it is on Whitehead Tariq Whitehead draws his third third of the half on Duke the officials West are very rarely going to let you get away with slapping at the ball from behind John Shire not particularly happy remember we said you couldnt let Burton get past you well again thats much easier to say but hard to do Henson had a three Rim out from the left corner sixpoint game Proctor heres philipowski now Whitehead and hes got Nike sabandi who was quite a spark off the bench in the first half now filipowski turns and a skip for Mitchells Lefty three when Mitchell he makes a high percentage of those wide open threes missed a couple tonight sure and now Cummings to work spot up at 16 feet and good for Nelly Cummings West they are so good those guards in the midrange yep seven and a half 11 in the ball game for Cummings its an eightpoint pit lead with six minutes gone in the second half well thats great help by Federico and then to get back to his man heres Proctor now with eight to shoot to Young Federico recovers Mitchell tried to go back to Young taking away sabandi pit with a transition chance and Nike sabandi had it blocked by white hair overpassing there by the Blue Devils and Pitt they never gave up on the defensive end and thats another steal Applause so Guillermo Diaz Graham Checks In for the Panthers and Lively has joined grandison in the lineup for Duke Applause Cummings got to find a outlet on the Baseline out of bounds and its the seven foot freshman from the Canary Islands Burton shakes philipowski hanger left it short might have been bothered I think either philipowski or Lively got a hand on that nice defense Whitehead spot up three too strong and knocked out of bounds by grandison says Jeffrey Clark that ball bounced off a couple of guys and I I think it might have been philipowski is the last guy that hit you know its like pinball out here right off the head oh it hit the hand yeah right off the head of Cummins and off the hand of philipowski as a surprise for Cummins is Eddie Cummins almost had a header seven minutes in heres Cummings on the drive nice play grandison but a great play by philipowski to not let him get by Proctor skip for phillipowski hell Slash from the wing and turned it over to Diaz Graham number 15 for the Blue Devils tonight sabandi tried to go to Burton and got knocked away and its returned on the turnover by Pitt grandison filipowski layup and one Guillermo Diaz Grahams third and the Third on pit here in the second half this is a situation where you have to get back on defense and Diaz Graham just doesnt beat philipowski down the court philipowskis having a great game tonight he is five of six at the line and well go to the stripe here to try and make it a fivepoint Pittsburgh lead I got to tell you there have been a handful of consecutive possessions that have been like a fire drill here tonight in this building you know if youre the pit Panthers you cannot be relying on the official to blow the whistle here you have to be very tough with the basketball because Duke has suddenly raised the defensive intensity and now they have the crowd behind it thats an important possession for Pitt John shires got a new student assistant on his bench and Jeremy Roach urging his teammates sabandia three back rim bounds away for grandison I think he got to probe the interior a little bit before you take that one in that situation Proctor on the drive feeds Lively right hand layup fell off phillipowskis got 20 actually 21 to go with nine rebounds tonight sabandi Cummings with Lively defending they dont try to post up the Big Guy Burton attacks on the dribble against Lively cant score it Diaz Graham had it and draws the foul so well go to the break on a Blue Devil foul the ball will belong to the Panthers who are up five foul was on grandison filipowskis got 219 to lead the ball game since I was little I wanted to be a part of a team come here

order with well a legacy basketball player in his own right his dad played it slippery rock his mom played at Long Beach State Kyle filipowski is on the verge of his seventh DoubleDouble but Dannys got a season High 21 tonight for Duke and thats a big reason theyre within five well and you can see what hes meant to the team he scored almost half the points you know the rest of the teams make its nine field goals he has seven and I think the key though here in the second half is Duke has really turned it up on the defensive end remember Pitt shot 56 in the first half theyve only made four of 13 field goals here in the second burden theyve made life difficult for Bert yep he is five of ten from the floor and Lively picked it and heres Whitehead bounce pass Proctor and one on the flyby picks up his second Proctors got his second field goal and Wes this is just a tremendous defensive play by Lively and if youre Nelly Cummins For Heavens Sake youre six feet tall the odds that youre gonna block this shot are very limited just let that one go Tyrese Proctor at the line and a chance to draw Duke to within two Pitt is doing a little standing around here in the second half West thats why theyre four for 13 I think and theyve become a little tentative theyre not as aggressive offensively as they were in the first half and as a result were back to a twopoint game yep eight tonight for Proctor it was averaging just five points in his previous three games you see Pitt theyre in a bit of a scoring drought themselves they havent really had a good shot Diaz Graham now for Cummings nine minutes gone second half it was an 11 point lead at the break Cummings five to shoot hell take Lively into traffic now heres Burton at the top for three backroom missing Whitehead clears thats great defense Duke hasnt LED since it was 54 Applause Proctor Lively time out Jeff Capel John Shire wondered about the energy in the building helping his team its here now Music introducing the

now tie Pitt 52old but maybe no one more happier than James Walter a seventh grader at Holly Ridge Middle School here in the Raleigh Durham area James is the honorary captain of the Duke basketball team today hes going to begin an intensive round of chemotherapy tomorrow at Duke childrens hospital and he has been part of shoot arounds and everything today for Duke basketball its a special young man whos got quite a challenge Applause and its nice to see him having a big night here now is on Whitehead of Duke we wish him all the best yep absolutely thats the fourth on Derek Whitehead fifth on Duke with 1013 to go here in the ball game well keep an eye on Batman because outside of phillipowski thats a guy that can go get your points here is Burton with Mitchell defending part of the problem for Pitt is that Lively and philipowski been switching out on those ball screens and pit cant shoot over them Cummings caught around Miss of a three kid is spreading the court trying to get the ball to beat Duke off the dribble and they cant do it and its hard to shoot over top eight nothing run by the Blue Devils grandison heres Lively Federico Federico defends and Lively cant finish Burton the rebound Pitts only hit one of their last 10 Henson Baseline and knocked to the floor I think he got too far into the basket Proctor for filipowski in the lead nope Lively the rebound and were going to get a whistle and a foul underneath the basket that will keep possession with the Blue Devils and its on Nelly Cummings itll be his third when thats another offensive rebound for Duke thats 20 in the game yes and what was the first thing Jeff Capel said he was concerned about today right yep absolutely so the man knows his business absolutely right Mitchell spending on sabandi layup good hes too big for sabandi second field goal for Mitchell Duke in front for the first time since it was 54 now lets see how Pitt responds yep Burton on the drive too strong hes worried about Lively lob Lively came down with it feeds phillipowski and the Blue Devil bench erupts Applause Jeff Capel a timeout West one of the things that Duke has been able to do is get out in transition this is a great job by Lively to not walk to keep his balance and filipowski bails him out by doing something very simple he just runs the court Dan theyve tightened up things at the defensive end of the floor for sure you talk about the way theyre handling screens here in the second half well Wes the other thing theyve done is theyve stopped throwing it to pit theyve cut down on the turnovers so Pitt has not had as many easy opportunities Pitt has to go every time against the set defense and they try to start it with a high ball screen there with Federico and either philipowski or Lively have been switching out and the pit guards simply have not been able to be productive either getting around or shooting over the top its been outscored 249 here in the second half well theyve had to take tough shots against the set defense only one time out to go in the ball game for the Panthers Burton with Proctor defending and a foul on Tyrese Proctor and thats his fourth well he literally stuck his nose in there and yep Applause and Chris Carroll and John Shire I think want Jeff Clark and these guys to have a look at the monitor Proctor comes out on the fourth foul with 8 31 to play fine the question is it was is this a flagrant foul on jamarius perk you know Burton did swing his elbows out there so we will have a monitor check here I dont see anything there do you well this is clearly foul and watch Burtons right arm it comes up and I you know I just think his arm was coming up but the ball got knocked loose in the process right right here no no no no no right there okay I mean thats uh thats totally inadvertent okay so Proctor has four Whitehead has four Lively has three theres a look and 8 31 to go now Lively had all three of his in the first half he has done a nice job here in the second half well you mentioned the the schematic change against the screens here for Duke defensively right theyve changed some a little bit of a wrinkle here and there they they switched the screens in the first half West but the thing I think in the first half is Duke wasnt able to really set their defense remember we talked about Pitt having seven steals well if the guys are stealing the ball you cant get back and set your defense and so Pitt was able to just flow into an offense and they werent as easy to defend in this half Pitt has Pitt has not been able to generate those steals so while the discussion ensues quick reminder to you womens basketball takes over the ACC Network tomorrow night number 11 NC State and Florida state starts our coverage at six oclock and then Miami Georgia Tech from mccamish Pavilion in midtown Atlanta follows that ACC womens Hoops on a Thursday night here on acc Network and streaming live on the ESPN app well West clearly since were taking so long with this review the guys work in the game arent as dismissive of it as I was so John Gaffney Jeffrey Clark Ron gruver the trio in discussion and the video being replayed here inside of Cameron Indoor Stadium and as you might Imagine The Artisan Blue Devil crowd thinks that Burton is guilty well there was contact there theres no question Wes and there was contact with the elbow to the face but hes bringing up his arm and just running straight through I just with all this discussion here they may be uh Jeff Capel they its a flagrant foul Jeff Capel the way he just reacted he is not happy with this Music okay its the same thing its uh on the foul West the foul makes it a dead ball so it is a foul on Proctor on Proctor and so the balls dead once they blow the whistle with the foul and then theres the contact and so basically what theyve called is a dead ball technical foul its the same penalty as the flagrant file its basically a flagrant foul when the ball is dead so youre going to have two shots here for Duke and then youre gonna pick it up where you stopped and that means pittle had the ball yes phillipowski has hit seven in a row after missing his first and I guess Im responsible for that according to some so its a fivepoint game and now Pittsburgh will have the ball on the Baseline no excuse me Im sorry Wes its a flagrant its a flagrant foul when the ball is dead and the penalty for a flagrant fouls two shots on the ball and the ball so thats the penalty for this dead ball technical foul okay Im sorry largest lead of the game for Duke on the free throw by philipowski and the Blue Devils the ball and they have a chance to extend it sure do heres Mitchell spinning in traffic forced it with the left hand and a foul called on Federico Federico itll be his fourth he becomes the first pit player with four at the 8 20 mark Wesson the other thing that has has happened here in this second half is Pittsburgh has not gotten to the freethrow line thats it and zero the Panthers they they score a lot of points from the freethrow line in their big win against Virginia they outscored the Cavaliers 112 from the line in the second half and so the Panthers they want to attack they want to draw the defense they want to draw fouls they want to kick it out for threes they havent been able to do that for the last four or five minutes six and a half eight in the ball game it is a 15nothing run by Duke its a 192 run over the last 815 so heres that switch on the ball screen again only nine second half points for Pitt Henson the catch but a foul first I believe on Blakes well it took pit a little while to recognize that mismatch inside Hinson was asking for the ball 804 to go and thats the third or the seventh foul on Duke and the first on the sophomore from New Jersey and Jalen Blakes so here is Henson and left it short on a one and one hes a 70 freethrow shooter and in a type of game like this where you desperately need points you just cant leave it there yep philipowski here is Mitchell with Burton Defender Mitchell with five on the shot clock bounces to philipowski hell turn fall away and hence in the rebound now you got to push now you got to try to get down and get an easy basket heres Burton against Blakes Diaz Graham trying to help with the screen and theres that switch yep now Lively with Burton to Marius will get a foul drawn on lively well it was an 11point pit lead at the half Duke is on a big run 192 and the Blue Devils lead by seven when we come back on acc Network Im a screen addicted tween and if Im not posting on social media I dont

from apparel backpacks drinkware to hightech items wow I love it go to 4imprintcom and find some wow now for imprint for certain point lead for Duke Pittsburgh has but nine points here in the second half and its a 192 Run for the Blue Devils in the last nine minutes and Pittsburgh doesnt have a point in the last 6 45 Dan its it this is an amazing turnaround Wes the Panthers are four for 17 overall in this half one for six from three they just havent had any really good opportunities foul on lively his fourth he comes off the floor young philipowski grandison Mitchell and Blakes out there for Duke jamarius Burton at the line for Pittsburgh and the front end is good well theyve dug themselves a hole Wesson the first thing the Panthers have to do like anybody else when you dig yourself a hole when you get in the host to stop digging and so thats what theyre doing right now with that that basket now theyve got to get a couple of stops and get back to what they were doing on offense in the first half something were bounced away hes an 80 free throw shooter two of three is Burton so maybe they havent stopped digging sixpoint game speaking of digging you got to dig in here on the defensive end phillipowskis had a terrific night and knock down Henson no foul called and then a foul on Diaz Graham which will be his fourth a seventh on Pitt with 706 to go Henson is going to try to take a charge and theres a lot of contact there Wesson you know so is that a flop is that a foul the officials obviously ruled yes there was contact but you know incidental obviously and Jeff Clark talking to Guillermo Diaz Graham and now Ron gruver is asking what for and so now the question I think here is there theyre calling a blocking on Henson on Henson okay so thats what theyre doing again if you originally thought the foul was on Guillermo he has Graham trying to block the shot but theyve ruled that that was a foul on Henson for a walking phone so heres so the foul is right here on Henson and they ruled that to be a foul because Henson Henson stepped reward there was a lot of contact there but Hinson stepped toward philipowski so now it is a one and one for filipowski it was not on Diaz gray and then it will not be a twoshot opportunity which is what was originally ticketed and the free throw good for Kyle fidelpowski who now has in all these points are seasoned highs hes got 25 hes also got his seventh DoubleDouble which ties him for third in the ACC Armando bacott has 900 Tyson to Clemson eight and phillipowski in a group at seven the West remember the Panthers scored 43 points in the first half theyve only scored 10 in this half so they are capable offensively but theyve got to start getting the ball to go in the basket heres that mismatch Blakes against Henson again Elliott whos been quiet here in the second half on the drive and a block is called on Ryan Young by Ron Gruber so young picks up his second ninth team foul but two shots for the Marquette transfer Ellie gets around philipowski yeah those are bang bang calls Wes thats a break for Pitt right there so here is Greg Elliott the third to shoot free throws grad student from Detroit free throw good six tonight for Elliott he averages eight and a half against the league Duke assistant coach Chris Carroll actually coached Elliott at Marquette when he was there with Steve wozzowski Applause you start doing some deep dive on the pit roster you find out they got four guys that have played a decade of basketball it feels like but these young Duke players have kind of matured and battled here tonight and pit to his own yep heres a three Bob Blakes and the rebound Burton battling young who rolled to the deck and then saved it to grandison heres Mitchell on the drive young again blocked foul Diaz Graham now Diaz Grahams got to be careful do you ever want to get a technical foul what a play by Ryan young yep diving on the floor after the ball I mean he was close to the sideline there and he didnt go out of bounds Dives on the floor after the bond gets rid of it nice job by grandison to go over and help his teammate out heres young first of two at the line after the fourth on Diaz Graham fifth point for young John Shire into her visit said you know we did some really good things at Boston College the other day certainly better than what they had done a week ago tonight in Raleigh young missed the second he said but were still kind of finding ourselves well theyve made a great response tonight sure have Barton had it blocked by Young heres Blakes ahead for philipowski challenged by Henson and the second follow no good and the foul called here and well see if this is Diaz Graham and that is five Wes thats 22 offensive rebounds for Duke and again Duke is getting these offensive rebounds in a large case because theyre playing in transition and even when theyre not playing in transition theyre getting the ball in the lane theyre causing the defense to come and help and that creates rebounding Lanes second time this year Guillermo Diaz Graham has fouled out of a game by the way coming into tonight he had only committed five fouls in five ACC games he has five tonight and frustration in talking to his twin brother Jorge philipowski the first one and the second one drops through two freshmans been good tonight very good 2814 for filipowski its gone eight minutes without a field goal down nine Cummings drops in a three they desperately did that one now Wes they have time that weve still got almost six minutes left in this game but theyve got to start getting some stops and part of that you dont get a stop until you get the ball theyve got to rebound the ball defensively 10 in the second half for Cummings 14 in the ball game Mitchell heres young skipped to Blakes not Cummings down grandison a three out of the corner wow and a timeout for John Shire 24yearold Jacob grandison most senior man on the Duke roster and his 131st college game tonight has dropped a pair of Threes in the ball game and the lead is nine again for Duke and well and this is just a great play by Young he does such a good job getting the ball out and again even against the Zone West we see that dribble penetration forces the defense to come and help now Pitt wanted a charge on that play but when the defense collapses grandison is a very good threepoint shooter particularly when he has his feet set and he was able to get his feet that had just enough time nine point game again with 5 28 to play dont forget coming up coverage from WinstonSalem Florida State whos won four of their last six meets a Wake Forest team that has beaten Florida State the last two times they played and tonight the Seminoles get the 611 Phenom Baba Miller onto the floor for the first time well West weve heard an awful lot about Miller the Florida state folks have been talking about him since the year started so yep opportunity for him to Showcase his talents in Florida State on the road they need that Corey Alexander Randolph Childers standing by from the Joel in WinstonSalem Steve Forbes his team 115 32 in the league Leonard Hamiltons team is three and two in the league 5 and 11 overall Burton step back on Mitchell and the rebound for filipowski Burton was open Wes but he wasnt ready to shoot the ball and it wasnt a good pass either and by the time he got the ball under control the defense was there Mitchell grandison now philipowski has skipped for Blakes Granderson calling for it in the left corner wide open hell launch spun out battle for the ball Blakes has got it heres young got it blocked from behind by Federico cleans it up and scores Dukes got a season High 23 offensive rebounds tonight Henson Fires for three the rebound for Burton back in traffic Burton scores West is its still only a nine point game but the Panthers I mean they cant get a rebound 6960 and if youre Duke you dont want to get tentative but you dont need to go at a Breakneck Pace anymore youve got a nine point lead the clock is your friend in this particular situation Blakes off a screen a deep from in front three and Henson clears the rebound a little bit of standing around by Duke against the zone and again you got to be careful about taking your foot off the gas heres Henson left wing triple away and grandison made the save Federico goes to the deck with young and Ron grubers whistle stops Play Hell ball and possession will stay with the Panthers timeout in Durham 3 35 to go in the Blue Devils lead is nine so that way hes up in the game with the

Florida State and Wake Forest accs second leading scorer Tyree Appleby looking to help his team pick a backtoback conference wins this games going to tip at 905 on the app and then we will bring you to it right here on acc Network after the conclusion of this game guys also looking forward to seeing Bob Millers debut a papa Miller Dan there you go yeah everybodys looking forward to seeing that nobody more than Leonard Hamilton thats yeah Kelsey and you and me would be right behind Leonard Hamilton you know maybe not right behind maybe a little further behind Pitts scored 17 second half points Kyle filipowski scored 16 and a foul on Mitchell as Cummings was trying to put the ball in play on the Baseline and Mark Mitchells first of the night but it is the 10th team foul on Pitt with 3 35 to go west and for the if youre the pick Panthers and youre having the kind of struggles theyre having on offense its awfully hard for that not to carry over on the defensive end and I think weve seen a little bit of that tonight Two Shots here for uh Greg Elliott the Third and the first one good Wes and the Panthers still have time but they have run out of wiggle room thats it Federico Federico takes a break theyre going to size down now with Nike sabandi checking into the lineup well they forced 12 turnovers in the first half well its only three here in the second half Duke has done an outstanding job hanging on to the basketball and thats a big reason for their offensive Resurgence nine in the ball game for Elliott Seven Point Duke lead Jeff Capel one timeout remaining John Shire has two so Burtons trying to match up against philipowski well we got double bonuses both ways see if Duke Alex to try to get him down inside young against Henson double team Cummins Skips from Mitchell he lost it itll belong to Pitt out west theres the turnover you know we said thats Duke has only had three in the second half thats four and its a break for the Blue Devils that thats not a transition turnover the ball goes out of bounds and so they can get set their defense Lively into the ball game to replace Young sabandi shot fake on filipowski drives and draws Livelys fifth foul Lively wasnt in there long say what you want about Nike sabandi thats a heady play right there Lively going to foul out with six points tonight and do so with 301 to play in the ball game West that is a smart Play Because philipowski runs at him runs him off the threepoint line and then rather than pull rather than take the midrange pullup jumper he can seize that its Lively there its gonna be tough to shoot over him so he goes right at him draws the foul third foul third time this year that Lively has fouled out of a ball game first time in ACC play Lively could have could block a midrange jump shot and thats good recognition by sabandi to go right at him Nike sabandi and the freethrow attempt is good first part of the second half Dan we said that Pitt wasnt getting to the free throw line well suddenly they are and theyre crawling back into the game just with the clock stop too by the way second one good a dozen for sabandi and here is Blakes pressured into the front Court avoids the double team with a pass to Proctor philipowski trying to help with a screen heres young filipowski working to get the ball inside yep Burton there defensively double team with Elliott six to shoot heres Proctor on the drive and he got the bounce off the glass wow thats a big play five and a half double figures for Proctor now and a timeout taken by Duke they got one left tonight West thats a huge play for the youngest guy out there tell the truth and remember Jeremy roach weve said it a couple times hes not playing tonight so Proctor steps in with the main point guard responsibilities and this is just a really good tough play in a big situation first double figure effort for Tyrese Proctor in the last five games and the Freshman from Australia still just 18 years of age I wish you were talking about all the guys on the court with a hundred plus games Proctor didnt want to no no hes not in fact he shouldnt be playing in year one he should be here next year but reclassified an opportunity to contribute and John Shire welcomed him and with roaches injuries youd alluded to its been baptism by fire in many respects dont forget those of you waiting on Wake Forest at Florida State its available now in the ESPN app well send you to the Twin Cities as soon as were done here at Cameron Indoor Stadium Corey Alexander and Randolph Childers standing by to deliver the details of the Deeks and the Knolls tonight here is Cummings into the four court now drives Mitchell to the basket lost the handle on it and a kickball awarded to Duke so Im not sure did he dribble the ball was he out of bounds he fell down was he out of bounds touching the ball yeah might have been oh thats what happened yep raised the left leg well the kick violation Awards it to do I dont know that Ive seen that one guy kicks not in a while at least no yeah so if youre if youre the Panthers now you really need to take the ball you need takeaways and Dukes content to burn the clock down here seven to shoot Blakes drives into Burton offensive foul jamarius Burton will draw Jalen Blakes second foul player control no free throws Blakes is very aggressive West but you gotta right here you gotta get right there and you stop do a jump stop kick the ball out and thats what John Shire was telling him okay now youve gotten to stop now youve got to get a basket and you got to do it relatively quickly under two to go in a seven point game heres Burton out front Henson thats a long three and its good Blake Henson second triple of the night gives him double figures hes got 10 now its a fourpoint game 100 seconds to go Proctor against Nelly Cummings phillipowski gonna try and help Henson switches inside tough shot Proctor seven and a half a dozen in the game and two big ones recently yep heres Burton tried to beat the Blue Devils off the bounce ahead of a minute to go takes Mitchell inside the contact and the hoop for Burton seven and a half 16 in the game one minute to go in a fourpoint game but its got to get stops they want to have a crack at it and Duke to taking the time sure heres Whitehead they swing it to the corner back from Mitchell tend to shoot Proctor look for philipowski on the roll hell step for three rebounded by Elliott boy you got to go now heres Cummings inside 30 seconds hell take Mitchell to the basket skip for Elliott out of the corner for three too strong rebound by Mitchell in a foul on Nelly Cummings fourth on Cummings two shots for Mitchell whos four for four tonight at the line Applause wow Elliot went for the Home Run ball wow and he had a good look at it and hes a guy whos during his time at Marquette is a 40 career threepoint shooter coming into the year so if youre pit you like that shot it just didnt go Mitchells free throw is good itll be a two possession game for Pittsburgh regardless of the make or miss here with 21 and a half to go and he knocks it down so its a sixpoint game Pittsburghs got to get going Henson back for sabandi over the top of Proctor for three back rim Miss Burton had it lost it here is Blakes hell give it to Proctor and a foul by Burton comes with 73 left to go and the Blue Devils can feel their fourth ACC win their 13th on the year and their sixth in the last seven games Dan Wes this is an impressive performance theyre down nine at halftime and they responded yep and Im telling you weve seen you know in the last couple of games weve seen Derek Whitehead he wasnt such a big factor tonight but down the stretch when they had to have baskets who was it who was getting the basket form it was Tyrese Proctor sure was one freshman last Saturday actually a combination of Whitehead and philipowski and here today Tyrese Proctor a nine point second half 14 points in the ball game the layup missed by Burton and the ball game will end due to Trail 11 at halftime wins 7769 Pittsburgh shoots less than 30 percent from the floor in the second half as they fall for a second straight time in the ACC Kyle filopowskis seventh DoubleDouble of the Year 28 points and 15 rebounds Dan very impressive by Duke whos at Clemson on Saturday really impressive win Pittsburgh gets to Georgia Tech in Atlanta for Dan
