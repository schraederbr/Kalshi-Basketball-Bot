one and0 start the Irish eat pass Niagara in their season opened on Monday Western Carolina Hammer Dalton state in their first contest of the Year opening tip is one back by Charles Lampton and under from South bent Notre Dame in man defense as expected Russell Jones Jr one of the three Stellar guards on this Western Carolina team works it down low to wbr trying to work on Davis back out to Tre Jackson those three are the key for this Western Carolina team and were going to have an early turnover to start this one great start thats exactly what Notre Dame wants and Andrew Im a fan of Tay Davis on vonius Wright I think his length could be something that bothers him D Davis a sophomore which makes him an experienced option on this Notre Dame team working inside Marcus Burt tried to pick up where he left off mean his final six shots in that win over niagar 29 points as we said starts alongside another freshman in Braden Shrewsberry Julian roer and that shot good over matad Zona one of the few returners for this Irish team and Davis as you mentioned DK getting the start as well as the basketball here working to the foul line Shrewsberry pulls up from Deep Off the Mark this Irish team struggled from three in their opener just three for 17 Russell Jones you see leading the catamounts up the court wght tries to work inside out with Jackson and Lampton is that shot is knocked down wbri was looking for a foul didnt get it thats exactly what Michael Shrewsberry wants he wants them to make Woolbright a scorer scorer and not a distributor Matt Zona connects from downtown and hes fired up Zona who missed three for three Notre Dames final game last year in the ACC tournament did not attempt a shot from Beyond The Arc in the opener connects on his first triple of the year here good to see him get hot early as you mentioned Zona just one of only a couple of returning players for this inter Dame rosters its essentially him and jzn who are back from last years team Irish of course making a coaching change as a threepoint answer comes from Russell Jones Jr great ball movement led to an open three I bet you Justin Gray is Happy over there on that sideline Andrew yeah we know he as well likes when his team is shooting from Deep David tries to work inside too strong off the glass we said Dar before this game it is going to be a guards afternoon here at purcel Pavilion both these teams like to shoot the ball like to get out in transition heres Jones again connects again two threes from the top of the key right off the bat from Russell Jones Jr I think Marcus Burton needs to be a little closer on that close out he just hit two maybe some adjustments should be made there zono with the handoff Burton to the foul line he connects on a jumper good read of the ball screen he noticed the big backed up in the paint nice off the pull up cish team got off to a slow start they were down by double digits for a good chunk of the first half in that Niagara game closed it to one before halftime and a foul here against Burton that Mah Shrewsberry is not too happy about thats a small match up when he switches onto wbr hes going to have to body up early without fouling said he liked the discipline his team played with in that opening game not all lot of fouls not a allot of turnovers either which is no small feet for a coach putting in a new system with an entirely new roster almost the Irish got it done with their defense late in that contest heres wbri spinning unable to finish but he does draw the foul and well have the first three throws of the afternoon T Davis the party that brings vonius Wright the preseason Southern Conference Player of the Year led the conference with just over five assists per game last year only 66 at the line but he connects there right right there we saw why hes a veteran point guard hes good at getting in the paint he can make the right read he saw nobody was open and he drew the contact on Davis whos guarding him tight so now Tay Davis has a decision to make can I keep being aggressive do I have to take a step off and now thats going to work in Wrights favor Bernard pelot checking in there first sub for Western Carolina he replaces DJ Campbell as Wright goes two for two said early in that game you felt like NE Dame was trying to rush a lot of shots play some hero ball and they got their team game going as the evening progressed on Monday night Burton miscommunication there with Davis and he coughs it up W in transition pulls up from deep that one off the mark and this is going to stay with the catamounts as it was last Touch by Notre Dame Notre Dames going to have to take care of the ball against the veteran defense because turnovers and even bad shots are going to leave to scoring opportunities for Western Carolina see Colin Granger there for Western Carolina JR kesn for Notre Dame both checking in kzn sizing up Wright now switches off with Davis WB gets some space takes it to the basket and scores hes so good when he gets two feet in the paint montarius wbite with a skilled scorer and distributor averaged almost 15 points a game last year Shrewsberry gets inside is forced out Ranger in the new Sub in is on him shuberry draws two Defenders kicks it to the corner for a three thats off the mark from Davis Trey Jackson will slow it down gets a screen out high from Granger pull up jumper from outside the pain is no good Burton with a burst of speed tries to get downhill draws the foul and so willll step aside hot start early from the field for West Carolina they two from three from three and was telling us hes confident he has that senior leadership that IQ hes going to do whatever it is for his team and already hes Distributing and scoring tonight yeah not just the 19 points he threatened a triple double in that game as well seven assists and eight rebounds Irish quickly off the inbound three is left short and goes out of bounds from Cory Booth who delivered 10 points off the bench in Notre Dames opener on Monday Id like to see Notre Dame get some easier shots right like right off the bench carry Booth taking a corner three I like the confidence but at this point in the game Id like to see them get some easier attempts Marl Roberts into Colin Granger Jackson gets a screen off the handoff over kesn back out to wbri Irish will switch wbri inside attacks the basket but cannot finish Irish moving quickly now they slow things down we mentioned took them a little bit while to get going in their season open bit of a slow start to this one as well threepointer left side that went off the mark good hustle from kesn but it will be Western Carolina ball you see Micah Shrewsberry coaching up Julian roer pretty hard they worked really hard on defense under 10 they made Woolbright take a contested layup but again I dont think thats the shot selection that theyre looking for right now Shrewsberry at the start of the Season said that he wants to emphasize ball movement specifically said were not looking for we are looking for great shots not just okay ones and feels like nerd Dame settled for okay a little bit so far for sure Robertson looks to get downhill stops in his tracks picks up Trey Jackson Lefty scoop shot is no good Lan Imes one of the Freshman on this Irish team draws contact of an awkward play there looks like its going be ruled a foul on the floor as michah Shrewsberry looks on in his second game coaching this notame team following two very successful years at Penn State yeah as you see here first season at Notre Dame our Indiana native 37 and 31 record in his first two seasons at Penn State he also LED them to the best scoring defense in the Big 10 in his first year there at 65 points per game allowed heres another threepoint attempt and that one Falls from booth that should be great momentum for the Irish just to see the ball hit the bottom of the net is huge Irish not hit a single three in the first half in their opener theyve hit two so far on six tries in this one DJ Campbell Works inside puts up the runner no good zip drill on the rebound its still up for grabs all the way back to mid court and the Irish sold out for the board and winds up going bust easy two for Lampton inside how about that series of events I dont know if Ive ever seen that happen before Shrewsberry to the attack right along the Baseline works it out to Roper tries to back up on Lampton spins righty shot tried to go underneath fights for his own rebound still still has it draws contact cannot finish while tumbling to the floor nice work by rer getting after the offensive rebound and taking the confidence up against Charles Lampton which is definitely a matchup nightmare down there if I had to say yeah certainly did not have the size advantage to say the least this Notre Dame team historically has never been a top rebounding team and they dont figure to be one this year either but as Shrewsberry said effort and work ethic has to be at an alltime high for them on the glass and weve seen them fight for some rebounds so far in this game couple have come up short as in that dunk attempt from Booth he does draw contact and will go to the line thats something that I think is going to be huge tonight booth has a speed advantage over Charles Lam in and right there you see you got him up on the pump fake took it in and thats another foul already I think in the last 20 seconds on lampon so now Justin Gray is going to have to make some adjustments which is going to work in Notre Dames favor first from roer two strong shot just 46 from the line last year this his third stop in his college Journey started at St Marys then was at Northwestern and the former Michigan Mr basketball finalist now starting new South bent connects on the second you mention not a single starter from last years Notre team returning couple graduating a bunch of transfers as well after Mike Bray stepped aside Following over two decades coaching this team heres pelot from downtown he drills a three hes coming off a four for four night at the threepoint line and certainly has carried it over today early averaged almost 15 points a game last season conect from downtown there heres Burton with a left side jumper too strong Campbell in transition down low spins tough shot tip try no good as that was Cornelius Williams following up he checked in just a moment ago Roper open for three he drills it thats the one that Michael Shrewsberry is looking for good team defense they push in transition and he takes an open three Im confident with that take by roer all night Irish made just three threes against niagar theyve already connected four tries or on four of 12 tries from downtown here on this Saturday afternoon wbri spinning too strong off the Glass Logan Imes a four assist performance in the opener Monday Booth will pull up from three again doesnt get the roll Irish not hesitating though to pull the trigger from downtown and theyve gotten some better looks from Beyond The Arc in the last few minutes off ball screen tries to free up Jones get some space on the scen from Williams takes advantage Nails the jumper from just beyond the pain great use of the ball screen right into the pullup jump shot thats what theyre going to continue to do if the post stay off game high eight points so far for Russell Jones Jr he put up that many and the Catamount sees an opening Victory Marcus Burton offensive foul as Jones getting it done on offense he draws a whistle on the defensive end as well well step aside with West car Ina still up seven season for Coach Justin Gray leading the Western Carolina catamounts and told us before the game the main thing he focuses on is making sure he and his players have fun so far so good through about 9 minutes or so in this one yeah you you love a coach that can relate to the players in terms of his career uh it helps so much he understands hes able to coach them better and thats exactly what he was telling us today he just wants them to have fun when theyre playing and not about anything else and obviously that plays a big role it allows for a more relaxed environment and you could tell with the these seniors on the court right now thats exactly what theyre doing tonight like Russell Jones Jr again off the pullup in the ball screen getting to that sweet spot early well he had a great onew tandem with Chris Paul in his playing days at Wake Forest and perhaps unsurprising then that got a trio of guards leading the way Meanwhile backto Back possessions anding in offensive fouls for the Music Irish thats the second on tay Davis overall today that might lead to matchup problems Logan IMS coming in to check in Im curious to see who Michael shy will now put on vonius wbite Jones trying to get some space inside Campbell with the kick out quick three left well short think Tre Jackson might to rush that one just a little bit nerd a takes over again great team defense they worked on that in practice all week bodying up when Western Carolina gets into the paint it didnt allow them to get into their sweet spot led to a contested three and now they got an offensive opportunity Irish at just 31 from the field so far theyve actually shot better from three then overall drewberry cant find Space on Granger has some here makes a nice move and left that three short Zona tries to save it but got caught in between good use of the pump a thats also something they worked on in practice they know Western Carolina wants to run them off the threepoint line so I like that shot from shrewbury Im confident hell hell hit the next few yeah threepoint shooting for both these teams very important both in terms of what they do offensively but also defending in Western Carolina as you said d one of the top three three point defending teams in the country what an effort by grer there to collect the rebound but bught cant finish on the second effort rer swings it Zona takes it too strong looking for his second three of the afternoon wbite with a double team Granger with the hook shot gets the roll thats Wrights bread and butter backing him down getting two feet in or close to the paint and dishing led to the easy layup Notre Dames got to tighten up in terms of bodying early when wght wants to get himself into the paint already three assists for wbite Burton to Zona has space puts it up puts it in and will go to the line two man games working to Perfection on both sides of the Music Court good use of the ballen Marcus Burton gets in there makes the easy dish to Matt Zona and freshman point guard not playing like a freshman Zona to strong Roper hauls it in and the purcel crowd I rate no whistle there I think I could agree with the crowd on that one I think Zona took a hit or two Granger given space hell try it from three Zona daring him to shoot the BET pays off Burton and Shrewsberry go to work those two were no names minutes leaners in that opener against Niagara Burton inside muscles it up and in look at that body control by The Freshman Notre name on a run impressive stuff M Shrewsberry said hes seen Burton make shots like that and produce at a high level since his AA days what they need he originally committed to play play for Shrewsberry at Penn State followed his coach to Notre name and he off to a stellar starting his collegiate career and a turnover here as Campbells foot was on the line Michael Shrewsbury told them this week in practice if we keep them out of the paint and we live in the paint well win the basketball game so you see down there on that end they get into the paint they get a bucket and then they force a travel down here on the defensive end running them off the threepoint line and her name historically jump shooting and threepoint team but in that game against Niagara they outscored them in the paint 4828 its not often that the Irish have one games with their play inside but that was the case on offense in their opener and Burton gets inside again and all of a sudden Marcus Burton starting to heat up once again for this notame team I think were having some flashbacks from the other night against Niagara I mean hes just so exciting to watch six points for Burton today six straight for Notre Dame Wright looks to end the streak and does just that just one for six from the field before that shot but wbde even when hes in a bit of a rut you always know the next hot streak is right around the corner as Burton made a nice move but couldnt connect transition three Jackson Off the Mark hustle for for the rebound Robertson in tight quarters and its off kesn still up for grabs up a wild scramble so far in this game and once again the catamounts Come Away with it and we might have a shot clock issue here understandably after such a wild scramble I think we can say the speed of the game has definitely increased over the past two minutes Andrew we step aside still a sevenpoint lead for the catamounts Jones junor in double figures in points hes already got 10 in just 13 minutes so far in this one four of five from the field and two for two from Beyond The Arc right Jones Jr stands at 58 and is hitting tough contested shots against Notre Dame you see this right here carrying his team early hes the reason for this momentum and this 25 Point downam outs are led by their big three guard for of Jones jior wbri and Jackson but its largely been Jones so far hes four for five from the field wbri and Jackson combined two for 11 on any given night the the their big three between wbite Jones Jr and Jackson you kind of have to pick your poison any of them could get hot and weve seen early tonight that it happened to be Russell Jones Jr as wbr on the M this makes them such a dangerous team finished fourth in the Southern Conference standings a year ago Burton looks to get inside risky pass somehow de or rer or Booth excuse me came away with it for a moment and now we get whistles another name Will repat possession here on the jump ball call Shrewsberry wanted a timeout he did not get it but the possession arrow favors the Irish some chaotic sequences already in this game both teams really fighting for every inch out there Shrewsberry from the Baseline Booth from the wogo bank shot Falls and the foul great attack by the Freshman like I said before Western Carolinas at a western Carolinas at a matchup disadvantage with Boo as you see here creates the contct stays with it and gets the am one one shot here for thats the sixth foul on the Catamount so Irish will go to one in ones after Booth Off the Mark Roper goes down hard Cs coming with the basketball 514 opportunity and wbre can take advantage smothered at The Rim by Booth Jackson regains Control and the Catamount slow it down look at the effort by Imes down low on wbri pushing him out of the paint thats exactly what they need Jackson feeling for space tough shot no good he is again with a rebound Lan Imes not much of a score in N Dames first game but showed up in other areas four assists three rebounds the zville Indiana native and hes going to get two points here a gold against the catamounts and Logan Imes making a difference on Off the Bench hes got new a within three Western Carolina does not have a history of switching on the perimeter Logan Imes great read with the back cut they worked on that in practice this week rewarded not with what he wanted but still got something there deamar Robertson down low for wbri the Albany n it puts it up and in and one big answer for vonius walbri to snap a twominute scoring trout for the Catamount as you watch here hes persistent and hes dangerous when he gets two feet in the paint as we see there hell have a chance for one free throw rer just with the late touch on the hand and you know Wrights going to capitalize on that cant capitalize on the free throw two teams combined in this game are just three for seven from the line Irish just one of four Burton got caught from behind has his pocket picked good effort from Jones getting the steal wght tries to back down IMS pass goes to Pell but hes out of bounds were in for a treat all night with this match up between Jones and Burton as you see Jones stands at 58 and he just finds a way to get underneath everyones skin hes what they say a pest on defense stayed with Burton right there even after he thought he turned the quarter Im had some space at the top of the key he defers to Booth screen frees up rer goes downhill no in the first try second ones up and in and another and one opportunity this time its Cor Booth Music converting you see roer gets downhill almost booth there to clean it up another and one for the Freshman this is a Western Carolina team that will sell out for blocks it can result in missed rebounds at times it can result in fouls at others both there to put booth on the charity straight you can hear the fans encouraging Booth to hit this free throw off his second am one he didnt hit the last one in his first am one but well see what he does here nothing Manet there we go so a twopoint game this is the closest its been since the opening moments of this contest rer giving some room out high wght and IMS the two number two is going at it nice spin move by WB and he puts it up and in and yet another and one opportunity thats been the theme of this opening quarter especially as of late a beautiful spin move inside for WB to put him in double figures I mean Im like a broken record at this point he gets two feet in the paint hes a matchup problem for almost anybody against Notre Dame and right now scoring is whats leading them we talked before Justin Gray telling us hes confident hes going to do what he needs to do for this Western Carolina team dounts averaged almost 74 points a game last year that ranked fifth in the Southern Conference primarily used their threepoint shooting ability to put up points last year a theme again for them this season truberry from Beyond The Arc leaves that one well short so a lot of Threes early in this game both teams have kind of gone away from that over the last few minutes or so orbite inside again couldnt find any room Jones looks to gets downhill kick out into the corner three is good splash down from the corner as BN or Bernard Pell drills that one hes two for two from the field and from three in this one hes a great spark Off the Bench for them thats exactly what they needed whistle here brings the stop to play with 349 to go in the opening half a 60 run has Western Carolina back up by a comfortable margin vus wght got off to a bit of a slow start in this one made just one of his first six shots from the field but since then hes made three of his last five and as half of the points on a 60 run right now for the Western Carolina catamounts who leaded it by eight late in the first half he started off slow now hes up to 11 points and Andrew hes just showing us why he was Southern Conference preseason player of the year he keeps getting in the paint he keeps executing hes showing that senior leadership we keep talking about and hes had two of their last three baskets in this six and0 run this last 52 seconds transfer from Lawson State Community College and made second Team all Southern Conference a year ago Logan IM is at the line for Notre Dame Irish have struggled from the three throw line all day and it continues here just two of six after Im put too much on that one Western Carolina leads it by eight its the largest lead of this contest there have clawed back a few times in this half and hasnt been able to close the gap uh completely yet and it gets wider as wbri drills one from downtown about the only thing he hadnt done in this game so far was make a three but he connects someone right there thats Sona looking for some space he shot the ball from that spot twice in this one made it once defers to Imes here kesn inside looks for space double team comes Zona from three just off the mark Western Carolina making them work all the way down to the last second of the shot clock pushing in transition no surprise space opens up for Campbell at the top of the key hes short on the three another rebound scramble that ones last Touch by Jones and so this time bounce favors Notre Dame Notre Dame needs to settle in and take advantage of getting downhill like I said before Western Carolina does not want to switch theyre running a ton of scre I dont think theyre getting exactly what they want but I think they can do a better job at getting downhill off of their pin Downs Bren Shrewsberry to inbound been a tough first half for him no points on three unsuccessful shots so far and miscommunication there between kesn and Booth Irish turned the ball over Campbell looks to keep the hot streak going for the catamounts he gets in side all the way in lays it up and in and Western Carolina has found their crew of 11 unanswered points to create some separation foul here is on Jones and one inone opportunity coming up for B Western Carolina has so many offensive threats you see now here DJ Campbell getting in on the fun persistent in his ball handling finds a way for the easy to thats big for them we talk about their big three but they still have so many other scoring options yeah Campbell last year averaged Five Points a game and had 18 in their season opener was in double figures on six occasions as four already today as Burton drills the first free throw 16 minutes for the Freshman he led the Irish in playing time in their opener biger part was second behind Bron Shrewsberry Notre Dame hasnt gotten the offensive looks that they would love but keep in mind Western Carolina was 257th in free throws allowed last season so that says something about their fouling rate and if Notre Dame can keep getting to the free throw line drawing fouls up top I think itll do them good down to the final two minutes in the first half of this one Andrew begin us alongside Dara ma second game of the year for both Western Carolina and Notre Dame theres another shot that falls for Trey Jackson who gets off the schne was 0 for five before that jumper Trey Jackson is my exf factor for this game the film in their past seasons has shown when he plays well they play well as a team Burton gets downhill and a nice finish inside Marcus Burton with a bit of a burst here late in the half and providing the spark an AME needs now down 11 theres what I hit on before execution of getting downhill Campbell defended by Roper screen set by Granger three taken it rims off Burt leans the Irish the other way like to see Notre Dame get a good shot this possession Shrewsberry rushed at three I think he thought he was going to have more space off the booth screen almost like a quarterback sometimes when you plan what pass youre going to make before seeing the defense Shrewsberry unable to connect from downtown there Im not sure his dad is happiest with him right now with that one they got a minute left probably wanted a good shot hold it for a couple of possessions hopefully theyll regroup here yeah shwb was over for or is 0 for four from the field in this one he also got off to a slow start against Niagara picked up a bit as the game progress we said lead Notre Dame with 36 minutes played finished with seven points on three of seven shooting and that shows the trust hes hes a coachs kid he has a high IQ he might not have the shooting percentage that he wants right now but Michael shrewbury is going to continue to leave him out there because he knows the game well he trusts in his playmaking ability even if its not this shot selection right now and also it could be freshman Jitters its a big stage maybe has adjustments to make but 36 minutes is quite impressive for having that shooting percentage 55 seconds to go here see how Western Carolina plays it they going to design this so they can get a two for one opportunity Campbell to Jackson off the screen 43 no good followup also Off the Mark a third try that one is home Western Carolina has the edge on the glass as we expected coming in this one and they take advantage of it there with a third chance basket from Bernard p and Shrewsberry uses his use it or lose it timeout with 27 seconds left make rber in that game against so he was really happy with how nerds defense play down the stretch and how didnt let things get away from them but Western Carolina threatened at times in this game to pull away 13point halftime deficit certainly not unmanageable and obviously time for nerame to shrink it but CS have had control of this game it feels like not unmanageable at all and curious to see if they can capitalize off this possession Micah Shrewsberry has a history of very good playmaking calls out of a timeout so Im curious to see what he does here for an easier attempt with 27 and 25 on the shot clock rbur as we mentioned incredible success was a short time with Penn State as the 10 seed in the conference R last year they got him all the way to the finals where they lost by just two points to Purdue or he used to be an assistant left the boiler makers to spend some time on Brad Stevens coaching staff with the Boston Celtics some deep playoff runs there and got his chance at Penn State now returns to his home state where his coaching career began at I USB Burton to the basket blocked rebound is still available Burton goes hard in the corner Irish run out of time shot was off from kesn it would not have counted Ricard lless inbound and get the second half underway DJ Campbell leading the catamounts back on the attack starting five is back in for Western Carolina Michael shrewbury going with four guards here Tay Davis will come off the bench along with Matt Zona thats a different matchup and a whistle here and wbite starts off this second half with a traveling violation go some turnovers early from Western Carolina they were able to nip that issue in the butt as the first half progressed seven overall for them or four excuse me on this game so far getting a little chippy here to start the half could be interesting both teams obviously competing at a high level yeah if you didnt see the opening 20 minutes we had a couple of crazy sequences rebounds were available bodies hit the deck that type of stuff can build tension even though this is the first ever meeting between these two schools Shrewsberry held off the score sheet in that opening half gets it pulls up from long distance and left it just a little bit short Carrie Booths numbers were very visible on that possession I thought that was good time for a post feed instead of settling for The Three Irish three of 14 from Beyond The Arc in this game meanwhile getting back inside is Jones Jr doing what the catamounts have done all game which is just attack the basket then use that to create some space from three when its been available its been a very successful formula thus far more high ball screen action provided by Lampton nice pump fake worked inside by Campbell banks in the righty floater nice recognition off the shot fake Notre Dame wants to run them into the threepoint line good use of the second option by Campbell Eastern Carolina went a big scoring run right at the end of the first half they picked where theyve left off nice fake taken inside and unable to finish or contact is Booth no foul but its last Touch by Western Carolina get another look I like the aggression by Booth here but you just cant teach size Charles Lampton standing at 611 thats a tough match up for booth although he has the foot Advantage whos driving into some big traffic there and from the tallest member of either team threepoint attempt Burton put a little bit too much on it transfer from the College of Charles did not play a very big role there but a solid debut earlier this week out of eight points and six rebounds rer swings booth for three their name just a little bit off coming out of the halftime break still looking for their first basket good job by wbr there almost lost control but is able to maintain possession Jones will slow things down because of the quick shots Western Carolina has had too many chances to set into the shot clock and run whatever they want Notre Dames making it too easy for them by taking questionable shots on offense Wright gets inside ball up for grabs again great effort by roer rer who got his hands on it initially hauls in the rebound on that second effort Im trying to work a Twan game there with Booth instead is forced back out rer to the attack defended by wbre puts it up and in over Lampton under gets off the schneide courtesy of the junior Julian roer great Patience by Notre Dame offense Michael shry was coaching them hard that possession he wanted them to be patient they stayed with it roer for an easy layup over wbite waited for an option to develop nice hands there and an attempt to save it just unsuccessful but a good effort there from Julian rooper on the defensive end for Notre Dame roer coming alive on both ends using some of that experience he had at Northwestern carrying this young team hes leading by example as we would say right now theres a highly talented recruit coming out of high school was the fourth best Prospect in the entire state of Michigan I do think he could have saved that one though instead of diving on the floor yeah maybe he thought he needed to but I thought he had enough time to go save it there wasnt a lot of pressure over there in the corner but good reach there and another one showing off those quick hands as right at the end of the shot clock wbri forced to put it up that ones no good looks like theyre going back into the same action here its a guard to guard high ball screen Campbell fought around the screen Shrewsberry creates space tough shot left it short zonah halls in the rebound space outside its Burton for three another manette you have to credit Matt Zona there for making that play Marcus Burton got that shot because of him Notre Dame clearly has some momentum here and we just cant stop talking about Julian rer he came out here this half fired up hes leading his team and look what look what its doing look at the effect its having Z making an instant impact coming off the bench after getting the start in this one oght trying to work the pick and roll here oght inside tough shot while falling to the ground he cant get it to go numbers the other way for Notre Dame to the corner for Burton fakes takes just cant connect Zona another great effort to pull it back down rer wisely in no rush takes it out screen set by Shrewsberry rer giving a lot of room takes advantage couple big threes for another name to force a timeout and bring this deficit back to single digits energy back at purel Pell and the Irish within couple of big offensive rebounds for Matt zon in the last few minutes to set up a couple of big threes forre Dame Julian roer the second hitting the second one give her aame a little bit of Life all of a sudden an 80 Irish run has this back to a single digit point game Julian roer off the three here Michael Shrewsberry didnt like the one he shot in the first half given the circumstances of the game but he knocks it down he came out hot this half he is leading this team and its good to see a different spark like I said Marcus buron needs help and Julian roer has clearly taken on that role to start this second half a nice screen there from Jaden or from Braden Shrewsberry as well IR trying to keep this momentum surge going cam Ms trying to find the offensive stroke that they had late in the first half long range three is good and Russell Jones Jr stems the bleeding in emphatic fashion I was confident that he was going to drive it given the foot speed he has over Matt Zona but I mean again hitting contest William Roper Campbell turns the corner and scores I think Burton thought he had some help there down low but just too much space and cam outs take advant Campbell has just seemed to get a bucket every time Western Carolina has needed to stop the bleeding hes stepped up really big in this game tonight Andrew eight points and five rebounds already for the sophomore tough turnaround shot there is off the back of the rim I think they might have missed a little pushing and shoving down there on the block with Matt Zona and Lampton F have lot let a lot of that go so far inside Lampton they cant let that one go easy foul call there as rer did what he had to to prevent an easy two well said I would agree that was a good foul call on roer as they lead into another timeout thir Carolina with a couple big baskets to stretch their lean back out well step aside with the catamounts up by Music 12 1322 to go here in the second half Russell Jones Jr the hot hand all of a sudden for Western Carolina strong first half and hes picked up right where he left off here after Western Carolina got a bit of a slum for a few moments Justin Gray doing a great job of putting him in mismatches on the offensive end as Lampton here is going to take two free throws but again carrying carrying what he did in the first half into the second half hes hit multiple contested threes six for seven field goals I could imagine theyre going to continue to give him the ball but once again one of those out of the threeheaded monster coming alive for Western Carolina and Jones Jr as lampon pits the first one lampon as youd expect for a big man was not a very strong free throw shooter last year but pure on both attempts there so its back to a 14point lead after the Irish briefly cut it down to single digits on a brief 80 burst just have not gotten the consistent secondary scoring that weve seen from Western Carolina thats been the difference so far Burton throws it up oh and a missed opportunity there for booth as he couldnt convert the alleyoop Jackson the other end draws a foul I agree with the foul on Burton that probably would have led to another transition bucket off of the Miss so once again Burton doesnt play like a freshman on the offensive end and then on the defensive end I would be confident in saying that that was a veteran move give up aoul stop the bleeding as they increased the lead again already by these last two free throws and Im sure Booth is itching wishing he would have converted that one as Notre Dame needed that easy layup yeah baskets have been hard to come by for the Irish shooting just 35 Ranger with two guys on him cannot convert as Booth got a hand on it as the reder junor tried to go up to the basket made up for it on the defensive end good defense by booth great hands there the steal from Jones takes it the other way and puts it up and in Russell Jones Jr doing it all on both ends and the lead for the cams crows talked about him on offense but look at this defense he has the hardest match up of the night and he gets a hard awkward Collision there and tempers briefly flared cooler heads prevailing as both both Burton and Jones went to the floor hard and still some Music discussion get a look at the foul thats a hard foul going up and I think Marcus Burtons frustration may have come from thinking it might have been a little bit more intentional uh a great match up you know theyre both around the same size Russell Jones Jr double technical call both on Jones Jr and Burton inial foul still stands Burton will go to the line as it is a shooting foul I think that was a hard intentional foul I understand the frustrations coming from Burton its good to see that it didnt escalate any further than what they got into as he makes this first free throw but I mean emotions are high theyre around the same size theyre similar players that theyre bound to get into it but its just good that it didnt escalate any further you think that should have been anything more or just a common foul they were rewarded to technicals I think uh which the refs made the right call uh but I dont I dont think he Burton was going to make that I think Jones actually fou him twice I think the second foul was a little unnecessary Albright in tight Corners tries to Pivot for space kick out nice move to spin away from the traffic there from Jackson he cant convert in the shot and its thrown backwards and thats going to be a backourt violation another chaotic sequence in this game which has had a lot of entertainment they not even counting just the scoring plays Western Carolina turns it over and well step aside 14point lead for the visitors here at purcel Pavilion Shrewsberry chatting with the officials about the hard foul and the double technicals that were called against Russell Jones Jr and Marcus Burton it was Jones with bit of an awkward Collision trying to prevent Burton from getting a free Lane to the basketball players went down hard got up heated thankfully nothing more happened than that other than the fouls assessed and two free throws for Burton on the shooting foul but certainly a tense moment and Burton with the basketball again a new defender on Burton last time it was Jones Jr another body thrown on him Davis through contact lost control was able to get a shot away P thought about the transition three nice move to step in by wbite open man on the left wing its Robertson unable to cash in from long range rebound finds it way into the hands of Logan Imes Shrewsberry around around the zone of screen and a travel is called before the shot which was rejected emphatically by lamp anyhow I think that was a difficult take by Shrewsberry micel Shrewsberry on the other end wanted the kick to the corner as you see is probably going to come out assistant coaching staff GNA have some conversations with him to make some adjustments but here we go Julian Roper back in the game Im sure Notre is going to gain some momentum from that he going to keep up what he started the second half with as Western Carolina resets again shot clock at 20 shry said hes had a lot of teaching moments with some of those younger players but he also wants to give them some freedom to make some mistakes a lot of teaching moments here in this Western Carolina game always a tough give and take because certainly Co never wants to lose a game or as any player of course but the Irish know that they are in a rebuild as a program obviously with almost a total roster overhaul and some of those shortterm mistakes will hopefully have longterm payoffs but doesnt mean there isnt frustration in the moment rer going oneonone with Robertson shifts his way inside and somehow gets it to go tough take by rer he didnt get the best screen at the top of the key but he made what he could out of it and that was a tough shot over lampon at 611 credit rer for that nice tear drop nothing but 12 points for rer in this one threepoint attempt from the right wing is no good from pel two Irish players Collide and that GRS a second life to Western Carolina W looks to take advantage and a blocking foul is called that upsets the home crowd I dont think I can agree with that one that is similar to the first call in the first half that that same official made I dont Ill have to his feet again but I think he had position another look at it here guess maybe the argument that Burton was leaning before the contact maybe he sold it a little too much and thats also a big size difference between wbr and Burton there just trying to see it from the officials point of view I know the Irish crowd wanted a different call much bigger Davis is on W right now forces him into tight quarters mght gets a screen from Lampton space to pull up from deep but its a little bit wide to the right and rooper able to grab in the rebound back to the same action high ball screen roer in Zona again rer put a bit of a Twist on it there with the spin move backs off from Lampton there knew a key would be trying to pull him out of the paint they got him on the outside now roer cant take advantage with a threepoint attempt with the rebound and hes fou trying to put it back up great effort by Davis rewarded with the foul call a chance for two buckets at the free throw line all started at lamon getting sucked out of the pain a little bit and that made grabbing that rebound much easier for Davis you see ball goes up here Tay Davis working really hard rewarded with the foul took a good hit five boards on Monday were tied for second on the Irish and he gets the bounce there good to see him coming alive in this second half alongside Burton and Roper the more for Notre Dame the better I would say Andrew been a quiet day for Davis so far just one rebound and one for two here pass the halfway marked in the second half or Western Carolina has led by double digits for most of this second half up by 11 right now trying to secure a two and0 start to this season Jackson works his way inside defended nicely by Zona wbri has to hurry two on the shot clock Wright to his right puts it up well short good defense there for Notre Dame I think Tate Daviss length bothered wbri on that possession takes in then turns back out screen from Zona IM to the corner space for Davis hell work in around lamp to the right hand unable to put it home I think Michael Shrewsberry wanted a foul call maybe on that one wght extends inside trying to push back Imes threepoint try no good scoring drought now for Western Carolina theyve gone over four minutes without a basket Irish look to take advantage as clock starts to get into the smaller numbers here credit Roper on the offensive end with Marcus Burton out hes had multiple opportunities tried to turn the corner there but is emphatically rejected by Charles Lampton not on that one I think I ate my words a little bit on that one as you can see the replay great block by Lampton again he cant teach size Julian rer going into 6 no doubt Charles lts coming over there hosting a block party in this second half a four block day for Lampton its as many blocks as every other player on both sides combined said hes the biggest guy on the court and hes played like it oh and a missed opportunity there for the Finish from Booth he does get fouled sometimes sometimes when you have Music yri Booth will go to the line when we come back at 11point lean for Western Carolina by 11 just under eight minutes to go here in the second half cam outs finished fourth in the conference last year 10 and8 record in conference play theyre projected to be third get a look at this standing Swit M Shrewsberry said that southern conference is one of the more underrated conferences in college basketball they pen state year played Ferman earlier in the year and they gave the NY Lions quite a handful and certainly the catamounts have been a challenging opponent for the Irish so far as they sit in the driver scene here great road test for the camat coming into Notre Dame pretty good crowd for this Irish team coming up against a power five team and their leading by now nine with 755 left into the second I know Justin Gray was excited about this match up uh coming back to the ACC as he played at week first yeah outstanding playing career there as we mentioned earlier start alongside Chris Paul then went on to have a very successful career over a decade playing in professional leagues across Europe trying to work inside is Jones He stumbles but keeps his dribble and then gets open from Beyond The Arc but misses wide to the right and Davis comes away with the rebound this is the smallest Western car lean has been all half there c a nine early on Catamount extended it t DAV is now taking on some of these point guard responsibilities as he goes on the attack against Lampton and finishes it they it look like a natural Davis SS inside its a sevenpoint game with seven minutes to go now the Irish crowd is on their Fe here inel Jones directing traffic Lon on high to set the screen and frees up WB for a kick back out leftwing side thats a foul on the floor and a necessary one for Imes to take as too aggressive on the close out Jones would have easily had him beat if not for the contact inbound in from just in front of the Western Carolina bench wbr working around the lampon screen I trying to effectively double him there with Lampton right next to him shot is short rebound is also off the rim somehow its pulled back by lampon three tries now looking for a fourth and now its up for grabs and I believe well get a jump ball here with the possession hour possession arrow favoring Notre Dame you can feel the intensity around the gym that these players are giving off everybody bodies everywhere six minutes left smallest lead of the night for Western Carolina you can really feel the intensity ramping up here as Notre Dame is going to come down for another offensive opportunity crowds on their feet good to see Notre Dame back in it Irish on a ner run they have not allowed any points in over six minutes their name beat niagar with their defense able to scratch back into this game with their defense the offense coming through to Cory boo with a triple and its a fourpoint game how about the dynamic of those two freshmen between Logan Imes and Carrie boo coming alive late thats exactly what michah Shrewsberry talked to us about these freshmen are hard workers and theyre proving it out here late in this second half stays for Jones pull up three the answer comes from Russell Jones Jr once again 20 points on the day no surprise there another three by Russell Jones Jr to stop the bleeding for Western Carolina same play Here We Go Again four for five from beond the AR for and Cory boo is on as well three for six from three and its back to a fourpoint Lead You Could See m bar in the left side of that screen hyping up the crowd you have to credit these two freshman late in the game once again Jones defended by IES looks to get it inside wbri draws the foul on Davis skilled move there from the Albany native Albany Georgia native vonius Woolbright good awareness by Woolbright he probably felt two hands on his back one came intertwined with his uh right arm AR as he was able to draw draw that foul maybe release some pressure Notre Dame building momentum and stepping it up on defense another way to kill some of that momentum once again veteran move good awareness by wbr as he is attempt for two free throws right here next Notre Dame foul will put Western Carolina in the bonus as wbri sinks his first Har have left five points on the line this game and currently a fivepoint deficit Michael shb has become best friends with the refs late in this second half as we see saw again wbr good on the second sixpoint lead yeah theyve had theyve had a couple of friendly chats Im sure key word friendly lines with some pressure in the front Court swings it ahead Davis to Booth can he do it again he does it again three threes in quick order from Cory booth and the Irish are within it Irish with a chance to Music tie Imes inside Davis has it poked away Jackson ahead beautiful skip pass and its finished off at the other end DJ Campbell running the floor great transition opportunity executed once again by two of the threeheaded monster in Jones Jr and Trey Jackson good to see Trey Jackson coming alive late Davis spins puts it up gets the go we talked about the effort needed outside of Marcus Burton and Andrew Look What the rest of this Notre Dame team came together and has done in this second half secondary scoring has come alive and Davis makes up for the turnover in the last position with a big basket right there oright goes right to left and a foul is called and that will put Western Carolina in the bonus so a one and one when we return with three21 to go of barn burner AT purcel Pavilion cam Mount lead West Carolina controlled most of this game but the Irish have gotten back into it and its been all largely thanks to the efforts of freshman forward Carrie Booth check out Carri Booth here one of his three threepointers made in about the last minute and 20 seconds hes a versatile freshman he showed us his inside game early on in the half and now look at him stepping out on the perimeter he has carried this Irish team put the team on his back late in this second half great to see Carrie Booth do that for this Irish Squad and a lot talking about the start to Marcus Burtons college career but how about Terry Booth he just missed a double double in the Niagara season opener 20 points so far in this one tied with Russell Jones Jr for the game high this is vonius wbri with a one in one trying to extend the visitors lead and he just gets the roll no surprise there Carrie Booth coming from a strong basketball background as his dad Calvin Booth is the GM for the recent champions in the Denver Nuggets probably picked up on some of those basketball abilities growing up as wbite makes the second certainly a good person to learn from Id say I would agree on that one Marcus spon back in back to a fivepoint game after he knocks down those two free throws Shrewsberry still held scoreless in this game trying to get the Irish back in it turns the corner kicks it over Burton for three and he left it too long Collision there as Davis and Lampton both go down no surprise there from Burton he might have been a little cold coming off the bench he sat the last few minutes Wright throws it up lampon catches it was able to get it up cleanly so he goes outside Campbell to the attack off balance gets it to go another big shot from DJ Campbell whos got 12 points in this one may not be part of that threeheaded monster but hes certainly made a difference in this game booth that one off the mark maybe a little bit cold coming out of the TV timeout and the cam outs in control up by seven with just over two minutes left big two minutes for Notre Dame coming up on the defensive end he they in the bonus wbite making his way couldnt get it hes not able to get that one to go think Shrewsberry credited the defense with that Victory against Sanger they came up big late in that contest need an offensive push here to avoid their first defeat of the season Shrewsberry calls timeout with 14 on the shot clock and 97 seconds remaining in regulation great timeout called by Michael shuberry he recognized that offensive possession was a little bit shaky werent getting the options that they wanted wanted to go into the ball screen good decision to call the timeout hell be able to draw something like I said he has a very strong history hes great in Xs and Os always has some tricks up his sleeve hes got 14 on the shot clock I could imagine they want to get something inside rather than settle for a threepoint shot as we saw the last possession from Burton didnt work out in their favor Irish after this will hit the road as they go up to Brooklyn for the Legends classic theyll take on Auburn five days from now and Oklahoma State and State b a venture after depending on how the tournament shakes out before they return home and then conference play begins December 2nd just a couple weeks away a tricky test against a very solid Miami team on the road great schedule for a new Notre Dame team three of their first 16 are true Road games as Burton couldnt get it that might be the last ditch attempt not desperately needed that layup from Burton to fall and the Irish just swarming Jackson and Justin Gray seeing that calls timeout Notre Dame now in a position where they have to foul put them on the free throw line but again late in this game they got a sevenpoint lead over Notre Dame its a new Squad freshman brand new coaching staff really really key teaching moments in the last two minutes of this game take the score completely out of the picture Michael shrewbury is going to coach until the very last second of every single game two close games to start this season and thats what Micah Shrewsberry wanted as you mention ER getting that ingame experience theres just no substitute for it the definely going to go through some Growing Pains they certainly have had some today but theyre hoping that those pains will lead to brighter days on the horizon and get n a program back to where it was in the mid 2010s where made three straight NCA tournaments including back toback Elite Music eights in Brown goes to wo in the back court and the Irish aggressively going after him Shrewsberry takes the foul so wbri who is seven for eight at the line himself he had over half of the free throw attempts for the catamounts well go up here for one and one Im sure this veteran team has been tested late in the past uh so great execution down the stretch by Western Carolina Notre Dame did back in it they had some good spurts of momentum but for the most part Western Carolina kept it together down the stretch as wbite again at the free throw line con you like the decision to foul there Dar or would you have played it straight up they have to foul now at this point yeah agreed on that one uh Bren shrewbury I think was the last one they they need as many offensive possessions as they can get at this point eightpoint game with 80 seconds left W trying to be the third player in this game and the second on the catamounts at 20 points and he does just that 19 in the season opener one better for the preseason Southern Conference Player of the Year living up to the billing in this one foul on the floor here as Burton tried to cut to the basket great pass by Booth you had to thread the need on that one but that was a great pass made by a post player thats just the fifth foul in Western Carolina so it will not be free throws yet for the Irish I think Burton might have thought that was the case moves into inbounded now got a dispute here with Coach gray one of the officials Mah Shrewsberry walking over as well theres that interaction between two great coaches with big resumés as Shrewsberry again takes from the corner and misses Notre Dame gonna have to foul again and they caught wbite here along that Baseline sideline excuse me just a desperation attempt there looked like from Shrewsberry knowing that n Des points certainly a tough day for Ms son 0 for7 from the field in this one but obviously very talented Music player definitely probably still trying to find his gr on a new team everybody else to you cant let his shooting percentages the past two nights you know label him because hes a great player high IQ fathers confident that hes going to do the right thing and I mean thats just part of its early on in the year you know a lot of teams have picked up new pieces from the transfer portal and I think probably everybody else outside of Bren shury is also trying to find their way 32nd ranked shooting guard in the class of 2023 certainly not lacking for talent wbrt impressive tonight from the three throw line absolutely yeah impressed but not surprised 11 for 12 for him as Burton gets a quick two you can see Michael shrewbury still again coaching to the last seconding that not given in here trying to press here good move by Jones to get over midcourt and there comes the Music foul IES will send Trey Jackson to the Music line Music little bit short on the first one Jackson last year 88 from the free throw line which was the best figure on Western Carolinas roster not the best night for Trey Jackson one for 11 in field goals but I mean that speaks on the rest of Western Carolinas veteran team hes part of that threeheaded monster as Campbell gets the late strip good hustle there was somehow able to maintain control of the basketball while losing his footing and save it to a teammate but for sure that was going to go out of bounds once he stumbled impressive body control there theyre having a good laugh about it on the sideline Russell Jones Jrs pumped up the end of this one credits to him inbound goes to poot hes immediately Music found Western Carolina after this contest stays on the road they have a quick turnaround theyll play Middle Tennessee State on Monday another great road test against a good middle tenness team that should be a good one Bernard P misses the first and they back home for a couple games they have almost a week off after that game of kny state next Saturday and then a full week off before they play Northern Alabama on the 26th oh for two there IRS with an Aaron pass and that should seal it there is a difference between the game and the shot clock here but Mah Shrewsberry telling his players to back off Western Carolina for just the fourth time in 55 games against the ACC will emerge Victorious thanks to 20 plus Point efforts from Russell Jones Jor and vonius WB good effort tonight by both teams a lot of teaching points a lot of things to learn for the veterans and the Freshman as a shot clock violation occurs for the catamounts Notre Dame will have the last possession before they close it off was all academic though Western Carolina had their lead threatened seriously late in the second half ndame closed it to as small as a threepoint Gap but the veteran catamounts using that big game experience to hold on as they improved to 2 and0 on the year with a 10point win
