West Thank you very much gentlemen And welcome to Louisville for the back half of our mens basketball double header Havent missed much A minute in a possession on each side And its Florida State and Louisville Florida State Theyve done the hard part this year Theyve salvaged their season Theyve won eight of their last 11 Theyre fourth in the ACC at six and three And you check out the first five for Leonard Hamilton who now faces a question with his team of all right can they get to the NCAA tournament because right now Joe Lonards got them considered but not in And against Louisville at the bottom of the ACC Randolph Childris this a mustwin game It is And they have to come out here tonight and take care of business You duck yourself out of the hole You brought yourself in contention here as you see the Louisville starters They have to come out today This is a must win game for these guys if they want to continue playing in March traveling on Trey White for Louisville All right so this is what were talking about with Leonard Hamiltons team The net in the high 80s Couple of quad one wins this year Today a quad three game You cannot lose this one Youre not Again we talked about it earlier When you dug yourself in that hole that way they coming out now Theyre playing well enough You got to be confident But hey lets give credit to this Louisville team Theyre continuing to compete compete on the defensive end of the floor and trying to find ways to score enough to stay in games and lets see if they can put 40 minutes together today Baba Miller starts the scoring in the first couple of minutes Hes Randolph Childers Im Mike Monaco Glad to have you with us after Pit took down Notre Dame You saw the starting lineup for the Cards without a point guard because theres no Sky Clark Tyler Johnson is back and available after missing Tuesdays game with a sprained ankle but hes going to come off the bench And Curtis Williams misses from long range And now its a carry on Jaylen Wley So Sky Clark suffered a hit pointer on Tuesday against Clemson didnt return to that game Hes a nogo tonight Third leading scorer and starting point guard Louisville you misses him dearly And you can see in that first possession there no one can break the defense down And you see right away first chance coach Kenny Payne gets he brings Ty Lord Johnson in They dont have a guy that can create and break you down They settle for a jump shot in that open possession because Florida States defense theyre not going to let you reverse the basketball So someone has to put their head down get in the paint force rotation And you can see Johnson trying to do that here underneath and nearly a block at the rim but Caleb Glenn followed with Johnson coming in just over two minutes in after they started without a point guard and a different starting lineup for the Cards And now Baba Miller with the turnover Just a start you want to see Great job by Kenny Payne going right to Johnson early identifying offensively the ball wasnt moving against Florida States pressure Johnson comes in first possession gets in the lane creates a basket for his teammates We asked Kenny Payne this afternoon if you can think about starting Tyler Johnson He said Yeah of course But he thought they played really well without him in the second half trying to come back from down 24 against Clemson that he wanted to give that group a chance And in particular Mike James and Trey White without a starting point guard had a lot on their plate And of course Trey White was excellent Tuesday The difference is its hard to simulate Florida States pressure because you cant you cant emulate their size So when you get your scout team you dont have a 6 seven point guard on your scout team So things look totally different He gets out here and you can see the adjustment right now with Johnson Lets see if he can sustain this energy for 40 minutes because hes a blur He has extra gear in his speed and hes the one guy that can continuously break this defense down off the bounce Speedy freshman point guard from Brooklyn with an assist and a bucket of his own Only two points in three plus minutes for the NLES Jir Watkins got met at the rim but Jaylen Worley follows for Florida State Borley not known for ability to make jump shots but he attacked the glass Glenn had it rolled off Applause a 67 point guard in Jaylen Worley Longest tenure null for Leonard Hamilton and his third year from the Philly area Here he is directing traffic with the starting group for Florida State among the 10 to 12 bodies Well see Glenn fouls Watkins and theyre both slow to get up Looks like both guys are okay Difficult when you get that high in that contact Walks got the worst of it Just a great drive there I thought it was a clean block initially Just a lot of contact after the block Great job back Glenn just sliding over Just a little late but when you got that kind of bounce you can challenge it at the rim Freshman who was number 66 in our ESPN 100 He fouled Watkins The red shirt junior BCU transfer is the leading scorer rebounder assist man steel man for Florida State The only guy who can say that in the ACC Its not many that can say that in the country at this level to be doing what hes doing for this team and just a matchup nightmare 67 wing uses his size and overpowers smaller guards and just drives bigger bodies when you try to put a bigger guy on him Well he knocks down both and its Florida State by two and they extend this trademark pressure Nolles press the fifth most of any team in the country and they force you into turnovers at one of the highest clips in the league Johnson got fouled and got it to go And talk about an instant impact from Tyler Johnson off the bench Great job Hes just showing you he cant come if they cant stay in front of him and he has an extra gear to him A lot of quickness there Uses his show to create space on a bigger Warley Knocks down a 15footer and one We havent really seen a lot of Johnson over the last two games Of course like you said he was out Tuesday with the sprained ankle against Clemson Suffered that in shootound before the game but you go back to Saturday against Virginia and he fouled out in 14 minutes So if they could get a lot of him and you said sustaining it thats going to be key against the Mills defense Well the critical part for Johnson is Kenny like you said sustain it for 40 minutes You tend to wear down because when things break down you can see Louisville is going to give him the ball and say Go make a play Primo Spears has checked into the game for Florida State 23 in the white One of their top scorers at a dozen a game coming off 15 against Carolina Heres Darren Green 349 career threes in his career Miller Ho out of the corner short and couple of cards went up for it and couldnt corral the rebound So it belongs to Florida State when we come back Welcome to the game Tyler Johnson Its been a Tyler Johnson show here early Music the interaction with everybody here the service advisors your sales associate when I walk in theyre always glad to see me Everyone that touches that vehicle they take pride in being

Introducing the incredible new foot long sidekicks Get one at Subway today At Morgan Stanley Old school hard work meets bold new thinking to help you see untapped possibilities and relentlessly work with you to make them real Music Music Music Music Big day in the ACC in the top of the conference looks like this Uh you might have heard Carolina and Duke are playing a game right now in Chapel Hill Meanwhile Virginias hot They went to Clemson and one today and now its six in a row for Tony Bennetts team Then theres Florida State at six and three And boy Randolph it looks a lot different than it did a little over a month ago It has Theyve gotten healthy Primo Spears just has joined this team You see him coming out of out of the huddle there And theyve turned things around I mean and this team started out six and six struggling They got bodies They got healthy Theyve gone six and two since then in the ACC play winning three road games and theyre going to need to continue that strong play to get their fourth consecutive road game And thats difficult to do Theyve won eight of 11 overall but have dropped two of the last three against Clemson and against Carolina Some chances against some of the heavyweights at the top Primo Spears hiding behind the screen too strong And then a foul on the rebounding action Great job there You got to put a body on the Seminals front line Those guys are going to come in there flying in trying to get offensive rebounds and great job putting your body in front of people so you forcing an offensive foul there Applause Tyler Johnson uses that speed to break the pressure Skipped it to Trey White coming off a careerhigh 29 as well as 14 rebounds also a careerhigh in that loss against Clemson at Little John on Tuesday Hed like to have that back Its a really good look there Horn gets fouled by Caleb Glenn and thats two on the freshman from Louisville Applause If you havent watched Florida State play you can expect its going to be a lot of fouls They attack the paint so much drawing fouls and actually committing quite a few themselves that tends to favor them because of the rotation the amount of bodies that they play They play a 12man rotation Hey Wednesday night right here on ACC Network a mens basketball double header Starts at 7 Eastern with Louisville against Syracuse And then to Cameron Kyle Filipowski and number seven Duke play host to Notre Dame Duke at last look was trailing at the Smith Center Getting a very good Armando Bon tonight for Carolina Lane violation here goes against Florida State before the second free throw from Cam Corin Siminals struggling from the line on the year and midway through the season they seemed like they had figured it out But so far tonight theyve struggled from behind the line missing their first three uh free throws Brandon Humpley Hatfield with just his 10th career three in three seasons Darren Green gets to his spot Of course they came transition offense so fast there I dont think Louisville offensively wasnt prepared for Hley to hit that three Watkins picked it from Johnson Watkins Oh man Nearly ripped down the rim and sent us leaning back in our seats Whoa Great Louisville Louisville doesnt usually shoot the three well Hatfield can definitely turn and face You want to get the spacing from your bigs if you can But my goodness here after the turnover Ty Lord Johnson Fortunate you might say Oh yeah I think hes Jir Watkins has already had a poster this year He had the massive dunk on Miamis Nor Chad Omir And Watkins told us afterward I guess the very best dunk of his life Yeah Tylo Johnson there is like wow I know he could jump I wasnt expecting that one Watkins been doing that to a lot of people in the ACC surprising them with his allaround game Got to watch the turnover I think again its hard to simulate the length and something to monitor here with Johnson Hes hes going to have to singlehandedly handle the pressure Hes created literally all of their offense either scoring or assisting on it And someones going to have to step up and provide some help with him Even press breaking and in the half court set Watkins to the bench for Leonard Hamilton And Johnson brings it over to the timeline matched up with Josh Nickelberry against this Florida State defense top 40 in the country Brandon Huntley Hatfield on the drive And then Cam Corin slow to get up I think thats the best thing Hutley Hatfield does I think catching it on the move hes so difficult to defend So if hes knocking down threes but this is what I think hes really exceptional just driving you as a big Applause Black Sea Everyones okay there Brandon Huntley Hatfield in his second season of course at Louisville after starting his career at Tennessee and its a Florida State turnover and Josh Nickelberry and Taylor Bowen exchanging words Thats five turnovers for Florida State Applause Johnson off the bounce against 610 Bull Bowen who secures the rebound Johnson picks him lost the shoe Couldnt finish Hley Hatfield the offensive rebound and put back How about this start for Louisville This is the way they need to play Jump the game up You know you just got to play when youve had the type of season that theyve had thus far You got the home crowd cheering for you just laid it on the line Green rises cant silence the crowd but an offensive rebound And then Nickelberry hits a tough follow Mike James had it in his grasp And Tyler Johnson needs to go get that shoe Hes been without for like a minute now Who throws a shoe after the steal there just keeps playing Hes had himself a heck of a start here tonight Five points off the bench Again if youre just joining us maybe youve been flipping around this awesome day of college basketball No Sky Clark the starting point guard for Louisville Heres Mike James coming off a couple of quiet games and a nice spin Mike James been struggling Hes two of 20 his last two games And when youre struggling to find your shot you want to get to the free throw line or the rim And he does a great job there Cam Corin finishes over the top of Emanuel Okoraphor What youre seeing now is just what why Louisville has struggled so much is that you do a great job Youre scoring youre putting pressure on the FSU defense and then you youre giving up just quick easy baskets in transition So Corore has got a chance at three Johnson again just getting in the paint finding teammates there Just Johnsons just controlling the tempo and the pace of this game with his penetration Applause Easy find there Great strong finish and just flexing on him letting them know What Steve Smith say to the Florida State team at shoot around this morning He yelled at them Guys when weve had a week off before we dont play well He He didnt like something about the energy at that point during shootout and its carried over a bit Louisville by six Well Johnsons a big part of that The first possession couple possessions of the game they did a really good job defending and its hard to match up with his speed Hes controlling this game singlehandedly Nickelberry listen to this place Louisville hasnt led a lot this year And Spears off the bounce off the takeaway gets the roll And Primo Spears with his first points tonight Speaking of impact in the team Primo Spears has added a dimension to this team Hes come in and been a deacto closer for this group and almost instant offense coming off the bench Bouncy guard playing at his third school Went over a thousand career points earlier this season Huntley Hatfields had it roll off and secured by Jaylen Worley with the NL down by four in the first nine minutes Applause Heres Spirits from Dukane to Georgetown to Florida State Orleys reverse is good Theres got to be more resistance on the defensive end from Louisville Its just too easy for Florida State to get to the paint get to the rim Its been something thats been a challenge all year long Louisville moves it James steps into one Rebound Nickelback Nulls play at the fastest tempo in the ACC and theyre out and running to tie it at 20 with Jaylen Worley Another point blank layup and we talked about you and I talked about this a shoot around thats in the Achilles heel for Louisville on the defensive end of the floor They just theres not much rim protection but theyre just getting dribble penetration just gets to the rim and when that happens you just get any shot and every shot you want Worst defense in the ACC according to Kenpaw Midway through the first half Jackson wrapped one around for Okoraphor who had it swatted by Jaylen Gany in among a trio of NLES Spears has a mismatch Moves it for Nickelberg Spears pulls up banks it in Loves that spot and he puts Florida State in front And Kenny takes a timeout 80 run capped by Primo Spears I dont know if Primo Spears called Bank but I think hell take it last week Music Its bow time Hey sweetie Hey Mom Ill land at 3 Any ideas for your first meal home

on an 80 run Yeah theyre just gotten out Theyre starting to attack the rim again and get to the paint And its been an Achilles Hill all season long for the the Cardinals And you see here just point blank range except Mo Spears gets in the act with his patented midrange jumper there And just on an 80 run and lets see I thought it was a great time out there by coach Payne And lets see if they change defense Maybe go zone and try something different here 131 and shake the rhythm that the Seminals have found a Florida State team that has so much depth as everyone knows by now They turn teams over at the second highest rate in the ACC and then they also lead the ACC in steals per game So they can get it to snowball in a hurry against opponents and against a team thats struggling with bench production The Cardinals arent you know now without Sky Clark even less production from their bench and someone else has to step up Oh hard fall Trey White That was a collision there Back for cut Gosh Didnt see each other Second foul on Jaylen Worley joining Cam Korn whos also got two for the North Yeah Close line Warley was thinking he had to get out to the corner Didnt know Trey was cutting Well you were talking about depth for Louisville In addition to Sky Clark theyre also without walkon guard Herc Miller again Hes still dealing with a hip injury They expect word soon on what the next steps are for him Johnson know Applause Watkins in transition sets things up for Florida State Little green on the drive and a hand off for Baba Miller Louisville fortunate that possession It never got matched up Applause Miller off the bounce Late shot clock banging into bodies and Hutley Hatfield clears it Great defensive possession there Miller pressing a little bit Turned down a three missed a couple early ones and tried to force a drive there A contest at the rim on Hutley Hatfield stays at this end with Lope Jaylen Gayy is that is what he does Former Ivy League defensive player of the year provides great rim protection Music when he comes in the game Yes Pley Hatfield found out there Nothing will be easy in the paint when 33 is out there Jie spent four years at Brown Sixth year senior missed the first three weeks after last years torn ACL James Dela followed up by Tyler Johnson Smallest guy on the court gets the offensive rebound among the trees He is having himself a first half here Nine points off the bench Watkins trying to burrow in on Xan Payne and the foul Hes going against Florida State And Watkins thats his second Just a great drive One more pass Youre expecting that shot Good look there And Ty Lord Johnson just in the right place at the right time having penetrated and created this jump shot We asked Kenny Payne when hes at his best what does it look like He said first of all when hes at his best we are a different team but its getting guys easy shots and its doing that consistently He said Tyler Johnson will do it for three or four minutes but then hell come down and hell think All right I got to get mine now Its maintaining the same approach and mindset throughout Well its hard because he has so much responsibility on him you know particularly in this game against the way the Siminals play He is the only guy I think that can consistently beat this defender off the dribble And you can see that this half He scored an assisted on almost all of Louisville points Williams gives it up for James Slashing and rolled off And Mike James will shoot two on the other side 22 all with eight to go in the first half in Louisville Music I love your

timely to focus on the late great Muhammad Ali in this city where he was born and raised of course and then began training as an amateur boxer at age 12 walk down Muhammad Ali Boulevard today but nothing can top what Caleb Glenn and Trey White have inked on their arms Hes the greatest this generation throws around to go But Muhammad Ali is the greatest athlete of all time and I think by a mile in my opinion at least Well have to ask these two for their opinion on that Two blackhead coaches The number keeps going up in the ACC and thats wonderful to see It is Were up to nine and coach Hams been around and seen so much change and hes always great to talk to and learn So much history there with him and he was telling those stories today of his time of course on staff at Kentucky and he said whenever he would come to Louisville he would never go out He would just go to the gym and stay in his room because of how fierce the rivalry was even though he was really good friends with Wade Houston Applause Well these rivalry games as we talk about all the time theyre real Josh Nickelberry where he started his career here at Louisville for a couple of seasons before he went to Lasal for two years and now in his first season at Florida State Huntley Hatfield The finish from Johnson Leonard Hamilton wants a timeout Johnson is clicking So is Hudley Hatfield Were right back in 30 When you have a history of greatness you keep dreaming and go beyond whats possible The new 2024 Ridgeline Passport and Pilot Part of our most rugged Trail Sport lineup yet from Honda Music and Huntley Hatfields got nine points So too does Tyler Johnson and those two connected right here Just a great job sealing there Catches Green on the high side seals him Ty Lord Johnson just controlling his game I mean his hes either creating or scoring everything for for the Cardinals This is how much Kenny Paynes team has led trailed and been tied this season They led for six minutes up in this first half today and theyre up by four Darren Green turns the corner gets to the midrange again his second bucket from a similar spot Thats what Coach Payne talked about there today in the warmups At some point when theyre in their drop coverage theyre going to have to switch Hunley Hatfields going to have to stop the ball and contain and contest that shot The guards going to have to switch on the big Johnson beat Fierce and finishes off the glass and hes got 11 in the first half off the bench They cant contain his speed Hes just a nightmare off the bounce right now and getting to his spots Hes hes a righty but he loves to drive left and they cant stay in front of him His speed is the deciding factor in his game right now Confidence caked all over his face right now And then he strips Deontay Green Last touch by Brandon Hugley Hatfield The ball is giving him energy here Hes driving shoots the floater there Difficult shot falling out of bounds but when you got it going you got it going And Johnsons playing as well as he can right now Baba Miller just shoved Xan Payne as those two matched up ahead of the inbounds pass I think Zayns in there is playing a little physical now Theyre going to take a look at the play Wow Yeah So Bert Smith and Nathan Frell came together and they are going to look at this Baba Miller giving a little shove Stan Jones longtime excellent assistant coach at Florida State uh does not look pleased with that from Baba Miller Hes telling Baba you know you cant do that They saw him extend his arm from their bench and Baba Miller is a little frustrated Hes got on a walk Yeah hes starting hes a little frustrated with his start on the offensive end of the floor And Zayn Payne is giving him the business right there Talking trash to him a little bit And I dont think he liked it If youre just joining us maybe you were watching Carolina take down Duke 9384 We do welcome you to Louisville in the KFC Yum Center And its a cards fourpoint lead with 628 to go in the first half Well have a look at what the officials are reviewing Middle left of your screen 11 and White Miller against Sam Payne Applause Music He didnt hit him when he lifted his arm initially but then when he pushes him Well they might think that he got him with the arm on the initial You didnt think so Well judging by Zayns reaction he doesnt look like he got hit there He stays in his stance He didnt do anything wrong He got to a legal position He stands there So but his head popped back Well I think he was trying to sell that I think hes Yeah he knows his role You come on the court now throw your body around He got five fouls to give You see Coach Manny coaching him up there letting him know that Milk Wagner letting him know hes got to be physical And thats you know Bobby Millers got to get used to that Thats what you expect to happen And thats his only advantage Hes giving up five to six inches Music I didnt think he did anything wrong I thought he got to a legal guarding position And Jeff Pons gonna come over and well hear what he has to say Applause Jeff Pon came over and said its a dead ball contact technical foul So its two free throws and possession Letter of the law and that is the ball is dead and its contact thats unnecessary unacceptable or excessive though it doesnt rise to the level of a flagrant two contact tech We asked was it for the arm going up at first or the shoving like you thought it it was for the shove Not that in addition Yeah its a push Its a shove there You cant do it And I think with him throwing the arm and then not hit him and then intentionally push him afterwards is Bob Miller You just cant make that mistake I mean are are you okay with that call Did it feel a little light to you No I think its fine I think two shots in the ball is fine Youre okay with it It was in your eyes Yeah I think its that egregious because if you dont then it gets out of control and I think its a good way of you know here earlier in the game to say Hey guys were not having any of that Just play basketball And I just dont understand what warranted by Miller to to push him in the first place Well you and Stan Jones are thinking alike Mike James a very good free throw shooter at 82 just split So its Louisville by five plus they get the ball here So in a first half in which the Cards have led by as many as six theyve got a chance to add on against one of the top teams in the ACC and Florida State fourth overall in the league at 6 and three And a similar lineup thats on the floor now Its not very big and I say that to say they got two 65 guards on the floor but with Primo Spears there is they mix up their rotation James underneath on the catch wanted by Miller from the backside and its Florida State basketball Thats what you do if youre by Miller Youre frustrated Applause Get back in the game Rotate Teammates loses his man You come over and shot block a shot Knock it off the offensive guy get a possession back for your team Now he comes up to get it Matched up with Payne Post entry for Gainy who gets fouled underneath by Brandon Huntley Hatfield Its his first Yeah Hatfield got Huntley Hatfield got buried deep there and let Gany catch it too deep in the post Had nothing but could nothing he could do but foul there gaining to the line 56 for his career Hey our next all access the ACC life very special one and it premieres Monday night ACC student athletes and administrators from all 15 ACC institutions went to Washington DC in July last year on the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington Talent Cup host it Its at 7 Eastern right here on ACCN and the ESPN app Fourpoint game inside of six to go in this first half Florida State against Louisville 19 in the ACC and 6 and 15 overall Fells on the floor against Primo Spears his first Hatfields doing a great job of when he gets the switch hes sealing those guards If theyre on the top hes sealing them throw for the lob If they stay below them hes burying them deep Lets see if the Sims make any adjustments on that ball screen Youve seen a lot of Florida State over the last few weeks You always talk about you have to punish switches against them because they are going to switch obviously as everyone knows one through five Well you have to do it when they have the smaller lineup in Right now with Primo Spears in the game and some of the smaller guards its easier switch When Warley comes in hes 67 So its not as the foul trouble that they have now has forced them to be with a smaller lineup Miller cuts navigates and an offensive foul Called on Jaylen Gainy Yeah theyve gotten really good minutes Part of Zane Payne Hes coming in there and thrown his body around And its not about scoring Its just about hes bringing a level of physicality and effort Sixth year senior walkon and the son of the head coach of course spent the first four years of his playing career at Kentucky Johnson driving dish Williams cant knock it down Miller rescues it off pain and its no basketball down four Its a great look there Great penetration and skip That shot will be there against Florida State Get deep Force rotation Sprays it to the corner three and second open three off penetration from Johnson They missed They need to knock those down if they want to pull off the upset And you said Florida States got to find someone that can stay in front of Tyler Johnson Who do you think is the best perimeter defender to do that for Florida State Well Warley can do it with his size As you can see here this is what youve given up easy baskets They Louisville has controlled this game throughout this first half and theyve given up continuously They given up point blank layups like that Theyre just making it easy Theyre being challenged to score Oh Jackson threats a gorgeous pass to Hunley Headfield There was no opening Johnsons having himself a game Hes singlehandedly controlling his game Hes got the Cardinals on his back from the offensive end of the floor Eric L from Spears to Miller Johnsons feeling confident at the controls for the Cards off the bounce Blocked by Miller and then he rips it away from Gainy Johnson has it They will pull it back out Sees the opening now underneath on Miller Huntley Hatfield the cut Too strong Im out of breath Watching Johnson on that possession Can he sustain this all night When you want to win youre going to try it And hes doing all he can right now Hes got Louisville up four inside of four to go in the first half Genie comes up to get it Got a post up for Bon Miller Hes wanted to do more of this but he got stripped by Hudley Hatfield Another turnover Williams sack steps Nickelberry and finishes Great penetration there getting to the rim sees Josh Charlesbury there ready to take the charge Jump stop Plays off two Louisville fans been begging for this This kind of effort all year Spears one Hes the guy He is the guy for the Williams Hit ahead bump and finish Louisville giving a symbol of some of their their own medicine You dont get back on defense Look at this pass here Huntley having himself a go Got a ball game here in the Yum

with three minutes to go in this first half At the end of shoot around today Kenny Payne said to his team one of the first things he said They cant afford to lose to you That was the start of his message to his group He knew the significance on the Florida State side His group has come out here in this first half and the Cards have looked really good You said theyve controlled this game in a game thats all important for the NLES I think he basically was telling these guys all the pressurees on them We know the season hasnt gone the way we wanted it to you know to go so far but the pressures on Florida State They have to come in if they want to make a tournament run to get back in this We just need to come out try to put it together a consistent 40 minutes and theyve done that so far the first half Lets see if they can sustain this They they theyve played well for 27 minutes so far Theyve controlled this entire first half and theyve defended well Theyve been the better team of controlling the paint You know thats usually what Florida State does their other team So lets see if they can continue this momentum and close out the first half in a week in which Louisville last Saturday against Virginia Remember 12 by trailed by 28 at halftime Biggest halftime deficit for Louisville since the 1930s Tuesday against Clemson trailed by as many as 24 Theyre up by a half dozen against one of the top teams in the conference this year Miller is fighting hard for positioning and draws a foul on Trey White his first Theyre trying to post Baba Miller up and hes trying to use his his strength against those guys He just needs to turn and face and elevate over top of him You know youre giving up Theyre giving you six or seven inches Just turn catch and face Baseline out of bounds and Spears had to get that into Miller Its Fierce Nickelberry Green Green and Miller The five for Leonard Hamilton Applause More fighting on the block and Deontay Green commits a foul Brandon Huntley Hatfield Well you said earlier Florida State plays in games with a lot of fouls Theyre going to foul Theyre going to rotate those bodies in So you still owe me dinner after that You know that So lets hash this out Average time a game for Florida State What do you think it is Average time of game this season 215 Good guess 2 hours and 13 minutes They have only played two games under two hours this season Longest game of the year Any guesses 22 How about 2 hours and 34 minutes Wow Regulation No overtime Well against Winro Strap in folks Randalls earning his money tonight Yeah Get your coffee and sit up with us tonight Were going to have a good one Biggest lead for Louisville Its at eight Nickelberry can shoot it Cant hit Hes got some good looks tonight Applause Hatfield a finish in the foul Hes fired up As good as Tyord Johnson has been on the outside and driving in the paint Huntley Hatfield has been a force inside and hes punishing that switch Green drives in front He walks them up the lane They stay behind He buries them inside Theyre going to have to try to change their defense and keep a bigger body on it Lead is 11 and Hunley Hatfield got 16 2 minutes from halftime Coming up on the auto owners insurance halftime report Carolina takes round one against Duke And now top 10 tussle and then Miami down to the wire Coral Gables against Virginia Tech Spears No rebound White Everything coming up Louisville here down the stretch headed to halftime James hits the gas Got fouled and maybe a goalend as well as he flipped it up after the foul Credit to Louisville here Theyre just completely controlling this game Florida State doesnt match up They dont get back and match up when theyre in this smaller lineup now theyre trying to designate assignments when theyre in their original lineup with their starters theyre just pick a man and right now theyre trying to match up because theyre so small and the foul trouble that they have in the first half its theyre not setting their defense and its giving them trouble right now theyre on their heels and credit to Louisville its Baba Millers second he is the fifth Florida State player with two fouls a pop Some tense moments for Steve Smith and Leonard Hamilton because its Miller Warley who reenters this game with two Watkins Corin and Gainy all with a couple of fouls each Okay those guys are play theyre like your closers as well So youre the reserve guys outside of Green here are getting extended minutes and Roy has to be careful He has two but theyre lacking defense right now I think coach Ham obviously is willing to put Worley back in this game 10 run for Louisville Here is Worley Shadowed by Johnson Aaron Green comes up to get it around the screen Late shot clock and Warley will initiate off the crossover Warley scoops and finishes Great job Great job there by Wardley He called in the ball screen up Caught him for it before Green could even come up He just crosses it over Gets down the paint finishes And his impact You hear him Coach Ham loves his big point guards He loves Trent Forest He talks about it And he loves his defensive oriented point guards from Wally sure is that he knows how to play and knows how to impact the game 68 free throw shooter 10point game He usually has more of a hitch on the shot That one that was just nice and easy and see if he can avoid picking up a foul here Hes chasing Trey White Season high first half point total of 43 from Louisville as we hit the final minute Williams previous first half season high was the opener the season 40 in the first half against the Retrievers of UNMBC Tom House known for his shooting is into the game offensive rebound Warley and how about the impact hes made since coming in with his two fouls he goes to the offensive glass what he lacks as a perimeter shooter he makes up for it with his defensive ability his ability to switch He anchors this defense Doesnt get enough credit for how important he is to this team And hes shown you why here Two on Nickelberry So six different Florida State seminals with two fouls and pop How about this first half for Kenny Payne I mean you asked him today at shootout Whats been the difference first half to second half this year And this is not fitting with the script weve seen No his team has come out and played a great first half and and he asked it He said You know what You look at those numbers and you think theyve just been totally wiped out in the first half And hes like No its just been a a segment of a TV timeout a threem minute segment here or two minutes here And Cardinals have been in complete control this entire first half Louisville hasnt led at the half of any of its first 10 ACC games Last time they had a halftime lead You got to go back to December 17th against Pepperdine Johnson good on both We talked about Florida State creating turnovers This Louisville defense that has turned to similars over 10 times here in the first half Big reason why Eric theyve been in control of this game Two seconds differentiating the game clock and the shot clock Tyler Johnsons got 13 points three rebounds six assists Hley Hatfields got 16 points Warley picked by Johnson Fick Johnson Hutley Hackfield A himlberry Applause west This game has been dominated by the smallest player on the court Ty Johnson has been the best player Big reason why Louisville is up 12 here Another 20 minutes and take this victory home Got to go back to the Clemson win last year for Louisville to find their last halftime lead in a conference game Darren Green gets a pick to start and he lays it in So already down to 10 Yeah you dont want to have a pick sixes Those did a great job in the first half of being able to set your defense making the Florida State team play against your set defense at times uh when you settle down and stop giving up point blank layups did a really good job forcing turnovers This guy Tyler Johnson was the star alongside Brandon Huntley Hatfield who gets fouled on the drive Hunley Hatfield had 18 in the first half His careerhigh is 22 Foul there is on Jaylen Worley and thats three on him and thats huge because he was probably Florida States best player in the first half it was and his defensive mentality if you want to get back in this game You can see theyve turned it up here to start the second half and Wleys a big part of that and you need him out there because hes a matchup nightmare He provides the best opportunity to switch fob which is what the Siminals like to do And when they go to their smaller lineups this guy at the free throw line Huntley Hatfield has had his way against the smaller guards And didnt want to see Wally pick up that third foul so quickly here in the second half Averages 11 and eight and hes got 20 Jamir Watkins He was quiet Only played seven minutes and had four points in the first half One of those six guys with two Hley Hatfield got the tip on Baba Miller Oh what a pass Glenn from Johnson Wow Ty Johnson again just controlling this game and creating for himself for his teammates Glenn running the lane catches it in stride and hammers it over Corin follows up Watkins I mean these passes that Tyler Johnsons made the one that he bounced seemingly between legs in the first half and then that one length of the court to Glenn Traveling call on Johnson Wait look at this pass here in strike Glenn slams it home But look at the vision in the pass Applause He is dominating this game The crowd here really did not like that whistle and traveling call and turnover on Tylard Johnson Theres Warley with the defense sagging off him He attacks and hes going to the free throw line And thats what he does When you sag off of him youre daring him to shoot Hes going to get hes comfortable enough now and knows his role within his offense and hes going to continue to get try to get to the front of that rim and force contact there and he drew the foul Really quick release now Hes not hitching Wleys known for having a hitch is something he may have worked on here And balls coming out of his hand just as smooth and and flow Put a lot of time in on his shot over the last few years He knocks down both And its a 10point game First couple of minutes out of halftime Applause Start of this game is big for Louisville because you dont want to with the Florida State lineup out there now Theyre in foul trouble If they can continue to apply pressure and draw fouls theyll force coach Ham to go to his early than he wants to Applause Thats on Baba Miller And thats his third and they give it away to Watson now Yeah but its his third too And now he picks his third Well in addition to all the foul trouble weve not seen Chandler Jackson play in this game Sophomore guard from Memphis who averages 14 minutes per game We were told before the game that that might be the case There was not certainty in the messaging on that but we were told it might be because of a coachs decision And that clearly appears to be the case So even more shorthanded factoring that to go along with the foul trouble because hes a scoring guard as well and hes a hes been in the system a year Applause scoring finishes and and what do you say about it I mean you dont know what he did Too late to speculate on it And what you dont want to do is be in coachs ham dog house with the way he rotates his guys Trey White blocked by Miller Chandler Jackson did go through shoot around fully and did warm up before this game started tonight Watkins is bumped and its a foul on Tylard Johnson is second Now the lead was a dozen for Kenny Payne at halftime Largest halftime lead for Louisville against an ACC opponent since 23 months ago Georgia Tech in the ACC tournament 32 games ago against ACC foes Thats how good the first half was tonight for the Cardinals And its the way theyre doing it They havent done it by just making threes or doing something thats just been so out of character I think the surprising thing is that theyre beating Florida State at their own game Just controlling the paint off the dribble Hat Huntley Hatfield has just been you know sealing inside and punishing the switches Hes just been dominating Theyve been dominating the paint Kim Corin the sophomore from Texas Hey Thursday its a full slate starting with ACC PM at 4 Then its a double header of womens basketball including the featured matchup at 800 Number 17 Virginia Tech against number five NC State And all of that followed by nothing but net right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app All right down to an eightpoint game And Florida State extends the pressure on Louisville How did Johnson and Hunley Hatfield hold up as well Hunley Hatfield did not come off the court in the first half and Johnson played all but 214 that he sat out to begin the game Its a missed three from James You also want to see James and Hawaii try to get themselves going offensively Kick for Watkins Short Johnson the rebound Yeah you think about playing without your third leading scorer in Sky Clark And White your second leading scoreer Didnt score in the first half Williams a little bit out of control And then its a push on Brandon Huntley Hatfield He picks up his second foul Applause Huntley Hatfield You can tell theyre intentionally trying to be physical but Baba Miller there commented to him as he went back down the floor He dont mind that foul Hes playing with a level of physicality Hes leaving it all on the court tonight And and he singlehandedly controlled the paint of this game for the bigs for the Louisville Louisvilles plus eight in paint points Warley nice to the basket How about this game from Jaylen Warley Great attack there and drove right down and I think Hatfield was a little hesitant because he had just picked up the pre the previous possession Picked up a foul and tried to time it on the glass and again Warley 67 and with his wingspan gets it to the glass quicker Hes got 15 his most points since November Corin cleans up the Johnson miss and the nullles run Only down six off to the wing and Miller had it poked away and it does stay with Florida State when we come back Deficit gotten large at times for Florida State as big as 14 before these bringing him back Yeah he turns the corner here beats half field to the glass and hes battling back and helped this similar team cut it to six With no fees or minimums and no overdraft fees banking with Capital One is the easiest decision in the history of decisions Even easier than this Ill take Barkley Yes I still got it I told you

given him the assignment on Tyur Johnson there Hes completely face guarding him Hes not even looking at the basketball Johnson still finds a way to get it And with Florida State switching of course now its Worley back on to Johnson Oh what a pass to Hunley Hatfield This is a show Hes been the best player on the floor tonight Its been fun to watch Not even close He has completely just got to his

on ESPN and ABC Applause Tyler Johnson having a day 15 points five rebounds 10 assists couple of steals Hes got a block as well for a guy who had never scored more than 14 points here in his freshman season and had never had more than six assists in a game either But Sky Clark out of the game he had no choice but to play From the moment he stepped on the floor he hadnt come out And he shouldnt Hes been the best player on the floor And from the very first possession Louisvilles scoreless And he touches the ball goes down the lane creates for his teammates And and you wont find any pass any better than this one here I mean just fakes a dribble hand off turns a corner throws the wrap around behind the back pass And Hunley Hatfield knows what to do with it And he has just dominated controlled the pace of his game The pressure of Florida State doesnt bother him His speed is ne negated Florida States pressure Hes making the right reads Hes taking care of the basketball And the most impressive thing is hes been able to sustain this pace for 27 minutes so far Lets see if he can close out the next 13 with this type of energy that hes given Florida States down by 13 So what do you do for Florida State defensively to stop him One they got to start You may have to push him and make him a jump shooter but you got to figure out him And then you got to also figure out right now Pat Hatfields out of the game So you got to start taking advantage of that now cuz you hadnt had an answer for him I Worley with the shot clock winding down with the left hand Getting him the ball might help too cuz hes he is answering the bell himself getting to the paint whenever he had whittleled Turnover on the inbounds and its a held ball and the arrow points it back to Florida State Yeah these are turnovers you got to eliminate now Siminals extending their pressure and trying to take the ball out of Johnsons hand and someone else is going to have to step up and be a ball handler here I thought Florida State would try to do it early than this and you can see quickly Hatfield comes in Applause when hes playing the way hes playing You give him a quick TV timeout break and thats it Get back out there Spears off the bats Draws the contact from Brandon Huntley Hatfield Thats his third Now hes got to be careful here He pick up a fourth Hes going to have to take him out and he allows you to the ability to switch playing them at the four or the five And right now they got a bigger lineup in and hes playing the four Spears misses on the first Applause Music with the lead Kenny Paynes taking no chances Giving him a quick rest here and see how long he stays on the bench Its noticeable difference when hes not out there Puts more responsibility on Johnson Spears missed B talked about the Florida State free throw shooting Johnson works with it Thats the turnover there Johnson can want to try to eliminate there I thought he did a good job of getting to a spot trying to play off two feet Just couldnt fit his footing up under him Watkins drives on James Kicks for Worley Spins on Williams off the glass Jaylen Worley with 19 points matching his outing against Colorado earlier this year Now one pivotal thing out there now is Jaylen Gayys on the floor now and he provides rim protection Applause I thought Punfield would be a more of a difficult matchup for him and hes out right now And theyre not trying to switch one through five with him if they can avoid it Johnson missed the jump shot but Okoraphor ran it down Well as good as Gany is defensively I dont think he wants to be in front of Johnson No Who does James attacks and drew the contact Ty Lar Johnson and Brandon Hudley Hatfield living their best lives The lead is nine for the Cards at home Agassi Craft

State though they are six and three in the ACC fourth in the standings and behind only Carolina Duke and Virginia not currently in the field in Joe Lonards latest projections He says theyre considered Hes got them around the late 80s for his spots as well And this is a quad three game for Florida State So really you dont want to lose this one against a team with a net in the 200s And this would be the halfway point for Florida State in conference play as we check out what remains for them and the opportunities still out there It would be a brutal loss but we talk about it all the time winning on the road is hard Yeah And this team came in today and I think what makes this one so alarming is that we heard the coaching staff talk about them and their effort their level of ant intensity and just their attention to detail in todays shoot around And we heard Steve Smith say You guys arent paying attention And when you come off a week off you guys are notorious for doing this and theyre playing dearly for it But credit to Louisville Louisville came out and theyve handed them this game every you know from the start More importantly when Tyler Johnson was inserted in the lineup this team just took off and they fed off his energy and he and Hatfield have done their part to help Louisville get their second ACC win of the year Green short Okoraphor the rebound and Williams will slow things down Yeah Leonard Hamilton even said it to us He said We know Louisville is going to be able to sustain it for 40 minutes against somebody Just dont want it to be us Thats what he said And and the crowd has turned up Theyve supported them and done their part The guys have continued to defend and compete at a high level And I think whats so impressive about this game so far is that theyre like again theyre beating Florida State in the way that Florida State usually beats teams Miller finishes Darren Green had poked it away at the other end And now Florida States got it down to eight Someone else it has got to step up And this is where you worry about Tylo Johnson maybe wearing down a little bit as Hunley Hatfield comes back in the game and coach Payne has seen enough of him Hes only has three fouls Its got to get him back out on the floor Hes been the second most impactful player out there Darren Green commits a foul So five team fouls on both sides with still 1029 to go here in the second half You dont mind the pressure for Florida State but you just dont want to commit silly fouls and put them in a bonus unnecessarily Just extend the pressure Theres plenty of time Youre only down eight Its over 10 minutes to go here and Williams navigates and scoops it home Curtis Williams the freshman from Detroit known for his shooting from the outside Florida State didnt match up there and Williams made a pay Spears in and out Williams accelerates Pulls up The follow from Caleb Flynn Warley answers right back The pace of this game right now Both teams are extending their pressure and its just a race now Applause Worley trying to shut off Tylard Johnson still So its Mike James controlling Johnson with it Hley Hatfield got his own miss Sticks it back Hes just overpowered by our Miller inside Another assist there by Johnson Glenn picks up another foul and thats his fourth Someone better box this young man out He times this perfectly Comes off over everybody dunking on his own teammates Glenn a local kid from Louisville stayed here committed to Louisville and he is Applause showing the fans they have a lot to look forward to in the future And thats just seven to seven in dunks And thats typically what Florida State does to their teammates which is surprising to see with the length that Florida State has Theyve given up so many theyve blown so many rotations on the defensive end of the floor and they paid for it Worley and Millard to the bench for Leonard Hamilton early sits with 21 points in 19 minutes and Baba Miller has got as many points as he has turnovers for each Blacks good on both Guy who lives at the free throw line I cant imagine Wally being on the sideline long Hes been best player for the Sims tonight and theyre trying to run and jump here and create turnovers Good hit by James who got fouled by Cam Corin Three on Corin So four different Florida State seminals with three fouls and pop Yeah Mike James is not shooting it well from the floor but hes one of the best in the ACC of getting to the foul line and Music Applause does a great job there drawing contact Hey tonight 10 Eastern the Nothing Man Crew breaks down the

Syracuse and Winston Salem Yeah that the Des boat racing the orange there and 29 point win Home teams taking care of business And how about Louis uh Virginia going into Clemson getting one That was a big game there And surprise to none Tony Benn has figured it out Cavaliers are back Watkins is finally getting himself going here as he drives against James there Again weve talked about it He just overpowers wings Had foul trouble early Just never quite got into it in the first half And no time is better than now for him to get going and try to pull the symbols back in this game Top four in the ACC in free throw attempts And he stamps a threepoint play to get Leonard Hamiltons team back down to single digits trailing by nine 850 to go in a quad three game for Florida State Now if youre Louisville you cant get tentative now You got to do what got you here and continue to attack the paint Applause So States gone to their zone now Theyre changing things up Williams hes a shooter Holly Hefield on another stick back just dominating underneath Hardest thing to do against a zone is rebound And its why a lot of coaches dont like to play it And when youre patting yourself on a mantoman defense and not accustomed to blocking out Williams had it roll off his fingertips and it goes back to Florida State Florida States lucky there Applause Williams did a great job pushing the pace creating the turnover and just couldnt finish it right away Florida States got to buckle down here Eight minutes to go down 11 Watkins midrange No not running much offensive Just trying to speed you

Clives are pretty good for the Cardinals right now Up by 13 We got the guitar rocket here Everything has come up Louisville and Tyler Johnson 17 points five rebounds 10 assists Last Louisville player to put up a statline like that Those numbers are better in one game You got to go back to 2004 Francisco Garcia 20 years ago had 17 seven rebounds and 15 assists against Murray State That is the company that Tylard Johnson keeps tonight Its the perfect storm for him too The sky clock not being eligible you know not being able to play and he gets thrown in the lineup and hes just playing against a team that pressures so much and they just dont have an answer for him His speed hes been a matchup problem all night Clark out with a hip injury a hip pointer suffered Tuesday against Clemson So hes been out and Kenny Payne didnt start with a starting point guard in his lineup He left it to 65 Mike James and 67 Trey White But just over two minutes into the game he inserted Johnson and everythings changed Five to shoot for Florida State down 13 Derek Green we got to get to him That time Louisville was late on the switch When the Greens involved in any type of dribble handoffs youve got to switch up Williams blocked by Worley Jaylen Worley is doing Ymans work right now Hes face guarding Tyler Johnson then switched blocked the shot Oh and he leads him with 21 points as well Hes doing it all And hes got a quick blow just a minute ago Now hes back out there And where would Florida State be without him Pick and pop Watkins hesitated and missed it Offensive rebound court Darren Green wanted another run down by White They got to get stopped Florida State Williams hits front to Louisville as Williams knocks down his second three from that same you know same spot And theyre not matching up with the size that they have just get a guy and theyre trying to get Wley on Johnson and at this point in the game you just got to match up and guard him Corin the offensive rebound and then tipped butt waving off Its basket interference on Florida State Applause Yeah its definitely still in the c cylinder of air the upward extension of that ring So most traveling here Mike James wasnt expecting the ball back James had that blocked but a foul is called Mike just cut the angle off You usually dont make a living driving the ball to the rim in the first side against this siminal defense but there hasnt been a lot of resistance here tonight Teams were always reluctant You would tell your team to drive and kick out and credit Louisville Theyve done a great job I think Mike James here asked before and one and it wasnt a goend and I think they got it on the way up and could still get his two shots here Applause They have really controlled this game from the from the opening tip Again if youre just joining us its a Louisville team that is 1 and nine in the ACC and on a sixgame losing streak Has lost 11 of its last 13 and in its last two games before tonight had trailed by 28 at halftime against Virginia last weekend and Tuesday trailed against Clemson by as many as 24 Well tonight the lead as large as its been at 15 Its a foul on Brandon Huntley Hatfield and thats significant because its his fourth with 602 to go Applause Lets see if they take him out or they leave him in And cuz were running out were minutes away from Applause Louisville taking this game in if they can just hold off the next couple of minutes Now they going to take him out Just play it safe But I like the lineup now Theyre playing with a smaller lineup more guards So they should be able to handle the fullourt pressure here and get it to their offense And Corin is good on the first 77 free throw shooter in his twoyear career Florida State as a team only 69 at the free throw line this year Fourth worst in the ACC Corin splits but an offensive rebound for Baba Miller And then he turns it over Curtis Williams will slow things down Great job Great decision there by Williams Freshmans drove it taking it to the rim a couple times tonight that time pulled it out and Glenn had it poked away by Watkins Green was trying to handle it Corin got a seal and the foul is on the floor Its on Mike James and thats his fourth as well So now you got James Glenn and Huntley Hatfield all with four And James is pleading his case to stay in the game I think theyre going to leave him in his ability just to attack the rimman draw fouls You need you need his ball handling against his pressure Corin good on the first Mike James the heart and soul guy of this team as a red shirt sophomore Part of the foul trouble for Kenny Paynes group When youre one and nine in conference play youre doing your part Hes given the effort Youre five minutes away from a major upset James is hounded Just got to continue to be strong with the ball in you You get it in Johnsons hand Space the floor and allow him to drop Johnson off the hesy ball away Good Cant guard him Why not They cant guard him Had stopped him all night Kenny Payne just says clear out and let him go And he delivers again Orley shut out Green sniper down to a dozen with five minutes to go Music This is the advantage of having the five guards out here on the floor Now you got multiple handlers Applause Kenny Payne takes a timeout Two left 443 to go Back in 30 seconds to the young Applause Some people just know that the best rate for you is a rate based on you not Paul You dont want to ride with Paul Get a rate based on you with Drive Wise and the All State app Applause Its been almost a calendar year since the last ACC home win for Louisville And everyone in this league knows how significant a loss it was for Clemson Louisville right now leads Florida State according to Joe Lennonardi on the outside looking in by a dozen in this one I when you dont come ready to play this is what happened And credit to Louisville We talked about it You know as much as we talked about Florida State and how important it was for them to come out ready to play they did not do so And Louisville took advantage of it And you saw Sky Walkers out But if you just take away the records and watch this game Louisville has been the better team tonight Pitpointer for Sky Clark Opportunity for Tyard Johnson 19 points five rebounds 11 assists He hasnt come off the floor since he checked into the game 2 minutes and 14 seconds in And it tipped away by Darren Green Still belongs to the Cards with five to shoot You got time to run You have You got plenty of time here Whoever gets it to space the floor You give them time You got enough room know time on the clock to get to the rim So Applause Trey White will put it in Hes out there with Curtis Williams Mike James Caleb Glenn and Tylard Johnson White gets it in Heres Williams Strip by Darren Green ahead for Warley Corin the lob Down to 10 This is the way Florida State traditionally likes to play Create turnovers Get out in the break Score in transition They just hadnt been able to get stops James got bumped on the floor Fourth foul on Baba Miller Its a great find there by Woolly Music Cam Cor beats everyone down the floor and catches the lob finish Set try get a chance to set the fullourt defense But again it doesnt matter with this lineup is on the floor now with five guards Theyre beating the press fullourt pressure easily and pouls Four minutes to go Warley to the basket He gets fouled and Caleb Bled is fouled out of this game Freshman forward whos been starting in the front court is done Picked up his fourth a little while ago and quickly thereafter his fifth Now when youre a young team like this too this this Louisville team is trying to figure out they hadnt been in this situation a bunch Theyre trying to figure out how to close this game out And fortunately for them even though Glenn is fouling out Hunley Hanfield is coming in and hes had a monster game himself with 28 points And Music so no reason to be concerned if youre Louisville you needed to get him back in the game anyway You just dont want to stop the clock right now with the fouls Jaylen Worleys four of four at the line So Glenn Dunn Hunley Hatfield with four James with four and Jaylen Worley having a night Heres the pressure coming Hes matched a careerhigh with 23 points and has trimmed it to eight And here is the pressure indeed And they let Tyler Johnson go up the floor Theyre trying to get it to him in a half court And its a battle here with Warley getting the foul trying to deny him Worley grabbed him and he picks up his fourth 353 to go Louisville by eight on Florida State Music We want a trimmed tree and an unfranchured coxix Sadly we cant have it all except at Sport Clips where we check in with the frozen mens hair and totally

6 and three in the league by eight with 353 to go Couple of timeouts left on both sides Weve had tons of fouls all night And the arrow points to Louisville Hes Randolph Childress Im Mike Monaco First question how has Louisville done it The folks are just tuning in right now Theyve just controlled the paint the way Florida State does Theyve even outscored them by bench points but theyve dominated the paint Something that Florida State usually does to its ACC opponents Theyve been unable to do it against Louisville They cant contain Johnson and penetration And that was the what struggled Louisville has struggled at all year long is guarding the basketball And they have just reversed everything And and quite honestly theyve been the best team today I dont think its been close Next question If Florida States going to come back down eight right now been down by as many as 15 in this second half How do they have to do it One you got to keep Johnson out of the paint and I dont know how they do it because hes done a great job of taking care of the basketball Hes hes scored so much and hes put so much pressure there and you still got Mike James whos been able to drive it and finish it on the court They hadnt had an answer for for Hatfield Its its just been a really impressive performance with this team and theyve finally been able to put together close to 40 minutes if they can just close out this last 3 minutes and 53 seconds And it isnt as much sometimes as what Florida State didnt do is what Louisville did And when you counted them out you didnt show up and put your best foot forward Youre paying for it Ramos Spears travels 17 turnovers on Florida State and thats been a huge part of the problem as well Yeah youre giving up 84 points to a team thats averaging 71 and still have 345 to play and you turned it over You had a 11 first half That was the the recipe that got Louisville confident in the beginning of the game Brandon Hunley Hatfield gets trapped by Korn along the sideline and then Mike James dribbles it off his foot and Louisville gives it back to Florida State with still 335 to go All right for the NLES for just joining us Jaylen Worleys been the star 23 points matching a careerhigh on a day where everyone else has been dealing with foul trouble or ineffectiveness Now Warley turns it over and its backto back Florida State giveaways out of the timeout Just guys trying to make plays doing a little bit too much and Applause season high 18 turnovers for the NLES Tyler Johnson has starred 215 and 11 first Louisville player in the last 25 years with 20 points 10 assists and five rebounds or more in a game Heres James backing down on Spears Worley reaches in and has fouled out of this game With 302 to go Jaylen Worley is done for Florida State And you got to know when Mike James went to attack the basket there hes looking for contact trying to draw a foul And Worleys been the best player for the Seminals tonight And if you wanted to to get back into this game you definitely didnt want to lose him Hes been hes your best perimeter defender And then tonight hes been your best offensive player only guy on the roster and in the rotation for Leonard Hamilton whos been with him for three years now and in maybe his best career game fouls out with his team down double figures with three minutes left staring down a difficult loss Applause for the resume of Florida State This is a really bad loss You were you were climbing your way out of the hole you dug yourself in with the six and six start and you dont come ready to play Winning on the road is hard and when you dont come ready to play you So Watkins muscles it in Hes got a chance in a threepoint play Still with 254 to go Got to get stops You put great job there to not not only score but get the clock to stop So it gives you a chance to set your defense Got to create turnovers here Jir Watkins is seven for seven at the free throw line He is second in the ACC this year in free throw attempts Only behind Syracuse is Jude to Mint And he cannot stamp it Spears the finish and the foul This is what Florida State has done this year Offensive rebounds on missed free throws and it just adds possessions But when you when you losing games you no communication there White and Huntley Anfield collab with each other and its a big play here You get five points out of this trip down the floor without the clock running is the key to that And now you got to get the ball across half court against this pressure Locking foul on Darren Green I thought Green did a really good job trying to stay on Williams right hand And sometimes the officials call foul They think youre down and youre trying to foul I thought Green did a really good job of trying to stay on the right hand and not force Williams to go left Credit Williams for forcing contact making a ref know the whistle Music Curtis Williams only seven for 12 at the free throw line entering tonight Hes good on the first Yes he went for that fake in the middle and jumped inside and definitely contact there Applause Williams makes both Hes got 15 Its a big possession there Give up five quick points Needed to get a bucket Now Watkins drives on White Watkins had it popped out White clears it and finds Johnson Hes got to get it over half court and he does to Huntley Hatfield Get it back out and find Johnson Johnson or James Johnson comes to get it Freshman point guards been spectacular And he got fouled And whos it on They get it on Baba Miller And now hes fouled out as well with 217 left And Baba Miller struggled tonight I thought they were really physical with them in the game Music Never got it going on the offensive end of the floor and had some challenges on the defensive end as well Thats what Music credit to Louisville as well there Attacked quite a bit Won most of those matchups Miller out Theyre going to bring in Tom House and hes only played two minutes tonight and hasnt scored in exactly a month Music Hes in here now just to hopefully hes their best catch and shoot guy outside of Green and hoping to catch Lightning in the bottom and knock down a three or two Meanwhile Kenny Payne trying to grab his second ACC win of the season Johnsons been steering the ship for him And now Johnson picks up a foul Thats a freshman mistake there Last thing you want to do is stop the clock at 215 for Primo Spears to go to the line 79 free throw shooter this year and just one of three though tonight Third by the way on Johnson Spears makes the first Still got 215 left in this ball game Still time You got to be ready to rebound if he misses This is such a press offense Makes both ninepoint Louisville lead They set up the press offense with Mike James to key it in Williams escapes to James and a block on Tom House Its the right call House didnt give him a chance to turn around He just was crowded James on the catch and block call was the right call Applause So Mike James goes to the line red shirt sophomore from Orlando about whom Kenny Payne always raves Loves his spirit thats coaching him What do we say the record was for Florida State game for length of the game for them this year 2 hours and a mere 34 minutes against Winthre right around Christmas Okay think we got a shot Were at 2 hours and 17 minutes with 210 to go Okay definitely a shot Did you see the Butler game last night But the last minute of that game took like 24 realtime minutes No dont do that No Im not Im not wishing Im just saying thats what happened James backs it down So he splits 10 point cards cushion Spears House Green Watkins and Corin The five for Leonard Hamilton Spears rejected the screen Heres House in and out and he got fouled hadnt even attempted a shot in a month And Tom House nearly stuck it And now he goes to the line for three When youre learning how to win these are the mistakes that you make We saw Johnson at the length of the court make a foul and Williams there doesnt allow House to land and fouls a threepoint shooter which is a Cardinal sin You dont want to do that at all And you definitely dont want to do it when youre trying to close out a game And how about Tom House now Hes only attempted three free throws including that one all year Had been one for two and hes missed the first two of these three And Florida State as a team has missed 11 free throws tonight 20 for 31 64 Makes one of three If youre over you need to get the ball in the hands of Johnson or or James And wow its a strip Green lays it in Its down to seven Still a buck 53 to go Johnsons got to come back and get this ball Instead its White for now Takes it over midcourt Sails it to Johnson right over here So two costly Louisville giveaways barely up toward half court Johnsons got to get his hands on this basketball Green just takes it out of the hands of William And then William doesnt take it out Hes not supposed to take it out and he kind of overreacts there and creates another smacked on the screen Spears fouled Green He thought about it House moves it Spears with it He rises Cant hit Music Dont need to foul yet Find Johnson and get the ball in his hands Thats the guy Let him take you home He brought you here Let him take you home He got bumped Count it Sure looked like that was on the floor but they say count the bucket And a chance at three for Tyler Johnson He was starting his move Hes been the guy at the start of the game Let him take you home Hes earned the right All this pressure is going on No one has stayed in front of him all night long He takes the contact there I think theres no doubt its an one Agree to disagree All right bro Hey hes getting his league going man Hes getting ready He sure is playing that way tonight First 25 and 10 game in Louisville program history Wow for Tyler Johnson Hes been that good He has been the best player on the floor tonight from the jump 26 points five rebounds 11 assists for the freshman from Brooklyn who didnt even play on Tuesday because of a sprained ankle he suffered in shootout Didnt start this game even with Sky Clark out with a hip pointer Louisville went sons point guard but then 214 into the game Kenny Payne has seen it up He inserted Tylard Johnson into the game and he has not left the floor since Brooklyn stand up baby Brooklyn stand up We go hard Ty Lloyd Johnson has been dominant since hes entered this game and just getting wherever he wanted to get in the four His speed is they had no answer for it Hes got to his spots just dominated the paint and you look at where hes getting these shots from I mean hes all at in the rim at the paint Just just controlled the game with his vision Applause Music Just a flatout dominant performance He has helped Louisville put up 90 plus 94 points so far in an ACC game for the first time since four years ago against Syracuse when Louisville was ranked 14th in the country at that time A lot different here tonight but theyve been explosive They lead Florida State by 10 with a buck 10 to go here at the Young Tom House in and out again scoring the offensive rebound and put back Eightpoint game Minute to go and Leonard Hamilton will take a timeout One of his two remaining Gives Louisville a chance to set up their press offense again I think they have to find a way to get Johnson the ball If not you got to allow him and Mike Jeans to take you home Spread the floor Give him room Music Florida State you got to try to create another turnover here And as they trail by eight and they face an allimportant final 60 seconds Lardi right now says they would not be in the tournament field Now theyve had two different seasons essentially Remember they were six and six They have lost to Lipkcom at home A game they trailed by 21 at the tuck Very different group since then Entering tonight have won eight of their last 11 But its a quad three game tonight because of the way this seasons gone for Louisville So even if to the eye test right now Florida State looks like an NCAA tournament team but says theyre outside looking in Well this loss will be devastating to the title hopes I mean they were starting to see light at the end of the tunnel They were crawling their way out of that early hold And though its a different team now the committee is not going to look at it and be dismissive toward their November and December season as still more work to do going forward And you see there they have four more part one opportunities remaining on their schedule but theyve missed a big opportunity tonight But credit to Louisville theyve been a better team all night long Lets see with it in the last minute they can close it out with Kenny Pay talked to his team at the end of shoot around today and he said Florida State cant afford to lose to you That was his message to his own team He did He did And trouble on the inbounds here and itll stay with Louisville Second and a half came off And I take that as this team came out relaxed This team came out today and I think the only thing if if Kenny Payne could have done differently was he probably would have started Johnson You know we made the assumption that he would start and we were kind of shocked against this pressure that he didnt Well lets have a look here as the officials go to the monitor and review the inbounds The call on the court was that its still Louisville ball and it does appear to be offshir Watkins Yeah but the last time you and I said that we were wrong So Im going to wait and see I do think its Youve really let that one go huh Yeah the old Boston College might have been two weeks ago say but still we we are very likely to believe that this one still belongs to Im going to jump right on the limb here and say I think its Louisvilles ball Okay it is confirm that Confirm that Okay Yeah Thank you Randolph Childress Some of your finest work 9486 Kenny Paynes cards up on the NLES They do add 810 of a second back to the clock as well Applause free throws the rest of the way Its been that way since it seems like on a Wednesday of this game Well thats the way Florida State plays and we joke about it but theyre going to have to shoot free throws and play a lengthy game against those guys And now they got 8 seconds to get the ball across half court Hundley Hatfield gets fouled Its on Taylor Bolt Bowen the freshman So it puts Huntley Hatfield at the line for two free throws this season 66 tonight Five of six in a night in which he has scored 28 points a careerhigh Lets be honest I mean were talking about Tyord Johnson how dominating hes been Honey Anfield has been equally as impressive Why did it work so well for him You said he dominated inside against Florida State when Florida State is the tallest team in the country Because when they switch he was punishing the guard They typically their their base defense theyre switching one through five He did a great job early as Tyler Johnson was attacking the bigs on the perimeter on the inside He was punishing the guards on the switches If they fronted him he walked them up the lane They threw it over the top for an easy basket If they stayed behind he just turned over and shot it Two headed split at the line and Spears scores And 509 seconds still to go Florida State has it down to seven Johnson gets tapped and fouled So Johnson will go to the line where hes eight of eight tonight and 83 this season I I think if you get just get Johnson the ball and provided he just doesnt miss start missing free throws they just cant guard him Its just quickness has been a major major factor His speed and overall speed is just something they couldnt do Now hes got to knock free throws down but Weve had 70 combined free throw attempts in this game Weve had 52 combined fouls as Johnson splits with 465 still to go and Louisvilles lead at eight Heres Spears around the corner screen to the basket and the foul and Hunley Hatfield is fouled out Wow And you said it a few minutes ago Louisville is trying to learn how to finish and win games and thats showing When youre when youre losing you find ways to lose and youre seeing why this Louisville team is six and 15 and 1 and five in the ACC play as you can read Kenny Pay lips there Hes telling them why would you do that at that point Just concede the layup and instead you give him a chance at an and one here and you just can absolutely not do that stay in front of the basketball which you did earlier And and as a big guy you dont want to get a hand ticky tack foul like that anyway reaching in and but when you struggle theyre riding the emotions feeding off this crowd here And its all part of learning how to win Its frustrating when youre in it and youre trying to figure it out And people forget how young this Louisville team really is Spears good to make it a threepoint play Now Florida States only down by five Trailed by as many as 15 This is the biggest possession of this game right here Williams gets fouled You got to get something out here Williams has to stop the bleeding here and knock these free throws down Applause Before tonight Curtis Williams the freshman from Detroit was seven of 12 on free throws Tonight hes three for three part of 15 points for the former top 100 recruit Applause He has matched a season high with 16 Cam Corin reenters Hey just one guys Now if youre Louisville you got to get your matchups You got to make sure you give up nothing easy And if youre Florida State look for Primo to get this outlet pass and get some type of ball screen from from Korn here Spears has he missed it Secured by James A trap James lost it but a foul is called Applause Music Fourth on Jamir Watkins with 257 remaining and Louisville starting to sniff the finish line Yeah theyre close now That that empty possession there may have done it for the Siminals here as Louisville has a chance to increase the lead to nine here with a pair of free throws from coming up from Mike James Good How do you think this feels for Kenny Payne for all that hes been through in just two seasons to have his team come out and put together a complete effort That feel pretty good tonight What it is it just shows you what you guys are capable of doing when you you did it against a very good Florida State team Watkins draws a foul 193 still to go Now that puts Zayn Payne in a difficult position here to be on the bench for as long as hes been on the bench and come in there in that situation and Watkins misses the first How about this for Florida States defense Last time Florida State allowed 95 plus to a team that had as bad a record as Louisville a winning percentage under 300 You got to go back to 2002 I mean its just unheard of for their defense to give up this much to a team that has been this poor all season Watkins splits Sevenpoint game 193 to go Turned over House cant finish Bowen left it short Chances galore for Florida State but they could not capitalize with Louisville leaving that door a jar for him That possession is indicative of this game Louisville turns it over and trying to keep Florida State in it And Florida State doesnt want it They just missed the layup after layup after layup And then finally Louisvilles like All right you dont want it Ill take it back Back porch door is open Walk right in Theyre not doing it 100 points for a team that last weekend in the first half against Virginia scored 13 Remember that Very different tune for the Cards tonight This team has scored over 30 points over his average and theyre going to get a standing ovation here in the Young Center and deservingly so Theyve been a better team than I Lets say this too for these players and this fan base Theyve gone through a lot this season and the last two years Kenny Payne has as well And its not going to rewrite history It might not rewrite the future either but tonight for this fan base for this team and this coaching staff you feel good on a human level Stay in the moment baby Enjoy it Its a Its a good win Youve played your tails off Get to go and celebrate this weekend and all youve done is just raised the bar to show how you want to finish the season Applause Music That also remind everyone that Louisville loves playing teams from the state of Florida Dont you think They took down Miami on the road and now trying to beat Florida State Again if youre just flipping around closing out for the night you miss this gem from Tylard Johnson 27 points five rebounds 11 assists And hows this for his company in the ACC Guys with 25 five and 10 in the league the last 25 years Theres only three other guys Listen to these names Ty Applebee of Wake Forest last year Dennis Smith Jr course of NC State and Grievous Vasquez in the Maryland days did it three times Wow Its great company to be in there They go to the 131 here Applause Down nine Watkins off target Batted around and secured by who else Tyler Johnson He was magical And Louisville wins for the second time in the ACC Hangs 101 on the seinals Wow
