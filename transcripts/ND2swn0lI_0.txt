able future thanks to an elbow injury suffered in the game Saturday at North Carolina we are underway the Mustangs have the basketball first in the hands of their newly Shor point guard bopy Miller if youre a fan of ACC basketball last year at wake Force this year with SMU bopy had a whole different look but he got rid of the hair just a couple of days ago inside SMU goes C yigu has the first two points of the ball game and thats a big time first possession for SMU pit wants to see how igu is going to come out and play the game and not going to send a double early and he certainly was a big focus of Coach Jeff capable and his staff during todays shoo around there is yigu with the defensive rebound and this is Chuck Harris the senior from Ashburn Virginia averaging over 12 points per game skip pass stolen away by Ish legett great recognition defensively from Music pit on the pick and roll Corin pulls up from the midrange transition defense for Pittsburgh another key coming into this game because SMU gets it and goes they lead the ACC and scoring per game at nearly 83 a night and thats one thing coach C harped to us and shoot around today he wanted to make sure these guys understood they have to get back for them to succeed and come out with a win today jayen low passes back out to Zach Austin low from just inside the top of the key has the Panthers on the board and thats a big time shot from low pit worked on this in in shoot around and pregame attacking that drop coverage that SMU is going to run all night he to every bit of seven fet two its going to be a long night for cam Corin at 610 235 to try and deal with that size Theo and cam can he cant go in there and just get a cheat foul like that just show your hands dont youre too important to your team to get a cheat foul like that right there hes already 7 foot see if he can make it box out and get the rebound 7 2 in 265 lb just a freshman from Istanbul Turkey and he is putting together a very good first year at SMU averaging nearly 11 points per game hes had some left shoulder issues missed some time and a 61 gets a friendly roll for his first point and he is all of 72 and the thing that differentiates him from most people his size not that there are many on the planet who are 7 foot2 Theo but hes got good hands and Good Feet hes really got a pretty high upside for sure he has very good coordination can run the Florida High level and has very good hands as you said before thats thats rare for a big and its a good luxury to have for a guard feel with this end how does pit best attack the SMU defense as weve got an offensive foul and its on cam corn he cant afford to pick up fouls on the offensive end his second and hes going to have to take a seat just 2 minutes and 5 Seconds in and thats exactly why I said the foul on this other end get on igot to underneath the backet dont reach there because now you have to go to the bench with two fouls and it just hurts your team and so an early entry into the game for Papa amadu kti who is actually the most physical player on this pit roster and we figured we would see some extended time out of him tonight Matt cross another one of the weapons for Andy enfields Mustangs and I know coach Kel is not happy about that he raved about Matt crosson shoot around today and just told him he will shoot the ball from anywhere and as you can see he can knock it in is legged not shy a little strong on the offensive glass the seven foot junr GE mod Diaz Graham he miss fires and Miller will dribble up Pittsburgh gets back defensively gatu bad pass to Harris saves it to cross get space and go to work step back three well short so again how does pit best attack this defense as low shoots over the top I guess you just get the ball to low and just let him shoot but what you want to do for pit is just keep attacking that drop coverage no youre not going to have someone there immediately but just make the right reads Jaylen Lows got all five Pittsburgh points to start coach capable has said that Jaylen really has put a lot of pressure on himself this year especially early on after bub Carrington went to the NBA and they lost a couple of their big players and hes just got to do what he does and thats just be a score and be aggressive I think that opens it up for everyone else on the team but Matt cross here getting to the shot dont let him set his feet cuz it is Cash Matt cross having a terrific year coming off a season High 21 points in Wednesdays win over Virginia Tech 8175 bopy Miller from distance it might just be one of them nice for SMU just get it up there to the rim and knock it in Music low gets into the lane back out to guo Diaz Graham whose twin brother Waits on the bench to come in Austin from the corner no but thats good offense from pit Baseline Drive Baseline Drift from Austin and G there and that was a good shot you can live with those pass deflected by Austin BJ Edwards tracks it down and attacks and the Nifty lefthanded layup Jason Cel one of the assistants for pit the younger brother of the head coach Jeff is trying to convince Tony Padilla the official nearest to that that that should have been a travel yeah it was Nifty cuz it was a travel not if they dont blow the whistle I guess so from way downtown Gio Diaz Graham and he has been shooting really well lately Theo yeah and thats just good offense just taking what the defense gives you and not forcing it but thats a big time shot from pit you got boopy Miller here desperation time had to get the shot up and going out here and just getting the bucket give me the ball get out the way shiing everyone loved him last year when he got him to the finals why not trust the mans process did you uh get in the Intel over the uh the trade anything that we dont know publicly no I got no Intel and if I did I wouldnt tell you be noal well one of the reasons he is here at Moody Coliseum tonight is that hes got a longstanding friendship with Pits head coach Jeff capable and actually pit has not been home in several days after playing Saturday in Chapel Hill Off the Bench as he does Caro o quendo instant offense for the Mustangs and thats just Elite ball movement from SMU they swung it around the horn everyone touched the ball and everyone feels rewarded and they got a three out of it rather than flying from North Carolina back to Pittsburgh and then down here to Dallas coach capable and his staff decided just to spend that night Saturday in Chapel Hill and then fly Sunday morning here to Big D yo Diaz Graham for three and so pit has been here they uh worked out Sunday at the Mavericks practice facility and then worked out here at Moody Coliseum yesterday before having their shoot around earlier today and again you sensed Theo a real sense of urgency out of this pit team earlier today 1000 the attention to detail and the the togetherness that I saw from pit was very impressive coming off a a tough loss this past weekend to M Alba Mar North Carolina smus got so many weapons around the perimeter Matt cross bees the three they lead the ACC at nearly 40 as a team from Beyond The Arc and as I said before I know coach cable is not happy he told them every time Matt cross catches ball there should be a high stick hand because he will shoot it from anywhere on the court now four of the five SMU starters have scored bopy Miller now has a pair of Threes And the lead is grown to double figures in the blank of an eye yeah Im thinking SMU is going to want me to commentate every game cuz every time Im here they make every threepointer be careful what you wish for because as soon as you call one of their games that they lose theyre going to say we dont want that Pinson guy around anymore thats true thats true dont take too much credit cuz then youll get all the blame is leot looking to go to work late in the shot clock good close out by cross but it doesnt deter legot from knocking down the shot that is a tough shot weve got some bucket makers in this game ish leet is a bucket Chuck Harris is a bucket jayen low bucket bucket this guy too o quendo a little strong from the corner leg it with the rebound and thats something pit fans have seen a lot of is Leed at 6 3 in tall is Pittsburghs leading rebounder and hes putting his name in the company of some of the Pittsburgh greats at only 6 three and being such a proficient rebounder as Harris deflects that out of bounds and this is just Elite basketball from SMU ball movement if you dont come out here with a stick hand on Matt cross he will shoot your face off and thats just not good enough that is too far away hand down man down cross is quite the weapon 67 senior from Beverly Massachusetts this is third stop in the ACC from Miami to Louisville then the last two years actually in the A10 at UMass whereas had been head coach Frank Martin said you need to move on for your final year of Eligibility and challenge yourself shot clock at two Cummings with a wild shot SMU has it back the other way o quendo looking to go end to end and he lays it in normally when he goes down the line lane with with the head of steam hes throwing it down yeah I honestly thought he was going to put that on his head but honestly thats a great drive from a quendo getting downhill creating havoc and I know Pittsburghs not happy with that transition defense he was telling me earlier today Oquendo said Ive been on Sports Center top 10 when I asked him seven or eight times with Dun dont turn that dial because Oquendo May wind up on Sports Center again tonight not on this one but hes got the potential aqu Music Applause Music quendo once you get in tournament you just want to play now we got 86 as a Carolina guy to get in the tournament I dont know where they see that but thank you well at the moment Joe lonardi who does a whole different thing he uses the numbers but he is not projecting what he thinks is going to happen down the road as cross takes it strong to the bucket doesnt get the roll had the rebound for a moment but weve got a foul on the floor thats going to go against Pittsburgh now Joe lonardi has Wake Forest as its last team in making it four ACC teams in at the moment both these teams are on the bubble SMU on the first four out Pittsburgh part of the next four out but in the net system which is so important Edwards fouled and cummings said I was just standing here but Cummings is going to get the foul this game tonight for SMU is a quad 2 game for Pittsburgh its a quad one opportunity and they have squandered most of their quad one opportunities this year theyve lost seven quad One games by six or fewer points so this is an opportunity that Pittsburgh cant afford to pass up here tonight 100 as you can see the the the connective attitude they had in shoot around showed that they know they have been in so many games and just came up short and they know tonight is another opportunity for them to get a quad one win and come out here and understand they control their Destiny and try to just build some momentum going into the postseason DJ Edwards the Junior from Knoxville Tennessee with a pair of free throws to build the lead to 12 the Diaz Graham TST are on the floor together Jorge is number 31 that is guo number 25 who set the ball screen for Jaylen low 11 minutes remaining here in the half low crosses over a much bigger Defender gets into the lane cummings and weve got a foul on the rebound I think my boy Cummings knew that was off he chased it as soon as he left his hand all right you played in the NBA for a number of years uh your guys Randolph childis and Corey Alexander say that under no uncertain terms do you ever Chase your own jump shot what do you think I think you just show lack of confidence in when he let go sometimes you just got to sit there and act like you think its going in and then if its off its just off but he took off as soon as that ball left his hand and that means you shouldnt have shot it in the first place but shouldnt you get yourself into rebounding position if youre the one who knows that you missed it go get it thats true thats true ooh thats a tough one thats a tough one look like he got ball first well Jerel Colbert and Keon Ambrose Hilton a couple of the reserve bigs into the Music game and that is on culbert number 20 you can see he reacted kind of the way Theo did that he wasnt so sure yeah I would have been talking to the ref for sure hey what we got going on here I bet they wish they had that challenge button so here is Jorge Diaz Graham coach capable said he can really be an exactor one of their key reserves Jeff capable in his seventh year former Duke Blue Devil 49 years old actually he turns 50 tomorrow Im willing to bet Jorge knew he didnt get fouled so the ball dont lie as my guy rashed Wallace used to say got to get those Tar Heels in come on Music now theres the soon to be 50 year old he told me by the way hes looking forward to uh joining the half century club like so many of us which for you is still decades away yeah yeah we got a little time for that Im going walk away from that conversation oh youll come back to it eventually I know foul on the post guo Diaz Graham battling with Colbert and so Papa amadu kti red shirt freshman from Sagal who was a medical red shirt last year comes back into the game V on guo Diaz Graham is first deu back in we got a lot of size in this game 1 and if I want everyone to pay attention SMU is taking a fight to pit and pit is not doing a terrible job but they need to match the energy a little bit more to to sustain and not let this game get away get away from him to finds the o man for the easy Slam by Keon Ambrose Hilton when you double team a big in the post the all Five Guys have to be connected because once two gets on the ball everyone has to be in position to cover up for their teammate Ambrose Hilton is one of those rare reserves who doesnt play a lot but hes one of the team captains so important to the Mustangs and there you see some of the intangibles number 22 brings every night yes and then with the way SMU is playing right now they show they send a double from the Baseline side but everyone has to be connected on the backside and cover up for their teammate and as you can see Leed wasnt on the same page and thats how you give up a easy two well for pit in this season that has gone sideways where theyve lost seven of their last nine still though have the hope to get into the tournament Jeff Capel and his staff say it it just winds up being little things good defense by Zach Austin but it looks like itll stay with the Mustangs its the little things its a missed assignment here its a badly timed turnover there and so what went from looking like they were fairly solidly in the field of 68 now theyre scrambling for their lives 100 and as you can see thats whats hurting them right now the little things upon the game is whats causing them to be more in this game as we speak smus taking the fight for them and pit just needs to dont put themselves in position to create live ball turnovers and give up offensive rebounds they need to do the little things to stay in this game cuz on the road you have to do those to come out with wins yeah their best win was the nonconference victory at Ohio State and they suffered that really bad quad three loss at home to Virginia pit turns it over and here comes SMU Edwards back to the left hand his second made field goal both now with his off hand quickly back the other way Jaylen low legot kicks it away another pit turnover taken right back by low and hes denied by Edwards a frenetic pace and once again those live ball turnovers thats is killing pit right now but SMU you got to give those guys credit they are playing elite elite defense right now and the crowd is recognizing it Harris working on Le it great hands pass deflected out of bounds by Jorge Diaz Graham and now Kevin bopy Miller one of the tri captains comes back into the game this is third stop after uh two years at Central Michigan in the MidAmerican Conference last year at Wake Forest and yes for the first time as an ACC player he doesnt have the long hair first time in years he said he went to uh a friend whos a barber in nearby mosquite the other day and just cut it off and bopy who has to fire with the shot clock down at one he says he actually feels faster now without all that hair I bet he do he had a lot of hair before that but I told him I said you better play well you just cut all that hair off the way SMU is covering up for their teammates iss at an elite elite level and they you can tell they understand the magnitude of this game tough shot by legot 296 just over 8 minutes to go in the first half for a team thats struggling like pit oh for a team thats struggling like pit you dont want this game to get away from you too early because you can start to doubt yourself you can start to look be like okay what do we do to get a win and you have to keep this game close to give yourself a chance at the end cam Corin back into the game for pit playing with those two fouls he set up his teammate Jorge Diaz Graham whos a 56 threepoint shooter so youre surprised when he misses shots like that pit on the takeaway low attacks and Miller takes it away back come the Mustangs Miller lives yatu misses on the slam Edwards Keon Ambrose Hilton for two timeout Pittsburgh SMU is playing at a fast active lets go ahead and take that is and that question mark of its Cooper flag the ACC player the play of the year he is the ACC player of the year is well I I agree with you I agree Reno leads the league in both scoring and rebounding and hes done that right along on a good Stanford team but I agree and to me Cooper flag is the national Player of the Year yes uh hes playing at a high level the pace and the the Savvy that guy has of playing at just a young age is Elite smart play by Boy what would you have done if in your Carolina Duke matchups you would have been assigned and you would have been assigned oh yeah to defend Cooper flag you just got to throw different looks at him pressure him here and there make him see if hell make a jump shot here and there but Cooper he he has a great Savvy for the game and its hard to guard guys like that he hes playing at a high high level but he didnt want to see me well Roy Williams had you on the perimeter against the other teams best offensive player every night so you absolutely would have been given up a couple inches for sure and a little bit of length but you would have taken on that challenge but coach cable knows he had I was guard Marvin Bagley when he was at dude I was the four I did a pretty good job I did a pretty good job we got two of those three games so no doubt he got me one game now Im going he did give me one game now coach cable of course went back to his alma mater graduated in 97 and after working for his father at Old Dominion and becoming a head coach for the first time at the age of 27 at VCU went to Oklahoma then after getting fired in Norman he went back to Durham and really did a nice job under Coach K before getting his third opportunity as a head coach at Pittsburgh out of bounds cross got the rebound but he didnt realize his foot was on the Baseline yeah this is a big 6 minutes and 37 seconds for pit right now just to give those guys a little bit of juice and some of belief going into halftime right now they look a little depleted trying to figure out okay what can we do to get back in this game and they need to make a somebody needs to get a pit of a spark right now well no matter how you slice the numbers so far SMU has been in control bench points they lead pit 9 to one the shot clock is under review and in the paint Pittsburgh has a a 12 nothing advantage over SMU and the number you say is the biggest one so far pit has turned it over seven times SMU has capitalized with 12 points off of those turnovers and thats the game right there uh coach cable talked about it early earli in shooter round you have to cut out live ball turnovers because SMU is already good enough in transition so just giving them live ball turnovers to go down there and be athletic and dunk on you and have a layup drill thats not going to help you win on the road and outside of jayen low whos averaging three turnovers game second most in the ACC pit as a team has not habitually had a turnover problem its just been game clock will be reset to 638 shot clock to 13 well there you go so no uh reset um its been the timely and the live ball turnovers that coach capable says have just really doomed them in so many of these close games and thats just something jaylens going to learn along the further and further he goes playing this game of basketball its not about how he plays its getting himself in certain situations that arent suitable for him like plays like that you cant make a skip pass in this in this league across Court without seeing it definitely being open and then he commits the foul at the other end trying to catch up with Miller our officials tonight by the way Lee Celia just heard from him Brian oconnell and Tony Padilla Music and so boopy Miller who has been clutch for SMU this year got a couple of game winners Music late well weve got three great womens games for you Thursday night here on acc Network at 6 Eastern its Miami and number 10 NC State then second ranked Notre Dame takes on pit and the night is capped off with Syracuse and Stanford at Maples Pavilion and every opportunity I get to watch Hannah Hidalgo and Olivia miles perhaps the best onew punch in the country for the Fighting Irish I do it and I advise everyone to do the same thing those two ladies can ball pit with a basketball down 3416 pit has looked uncomfortable all night on the offensive end leg it is swatted by yigu now that they go right into the big fella indeed they do and hes called for the offensive foul pushing in the back his Defender Zach Austin what a block by igu everyone for SMU is helping the helper and theyre doing it at Elite level on both ends of the floor but on this end you get to you dont have to push anybody youre 72 my guy just throw it up there catch it and go dunk it first foul on the big man from Turkey who will take a seat high fives all around on that SMU bench the Mustangs looking for their 19th win of the Year tonight and what would be their 10th in conference play they took the floor tonight a half game back a Wake Forest in fifth place in the ACC here mod Diaz Graham a little short just into the game fighting for it amsol delich Diaz Graham misses and brings it back out to low leg it step back three off the back iron long rebound Tracked Down by Colbert he hands to Miller and thats just not a good shot by Le sometimes you pass up a good one to take a tough one the low did the hard part by getting into the paint and pass it to the other end you have to knock down that shot as soon as you catch it another offensive foul by an SMU big this time its Colbert who was battling with delich and for Colbert the former LSU Tiger and Kansas State Wildcat its his second personal I would have caught a foul on both of them they were just fouling each other the Colbert will take a seat and Keon Ambrose Hilton returns much deeper bench for SMU than Pittsburgh has both are playing without parts of their rotation Johan tror is is still sidelined with a hip injury for SMU he sat out the Stanford game tried to play the other night at Virginia Tech couldnt play and that is Damen Dunn the Pittsburgh sixth year who may be done for the year Damen Dunn suffered an elbow injury in the loss Saturday to North Carolina and since theyve not been back to Pittsburgh he has not been reevaluated by the team doctor that will happen probably tomorrow when they get back to Pittsburgh and make it determination on how they will treat that elbow injury but theres a good chance he wont be back again this year thats a tough rough for pit at this point you need all systems go and you need all the guys you have that to that have helped build this thing for pit Harris still scoreless just thrw him out the way lobs it up Ambrose Hilton has it taken away by leet and P has to capitalize on these transition opportunities because its already hard enough for them in the half court offense to get good shots so if you could create live ball turnover in haveit Advantage you need to take advantage of Applause it low takes the dribble hand off puts up a wild shot ball batted around cross is just a superior rebounder able to get it now to Edwards and the flush ton Ambrose Hilton finishes the alyu elite giv go from SMU BJ with the nice pass crowd getting into it and Theo that SMU defense just making life so difficult for Pittsburgh the Panthers have scored just once in their last 14 possessions before that bucket and a foul by guo Diaz Graham and fmu once again causing Havoc for pit on the other end getting the transition BJ Edwards with the pass up top now great dunp great run great finish SMU up Music big they start by making a free throw here well gu mod Diaz Graham trying to complete the oldfashioned threepoint play and he does and hes been the one guy thats been playing well for pit well pit as it has done so much lately trying to come from behind Panthers have trailed at the half in eight of their last nine games and they are certainly going to be trailing at the half sh short of something crazy happening Edwards on the beautiful Roll by yiga and thats just great execution out of timeout play from SMU as you can see there theyre really locked in and understand the magnitude of this game and you can just see the difference the execution on both ends of the floor well people remember Andy Enfield when he was at Florida Golf coast and popularized dunk city as he took that little known school to the NCAA tournament hes got a little version of dunk City here in Dallas he really does I mean he got some Elite athletes on this team for SMU and they they do a good job at executing on both ends of the floor and as you can see they add a timeout play coach nfield he drew it up for a dunk well the former division three AllAmerican guard at Johns Hopkins University spent the last 11 years at USC the streak continues I think thats 19 games in a row that hes hit at least one three Mr Austin well Zack Austin might wind up being the second pit panther ever to lead his team in both threepointers made and block shots Moi did it three years ago and Zach Austin is on that same Pace shout out to my former te teammate Mo G SMU Theo with an 182 advantage in the paint well we knew that was going to be a problem coming into the game but also pit has not helped himself with live ball turnovers and just giving them layup thats two threes Mr three and d himself Austin with consecutive threes its back to a 15point game first two points for the senior from Winston Salem North Carolina and you have to wonder how much energy low legged in Austin have left in in them being on the road not being at home at their own beds just coming out here trying to compete at a high level and playing the whole distance of the first half Harris the only Mustang in the starting lineup yet to score until then Doug he said dont worry about him I got it well Im sure that the former Gonzaga College High School star in Washington DC would give up his own scoring for his team to be up close to 20 points every time 100 and thats the beauty of the team right now we talked about Chuck Harris coming out to start the game and the whole team has come to the party and theyre all contributing to this big lead they have right now and they just have to keep it up five on the shot clock Harris steps out to defend low again the SMU defense making life tough on the Pittsburgh offense and this is just good great out of timeout play from SM you got a quick slip to the basket no one on the back side for the weak side tag and igu literally just lifting his arm up and dunking the ball and then you got my boy Chuck Harris Doug said he aint made a shot Im going show you Doug right on Q happens every time you know if he had enough threepoint attempts he would be leading the ACC in percentage he would be ahead of Chase Hunter of Clemson so its no surprise when he makes a shot like that Harris is 46 coming in Austin says dont forget about me and a foul on the rebound after Austin missed what would have been his third straight from Beyond the AR and this where it gets tough you got SMU and the bonus just adding free points at the B on the other end so I love the way pit competing on the offensive boys and just still going out there and doing everything they can to get back into this game and Pittsburghs being very careful with the minutes for cam Corin hes got the three fouls this is a homecoming game for Corin grew up 25 minutes north of here in Allen Texas but facing this man number 24 in white soat yigu will get a lot of people in foul trouble 100 and thats why you cant reach early and try to get a steal on a sevenfooter and thats a cheap foul right there from Matt 94 ft from the basket yeah cross with the reach in got a piece of GMO Diaz Graham and so that is the first foul on the senior from Beverly Music Massachusetts and I know coach infield is Music pissed now he brought pretty much his whole staff with him from USC the Trojans for the last 11 years their highlight was reaching the Elite 8 in 2021 made it to five NCAA tournaments and they produced an awful lot of NBA players I got a lengthy list lengthy list shout out to my man Evan Mobley coach Mobley over there son got to the AllStar Game talked to him earlier said he definitely is going to be there for his sons first Allstar rightfully so deserved it and and hes been playing at an Allstar level all year and Cleveland has a really really good basketball Music team another cheap foul for my guy Austin Matt cross back at the line first well Matt cross says the best moment in his basketball career happened at the Garden in Boston of course hes a Massachusetts kid and in the state semifinals he hit the gamewinning threepointer to beat the buzzer for St Marys High School hes done some really nice things in college but that one still stands out for him yeah man we got to get you some more memories my boy Im sure big memory for him would be making the tournament and this is a great step for SMU to come out here and get this win against pit if they can hold on he misses both free throws leot who averages 57 boards again Soares for another one final 32 seconds of the Music half Ambrose Hilton on the switch defending low fouled against Harris the helps side Defender and SMU is doing something very interesting as soon as a guard clears out the guard is staying in the paint because they know theyre trying to drive right behind them and theyre just staying there and clogging up the paint and making low make those reads in very tight spaces and its been coming in handy hes been turning the ball over so far but that right there if Chuck just go straight up I think they make a better play and Theo the defense knows that loow is going to go left hand almost every time yeah and they invited him to go left that time because they knew they had to help behind him and they knew their teammate was going to cover up for him well jayen low is the godson of 1976 number one overall pick John Lucas the AllAmerican out of Maryland who played 14 years in the NBA low is from a basketball family lot of connections in and around Houston this also a homecoming game of sorts for him first time back in the Lone Star State in his two years with the Panthers 100 its a big time possession here for pit if they can go into half time with a stop to be a good momentum for him 7 Seconds 6 seconds travel back out to cross block Austin can he get the shot off he does Banks it in the call on the floor is that its good and they will review it so not only do they get the stop youre talking about Theo though they might get two points out of it and thats huge just knowing that they needed a spark coming out now youre going into the halftime just like okay lets build Music off lets see what we got here great recognition recognizing every oh thats awful yeah its a great play from Austin great recognition understand time and score know making a great play great block on mat cross and coming down nice little touch yeah he says Im more than just a threepoint shooter yeah great momentum from pit going into halftime but they still have a big hill to climb down 14 4329 our score now lets get you back to the studio Justin line for the NCA tournament how do you turn this thing around in the second half first five minutes first five minutes need to be the best minutes You played all season you need to come out here and set the tone and show upm you this will be a fight these last 20 minutes of this game off the pick and pop low finds the open man guo Diaz Graham low gets it and then has it taken away Edwards on the floor Miller cant quite get there and its Corin who picks up the basketball and finds the wide open jayen low for three and that is a great great start from pit right there you have two great shots one from the Twin Miss shot you cant get discouraged by it but they get active on the ball and on the floor and get an open shot Sho come on man which twin is it you got to tell me I they look alike they do when they dont have their uniforms on I cant tell them apart but that was guo cuz his brother comes off the bench yeah thats my boy guo I know the feeling when youre trying to identify him Corin coughs it up Edwards finds two Defenders and it doesnt matter passes through it to find the big man s met yiga hlu for the dunk and once again live ball turn you cant have them but BJs making great big time plays down there on the offensive in and eatu is getting rewarded for running the floor well BJ is one of the big theft uh thieves with the thefts 23 steals per game but he is a valuable piece on both ends for these Mustangs Edwards couldnt save Music it well we talked about desperation off the top both these teams are desperate as by this replay and both teams very active they all understand these last 20 minutes can determine their season and theyre getting after it as you can see pit won this fight right here with the big time three from low and thats what the Panthers are going to need to do create their own breakes get those 5050 balls start making shots and play better defense yeah pit really has to just muck this game up a little bit they have to bring this fight to to SMU and just get it a little nasty low crosses cross doesnt get the roll yigu on the defensive glass Here Comes poopy Music Miller shoot that one going against Corin whos playing with three fouls yigu with no second Defender just muscles his way to the basket and thats a big time play I think pit might have to turn to go on the Elite double just bring the double already you know hes going to expect it but at the end of the to day you need to get two on the ball and try to just create rotation create Music steals off the Austin Music Miss Kio o quendo coming to the game for SMU one of the better sixth men in the ACC Callin for the ball as yigu goes through two Defenders cross is fouled tell you what Matt cross only 67 but he is an excellent rebounder only Maxim Reno Ian shefflin and Eddie lamin average more rebounds per game than that guy and thats the hardest part right there with with pit doubling with both bigs it makes it hard on the backside for these little guards to box out guys like Matt cross whos an animal on the boards and thats in spite of the fact that he tweaked his back in the season opener way back in early November against Charlton State and his continued to need to manage it but he has been such a big part in his one and only year here at SMU and hes shooting the ball at a high high level which makes SMU a lot more dangerous with a guy who can rebound and shoot the ball from deep it gives them a lot of open space for these guys like Chuck Harris and boy Miller to get down here couple and also BJ excuse me couple of free throws from Cross make it an 8 nothing SMU start Music three minutes into the second half jayen low makes his way into the paint drops it for Austin went strong to the rim and yigu fouled him thats quick jumping from Austin to get up that high off a late pass from low great cut out the out this corner and get into the free throw line well you know Jeff Cable says in his seven years at Pittsburgh Austin is the best athlete hes had so hes not just a threepoint shooter yeah I mean you could tell by that from the last play of the first half with a block coming down and we thought was a good floater my man Lee said it was not Im still up for debate on that one yeah Lee Cassel one of the officials came and saw the look on your face and came over and said I know what that face is for and he explained that the officials look at the red around the backboard and that is what determined why the shot was disallowed based on the shot clock there can be delays in a time but with the red that goes on around the glass backboard that is their determinant in that case Yu showing off that footwork that has the Intrigue of NBA Scouts 1000 and hes doing a great job you got you got Nico Harrison in here looking like hold on we need a big fella right now can we give him a 10day Nico Harrison the general manager much in battle these days of the Dallas Mavericks in the arena tonight hes a friend of Pittsburgh head coach Jeff Capel is leot nice bucket I think Le got fouled right there theres Nico when you saw him before the game did he say anything about the heat that hes taken uh since trading away Luca for sure I mean you know the first thing you think about is everyone is probably family just making sure everyones safe and want to do the right thing making sure theyre good and thats the thats the sad part about this thing at the end of the day this is a game uh you make a business decision you want to do whats best for the team he didnt do it to make everyone mad he did it to literally just try to make his team better but SMU up big Music check out a basketball game and uh you know when you look at these two rosters setet yigu seems to be the top NBA prospect on either roster right now 100 I mean hes showing what he has offensively that is a foul nonetheless Leed able to score but also Austin is showing a lot of Promise defensively making a lot of block shots and being active on the defense end of the court and but as we speak blck shot well I do think Austin has a shot I mean at his size with his athletic ability and he can shoot the basketball he might be able to find a spot as a three and D guy I mean he went disrespectful on this you did not have to block that with two hands he should have just grabbed it he should get two blocks for that he blocked it with his left hand and then his right hand Hey listen if hes looking at the score he should have grabbed the Laughter ball now look at that post entry from migu Cross missed the shot but thats your 72 freshman feeding a perfect pocket pass off the bouns and you can tell hes given a big a better feel for the game of basketball at this level as the year has gone on and its just only helping them and people hes only a freshman yeah having a big second half offensively eight of his 14 points have come since the break to help SMU expand this lead low dump it off Corin the hometown boy with the flu and thats a great time great drive from low drawing and dumping it off to the big fella and rewarding him offensive foul bopy Miller takes a look at the official Tony Padilla as though hes not so sure and you see jayen low holding his head and pit cannot afford to have him go out the game that is bopy Millers third personal foul previous play is on a review well from where were sitting and Im a little shorter than you are Theo weve got uh fans between us and where that Collision happened so Im not exactly sure what happened between Miller and low yeah I didnt I missed it and actually those are the President Bush seats that are filled by other folks that are just to hour left hey look at see like a lot of money over there o got him right in the chops I think hes just trying to check if he got all his teeth you know whats crazy if boy still had his hair and might not have hit that hurt that bad thats true thats crazy Ill be mad I bet boy you had to cut your hair today how about that that is some great thats the best Insight Ive heard so far tonight Theo come on man I need a Laughter raise now good to see jayen up and walking back to the Pittsburgh bench and hopefully like you said hes got all his teeth with him calling the four stands stands of what common foul oh no flagrance gotcha gotcha they refute oh I guess contact the head contact to the Head yep got to review it so bopy no worse for wear but he does pick up his third personal I guess head buttons not a flagrant I guess you can hear but people these days well it certainly was not intentional it was a basketball play yeah that was not that was not a just an accidental yeah its not a fager foul looks like Jaylen cracking a smile there thats a good sign y so the Freshman Brandon Cummings from Midland Pennsylvania back into the game for Pittsburgh this is Cummings attacking from the right side Corin on the offensive glass and I love the energy pits playing with right now its not showing in the score but theyre playing really hard been a tough night offensively for ish leot left that one short after a nice move and now Miller has big contact with Cummings who winds up on the floor Cummings got there a little bit late and will be called for the foul youll remember Brandons older brother played his fifth year of Eligibility at Pittsburgh a couple of years ago Nelly averaged 11 per game really good with the basketball and his younger brother Brandon followed his Music footsteps great pass iGo had it poked Away by Corin heres Cummings with cross to beat did a nice job to find the trailer and Corin has his second consecutive slam great run great turn great active hands from pit and thats how theyre going to get back in the game turnovers get in transition and make plays Im willing to say Cummings did not know who he was passing the ball to but it went to the right person he still gets the assist still get the Music assist bad pass cross couldnt get there bopy says you should have been going towards the corner but hell pick up the turnover for Andy enfields Club looking for their 19th win of the Year trying to improve to 10 and three in the ACC that would move them into a tie for fourth place with Wake Forest and on that play boys absolutely right when hes driving at you you need to move to space you cant just stand diagonally across from him so you got to give him a little room to get downhill well the roster construction by Andy Enfield and his staff excellent they have a lot of pieces that fit and theyve got a lot of older guys who have been there and done that Austin misses everything I mean SMU has four 1000 Point scores and Harris Endo Miller and cross and they seem to fit Theo yeah I mean every time Ive seen SMU play they have played at a high level and its not just one guy you dont know who can have a good night every single night and thats a tail tale of a really good basketball team what a play smus turned it over for their last five times offense worked a little better that time as Harris Cashes in I mean he was by him s skip pass to a wideopen Le it Edwards hustles down the rebound quickly up ahead to Endo Pittsburgh transition defense a big thing in this matchup SMU goes from end to end as quick as anybody in the ACC and this is this is a make a Miss League at this point pit is making missing shots and Mustangs are making them pay for giving up open shots good to see low back in you saw him just check his teeth yeah got to check them Cummings picked up his third foul leot goes out Cummings stays in with those three personals Harris off the curl Cummings trying to stay with Music him big assignment oh the veteran going against the freshman and cummings stands his ground went to the post on him Applause Music low great hesitation coming from the head of the key for three thats big time basketball from low coming back into the game after getting his head knocked into and passing up a good shot for a great shot and thats just good basketball from just over8 minutes gone in the second half here at Moody Coliseum Dallas hes Theo Pinson on Doug Sherman they missed that one Chuck definitely touched that ball last be careful the late head coach of the Mustangs big possession here coming out the timeout Cummings on the takeaway Edwards in Pursuit couldnt get the chase down block and the Freshman with Five Points here in the second half and this is how you get back in the game like I said create turnovers easy buckets on the other end of the floor now you gave putting a little game pressure on SMU to make plays on this end of the floor yeah dont look now but its a 13point game plenty of time on the clock okendo left alone cant go under the screen when endos teeing it up and thats just a big time shot from a quendo slowing down the run that pits having right now and just getting everything back settled for those SMU Mustangs he is instant off Off the Bench for SMU he started the first five games of the year but Andy Enfield really likes having that potency coming off the bench and Endo can fill it up averaging about 10 points per game yeah and it looks like that with those guys who bringing up the pressure you can tell they got a little excited there and its a little cheap foul Music from and there is endo former George Bulldog he told me his favorite dunk was one he had for Georgia over Santiago vesia Tennessee had made Sports Center top 10 plays hes a regular on Sports Center top 10 there he is grabbing the rebound and a great athlete who can shoot it again quite a weapon for Andy Enfield here is Music Oquendo trying to clear out for for yigo lets see what pit trying to dunk it and the foul comes but you can just see the physicality I mean G mod Diaz Graham is a sevenfooter who has no chance in terms of thickness and strength when trying to keep yigu from the basket but also pit has to do a better job you know the you know the doubles coming from the top side you cant let him spin Baseline if you know your help is coming from the strong side but but great move by Yu quick spin off the big and going in with aggressiveness and trying to dunk it so third foul on GMO Diaz Graham and yigao with the two NBA general managers flanking the court watching him hes been good tonight in a lot of different ways Hey listen Im telling you right now he saw Nico in the building and saw they needed some bigs so hes like let me go ahead perform and see if I can give me a 10day coach might not have that but again Nico Harrison the GM of the Mavericks sitting behind the SMU bench and on the opposite side of the Court Mike Dunley Jr the general manager of the Golden State Warriors watching this Bubblicious game these two teams desperate for a win to stay in the hunt for a spot in the field of 68 Leed with a little onehanded push shot hes into double figures Music great pass Harris wide open off the feed from Miller offensive rebound Keon Ambrose Hilton one of those Tri captains and hes tied up the possession arrow will stay with SMU I heard somebody talk about this the other day about the jump ball I do agree I think they should jump for this instead of it being an arrow yeah I I think that would be more entertaining I think I think the arrow is you sound like one of us older guys I like that Theo come on man lets suspend this game a little bit 30 second shot clock way too long yes way too long Ill go with 24 yeah theres the second Defender immediately doesnt matter yigu is just bigger and better than those trying to defend him yeah he he he literally does not care whos guarding Im going to shoot it on two next time they going to send three lets see if he shoots it then 17 points8 rebounds for the big man from Turkey dve and Dish Cummings alone again and hes got his second threepointer of the second half he can heat up in a hurry he put 30 on Eastern Kentucky back in December it looks like he trying to go for 30 again Big Time shot from Cummings keeping his team into the game Ambrose Hilton over the left shoulder no yigu through the contact just playing catch with his teammate Ambrose Hilton is fouled and hell go to the line OT Tulu he has been a force on both ends of the floor offensive rebounds and if you look on the other end when guys are driving to the basket theyre not even looking at The Rim when hes down there theyre looking to kick the ball out for open threes so hes controlling the paint on both ends of the floor fourth foul on cam Corin well in talking to Andy Enfield about his big freshman c yigu a couple of weeks ago I asked him whats his upside and without batting an eyelash said NBA 100 he has the footwork he has the hands he has the height to go to that next level and play and be very effective um hes impressed me both times Ive seen him play but hey look Pittsburgh is only 15 points right now you have to win these next three minutes to get going into the 5minute mark and try to get this to a single digit game and put a little game pressure on well p gotten little offense here in the second half from Brandon Cummings hes got the basketball now all eight of his points have come since the Applause break the Diaz Graham twins are both on the floor together heres Austin cant leave him open long rebound Tracked Down by guo Diaz Graham but great adjustment from SMU throwing a different look at pit right now they havent shown Zone all day today and right now they giving it showing it to them and theyre having to trouble adjusting to it well in ACC competition the twins have been combined for 45 from the threepoint line theyve not been able to match that so far tonight GMO finds his twin Jorge brings it back out to Cummings under eight minutes to go Cummings has it knocked out of bounds by Harris good hands by Jeff Cel the former Duke Blue Devils point guard makes a nice play and we head to break with under 8 minutes to play Music get another quad one win here tonight Theo what do they need to do they need to do things like this they need to pass up good shots for great shots you have low here getting Baseline passing a shot that he could have shot and made but getting downhill creating rotations and finally had two opes here you had Austin in the corner but fine Cummings up top for open three knocks it in they have to do more of that for them to get back in this game and theyve been here multiple times before so well see if they can come out on top on this one well Jaylen low had a big Collision headtohead with bofy Miller earlier in the second half got checked out came back into the game but he did not play much and has spent the last few minutes at the end of the Pittsburgh bench talking to one of the trainers but he got the worst of that headtohead Collision the top of bopy Millers head inadvertently into the mouth of jayen low here is bopy Miller defended by Ish legett and just to finish with that pit resume those two nonconference wins have staying power I mean Ohio state is still top 30 in the net West Virginia is 39 in the net of course thats a big rivalry game a nonconference game these days in the Backyard Brawl so they have good things on the resume but theyve got a not just limp to the Finish Line theyve got to run through the Finish Line in these final three and a half weeks not just run Sprint all out Sprint and the thing is is like you have the opportunity here to capitalize at on the road and try to get a win right now its not looking too good but they have put themselves in position to come out and have a chance to get into the tournament they have to see what they can do in the next 7 minutes 21 seconds Matt cross with a one and one after Pittsburgh committed at seventh oh foul of the second Music half down 16 Cummings defended by Miller and its tough a pit right now you got two of your best guards out right now with low taking a little head injury and being out and now youre trying to figure out whos next whos going to step up and make these plays Forge Diaz Graham its an airball and a shot clock violation yeah the other pit player theyre missing Damen Dunn was playing some of his best basketball last time out Saturday at North Carolina when he suffered what could be a season ending elbow injury so you lose him and low your two best point guards its going to be a real struggle if they cant play both of them here in the final 640 and thats what makes it tough when you got two guys that are ahead of the snake and the guys that control the tempo for you on both end the floor it makes it tough off the air ball from Edwards and yiga down and in Kane back in midcourt as play continues Austin lobs to the rim and then the whistle comes after the layup by guo Diaz Graham yig yigu has put up his third double double of the season 17 points 10 rebounds and to me Theo I what Ive liked most is they check out that right ankle or foot was his pass see what happens on the replay here got tripped up looks like with bopy Miller inadvertently theyre helping him up lets see how much weight he can put onto that right foot reading his lips says he says to the official Brian oconnell it hurts and indeed as he limps off but I was saying you know the numbers are great 17 points 10 rebounds the uh the best thing hes done to me Theo to show his versatility was his postentry pass through traffic a perfect pocket pass off the bounce to show his feel for the game and thats thats big time when you show Savvy and show that youre a plugandplay guy that you could play multiple ways on the basketball court it shows your value it shows different ways that guys can put you into the game and youre just not onedimensional as you can see the NBA is turned into guys that can do more than one thing the other night the Dallas Mavericks were playing sabonis with a 65 guard wow cuz they didnt have a choice you have to figure out a way how many ways can you play and I think that just helps him in that way that he can be a guy that initiate the offense and make passes and stuff like that my boy boopy tripped him up Friendly Fire little high five with Coach Mosley running back up floor after Kio Oquendo buried another three its back to a 17point game trying to get a little AllStar juice cross with a takeaway and the slam that back look all right right now it does 7even nothing burst for the ponies Applause smus pressure has been very elite all night theyve just caused a lot of havoc and as you can see another live by turn live ball turnover going end to end bofy Miller as SMU has done all night long turning live ball Pittsburgh time and time again got a look on the bench at CET yigu who went out with what looked like foot or an ankle injury probably wont see him again over the final 5 minutes as the Mustangs have put this one in their Hip Pocket blocking foul against o quendo and so Corin draws the foul just the fourth against SMU here in the second half yeah I thought that was a charge he might have just felt sorry for pit they wouldnt do that the officials dont feel that way first foul on Music Endo everybody confused whats going on you and I fit right in everybody like what Music happened Corin trying to carve out space was fed by Colbert and I think that was one of the biggest things Corin going out early with those early two fouls really hurt pit early no doubt thats foul number four on big number 20 for SMU 610 235 J from Houston played his freshman year at LSU played in just four games and then the last couple of years at Kansas State fouls all of a sudden piling up for the Mustangs third foul on this possession now 16 fouls here in the second half and number two on Matt cross its a tall order but thats one way you can get back in the game is get in the bonus and slow this game down and because the clock is not their friend right now under five minutes to go SMU took a double digit lead early in this one and they have really not been Music threatened Pittsburgh playing without Jaylen low after he collided heads with bopy Miller and playing without Damen Dunn with his elbow injury suffered Saturday at North Carolina Cummings and Miller have an official get between them theres Damen Dunn SMU student section making some noise I like it from the little fres showing a little toughness well you cant show any back down right I mean especially when youre a freshman and youre not the biggest guy out there you got to stick your nose in there for sure and stick up for your team tell them we going we going to play the whole 20 40 minutes fourth foul on guo Diaz Graham and so o quendo who his coach said earlier today hes our sixth starter he actually says he has grown to like coming off the bench I think hed still prefer starting but he truly does analyze the game before he gets the call and sometimes he comes in 90 seconds in but he says he gets a better feel because hes paying attention to what his team his teammates and the other team is doing and he says hes better for it and that can be very beneficial if you got a guy who can accept that role and understand you have a sort of an advantage to see how teams playing you can see how what coverag is theyre in and what how you can come into the game and Spark your team to improve the lead or help them by providing a spark Corin with the bucket 7554 just over four minutes to play here at Moody Music Coliseum Oh I thought they were going for that l Music Edwards pass knocked Away by GMO Diaz Graham Pittsburgh basketball Cummings finds the open man and it is bman G mod Diaz Graham hes got a nice offensive night going gamos play hard he play well shot the ball at a high clip hes the one one pit player thats playing pretty well tonight Music those three gotten back by o quendo who low fives three young fans sitting Courtside on his way back up so he makes a shot on the other side and high fives one of his assistant coaches on this side he does the same with some of the fans Im going to be completely honest I think a quendo really is enjoying coming off the bench because he is playing at a high high level shooting the ball with at a high level and enjoying the game shout out to the young fellas over Music Applause there and then this is the this is the way you want it you control your destiny you taking care of business tonight with a big win against pit as you as they should win tonight and then you got a game on Saturday against wake fors that you want to take care of and got a big date with uh Clemson coming up soon Brandon Cummings having a nice second half for pit coach cels team like they have all too often during this stretch of losing seven out of nine getting in a big hole and trying to claw their way out its tough its tough in this lead because you go through these stretches where if you dont come out with one or two of these Road WIS it can become a long long road trip and you kind of just want to get home and have a little reset and again pit did not go home after the game on Saturday they stayed in Chapel Hill for a night and then flew Sunday straight here to Dallas Im sure they will be happy to get back to the Steel City although the flight will be a little longer coming off a game like this for Coach Cables crew 100 but as if youre a pit fan if youre a pit coach and staff and players you just want to get back home reset I understand theres a lot of basketball still left and at this point you probably have to make a Deep Run in the ACC tournament but to do that you need to have these lexs how many many games are left and just going to the tournament on a high note and understand you want to build some momentum yo Diaz Graham has filed Music out and so he is replaced by his twin brother Jorge and Pittsburghs next game will be Saturday at home against Miami then a week from tonight they welcome Syracuse in so certainly a couple of winnable games games they will be favored in to try and get right and Pittsburghs already beaten Syracuse this year up at the dome last month but again we dont know the status of Jaylen low going forward there you see theyve got the canes Saturday on ESPN 2 and Coach Capel having already lost Damen Dunn for at least the foreseeable future that is not going to be an easy stretch e either no but its a good stretch to try to get your team back right build a little confidence going into the ACC tournament but at the end of the day in March 1st you got to play against Louisville at Louisville thats going to be a tough matchup but at the end of the day you got to continue to compete well in the first part of our double header tonight on the ACC Network Miami beat Syracuse down in Coral Gables 9184 Matthew Cleveland continues to put up numbers 32 points for a Miami team thats trying to figure out a way to earn their way into the NCAA tournament field of 15 how you feel about that Syracuse game uh not great how do you feel about Saturdays Carolina Pittsburgh game oh actually you guys won that one imagine yeah come on now you tried to give me back didnt work Buddy oh Ill have plenty of occasions going forward Hey listen Im going take that that was a win for us what they say a win is a win a win is a win onepoint win over this Pittsburgh team hes Theo Pinson the former tarel Im Doug Sherman Syracuse graduate so thats what were talking about here bopy Miller still on the floor hes just a blur he is faster without the long hair yeah I mean he looks good out there boopy keep the hair off if he heard you hes not looking your way uhoh now cam Corin a minute going nose to nose with Jerel Colbert they are separated thats a Houston guy against the Dallas guy going nose to nose yeah that that thats not a thats not friendly banter right there thats smoke and both of them wanted both smoke and it clearly didnt start right there this is a continuation of something earlier and thats just frustration on both sides Music ones like Im from Dallas play Under review ones like Im from Dallas well Im from Houston so whats up so since youre a transplant here in Dallas do you share those same feelings about people from down the road in Houston my come on youre from Carolina you dont care about that no no I cant even act like it n not really give it time yeah that dont got nothing to do with Music me now if we talk about Carolina and Duke yeah yeah yeah for sure Music well we got a couple of dookies in the building including the Pittsburgh head coach Jeff Capel and Mike Dunley Jr the general manager of the Golden State Warriors in town with the Warriors who play the Mavericks tomorrow night as Brian oconnell on the left and Lee Cassel on the right in the middle of your screen review the dust up what you think what we get two flagrants or just text youre the expert you tell Music me Music uh I say we just give him text I dont think anything happened did anybody throw a blow oh I think uh I think Cobra headbutted him so I think he going to get a flagrant one or get tossed all right Im going to go flag Im going go to tossed hes tossed hes gone you need this one man I need this one Music so lets hear what Lee Cassell has to say after further review we have a white 20 with a common foul followed by double technical fouls on white 20 and blue two those will offset one and one for pit come on Lee oh my Music gosh so Jerel Colbert has filed out with the common foul and the technical double TCH on as you heard both Colbert and Corin and so at the line amsol delich for the people at home I didnt get a good replay on my screen over here so dont dont dont count uhhuh dont dont count dont count that against my record uhhuh the rookie throwing the veterans in the control room under the bus I like it theyll get you back trust me delich gets the shooters roll despite having made only three of nine from the line this year pretty good shot there 8163 final 90 seconds we get our first look at a couple of the bench players AJ George number 10 for SMU and delich getting some late run Im kind of confused why Chuck and bopy are still in the game to bet gorner is the other Mustang weve not seen this is him beating the threepoint or beating the uh 30 second shot clock with a threepointer yeah makes you wonder both he and Chuck Harris still out there and we got uh Austin is still in the game I mean at this point they might as well play the rest coming steep back I think his foot was on the line was that was a long two about 9second difference between the clocks Miller into the lane thats a nice find I didnt see AJ George lurking along the Baseline but clearly bopy did he was find a way to get him in the stat sheet he wanted that bucket bad the Junior from Fresno with his first two Music points and Pittsburgh will dribble it out and will suffer a onesided loss here in Big D SMU threw the first punch the second punch and Pittsburgh never got off the canvas yeah it was a dominating fashion from SMU the whole night they started it from the jump great defensive pressure and they came out here and got the W they understood
