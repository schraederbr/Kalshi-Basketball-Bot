Florida state in the road black and we are underway the first Saturday in March here in the ACC and its Florida state that starts with the ball yeah Georgia Tech comes out in manto man a key for Georgia Tech defending Florida State paint touches keep them out of the paint easier said than done when you have all that length to defend Georgia Tech take a look at their starting five you mentioned Miles Kelly but two freshman Nathan George and by Dongo have been key contributors they turned it over ball back to Florida State dared green lines up the three but cant connect thing will track throughout this game watch Florida State they will switch uh everything one through five they make it very difficult for you to run your offense deflections uh because of their length and athleticism key for Georgia Tech take care of the ball heres dong go has the size advantage on warley turn around and he opens the Applause scoring what a first year he is having thats a beautiful jump Hook by Dango were a little surprised to see Darren Green Jr in the starting lineup for Florida State he walked into the arena in a boot hurt his ankle in the second half of the NC State game but hes on the court to start this game and its an early 4 nothing lead for the yellow jackets both uh difficult shots over the defense uh for a Georgia attch AR re again right here this is a tough Runner going Baseline up over the length that is soft touch right there big time finish L cam Corin at the line for Florida State sophomore from Allen Applause Texas a Florida State team that has plenty to play for Malcolm they can win out and still earn the number four seed in the ACC tournament that would earn them a critical double by if they lose out they could also be playing day one and really again so important here on the road a lot in terms of uh implications into standings and we already saw what Georgia Tech has done uh in this building some really big wins heres Miles Kelly threepoint threat squeezes it to Dongo in a double team and he draws the foul theres Leonard Hamilton in his 22nd season as the head coach of Florida State what an impressive program he has built in Tallahassee Hall of Fame coach were going to get into it uh later in the broadcast of what hes been able to do and the number that he is chasing if he is going to get another win but a really remarkable job that hes done at Florida State great ball movement open three cant connect Nathan George the offensive rebound Second Chance opportunity for Georgia Tech here crosscourt pass finds Reeves quick trigger nothing but the bottom of the net well you cant ask for a better start if youre Damon dmire again off of excellent ball movement theyre getting some high percentage shots right back to Corin hes got all four points for the seminal to start this contest and thats a nice nice pass that time by Miller little high low action another soft jump Applause hook Kelly off the window and in Kelly well hes a guy Kelly that tested the NBA draft process last year and hes a guy that is a high volume scorer one of the better scorers in the ACC and we talked about the game he had on the road at Miami 25 points and made Seven threes was the Catalyst for sure in that road win Baba Miller missfires from Deep first year head coach damid STM has to be happy with how his team is opened up here at home trying to follow up that Miami win get something going here headed in to ACC tournament time yeah in well traveled and we showed some of the key wins hes had and certainly a lot of optimism and cause for excitement if youre a Georgia Tech fan STM has done an outstanding job year Music one Dongo in attack mode down the lane lays it up and in showing off the versatility and again that is a tough move and what makes him really difficult matchup that time a big putting the ball on the ground finishing with the left warley into traffic misses the layup good defense by Georgia Tech and the yellow jackets Give It Away Watkins right to the rim on hand Jam jir Watkins plus the foul were not even five minutes into the game sports center my goodness on Dango and one and again thats what you have to be aware of anytime you play Florida state theyre going to be in the passing lanes that time you secure a defensive rebound you try to make a long Outlet pass and Watkins with the interception my goodness they better check the rim and Watkins has been the leading scorer and rebounder for the seminal this season biggest right spot for Florida State no doubt about Applause it and he cant complete the threepoint play Georgia Tech has started this game shooting red hot they are five of six from the floor in the first four minutes Georgia Tech early on in this game theyre trying to get the ball into the paint get guys posted that time Florida state did a nice job forcing a deep contested Applause three Watkins once again draws the foul both of these teams with a hot start Georgia Tech the fivepoint lead but its jir Watkins with a rim rocker defense into offense weve got a fun one in Atlanta is KFCs new cheza Pizza all time for most ACC regular season wins tying the great Gary Williams at Maryland and when we talked with him before the game we told him this he had no idea uh and thats uh just uh what you would expect from uh coach Leonard Hamilton humble always giving credit to other but remarkable what hes been able to do the numbers hes put up Hall of Fame no doubt in my mind think about that compan Coach K Dean Smith Roy Williams and soon to be Leonard Hamilton number four remarkable it really is and again where this program started when he took it over to where it is now obviously the WIS uh the guys playing at the next level for a paycheck but I think the biggest thing is the lives that hes impacted I think thats going to be his Mark the young men that hes uh guided the time that hes been there really has been remarkable Primo Spears at three rattles in and out and Leonard Hamilton told us that he goes when youre a young coach youre thinking wheres the program with the most resources where its going to be the easiest to win and recruit to he said God had a different plan for me wanted to choose a program where he could be the impact and he has certainly done that throughout his career all three stops Oklahoma State Miami and now here Florida State he took over programs where the cupboard was Bare floater in the lane rolls in Primo Spears catches that and its a one possession game and here comes the pressure when we spoke with the coaching staff of Georgia Tech this morning this was the concern again Florida States a pressure how they handled it again theyre switching and then how aggressive they are in the passing Lanes the first meeting between these two teams earlier in the season in Tallahassee Florida state held Georgia Tech to a season low 19 points in the first half so its encouraging they already have 13 in about 5 and 12 minutes so doing way better in the second meeting on the offensive end Second Chance opportunities youre absolutely right and thats been a deficit though in the problem for Florida State in ACC games theyre a minus four into rebounding department so again with all that length the one thing they do lack though is that 7f footer that provides that Rim protection and also rebounding B Bowen p P up pop Miss fires offensive rebound Watkins and he shoved from behind both teams doing a great job attacking the offensive glass right there Kelly trying to Bo him out again just great work on the offensive glass Chandler Jackson into the game the sophomore point guard off to Primo Spears and now cam Corin nobody picked him up missed the jumper Georgia Tech in a matchup Zone its been disrupted so far 6 and 12 minutes gone by lob passing to Claude kick to the Corner ripped away by Jackson up ahead cam Corin hammers it home in transition and thats what you have to avoid live ball turnovers that was key number one when we spoke with Damon STM keep Florida State out of transition and particular off the live ball turnovers again just know guys are going to come with their length easy throw ahead and finish the cam waren has six of the seminal 10 to start this game talk about steals in the ACC this is nothing new Florida States been doing this under Leonard Hamilton for a long time yeah and theyre just so disruptive how you want to run your offense mainly because they have guys that can switch really one through four one through five at times and its just really disruptive to your offense so again taking care of the ball back cuts and ball fak key anytime you play against them think about that stat we just showed you Florida state has more steals in the last 14 games when Georgia Tech has on the season I mean it jumps out at you again they do it in such a unique way and again their personnel allows them to be able to switch and actually right now Georgia Tech going back into their a manto man it looks like actually theyre still in that matchup Zone some confusion for Florida State the last few possessions Spears pull up pop cant Applause Music connect back door open for Dongo he runs right through it and slams it home and thats whats there thats what Im talking about back for cuts and ball ball fakes you know theyre going to be aggressive in the passing Lanes use of the ball fake and then back Cuts will soften up that defense otherwise they going to get those uncontested dunks or layups Watkins right down the lane a tough two for jir Watkins he is so tough thats great body control by Watkins hes got great upper body strength and this right here again beautiful back door set up and then Dango with the Finish thats a Big Time play against a very aggressive defense and for as well as Georgia Techs playing offensively shooting 70 they do have five turnovers cant let those pile up against Florida State they will make you pay Watkins off his leg so Georgia Tech wins the ball back but Florida State uh got the ball to the mdle middle of the zone and then right here again this is just great Hands by Kelly and yeah easy call for the ref to make right in front of it this has been though the problem area again breaking the Applause Music pressure Kelly in attack mode the floater doesnt drop knocked out of bounds itll stay Georgia Tech ball Yellow Jackets leading by five shooting 65 from the floor good start for the home team jackets ball first Saturday in March were here at the ACC Florida State trailing Georgia Tech 17 to2 look at the first meeting back on January 3rd Georgia Tech had a season low 19 points the entire half theyve already managed 17 points in 8 minutes yeah progress you can see it and theyve been playing well again theyre coming off a roadwi uh at Miami where they had 22 assists in that game and I think thats uh anytime you take over a program thats what you want to see your team get better as you get into March what do you think the biggest key for Georgia Tech offensively is I think uh Miles Kelly I think he is kind of The X Factor for them when hes scoring the ball the way he did on the road at Miami theyre a very dangerous team made Seven threes in that game and I think it opened it up for a lot of other guys to get some easy opportunities heres Baba Miller been quiet today attacks the rack cant finish though you cant ask for a better opportunity again hes got two feet in the paint just missed the little turnaround jumper but again if youre coach Hamilton you got to be happy with how your big establish the position just unable to finish 10 seconds to shoot sturd aent from Deep left it Applause short thats a turnover violation Leonard Hamilton not happy with that you know the one thing he told us malcol before the game is we have been consistently inconsistent yeah a and thats I I think a summary of a lot of teams uh within this league I think its more to the depth of the league how good these teams are and certainly we talked about a Georgia Tech anybody capable of beating anybody on any given night now Georgia Tech no doubt is the best example of that wins against North Carolina Duke and Clemson arguably the three best teams in this league and theyve beat them all count it plus the foul Debo Coleman through traffic this is a tough finish of through contact right here and one and thats great concentration and body control eyes on the rim the previous play is currently under presented by of the theyre going to go take a look at it now again from our original angle really didnt look like uh there was any wild swing of the elbow or anything like that again yeah I cant see it from that angle right there looks like he probably got hit into the chin with his shoulder but again I think thats just the guy trying to turn his uh back to the Baseline to fend off the defender but I think its the key thing is it a basketball play so again yeah hes just again I think thats just accidental contact hes a guy trying to go into his shooting motion and Im not sure theres much there other than incidental contact thats certainly a basketball play as hes just trying to defend the basketball from being Music swiped youre exactly right Haw and they uphold the call so common foul and Coleman will get an opportunity to complete the end one and I think the key thing on those plays if you see a guy not making a basketball move where an arm comes up a shoulder or a head just flops back where hes trying to either deceive the ref or really use Force thats really again youre taught you go Baseline uh you Shield the ball with your shoulder Coleman leaves it short what does Florida State need to do to get more of a rhythm offensively well I think they need to figure out how theyre attacking Georgia Tech back and manto man but theyve been settling for a lot of jump shots they need more of this right here paint touches cam Corin has been the goto guy today he has eight of the seals 14 and that was the key for Georgia Tech can they keep Florida State out of transition live ball turnovers and an El limit the paint touches Coleman another tough take and gets it to go backto back buckets for Debo Coleman and Coach Hamilton were right in front of him turned around and smiled thats not bad defense thats a off balance Runner Im not even sure he was looking at the basket on on that last play Watkins shoves off Kelly no call Green lines up the three and buries it he is the one guy you have to be aware of if youre Georgia Tech you turn your head for a second he definitely is going to make you pay excellent offense by Florida State rejected at The Rim Corin got a piece of it and then Watkins draws the Applause foul number 11 and the key thing about this block keeps it in play a lot of times you see guys swap that out of bounds blocks it keeps The Possession for his team thats a big time defensive play by Corin gorins been great on both sides of the ball in this first half been a real Catalyst for a Florida State team that has needed one throughout this Applause season green backto back threes Darren Green Jr and thats a set play right there again The Bigs have to be uh in communication with the guards and wings anytime they run that action you need to get Applause help well your college basketball Saturday just getting started here in Atlanta over on ESPN some great games NC State against number nine North Carolina at four Virginia and Duke at six so two terrific games in the ACC and then your Saturday Prime game in the SEC Tennessee and Alabama Florida State getting very aggressive defensively they are dialed in a couple of blocks Jamie lucky wants to review this for a goal T yeah I think so by rule we just got word theyre going to call it Go tending but then theyre going to review it and again Im not sure that ball was coming down lets take a look right here yeah I think that might be a clean block again I dont think that was coming down now from that angle right there it looks like its a pretty clean block but theyre going to review it and when there is a official timeout obviously as weve talked about some of these close games uh that Georgia Tech has been in obviously come to second half those two points could mean a Applause lot Watkins going right into to Kelly finds Miller extra pass to warley good ball movement on this possession green drills it again Darren Green Jr with his third three and 90 seconds offensive rebound Reeves follows his own Miss and finishes warley right to the rim and these two teams trading punches Oh What A Move by warley again body control through contact thats a tough Applause finish all tied to 25 we have a fun one here in Atlanta look at the pressure of that Florida state is putting Applause on Corner three Kelly cans it Miles Kelly fires Georgia Tech back in front and thats a back breaker if your Florida State they have them deep in the shot clock and Kelly Bells them out again if youre Florida State thats a breakdown Miller into the paint follows his own Miss with a man jam and thats why theres so much excitement about the potential that he possesses thats a a sevenfooter right there guy with that type of length playing like a guard just 19 years old Miller through 10 not much to separate Huck a lot at stake uh again we spoke with Coach Hamilton before this game obviously coaches its simple for them uh just win uh but again there is a lot at stake there still is a little bit of a big loog jam between these teams and certainly can impact uh whos playing or who has a double bu when you get into the ACC tournament and Florida State hoping that they can win out in the regular season this final week and claim that fourth seed which would earn the double bu it all starts with a win on the road here in Atlanta against Georgia Tech hard to believe its already March final week of the ACC regular season Reeves spins his way free and hits it Ive been impressed with Reeves his midrange thats twice now in this game uh hes raised up over the Florida state length and finished with soft touch Florida state has made six of their last seven including Darren Green who hit three threes in a minute 20 during that span warley he cant Applause connect watch how Florida State they switch out on anything ball screens the pin Downs theyre going to switch offensive rebound Claude through three seminal somehow comes up with the rebound and draws the foul SE foul J wat right here again on the offensive glass and again thats been the one problem area of for Florida State throughout the ACC a conference play you look at the rebounding numbers again theyre a minus four in the rebounding department and theyre giving up a lot of offensive rebounds now a lot of that is a setup because again Personnel wise uh but also some of the switching gets them out of position Music substitutions Georgia Tech has used defensive glass productively today 10c chance points of this first half still more than 6 minutes left in Applause it lob to Corin leads Florida State at scoring go right back to him and he finishes at The Rim plus the foul cam Corin he has been really good in this first half really love his patience and how Florida state has entered the ball into the post to him right here set a side screen and then roll him to the basket thats tough right there not an easy catch and finish he made that look easy and thats soft touch of for corn who youre right has been outstanding in the first half for Florida State cant convert the and one but his 10 points leads all scorers in this first half the blow by everything but the Finish Dongo almost had a seventh offensive rebound couldnt control it so its Flor to State Music Applause ball there really has not been much to separate these two teams a very even first half swatted at The Rim goase Reeves read it the whole way defense to offense thats how you do it to far gari showing off the Euro Step that was tough knifing through the defense and then the finger Applause roll step back three Watkins Way Off the Applause Mark Georgia Tech playing with a good tempo right now CIA three cant connect thats a nice block out by Primo Spears good look for B Bowen and he hits it the Freshman from Vermont makes it a onepoint game transition offense that time off the miss and a nice setup that time by Spears deflected ball Florida State looking for the lead B Bowen draws the Applause foul some impact minutes off the bench for Taylor B Bowen well bow has been really good defensively offensively the previous play knocking down a three and then you know in transition thats what Florida state does off the turnover Bowen in ACC games averaging close to four points per game and an aid skier J yeah he shared that with you I was surprised 61 I dont know if thats made for skiing but well Ill tell you what getting off that ski lift Ill tell you you better move out of the way you dont want a 610 guy barreling down baring down but Georgia Tech count it plus the foul by Dongo on a rack attack oh we got a couple of that might be going down to sports center right here Dango with the finish my goodness and really would you miss out on that yes the slam was tough but the pass on point O Dango had to do catch and go up and finish with authority thats excellent transition offense the sanal sensation how good has B Dango been during his freshman campaign completes the threepoint play and of all the dunks weve seen in this first half and you said weve got a highlight reel full of them that might be the best of the bunch pull up pop Spears cant connect offensive rebound green swatted away right back to Dango why not kick to the corner George cant connect thats a pretty clean look and nice pass that time out of the double by Dango blin right down the lane draws the foul hell be at the line shooting too when we come back but take another look by Dongo one of the top freshman in the here in Atlanta on the season you wonder if damid sire will get the opportunity to pick his brain because what he did at Georgia Tech Bobby kremens and in his tenure put together a remarkable run that just you wasnt one or two good teams they had sustained success under kerem I mean from Kenny Anderson Travis best I think back going back to Mark Price one of my alltime favorite Cs and yeah when you think of Georgia Tech basketball uh you definitely think of Bobby kremens and again what he built here what he was able to do and The Talented players that he had come through here mhm just the list can go on and on on and Applause on this has been a fun back and forth game lots of scoring 349 remaining in the first half Georgia tack a onepoint lead do you get the sense H that its just going to come down to who can start stringing together stops points off of turnovers you look at right now Florida State uh theyve extended their pressure sometimes theyre giving them different looks where theyre going straight man now theyre got a 221 pressure again key for Georgia Tech to close out this first half handling the pressure and length of Florida State almost another highlight real dunk weve had a bunch of them in this first Applause half Watkins attacking George 10 seconds to shoot Spears down the lane off off the window and in in Florida State back in front its their first lead of the game and what a look off by Spears that time drove looked like he was going to kick it to the wing and then lays it up himself George the immediate Applause answer thats one of the few clean looks that Georgia Tech has had great answer that time by Georgia Tech and Applause George Corin going to Dongo leaves it for Baba Miller who rocks the rim onehanded the interior passing and Baba Miller with the length my goodness what a pass and finish George gets free Reeves Corner three cant connect green usually automatic if you leave him alone and just ball slipped out of his hands as he trying to attempt the three and this right here take a look at the interior passing again Im not sure if he was trying to pass that or the ball got knocked out of his hand but Miller out of nowhere with the reverse slam and you can see the strategy again thats a been here again theyre going to pressure you Florida State and theyre going to try to force contested jumpers and get out transition two minutes remaining of this first half all tied at 39 heres sturdivan and its stolen away Applause again Spears all the way to the rim points off turnovers the name of the game and and Ive been so impressed with Spears his ability to knife through the lane the problem is though Florida state is late back in transition defense and Georgia Tech now has made them pay twice after Applause scoring now this first half has had a fun Pace to it both teams scoring with ease green misses it that time thats a break for Georgia Tech green should not be allowed to come off that clean simple pend down no communication again great ball movement George attack in a really nice flow offensively well they figur it out when theyve gotten into the halfcourt sets theyre getting some back door cuts and showing off some good interior Applause passing time out Leonard Hamilton his team trailing by three and but has been a highscoring first half 45 seconds left in it ACC yeah its been a great Pace uh both teams uh showing a high level of execution in the half court and transition right now Florida State trying to close the half out Spears pull up pop cant hit it its a pretty clean look again high ball screen came off pretty good look for Spears just unable to convert Applause 5 Seconds separating the shot clock to the game clock here at the end of the first half swatted at The Rim by Miller two seconds to work with for Georgia Tech and theres that length of Florida State again theyve been getting those slips of the screen a nice offense but again guys are recovering Music Georgia Tech takes a time out trying to draw something up with two seconds to work with you dont have much time and the thing about playing against Florida State they switch everything one through five so its going to have to be some type of catch and shoot uh but any back screen or side screen of the person that sets the screen is probably going to be the person thats open because again Florida States going to switch and not allow any clean looks come off for a jump shot its the Freshman Nathan George the inbounder in all six F 11 in of Baba Miller jumping in front of him George gets it in got a good look but Ta on Claude comes up short and thats a shot clock violation five and a half seconds to work with for Florida State now youre absolutely right not a bad look right now again Georgia Tech the key thing is do not fou a shooter 55 seconds left nry youd think in an Ideal World youd want to get the ball to Darren Green Jr who has unlimited range into Primo Spears pulls up cant hit it and Georgia Tech takes a three point lead into halftime a back and forth game a fort Georgia Tech they got to do a better job on the defense of glass warley almost intercepted that ball to start the second half both of these teams looking to put together their best basketball of the Season at the right time first Saturday in March 10 days away from the ACC tournament tipping on off in DC theyve both shown flashes throughout the season but want to put together that consistent play now that March has arrived yeah Florida State manto man theyre going to switch everything Dongo a perfect four for four from the floor in the first half stuffed on that one Baba Miller dialed in defensively Corner three green open hell usually make you pay from there missed it that Applause time thats a break youre absolutely right green wide open right down the lane everything but the Applause finish both teams getting quality looks in the opening minute of this second half just cant Applause connect Baba Miller aggressive take it rolls around but does not drop feels like theres a lid on both rims both guys balls rolling in and out off of finger rolls close a range well after all the scoring we saw in the first half surprised to see these not dropping another missed layup Corin he cant cash in finally jir Watkins puts it home yeah great work on the offensive glass and ke thing is in transition again thats what Florida state has been doing in this game in that first half push the pace Reeves right through his hands and thats the 10th turnover of the game for Georgia Tech both of these teams Malcolm playing at a fast pace thats why we had a lot of scoring in the first half does it favor one team more than the other I think its Florida State again in particular off the live ball turnovers thats going to be key Georgia Tech though they did a good job being opportunistic when there was imbalance on the other end in transition green lines up the three he thought he was fouled it was way off the mark Reeves right down the lane put way too much on the layup but there to clean up the spill by Dongo in perfect position and thats the 12 Second Chance point for Georgia t lob into Dongo a whistle blows the play dead right here again guys coming over to help the guards dont step down and block out put a body on Dango and he cleans it up on the offensive glass and again A lot of times that happens because youll have a switch with Florida State and some of the Guard yards and wings are Switched Off onto a big so again theres going to be some opportunities for offensive rebounds arguably the biggest bright spot for Georgia Tech under first year head coach Damon STM has been by Dongo Kelly Trapped in the corner wiggles out and draws the foul thats a second against Music Watkins and youre absolutely right Dongo and also George are two big bright spots for Georgia Tech first year players for Coach uh Damon stanmire and certainly a key building block as they continue to push this program Reeves treding to spin his way free lost his footing thats a travel again the spin move is here now if hes able to keep his footing lets see yeah he might have been able to go right into a nice little pullup jumper or dump it off but lost his footing turnovers continue to pile up thats now 11 against the yellow jackets but they lead by three three minutes into this second Applause half Baba Miller for three missed it tapped around this will be Georgia Tech ball good blocking out here comes the change the defense again now Florida State going to extend of their Music pressure Kelly lines up the three his Music fires well they both uh have gone staled offensively if youre Georgia Tech you got to try to get more swings of the ball that time really quick early into shot clock contested three Miss dunk there by warley for as good as these teams were in the first half theyre two of 15 from the floor to start the second half Char number 11 by d Thats dangos third foul sends Baba Miller to the lineer line right here two bigs right on Miller yeah I think again across the body and face Miller at the free throw line he has not shot it well in AC C play 56 from the free throw line he has provided the rent protection for this four to State team leaves them ACC play with 19 blocks incredible length that he has this this has been a close competitive game throughout Georgia Tech a twopoint lead the turnovers are the one spot that Damon STM has to be frustrated Music with and these two teams just combining for two of 17 from the floor in the second half after a red hot over Florida State malam hotab be J alter with you tipping off what is the final regular season week in the AC DC Yellow Jackets a concern for them is in the second half the defense has slipped in some conference games this season in the first meeting with Florida State 64 they allowed the seminal to score from the field so far so good Florida State just 1 for nine you the second half so far yeah and it was a focus this morning they were early a shoot around noon tip they were in here 800 and uh in the morning and that was something that the coaching staff was going over full focus in particular in the second half like you said thus far uh its been a pretty good defensive effort thats an early wakeup time on a Saturday I had my coffee ready to roll and damid statamire was out here a full workout gear uh getting into his stance I told him my knees were hurting just watching them get out there and demonstrate some of the defensive slides and rotations that they were going over but you and Stam played one another in college played in the Maui semifinals he was Arizona and a really good backourt but Im not as in good a shape as he is right now blockid cant get it to go Dongo there again he has done it all for Georgia Tech not just today but all season long by Dongo s event shook free but couldnt finish it yeah pretty clean look by stent again knifing through the defense just unable to make the short jumper and both teams struggling from the Music floor Stan transition three and the senior buries it and thats where Georgia Tech has hurt of Florida State in transition surprisingly again Florida State at times has been slow to get back in transition Georgia Tech has taken advantage of that Miller around the screen weaves in too much didnt have the Right Touch Florida state has gone ice cold that rattled in and out no good offensive rebound stays with the yellow Applause jackets foul on the floor take another look at dist stur of in transition three yeah right here again theyre late to get back nobody communicating again A lot of times youll see teams work on this scramble situation at transition nobody picked up the ball and sturd just walked right into a three again that cannot happen if youre Florida State guys need to communicate and certainly need to pick up the person with the basketball the seminal have gone four minutes without a basket just one point on their last seven trips down the court their defense trying to keep them in it trailing by five and I think a big reason for that Georgia Tech has not turned the ball over theyve kept them out of transition and limited to live ball Applause turnovers battle for the ball Jaylen gainy comes away with it and now heres Primo Spears kick out wide open three B bow and cant connect and a foul underneath against gainy gives the ball back to George attch you cant ask for a more wide openen look a beautiful find by Spears and bowan was wide open on the corner again thats not a bad look in transition Music Applause Reeves lobs it inside Claude kick to the corner good look missed it another offensive rebound Georgia Tech really attacking the glass that is now 11 offensive rebounds for this yellow jacket team very aggressive yeah they really are again trying to block out here and theres four guys for Florida State stand around I think the big thing though again some of these mismatches are created because of the switching but again in that situation you got to put a body on him Claude did a good job fighting around for position that rims out no good for Music Claude and its a sixpoint lead for Georgia Tech back the floor from the the largest lead theyve had is seven theyve used 11 offensive rebounds to pile up 13 Second Chance points thats been the difference in this game and tough to do against a tall Florida State Applause team if youre Florida State you got to try to get something going to the basket see if you can get a paint touch off the Applause bounce foul called number 14 and thats what you need if youre Florida State again youve been struggling uh shooting the ball from the floor a nice drive that time by B bowan well a terrific day of college basketball continues over on ESPN for Eastern Time NC State taking on number nine North Carolina then Virginia and Duke to follow and our Sonic Blockbuster in the SEC Tennessee and Alabama a monster triple header over on ESPN Florida State getting two points from the foul line but they have not made a field goal in more than five minutes minutes Seal have missed their last eight shots now during that spell theyve gotten three free Music throws yet only trailing by four stur it trying to make it seven and he does nothing but the bottom of the net for Kyle stent well surprised that some of the the quality looks that Georgia Tech has gotten again rarely thats not a staple for uh Florida State they want to contest and theres the drought ended right there their first bucket in a long time and nearly six minutes without a made basket before Chandler Jackson finally took the lid off only down two possessions sixpoint lead for Georgia Tech KY kept it alive just enough Coleman pull up pop left it short another offensive rebound for the yellow jackets thats now 12 today Coleman is Applause fouled 7 those foul charg number 33 jayen and weve seen Coleman make these cuts a couple of times in the second second half a nice use of making back Cuts again coming up like youre going to receive a pass and then going back door for as close and competitive as this game has been throughout its really Georgia Tech that has just been ahead for most of this game in fact Florida state has only taken the lead once today when it was 3736 other than that its been tied or Georgia Tech has been in front for first year head coach Damon Stam its about finishing these second half leads theyve LED in a lot of games with ACC play in the second half and theyve let it slip and thats again uh I think a couple things obviously youth uh first year a lot of young players out there and its something again its been problematic at times for this Georgia Tech Team and right now again theyre going to change up their defense lets give a little a 34 qut pressure lets see what they drop back into looks like theyre going to drop back into a matchup Zone Spears hits it much needed I love his midrange game thats a beautiful pullup by Primo Spears Georgia Tech fortunate that they didnt turn that over there big for Florida state is when they can finally make a basket they could set their defensive pressure cerent and it drops Kyle stur count it plus the foul go gecko but hes my best friend I G him back in grade school While others PL house he protected it hey slow down Geico helps find the right coverage for your car and H youre not my dad from Cars to home to pets its easy to GEICO well it is senior day here in the camage Pavilion and Kyle sturdivan

attack and today hes hit some tough floaters through contact and this free throw ties Georgia Techs largest lead for the game and they are dialed in defensively in this second half Florida State just shooting three of 15 from the floor and the matchup Zone has been problematic if youre Florida State try to get it to that fou line area and go from there warley cant Applause connect Georgia Tech in the driver seat 11 11 minutes left to go looking for their first time getting backto back WID since December Kelly on the drive doesnt drop another offensive rebound Stripped Away stay Georgia Tech ball wat and green J 14 offensive rebounds now for for Georgia Tech War State substitution number 11 biller and very rare will you see a team able to go five in five out and thats exactly though of what just happened for Florida State stent the hot hand Way Off the Mark there and thats all set up uh by Miller again his length and wing Applause span of the contest by Baba Miller impacted that play again sturd ofan almost with a steal right here Watkins almost just like he took his eye off him and almost a near turnover at half court again going up against this matchup Zone if youre Florida State again now they go back into their man Spears step back three no good hell stay with Florida State underneath their own hoop this lineup right here in particular Georgia Tech going back to man if youre Florida State get paint touches off the bounce or try to get Corin or Miller Applause posted Spears trying to spin his way in Corin there to clean up the spill cam Corin up to 12 points tonight to lead the seminal under 10 minutes remaining in Applause Music regulation foul off the ball Dongo and Miller Tangled Up Florida State the fouls have piled up thats already eight in this second half so Georgia teching the bonus the rest of the way yeah and thats huge right here lets see what he got him for both guys fighting for position again both guys doing a lot of jocking for position on that right there Dongo a double double today 12 points 10 rebounds so far and a lot of game left so impressive how he has operated does so much for this Georgia Tech team has provided a true low post presence and then also providing great run protection for Georgia Applause p Applause Music Florida State just shooting 20 in this second half its allowed Georgia Tech to grab control a sevenpoint lead at home Corin into the paint muscles it no finish KY transition three no good another offensive rebound finds George got it Second Chance opportunities right now that has been the difference in this game 17 Second Chance points for Georgia Tech and they now team trailing by 10 this is the largest lead of the afternoon for either team Georgia Tech has done a really nice job defensively in this second half grabbing control of the the game yeah a couple things uh the defense in particular when theyve gone to that zone and then uh on the offensive Applause glass out of the Leonard Hamilton called timeout Baba Miller count it plus the foul and the sophomore from Spain is fired up and thats why uh a lot of NBA execs have their eye on him this is a guy thats got a 72 wingspan handling like a guard thats a tough finish through contact and again his versatility is what makes him special uh he can guard really one through five can handle like a guard and you see the soft touch right there again so much talent with that length and athleticism and very important as Miller completes the threepoint play by Dango thats his fourth foul so he comes out of the game for Damon stto hes been Georgia Techs best player today 13 points to go along with with 11 rebounds and I think thats the key uh Miss with not having him out there hes done a great job Dango on both defensive ends on the glass ripped away but green couldnt come up with it stays with Georgia Tech 5 Seconds to shoot shot clock did not reset Reeves fading away too much on it falls to Primo Spears trying to go defense into offense here for Florida State Corin called for the offensive foul lowered his shoulder thats going to get called every time yeah he showed that one really well and not sure theres much of an argument yeah again he just I think because he got the arm out again lets see from this angle right here whether or not its a flop or good call yeah again theres a lot of contact now he sold it well dont get me wrong but there definitely was a lot of cont contact and I think because he got the shoulder up Claude nobody picked him up right to the rim for Applause Music Applause two Watkins hes yet to get going today tangled up and hell have two at the line when we come back now this is the danger zone for Leonard Hamilton in Florida State trailing by nine on the road 745 remaining trying to get up another notable win under first year head coach Damon satom that big win against Duke and then of course number three North Carolina on the road against a good cemon team and theyll have a lot of opportunity this off season to look back at their first year and theyll look at those wins as really the Cornerstone of whats to come here in Atlanta talented young players weve talked about it SP Dango uh Nate George but I think the staff I think thats huge uh Damon stymy put together an excellent staff Carl Hobs longtime head coach and assistant coach well respected and then bonsi Wells those guys also have done a great job developing some of that young talent and again any great program you take a look at Florida State or their staff the great St danan Jones has been a longtime assistant with the Hall of Famer coach Leonard Hamilton uh but make no mistake about it STM put together an AllStar staff big reason why theyre having some success early on yeah that staff has resulted in some big wins and statamire would be the first to tell you it just hasnt been consistent enough an opportunity to get a second straight win for the first time since December they went on the road and beat Miami last Saturday off in the midweek and now a sevenpoint lead against a good Florida State team that would be a big boost for this staff and this young team not only going into the ACC tournament but just going into next season as well look at what youve done in some big games and Wells and also STM looked like they can still ball a little bit as well Music too deep three svent nothing but the bottom of the the senior delivers on senior day well Florida State overh helping again dribble drives its contained but the Applause overhelmed the height Advantage goes right into stan8 Ines he has on the senior and again uh off of the dribble Drive Baseline and again really not much need need to help right there it started to give some love to his Godfather and head coach but a love tap so an eightpoint lead for Georgia Tech stent with a team High 15 one thing to watch for the yellow jackets is they are in foul trouble by dong go and kaasi Reeves each with four fouls so one more and they will foul out of this game the good news for Georgia Tekk Florida state has all sorts of foul problems as well so theyre in the double bonus for the remainder of this game and I think thats key right there as Florida State trying to get back into this game being in the bonus Georgia Tech obviously clock and then also can still be aggressive trying to get yourself to the free throw line biller theyve been playing through him and he turns it over cour violation Music and Miller and kapar really have been going at it the refs are going to maybe have to potentially separate these two theyve been talking all way up uh the court again it started on the previous play and the refs are talking to both right now and originally Im not sure the ref saw it and right now theyre going to try to clean this thing up Jamie lucky talking to the bench of Georgia Tech Leonard Hamilton trying to get a message into his team as well trailing by 10 the clock becoming a factor time ticking away on really is a mustwin for Florida State if you want any chance of that top four seeding in the ACC tournament they had to win out in the regular season Georgia Tech takes a timeout what would be the key for seminal come back down the stretch here well again theyre going to have to force uh obviously uh some Miss shots thats the captain obvious right there I think the big thing uh for them is containing dribble drives and then dont overh help theyve given Georgia Tech some open threes you want to contest obviously Georgia Techs going to run some clock uh but you cant give up the open looks that theyve had in particular stent whether its in transition or off of dribble drives on the other end I think its a Personnel then warley not really a threepoint shooter more of a Defender so now youre going to have to start driving get some paint touches still plenty of time but those two things are going to have to happen for Florida State contested shots and then theyre going to have to be better on the defensive glass now Florida state has not made a three in this second half 0 for five and Darren Green Jr who you see there hes really the only deep threat that Florida state has who shoots it from three with any sort of consistency and Georgia Tech has totally shut him down in the second half yeah uh Florida States number 25 from the threepoint line uh they made four four of 16 for 25 on the other side Georgia Tech has made eight threes 8 of 22 uh for 37 and not sure what theyre checking right now now weve been told that theyre just making sure that there was nothing flagrant between Miller and kapari yeah I think there was maybe a shove some words exchanged but I dont think any elbows or punches were thrown no not even close to that now they definitely were jarring uh going up and down of the court but again I think its more just a and Jamie lucky telling us play on just a good old discussion walking up the court right there between the two its been a physical game both teams have gotten after it on both ends and things starting to get a little heated as we get a deeper into this second half now Florida state knows how important this game is is to them an opportunity to try and work their way up the ACC standings ball inbounded off the foot Florida State ball down by 10 Damon STM are not happy at all after that long layoff certainly that that is not what they wanted the last thing you want to do in that situation turn it Applause over Applause great defense by Georgia Tech they are dialed in Florida State just six of 23 in this second Music half kapari passes off to three rejected Falls to George and a foul on the ensuing rebound committed by taon claw CLA if youre looking for Texas Oklahoma state that game is starting on the ESPN app and well get it to the Big 12 as soon as were done here in the ACC cant believe it is the final week of the regular season first Saturday in March best time of the year HW it is Marchers here and they might as well rename it uh win or go home month Georgia Tech playing like Music it great commitment to the defensive end of the floor of this second half theyre rebounding very well now just trying to hold on to this 10point lead 540 left in it lob kick to the corner Kelly missed it another quality look off a excellent ball Movement by Georgia Tech again you cant ask for a more clean look green pull up pop misfires both teams I think that fatigue right there again green normally makes that wide open little pullup jumper both teams getting really quality looks just cant finish that was a lob to Corin and almost went in off the back iron now they get it to Corin that rolls around and does not Applause drop and a foul before Claude could attempt the Finish thats a beautiful wraparound pass by George in right here George heads up play now thats should have been a dunk just unable to handle it not sure if Claude Twisted looks like he tweaked his ankle with trying to bring in that pass from George just trying to limp it off Applause here Ties on CLA at the line and Claude will get two cuz Georgia Tech in the double bonus the rest of the way our ABC NBA Saturday Prime Time matchup is the reigning Champion nuggets taking on LeBron James and the Lakers coverage tips with NBA Countdown at eight this is the largest lead for Georgia Tech today they have Domin ated this second half this was a one possession game throughout the first half Dongo checks back into the game for Claude who limps off to the bench Dongo playing with those four Applause fouls is now or never time for Florida State needs something anything on the offensive end that falls off the rim no good I can cant count how many times balls have rolled in and out of four Florida State and D go checks back into the game and immediately gets Another Second Chance opportunity hes up to 15 points today Miller lines up a three missed it Florida state is ice cold up ahead kapari two handed flush its an8 nothing Georgia Tech run it is all yellow jackets with under four minutes to Applause play and thats a go kapari 15 points four ass six from the threepoint line I think the big thing though his ability to control the pace and set his teammates up with some unbelievable opportunities and right there here his Godfather Damon tymire is going to be happy with the statline he has put up today hes tied with Bango for the most points scored for Georgia Tech today 15 a piece but cerent have come in times where Florida state was just getting within Striking Distance and he kept them at arms length well I think a key thing still some time left uh but start event and George again handling the pressure of Georgia T excuse me Florida State are going to be key to close this game out Georgia Tech in the double bonus didnt have to do that gives Florida State life in the seminal turn it right over its been that type of afternoon thus far take a look at the coach Hamilton and again another missed opportunity you get to turnover just pass a little a little too high 11 Baba Miller called for stepping over the end line inbounded to George and kicked off Miller so Florida state has had scoreless trouts throughout this game the latest one went more than three minutes until cam Corin got the goal tending call so they still havent seen the ball go through the hoop and look credit uh to Georgia Tech as well too theyve forced them uh into some contested and difficult jump shots theyve kept them out of the paint I think to switch up going to a little bit of a matchup Zone and then their ability to keep the ball out of the paint has been a big in this second half cerent has to get it over the line and he does draws the foul for a Reach Music inou This is looking very comfortable for Georgia Tech but when youre a team thats 5 and 12 and ACC playing youve lost a lot of second half leads nothings comfortable until this game is is Over Georgia Tech has now made nine straight free throws 14 of 18 from the line today and I think that was key uh in this game when they got into the bonus and theyve lived it seems like from the foul line late in this second half still a 15point lead in Florida State has yet to hit a three three in the second half Dongo putting the body on the line foul comes in Stan heads right back to the free throw line is and back to my previous uh point that again a lot of the credit goes to the Georgia Tech D they just really done a good job being disruptive and keeping the ball out of the paint in particular off the bounce against Florida State Applause substi number 12 Leonard Hamiltons going to take a timeout 316 remaining Georgia Tech open up their largest lead of the game 16 Florida weve talked about how many opportunities Florida state has left this was one of them they needed to sweep the final week of the regular season to get that critical double Buy in the ACC tournament so that is looking lost at this point leard Hamilton knows it you take a look at the Florida state the ACC Log Jam right now theyre sitting in ninth a lot can happen uh you look at as you said all these teams uh theres still some room for movement up or down and as you talked about of the double buy I think is huge as you take a look at Clemson Wake Forest uh those teams uh Log Jam right there to go along with Syracuse pit NC State and Virginia Tech and again I think its more a testament to the league weve already talked about some of the wins that Georgia Tech has WIS over North Carolina wins over Duke and they are not going to be an easy out no down at the ACC tournament yeah dont let that record fool you because their best game can play with anybody absolutely theyve proven that and still some work to do to close this one out 316 to go if youre Florida State you got to get into your offense Applause quick theyve yet to connect on a three in this second half keep going inside now Florida state is in the bonus shooting one and one Music J wat at the line shooting Watkins the VCU Applause transfer led the team in scoring this year for Florida Music Applause State got great size great body control it has just been a struggle though in the second half uh offensively for Florida State now their defensive pressure the way they can turn you over anything is possible but the problem is you cant be too aggressive because Georgia Tech been in the double bonus for a while and sending them back to the free throw Lines doing no good Kelly breaks the Press decides to pull it Applause out shot clock down to five Kelly on the Move feeds it inside Claude goes up with it the follow flush perfect position gari there again to hammer it home Watkins connects on the first three for Florida State in this second half Georgia Tech continuing to push the Music pace George right down the lane and another and one opportunity coming well right now they just have them spaced all out over the floor trying to come up with Steals and beautiful move by George yeah got him across the face and one line 11 and Jay we talked a lot about stur in this game but gabari as well too getting closer to a double double hes got eight points 10 rebounds hes done an excellent job on both ends in particular on on the offensive Applause glass Miller steps out for a three and after Florida say was ice cold now theyve got back to back triples Miller thought he swatted that cleanly off Georgia Tech instead it stays Yellow Jackets ball leading by 14 trying to close this game for their first first time all season earning backto back ACC wins if they can hold this lead for two more Music minutes cerent did well to Shield Watkins but Watkins rips it away up to Spears he lays it thats great Hustle by Watkins and almost another steal by Green the one thing you have to give credit to the Leonard Hiltons team down double digits they are battling to the end Im not surprised that that uh at all again uh this is just great work by Watkins not giving up on the play getting on the floor keep possession and it throws a nice pass uh to Spears for the finish and again if youre Georgia Tech you got to be better with the ball you know theyre trying to get steals but just can ill afford turnovers stur of it spins out of trouble takes the shot and makes the shot up to 20 one shy of a season high on senior day and thats a heads up play a lot of times guys if you get open looks youre not trying to score you just dont want to take contested ones and Georgia Tech is starting to feel it 14point lead for Damon stams team and hes emptying the bench Carter Murphy Carter Murphy the senior from Phoenix Arizona checking in all smiles on that yellow jacket sideline well this is a big win again uh weve talked about some of their big wins this is another one against a very good Florida State Music team one minute remaining even though Georgia Tech has those Marquee wins against Duke at Clemson to North Carolina You could argue this has been the most complete game from start to finish for Damon stmy team in year one Murphy that would have taken the roof off on senior day well I think in particular how you close the season out as we talked about it were in March right now as Spears knocks down the jumper but theyre playing some of their best ball right now they coming off a road whm at Miami and now they follow it up at home against a very good Florida State team this is a team you do not want to see in DC during the ACC tournament yeah and theres again it is going to be a I dont even want to use the word a wild but its going to be a very interesting ACC tournament and theres going to be a lot on the line for all of these teams not out of the ordinary or not out of the unrealistic to have a team like Georgia Tech go down there and go on to run theyve proven as weve discussed that they can play and also beat anybody in the Applause league Kyle Stant the senior checking out after a tremendous 20point performance 17 of the 20 coming in the second half really securing this win for Georgia Applause Tech Florida State continues the Applause battle Nathan George breaks the Press Florida State elects not to foul and Georgia Tech will take this one 8576 backto back wins in the ACC for the first time this season under first year head coach Damon statamire impressive win all around of the defense and then the offensive rebound LED though by sturdivan huge night fort Georgia Tech and Damon STM
