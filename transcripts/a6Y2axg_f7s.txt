it will be Soko and coren to jump it up Tony Henderson to throw it up and Kell will control in Blue on the road and were underway from the Pete counting coming in at s and Five O and one they lost to San Diego States in San Jose coming into this matchup the focal point on the scouts as mentioned in the open will be against St yakovich number two theres DJ Campbell in the starting lineup in place of Ola Joseph Campbell with the right hand and scores good take there and one thing Mark Madson does that I like hes really spaces the floor people dont stand on the weak side theres a lot of false motion and thats where hell get sakovich his open looks away from the ball cutting towards the ball youre watching pit for the first time coming at a 10 two one and0 an ACC play for pit one note in the lineup is legged is out roll his ankle that means Brandon Cummings making his first career start as a freshman iss really impressed the younger brother of Nelly Cummings theres ish one of the top scorers in the ACC the first game hes missed bet trayus with the left hand Diaz G is there the culprits for the foul its a big Miss uh losing ish leggeds ACC Sixth Man of the Year last year again due to the ankle injury not playing today not only what he does form off the on the floor but as far as the leadership ability to find you know dig down and deep when they need a bucket uh understanding getting other people involved and really a tough competitor and unfortunately just tweaked it and I think theyre being precautious with it if it was maybe late March he might sneak in there but theyre smart theyre in the midst of four games and 11 days and certainly a tweak can go into a bad spring and then you miss a month or to jef Cable IUS third straight 2 win season with Al leot relying on Cummings also Damien Dunn missing his six consecutive games sustained a thumb injury and that surgery from the Wisconsin game at the Green Brier Diaz Graham and thats what he can do best for a big guy Mor Diaz Graham can do that you see the smooth stroke he has struggled for most of the year but recently has been finding his way yeah only pedestrian numbers at three 11 of 50 that was his 12th three this year but not indicative of what he can do I mentioned Ola Joseph is outs Campbell in Oman out one of their better perimeter Defenders Black Shear will be at the one heres Campbell with four to go Petrus from the top of the key no doubt Petrus is the do everything guy the hard hat guy for Mark Madson kind of plays like he did when he was in college just gritty will do the inside work and as you can see can step outside as well its a cal team that needs to improve defensively one of the keys for Coach Madson telling us they need to rebound better get back and transition and also shoot at a more more effective rate that they did not accomplish against San Diego State Coran out to Austin with the right hand swatted Away by Soko sto yakovich looking to push on a 2v2 taking comings a blocking fell called by Henderson on cing good take there for sto yakovich well terrific block to start the transition and Soko just really doing a nice job coming in off the ball and when you drive into the gaps Austins got to be aware of the help coming be ready to kick it outside and stovic on the push they never slowed him down hes very good going in both directions you saw the great body control finding that angle to draw the foul at the rim and Tim thats exactly what Mark Madson in his second year leading the Cal program a twotime NBA champ played at Stanford coached the Lakers organization took UT Valley to the semifinals of the NIT in 2023 definitely a Resurgence under the Cal program a lot of transfers among them as you mentioned stoak leading the way well its todays world youve got to take the transfers you got to make sure you get the right ones that fit your system I think these guys are still trying to find their way and find their chemistry when you look at their assist of turnovers but they certainly play hard and marks instilled a very good system good pull up there for Cory and a guy that they want to get more consistent with the pullup game Jeff cable telling me needs to rebound more effectively coming off the 15point performance Pit by the way 1 three in a row coming off of a big win over Sam Houston by 32 points they have won their last 13 home games dating back to last year at the Pete S and0 at the friendly confines Petrus with the left hand and thats a sneaky play down low for petrius slasher what we were talking about though Mark natson puts his players in very good position to be able to create with space and thats what trus did on that drive he like he took the shot previously that time he found the angle to the rim low throws it away heres blackshire with betrus as the trail black your smooth left hand but too strong P trus cleans up and accomplishes what he could do on the Scout he said he was a hard hat guy Mark nson pumping his fist on the sideline saying you remind me a little bit of me when I played for Stanford and in the NBA trus is nine of Cals 13 to start the game blow penetrating with the left hand and a fell they needed that from jayen Applause low jayen low this is what he does he he finds that little Gap the crossover creating space the angle and the head up understanding where the defense rests a lot more weight Tim in this game levied on the shoulders of jayen low without is leing and also you have a freshman Brandon Cummings making the start double figures in all but two games for low completes the threepoint play I think the thing you have to be aware of as a coach which is when you lose a guy like leg and you have such a talent as low that he doesnt try to make up for it in one play or trying to do too much still stay within the concept but still attack when you can ranked fifth among ACC freshman last year in scoring taking that next step as a sophomore right on Q with trus one of the better on ball Defenders on him but a good blow by there by low backto back buckets patr is a good Defender but hes going to have a difficult time if he doesnt Force low to his right when hes got him on that Wing isolated picking up a little one two two and then well fade back here Tim it has crawled back in this one remember they were just down by eight now pedestrian one possession threepoint game black here good ball fake on the Freshman swatted away corad here at home and a good defensive play with Jeff G team Jam low is showing all of his work early the ability to get where he wants to go to off the bounce the head up the body control and the attacking one again for and the resistance big time for Music pit for the other players if they just tuning in betrayus for call and blue has nine of Cals 13 pit has made it a threepoint game swatted away by low pestering Black Shear that time that was a little bit of a force by black Shar and hes got to run the offense he doesnt need to force the ball in the half Court especially against good pressure stay on this end called by Bill Covington junr and Tony Henderson here for Austin and Pitts a threepoint game and Austin very prolific from three had a gamewinning three earlier this year with 04 left with the timer in OT at Ohio State Lo misses the pullup Diaz Graham to no avail on the Miss and back to a a cal team and I think rebounding Tim as you know is going to be a big factor in talking point at the end of this game because Cal is one of the better rebounding teams amongst ACC schools with like a plus 58 rebound margin well they are and thats an issue today especially without look at and done two experienced players so running good offense is important for pit but down here for Cal run some pretty good offense their assist and turnover is not good on the year but so far they look pretty good in rhythm in the half courter Diaz Graham side for cor how about that move by Coran leads the team and dunks and finishes it that is your old school drop step saw Im working on that with Coach Timmy UL yesterday in practice against no defense thats pretty good against solid D his father Richard played at Georgia in the 80s for Coran a transfer from Florida State and cable brought him here to pit because the toughness that he had for Leonard Hamiltons team so yakovich draws the contact taking matters into his own hands cam Corin has just been pretty good I think he can be really good as he gets comfortable with within this system and theyve got to look for him and that time he did a good job of presenting himself big down low so just a little bit soich just a little bit too straight up down there hes got to force him back to the Middle where he has a little bit more help yovich back the line if youre familiar with that name hes the son of the great pist lakovic many years in the NBA in a large part with the Sacramento Kings well more on that fatherson relationship in a little bit but born in Greece coming from Jesuit High School in the Sacramento area freshman here at Stanford is take a big leap from Stanford and transfer now to Cal hes got the quick first step and you see the ability to go off the bounce with both hands and really gets to the free throw line knows how to play six for six with Charity strike leading by three over pit just the fourth meeting its the second ACC game for both of these schools low this is the teardrop that time Dort 34 and blue into the action for the first time off the bench for madsons Music team its Wilkinson as well Off the Bench hes got a big motor Up and Under but too heavy on the finish for Wilkinson Wilkinson has come on strong on the bench is just a freshman averaging over 16 in and around the last eight delich also Off the Bench for pit both of these teams will utilize their bench early in this game little bit of a force on that last possession by pit they have to be more patient make sure that they get low involved on every possession hens at free because to yakovich was doubled swatted away down there by Austin on petrius good play by Applause Austin Austins been a very good player for Pittsburgh so far this year everyone talks about his outside shooting but you see his presence on defense can also be felt was his 19th block delich looked like was fouled perhaps from three called by S as of late has really been liting it up from the threepoint line but this is all about protection in the lane and he and Corin so far tonight this afternoon have been active around the rim heres next Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header Clemson o Florida stated little John to start us off on two Easter then North Carolina ncy State Square Off Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech takes on Cal should be a great day of Hoops on the ACC Network just want to give a shout to Bill Courtney even though he lost that game for Miami at at Boston College right before us on acc Network taking over for Jim Len and I know its a guy that that you coach yeah I like Bill Cory not a lot he worked with us at Providence and I think hell do a terrific job tough situation stepping in for a Hall of Fame coach in the middle of the year uh Its Tricky yeah obviously you know todays basketball you heard Jims press conference when he did step down from Miami he kind of felt for him like got thrown into this Whirlwind of nil and portal and everything else and you can deal with it for a while but sometimes it just gets to you and every year half your teams coming in saying Im leaving so congratulations to Jim on a great unbelievable career taking Mi Avi to the final four low draws the contact there on petritis third team foul there on C good assertiveness by low and look its its no question its been a theme Tony Bennett before the year going back years past Jay WS among others turnover in the coaching ranks and its nice to be into The League season though Dave obviously with these new teams in the league and Andy infield on at SMU doing a really good job in their first year and his first year their first year in the ACC and welcoming Duke in Carolina coming up so people down in Dallas will be very excited see p is 10 in the top 50 in the net signature wins this year three quad one quad two wins for the pit Panthers including as I mentioned earlier that Ohio State Victory on the road lost to Wisconsin and The Greenbrier tip off as well but its a Jeff capable team thats off matching their best start from eight seasons ago one of the the last teams out of the NCAA tournament last year very disappointing they declined at nit bid last year they got to the dance a couple of years ago back to those Jamie Dixon had Howland years here at pits three to go here the timer Wilkinson has to hoist this up and delivers good awareness wison making sure that he understood the clock was running down sovich made a nice move in the lane but they stayed with the play now speaking again about the ACC a little bit they you know everyones taking their shots they saw the record really struggled against the SEC but those five teams are good you know someone else could emerge wake had a good win yesterday on the road they they could make a run still uh you look at Virginia Tech maybe they could do something Florida States always a threat but those five that we spoke about that are really solidly into the tournament at this point I think can all cause some damage not only during the season but in March second turnover there on Cal Cummings cant finish though and here comes Wilkinson Tucker into the game also has started this year started when blacker was out due to injury Wilkinson misses gets his own garbage and finishes what a play there by Jeremiah Wilkinson The Freshman The Freshman is stepped up all season long for Mark Madson and you see his quickness the ability the awareness we saw on on the play before in the end of the shot clock but chasing down the loose ball amongst the trees and Music finishing and about Mark Madson when you play for him he gives you a lot of freedom on the offensive end long as you stay within the system he lets his players go I like that they go four out five out at times but they dont just stand around and go oneonone they really change sides of the floor nicely and have some misdirection action on the weak side which allows guys like Wilkinson to attack on ball movement look at the numbers over the last eight games over 16 points per game in just 25 minutes I asked the staff when was that that Breakout game from early it was the Air Force game early on where he got serious minutes and a guy that gets downhill a slasher can find those seams inside Wilkinson at the line with Cal up by three Pi did take a a short lead but if youre just Tuning In For the First Time kis had the advantage in large part D to petritis 31 for blue nine of their 20 points Dave Leno Tim Welsh and our entire crew wishing you and yours a very happy New Year here from Pittsburgh low in the game playing out with his comrade and leged both combining for over 30 points per game doubled because of the Scout corad with his second dunk of the game well good job by C in Duman and getting the ball out of Lows hand but if theyre going to do that on the ball screen they absolutely have to rotate to the weak side because he will give the ball up good job fighting out of that trap finding the open man sto yakovich and thats a good feed there by Tucker inside and have that cut for sto yakovich cut the ball cut the player movement the spacing the ball movement excellent by Cal terrific decision making by Tucker transfer from UTSA cummings 0 for two by the way wearing three the younger brother of Deli Cummings played one year after many years at Colgate before that Bowling Green delich gets it back with eight to shoot on the timer for Pitt and white tiing Tucker lost a good defense by Tucker third turnover on pits Wilson draws the contact on low thats his second foul too much oneonone belich just put his head down he was bound and determined to try to get a shot off instead turns it over hes got to give that ball up in the half court heres the spacing the back cut the ability to move without the ball and that Middles opened up because theyve got coverage on the weak side theyve got activity and pits defense is concerned about the shooters on the perimeter instead they go two on two right down the middle of the floor low St out there Tim with two fouls this pit is down by four Coran almost had to swipe black shirt with the decision making out to Mahoney first time in and delivers Off the Bench good job by black just finding the open man almost turned it over but k kept his head up and money had his feet set he was thrusted the lineup due to multiple injuries among them BJ omont one of their best perimeter Defenders out low met by money blow was fouled on this end it will stay here that time Cal did a better job closing the door on low he split the double but they stayed with it and two Defenders on both side of him and just took away the passing Lanes he tried to just force it up and draw the foul no foul here will stay on this end for hits Cal leading by seven Austin 55 still out there with Campbell on H download to Coran again taking dorts but a foul on the floor on blackshire so Dave I think thats where cor can really be more effective as the season progresses and thats what Jeff cable wants him to do kind of hangs out on the perimeter a little bit which is part of their offense hes a good screener up at the top but on the roll he can get carve out that deep post position hes so big strong hes got great footwork and terrific hands he can have that ability to put a lot of pressure on the defense down low last TI years of Florida State average just shy at nine points per game prend the 24 double figures performances Cummings looking his first bucket and hes got it with the roll for Cummings I have a feeling he and his brother went mono on Mano with this a few times in the back backyard and just little pump fake old school draw the foul great body control talking with Brandon before the game of freshman from Midland Pennsylvania its about he set a 40minute drive from Lincoln Park High School couple of PIAA state titles in Pennsylvania as mentioned the the younger brother of Nelly Cummings played one year 2023 to 2022 2023 that got pits back to the dance and theres Nelly Cummings played overseas and and looking on at his younger brother played an alumni game before the year Tim and they said that was such an emotional moment for the family see nelli and Brandon play on the same floor pit does a great job of welcoming their great ex players back now pit showing a little zone for the first time tonight just back Zone Back To The Man fourpoint game Wilkinson gives it up blackshire for three too strong that time who wants the board its money fresh 20 here for Cal thats what Cal does they were a little used about the defense they didnt get their typical movement but they stayed with it and make some pay wilon how about that thats some Jason kid range who formerly played for Cal back in the day those guys know Jason kid I hope they do they better I hope so just watch some tape which is easily accessible these days low with two fouls coasting against Soko was in his way off balance there for low six in the ACC in scoring how about this Cal team pushing again with Wilkinson this is what Tim Illustrated it is Campbell for three with nobody around him but strong the whole way look how Cal getting back Not Afraid theyve got a road win at USC played a tough stord team very tough on the road had a big lead at Missouri he fell late in the game so not going to back down today Campbell taking the Freshman with the right hand no did it go off a Coran it did and we just mentioned Stanford and Kyle Smiths doing a really good job there they kind of get forgotten you think about the new league youre thinking about the traditional teams that smus found their way into that mix right now early but I think Stanford also has that ability this year seeing how if they adjust to the new conference which I think they will with Kyle Smith to make some waves and get into the tournament as the season progresses we have Maxim Reno who leads the ACC in scoring as 10 double doubles as well six to go on the timer here for blatcher with Cal up by seven two to shoot from the corner its Wilkinson again trus has gone quiet since being perfect to start the game with his nine points of possession without stovic in the game they kind of stand around on occasion and that time the help defense wait to the party pings backto back buckets for him cradles into a fivepoint game hes getting going off of that penetration Applause changing defense is doing a good job now theyre in this two3 Tandem and theyve got Cal standing around a little bit not getting the ball into the middle of the floor saw this a lot on the tape going to a little bit of the soft Zone here black sh trying to beat that zone over to Wilkinson for three yet again and he delivers oh hes got a lot of confidence in Wilkinson well that time Cal did get the ball into the middle of the floor and thats what you have to do everybody says that everybody knows it but its a matter of doing it whether its with pass or penetration they got the ball off the bounce into the middle of the lane drew the defense in then kicked it back out for the open shot TIs the biggest lead for the Golden Bears at 8 640 and a turning clock here at pitch delich is fouled by Music Applause blackshire good balance for C so far today offensively they move the ball theyve done a good job against the man on the last possession finding the open Man In The Zone shot ready Music Music Dave Leto Tim Welsh back in Pittsburgh Wilkinson has 11 of Cals 31 points its a count team if you havent followed them this year first year the ACC with SMU and Stanford go to six and one at a very good start their best start since the 161 17 campaign but they have dropped four of the last five the issue hasnt been the the the shooting numbers the offensive PR as to the rebounding but defensively at times its going to strive it has and I think thatll develop over time and its kind of an underrated stat in basketball about as far as trying to identify defensive chemistry everybody talks about offensive chemistry playing together we have to play together on the defensive end the floor and Jeremiah Wilson a nice job they had the injuries to Campbell and blackshire early in the year and hes come on since then because hes been able to get that quality playing time and now the confidence from Mark Madson yeah they had the eighth best Turner in according to Ken pal in the country last year 10 win Improvement for that Cal team with with Matson the head coach in place of a three win mark Fox team a lot of resurgence on the Berkeley campus trying to bring those days back to what Ben Braun provid Mike Montgomery in the past sto yakovich who sat for a little bit comes in and draws the contact this is exactly what Mark Matson was telling us how much more of a slasher everybody talks about the shooting of sto yakovich but how he Dives inside both hands too and he finds a way and hes he plays low to the ground you can see that he was worked with at a young age with his dad watched a lot of film talked to his dad was coached by his dad and then Marks doing a great job with him here this year Applause Music love guys that move without the ball its kind of a lost AR everybody wants to go oneonone everybody wants to come off the ball screen and do their thing he is moving without out the basketball constant motion and you cant do it alone though youve got to have a good system if youre running around and youre running into two of your teammates thats no good but they have the floor space they have a good system and they came ready to play today a lot of confidence here early with Cal biggest lead for Cal theyre now eight of nine for the charity strike here they lost jayen Tyson drafted 20th overall to the cat so sto yakovich from Stanford to Cal was a big get for Matson one of those 10 scholarship transfers 16 new players low in and out playing with two fouls the Miss by Campbell here for Kell looking to push on a 2v2 Campbell with the right hand off the heel Soko gets the Miss disrupted there by Austin who wants it oh its Soko sto yakovich good shot fake this is on the floor according to Paul cells an official of two final fours will be on this end willll be the one of one on this side well off the bounce c will really try to push it even their guards get in and they help out on the rebounding butovich is so good you see the body control and again the ability to get fouled and this is what hes done 12 games got the line 72 times from into today he is not just a straight shooter for sure Tim I I just heard that the sugar ball is postponed to tomorrow due to that horrific incident on Bourbon Street in New Orleans I just want to give my thoughts to everybody involved on that that terrible scene but that Notre Dame Georgia game is going to be postponed with a lot of college football its a smart move its the only option they had I know they didnt want to jump to conclusions early but once you take a deep breath and figure out the situation just theres too much uncertainty right now in New Orleans to play that game tonight good move by the Sugar Bowl and by ESPN stovic taking it in running with Campell Jeff C has to call a timeout the largest lead here for cow at 13 with 505 to go and they are masterful in transition and theyre getting it off the glass and pushing it Pits got to get back slowed down Music Music Kell up by 13 youre looking at one of the better scores not just in the ACC but in the country and Andre sto yakovich the son of Paia won an NBA title in 2011 with the Dallas Mavericks played for four teams I know a lot of years with Sacramento and Pa also was an assistant GM with the Kings goes to every game at Berkeley seeing his son Andre who didnt pressure him to play basketball R up on him a JV players freshman year went from a seven and8 in growth spurted about 17 months and then when he was really serious Asia was was running some strengths with them going through all the Motions to get Andre to play College didnt pressure him Dave but Im sure that he had a ball next to his bed some sneakers and theres a a hoop nearby with a hope that hell love it and he certainly does love the game you could tell by the way he plays trus good assertiveness well stay on this end and Andre saying that hes a late bloomer unlike P who actually turned professional in Europe at at 15 how about the the shooting 10 if you can break this down yes the form similar Maybe I having a son that plays Ive never pressured him either but every night before I went to bed I prayed that he would play basketball and he is he is fun to watch I mean just Andre moves without the basketball constantly and finding the open man on that possession and pit right now is back on their heels defensively Campbells been strong averaging seven points per game how a lengthening this lead over pits right now pit offensively he kind of stuck in the mug without leg it theyre Cs done a good job and thats what Corin has to do hes got to be more demanding of the basketball hes floating out of the perimeter a little bit too much but after he sets that initial ball scen just plant himself near the basket put some pressure on the back side of that Cal defense but Cal is doing a good job of getting the ball out of Lows hands and loading up on him knowing that he is really remain an only threat to this point on the perimeter and he is the guy that they have to take away first and theyve done a good job of that and someone else has to step up for Pittsburgh or else theyre going to be in deep trouble that was much needed that broke an 11 nothing run there for Cal with Coran at the line and completes threepoint play but its a cal team at that youre just tuning in closing in under the fourminute Mark here the first half theyre pushing theyre been effective from three which the numbers were pretty anemic last game when theyre lost to San Diego State where they went for a spell of 0 for 15 during that stretch and were not good from three different story here in pits and look at the numbers on the offensive boards 82 five to shoot here for sto yakovich doubled with the left hand no better defense from the Panthers a good job by pit on defensively that time closing out before sakovich could get that angle right at the ramp heres the Freshman Cummings first career start for H 30 a couple games ago when his brother Nelly was on the call with our talented producer and announcer for Jason Earl high ball screen for Cory Cummings taking dorts hell draw the contact well play there from the localish product in Brandon coms well its only 1100 am start out in perkley but Cal came ready they got here two days early Mark Madson Adam Focus about five walkthroughs in the ballroom practices here and they came in like it was prime time for Cal Music you mentioned how well Kyle Smiths teams been doing for Stanford well Kyle Smiths teams have always done well going back to his days at Columbia and Washington State they have a specific system and they come out of nowhere because they beat you with the system and is a very good signing by Stanford run their program and Austin College looked dead in water today good good job by them on New Years Day of a sleepy afternoon at The kti Forum and they showed a lot of Life late where they really needed that game because they off to a tough start this year but theyre starting to learn each other as well theyve got a brand new team as as does Cal Toman Jr doing exceptional things for Boston College player of the week coming into this one here in the ACC also intrigued for that Louisville UNC game the night cap on the AC Network Pat Kels team 18th best strength of schedule led by Chucky Heir and Terence Edwards going against against RJ Davis is Seth Trimble the North Carolina team coming off of a big win over Campbell spinballs around pit trying to get it no Dort was there Cummings bangs the floor in frustration good hustle nonetheless for the Panthers but well stay on this end theyve got to go find a way you know when the shots arent going down youre missing your leading score youve got to find other ways to impose your will against a team been their first row game in this league and right now Cal looks like the experienced confident veteran heres dorts DLo taking Coran with the left hand stay on this end try to eliminate that phys physicality coming into the season hold by Paul sells the crow does not like Applause it got to call this you see Corner hes got the hands hes got the arm bar hes shoving with the arm bar if hes got if he goes straight up this is so and excuse me Dorp just knocks him down then you take the charge or you you go backwards just build a wall down there but you got to build the wall the hands straight up the armar extended is an easy call T out a season high of nine against Air Force low comes back into the game for Coran mired by two fou well if you dont call that early against two guys that are big and strong then the game becomes a fist fight or a wrestling match down on the paint and this is what we dont want the game to become the referees are instructed to call that every time well its interesting because a lot of the story lines around the NBA you hear guys in the superstars thing they want to bring back that toughness down low to let those calls go we didnt see that a moment ago low lost it there t back to Cal looking to push fifth turnover on the Panthers Wilkinson again short the whole way has the Miss wiin had got a piece what whats the NBA saying so if theyre saying that if in fact if thats allowed then theyre going to stop shooting 53 exactly they want to see banging down low think so would you like to see it the at the professional level Id like to see post play I dont know why you still cant have post play you can bring back the fours and the fives can have clean post play without physicality Austin for three no petrius with a weak side rebound foul on delich thats going to put Cal in the bonus again deam foul number nine on Pitts so when we talked about that that rebound disparity that is really key when teams play this Cal lineup also for pit in the two losses they were outrebounded by a combined 10 rebounds in those gamees so seemingly one of the big themes you come and get on the Scout was if pit gets out rebounded some teams might have the better end of it well theyre doing a good job Cal as far as attacking not only with the interior players the forwards and guys like petrius but the guards have been very pesky chasing down loose balls here we got a good match at the top feature players 15 to zero its in for Cal that goose egg for pit heres Cummings so the ball fake for three in front of the Cal Applause bench nice job by cies just taking his time out there on the floor understanding that they need a bucket they did a good job on low at the top but pit needs a little energy how about that spin move by sto yakovich as the crowd gets into it 11point game delich Diaz gram and a timeout by Mark Matson listen to the crowd here at the Applause zoo well theres some energy in the building with the defense and the extended fast break action and some extracurricular activity too well talk about that when we come back Music Music back in pit and at the end of that play Tim you were right on it I think theres coincidental technical fouls I believe on Austin for Pitts and Campbell for Cal Mark Matson came in it was to our rights on this and theres Campbell with the dreadlocks there for for Cal but as I mentioned some extracurricular activity good job by Mark Madson is the coach just to come out and make sure this didnt not escalate and the two came out and theres really nothing there but it could have got to something but Mark did a good job coming out now they call the technicals which Im not sure is needed he Austin starts it by firing the ball at him and okay so that part we didnt see originally so I can see where Austin gets teed up but they make everybody happy and make it a double technical I think they have not come over and explained it totally or made their final decision theyre still at the monitor yep by rule they can be at the monitor here to to to take a look at those potential technical fouls administered to both Campbell and also whats impressed you the most Tim seeing this Cal team a newcomer to the ACC and Jeff cable just got a oh hes barking he was barking during the monitor review at Paul Applause cells hes getting away smartly hes moving away to different direction so I dont know why hes mad obviously maybe they they told him that Austin and maybe is the only one that received a technical foul but which he definitely deserved he threw the ball at Campbell and now a lot to look at I saw just Austin throw the ball after that play after the dunk over to cample theres Austin right now for pits heres another Look to Him okay so Austin fires the ball at Campbell he fires it back at him right okay now its he said she said and lets see happy New Year and here comes Mark playing his old role as a tough guy and good thing for him he kind of settled everything down and that should be it double tes lets play on yeah so not asking for New Year Full Slate ACC games today da we cant spend our time at the monitor not asking for uh theyve been there for while to Clemson yeah all right heres after RW we have a dead ball contact technical foul blue three class a technical file white 55 class a technical file sporting conduct on white Coach blue will Shot Two Shots white will take the ball out at the spot underneath so if I get this right is there you got the foul and Campbell got the foul in Austin both technical fouls and then you get Jeff cable nobody is thrown out no its class a foul technical foul this could have been resolved yes very quickly if they came over and asked us Dave double double tes on the two players no harm no foul they both threw the ball at each other you know not a big deal the old days it was that was okay but you cant do that anymore and well get an explanation here from Paul cells Paul cells going to going to come over to us should still should be some Two Shots coming up here for St Music Applause so after the two free throws thank you to Paul SS an official of two final fours with a a fantastic crew with Covington and also Henderson so pitw the ball after so yakovich just missed on the other end of the floor well he Pits going to get the ball back because Campbell committed a dead ball technical after after the whistle was thrown Austin threw the ball at him the ball was live then Campbell threw the ball back at Austin when after the whistle bin blow so its a dead ball which will allow pit to have the ball retain the ball back on a dead ball Technical and after all that here we go so again they got those two sure what Jeff was upset about from technical you know thats what coaches do sometimes they get upset Diaz gaham coming inside its an offensive foul and the crowd is living here in pits see if if Jeff had not got the technical they would have just had the ball back underneath with with no free throws instead Cal got the free throws and now the offensive foul and were going back to the table to see if theres something flagrant I guess going back to the m yep okay to the monitor here 105 and cable is livid as Diaz Graham looked to be a little bit High I dont know how much was there from guo Diaz Graham you got the twin brothers of course for the canary look like he got tripped on the play but right now the rhyme and rhythm of this game has been discontinued it had a little bit of a roll there yep and uh get through the half but they have played with more energy and more tougher in the last three four minutes to get themselves kind of back in this game to explain that callus missed the last four under a minute to go here at the peak Dave let Tim Welsh our entire crew here from Pitts by 10 heres Wilkinson with the left hand double there good defense there by Cummings oh a technical fil off to the play again its going to go against K I believe its against Wilkinson for chirping and Mark Madson is livid with wison in his Cal team well got to know where youre going its like when youre traveling in Europe you need to know what city youre in what country youre in uh these guys are not in a good mood maybe theyre not happy about working on New Years Day I love working with you on New Year wi that seemed a little quick lets see so he wanted the call wanted the call I said he got hit in the head boom theyre not taking it today Dave looked at Tony Henderson and that was enough so low at the line twice and its hard to imagine Jeff cable said more than that crossed the line either I mean Im sure he just wanted an explanation and they werent giving it to him and sometimes these guys they ref seven days a week theyre a little cranky the coffees not hot in the morning the flight was delayed so beware just play stay away from these guys just tuning in C set the lead for Moos of the first but pit callling back to an eightpoint game low taking Tucker step back three in and out delich lost it kante had it Austin would be a big one got it but I first there was a foul and its good so a foul an off ball foul on Cal and the three is good for Austin what a turn of events Austin counted to three and a great job by Pittsburgh on the offensive rebound instead of trying to force the issue back up in traffic understanding that when the lane is crowded this is where the bigs that really have to understand basketball and that time they do a good job Papa does a good job of pitching it back out and Austin could have counted to five and he was wide open because everybody else was in the Applause lane so kante was the one that was fou I mentioned on the call in the post thats why hes at the line how about this Cal was up by 16 at the 419 Mark now pinned down to a fivepoint game kti made the good play on the inside he the presence of mind on the offensive rebound to turn to the outside and thats what well coached teams do they understand that a great way to get a three if you got capable people on the outside they teach them to spot up on the offensive rebound and look right back out before the defense can recover and you know this comeback is has really been energized by Pits defense C has not played poorly theyve done a pretty good job but Pits doing a better job on the glass and trying to force the issue in transition hante misses what do we have here a foul again downstairs I know petrius was down there with Dort on petrius thats his second fou him another look wow mon delich well you teach your players to block out but you cant put two hands on the offensive players chest and throw them to the ground good call the game is slowed down pits after flurry of technical fouls has clawed back in this one but the big story coming in only the fourth meeting between these schools a newcomer to the ACC and Cal has had the lead up by 16 you see it down to four with petrius going out delich another free throw with just a hair over 23 seconds left of the Applause half that be better at the free throw line there for delich 15 to go here on the game clock of our first half for Applause Campbell taking the freshman Cummings Hoy ball screen there for Tucker Campbell the kick out Mahoney three at the buzzer no thats a better end to the first half there for pit first half on 111 run in the second half is often running from the Pete Dave let Tim Welsh and our entire ACC Network crew here in the steel city Cummings had nine gives it up to Gad who was strong in that first half that was good offense on that possession and started with Corin just being able to run the offense as that point forward out in the perimeter on that dribble handoffs and then finding himself in that midrange area sto yakovich had 12 in the first half coupled with Wilkinson as mentioned with 11 heres blackshire who runs the one with Campell out there Petrus going to run the post and set those those screens up top here in Austin theres the switch flaer sees it sooko walk its a good call by Paul SS on little point forward on the perimeter does a good job of not forcing the ball hand the hand off and then just sliding into that open Gap as pit went two with the dribbler its only the fourth turnover on Cal went 18 last game and low Deadlocks the game at 42 remember Cal led by as many of 16 in a different game one minute into the second stands up theyre trying to read that top that hand off and c I believe be better served going underneath or sliding through instead of going over the top and letting low get that angle coming off that drible hand off low with 11 without ish legett due to Rolling his ankle not playing missing his first game action Damen done not in as well Campbell the step back thats good from the corner deep two for him Campbell is a strong looking guard hes got good size 6 to 205 low again with the left hand out was smooth C did a good job on Jay loone the first half not letting him get in ahead of steam in the half court but he seemed to find his way they will have to make some adjustments how theyre playing that ball screen and the handoff Tim to your point the season last year really turned around for pit when low was inserted into the starting lineup and you see that continue here to this season that was all from petritis and cummings was fouled back to low first low he just refuses the ball screen and nobody steps up on the weak side youve got a Defender guarding the screen hes got to be in support with a guy like low ready to Applause attack its three on Soko for Cal yeah you lose your two top scores from last year in Hinson and Carlton Carrington and you need low and others to step up Coran has been a big addition as Tim and I have attested to throughout the broadcast low doubled here Soka remember with three fouls five to shoot Brandon Cummings from the corner Applause yes and a timeout by Mark Madson and Pitts exceptional start to the second half well Jaylen L struggled that times in the first half two for nine but he has come out laser focus on the attack off the bounce in the lane attacking the Trap finding the open man and the young fella knocking it down Brandon Cummings Music Music welcome back to the Peterson Event Center in Pittsburgh Dave Tim Welsh our entire crew you see low at 13 comings with 12 so we see Saul if youre just tuning into this game for the fourpoint lead for Cal was up by as many as 16 to the first half to a 92 run for pit well J low has done it all coming out of this second half he and cam Corin just understanding in the half court reading the defense attacking the doubles and intense defense down this end so I want to point it out the the last bucket for sto yakovich third in the accs scoring at 1054 the first half Soko finishes it so I have to give credit to pit on the scouts on sto yakovich to spite that bucket there for Soko well Zack Aus is doing a good job his size has presented a problem for sakovich but theyve got to give get him moving around they can still attack for sure and let him get to where he wants to go to especially off the bounce and draw some fouls so yet again his scoring whos really impressed in this game threepoint edge here for pits Soko y put it right in his face sokos got to play his defense much earlier Soko part of four NCAA tournament teams with Michigan States Coran again all over the place thats what Petrus can do Cummings Dives right in front of us heres to yakovich with the right hand he will go to the line good Asser of this there from Andre stojakovich now the onand retrievals get to you when youre on the floor for those loose balls try to pick it up and dribble it youve got to put your chest right on the ball and stovic just takes advantage of just the ball squirting his way and sometimes when youre having trouble getting your open looks youve got to find other ways to get it on the board and he can do that giving the free throw line that was the fourth foul on guo Diaz GR delich has to come in St yakovich 9 of 11 from the free throw line cow was clinical in transition pit getting back a little late the transition defense helped their success in the first half as C in the first half was just five of 14 from three then we had 23 personal fouls throughout that first half four tactical fouls one on on capable of hits now pit the claw back in as the game is slowed down here at the pets all screen again with Corin on trus in the way again called for the personal of Cal thats his third well dor is playing off Corin on the perimeter and on those ball screens and handoffs and puts him in a spot where he can help in the lane but hes not hes kind of useless out there in the perimeter because hes not helping his teammate who is getting screen because he so far off the screener setting those screens up top Zack Austin Coran and delich in low a good dime again and its Coran with another solo in the game thats what we do the Ds there he rotates up a little bit late but nobody rotates to help to help them ler trying to quiet cor and he Applause walks Ill tell you Corin has been monstrous in the second though has created for himself in this second half dribbling with his head up and the dime dish with the late recovery On The Backs side Corin presenting himself big time and back at pit it has been low in Coran who have been very dominant the second half 10 when we talk to the pck coaches theyve been happy with Cam Corin so far this year but they think that he can give them more and today hes proving that for sure hes doing a good job hes still doing a lot of screening at the top of the circle theyre using him as a handoff guy on the dribble handoffs at that pinch post area around the wing but after that hes doing a great job of rolling presenting himself posting up big and also just sliding to those open spots if his man does slide over to help to protect the rim Le all scores with 15 accompanied by five rebounds six of his 15 have come in the second half as we just showed you along with the play of low right on Q with the left hand and how about that that time over dor this is in the first half Cal did a really good job on all these dribble handoffs and ball screens but they seemly are really confused with their coverage right now and low is having his way bigest lead Tim for pits here at five an inside for George that back up to Soko a turnover PS by P so what do you thinks been problematic here on the here you for this its not even a real ball screen its a its a ghost screen at the top but just a lot of movement and low going to his left you better slow him down a lot sooner than that c wants to see more effective offensive set on the other side low with the step back that was confident from jayen low gets where he wants to go two off the B so quick with both hands but he keeps his head up he understands the spacing and hes very good at reading the defender whos got 17 with his five assists backto back double doubles backto back 10 plus assist Applause games trus five to shoot here for Campbell step back over Cummings they need that no hes way off thats really good defense for the Freshman bran Cummings it has matched the toughness of Cal in the second half and it starts with their defense their offense is into a flow but their defense has been very very good contesting everything and been one and done for Cal theres low who leads all scores Tim with 17 working with Cummings taking sto yakovich with the left hand shorts so yakovich is there hasnt scored since the 10minute mark of the first half delich all on him well the mark of a good player even there I say it a great player and hes becoming a great player as jayen low having a really rug rough first half understanding the defense is going to load up on him because legs not in the lineup and understanding how to find his shots without forcing the issue in the second half and thats what Jaylen Lows done had a season height in 28 at Ohio State in Columbus when Zack Austin hit that gamewinning three with 04 just a clock issue here thats what we from our officiating Crews doing a great job Tony Henderson Bill Covington Jr and Paul sells a lot of experience on that crew theres dorts from the inbounds dorts taking Coran good positioning but misses the reverse petrius he get called for the foul thats four on petrius petrius has been a lunch paale guy all season long for Cal makes the extra effort plays but he knows thats totally unnecessary sometimes when youre going 100 miles all the time its hard to pull back you cannot fault his effort pit clinking to a sevenpoint lead here at the upart of the second look at the foul trouble Meed by this Cal team with Soko black Shir d as well just behind petritis low with the left hand short the whole Away St yakovich fell the whistle silent over to Wilkinson he can get downhill Tim in a hurry Mahoney back over to Wilkinson trying to take Austin for three short dor cant get the Miss its delich instead right C is not going to get back in the game with those quick contested threes right out of transition I agree need to go deeper in the clock Coran again draws the contact taking DK good assertiveness and decision making from a lot of frustration right now C on both ends of the floor when you take a bad shot down one end your defense rarely gets set down at the other end here you see Corin just finds his way on the Baseline before Cals help defense get set timeout is called by Cal fourth foul that time on George so for this C team what do you want to see just better Effectiveness on the offensive end for Mark Matson well in the first half they they did a really good job of changing sides of the floor with the basketball and thats a simple thing to do but you get into a rut of going oneonone and sometimes you get you forget how what got you there and I think thats why Marks calling a timeout now just he saw that quick shot the corner by Wilkinson and just like were not going to get back in the game that way we cant get back in one minute weve got to do it like the way we did in the first half work the defense make the defense work change sides of the floor put some pressure on the interior of the the defense which will open up the outside and gets stovic coming off some screens theyve got to do a better job of screening for him away from the ball which they did in the first half tomorrow at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but net crew will break down the night the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens basketball game and look ahead to the best matchups of the weekend weve got you covered all season right here on acc Network and the ESPN app want to give a shout of the ACC to the Georgia Tech women off to a 140 start the Cal women 131 to begin its season its best run since the 167 campaign nine ACC schools to the womens side with over 10 wins so far very deep on the womens side in the ACC after that foul on D theres Coran as we mentioned dominant to start the second half cow was up by 16 that has vanished its been all picks its the second ACCC games for both schools sto yakovich taking Wilkinson with the left hand Wilkinson will go to the line fou will be on Cummings and that will be his second ACC womens basketball has been excellent so far I get all my Intel on acc womens basketball from coach Muffet McGrath yeah sure she shes on iist listen but uh Cal listened to their coach on that position they did a better job of just more patience in the half court thats all they theyve shown that they can score against this pit defense and pit defense is solid its not Elite they dont turn you over they dont rebound great out of it they dont beat themselves though and if you come down and are quit triggered against them thats when they will take advantage especially getting out of transition picking up the 221 is Cal and then going back that quelled an eight nothing run Tim to your points there for pits and back down to a seveno game cling to the Midway Mark of the second Cal showing some soft Zone but not rotating and you cant Guard air youre in the zone and that time coko was he was standing in the middle of the lane but he was ball watching and when you ball watch in the zone this is what happens you watch Corin from the weak side just steps in front sooko hes just guarding air hes standing there in the zone but hes not bodied up on anyone when hes in the middle of that zone hes got to understand hes got to pay attention to one thing when Corans in his neighborhood hes got to body up on him and protect that lane and rim how about the job that Jeff cable has done here in the net we mentioned at 10 hes got three quad one quad two wins LSU Ohio State West Virginia among them last year one of the last teams out of the dance and and as we mentioned from the open a team in a roster thats poised to perhaps make a postseason Ohio State on the road is a special win thats going to carry them a long way but also West Virginia what they did to them on this court and seeing West Virginia beating Kansas yesterday that also will play well moving forward but Jeff Jeff we talked about it yesterday obviously the league the bottom part of the league you got to take care of business and the top part right now looks very solid but that can change if in fact you have hiccups moving forward in conference you know most of the time you say well we can build our resume with getting wins but it really matters who youre beating and who youre not losing to as far as the way the ACC has played out so far this year Wilkinson will be at the line but but speaking of the prow at the top just wanted to get your thoughts Duke and Cooper flag The Freshman 24 points 9 to 14 for Coach Shys team for the blue does well hes as good as advertised thats for sure and Tyrese Proctor has been a terrific guard and cant say enough about John sh I mean stepping into Mike shesky shoes theres nothing harder in sports than what hes had to do and hes its been Flawless for Duke and starting with recruiting running the program and and coaching on the floor as well three of the top 10 that would have been featured in this game but Leeds is not playing due to a rolled ankle as Coran will go to the line yet again conservative efforts noticing for Cameron Coran I dont know if they see a misch match with him down low you mentioned a little bit late on the help of the rotation side defensively for Cal well both in zone and man you got to move on the pass not on the catch and thats what Cals doing right now theyre theyre just a step slow theyre ball watching theyre not man and ball watching and coren is doing a really good job in this game of finding the open spots and just being able to just attack and that time you see just no body put on him as Soo leaves him someones got to rotate down to block him out corins got 19 in the game thats his best Mark so far at 16 in the Wisconsin game that was the one that Damien dun was injured with the thumb and Ankle Coran looks like will be the culprit for a foul here as we will go to a timeout with 1154 remaining in regulation pit up by seven one of the reasons why is low well jayen low can be a oneman band but he has had a good mix to his game he can do it all by himself or hes got his teammates involved and hes been good on the defensive end as well well Jeff capable and his staff here at pit have exceeded expectations over the last couple of years look at the preseason B compared to the Finish vers team last year getting to the ACC semifinals but not making the dance you know Ive learned over the years that the coaches really dont know what theyre talking about when they do the preseason poll right with the portal and the large numbers in each conference uh but I would tell you this Jeff Cap has a program thats built to last and I would say its not smart to vote them any worse than the top half in the league because hes done a good job of keeping his players that he wanted to keep over the last few years with everybody transferring with the drop of a half but this team is a good team theyre a very high quality basketball team and obviously theyre shorthanded today but you see low just the progression of his game and not forcing the issue without let in the lineup today just taking the the game attacking when he has to but also just running the team as a true really good point guard good points lets see if that bucket from Wilkinson out of the timeout will be the Catalyst for Cal downstairs its kante though off the bench at a season I 12 in Ohio state will go to the line should know better though hes decent position down low ke and he just shoved his body right into him instead of building that wall we could just protected and made him shoot over the top this so Soo trouble with the fouls as mentioned previously its the third count player with four with Papa ke of senagal and he has that 74 wingspan guy off the bench for Cs team Here Comes stojakovich what have you made of the the afternoon from the great Andre sto yakovich well there not that pits scouting report at the top of it is the game plan defense ly to stop him theyre denying him the ball on the outside theyre giving some help theyre giving him a little bit of room on the catch but I also think his teammates have to do a better job of screening for him away from the ball but it goes two ways hes got to keep moving without the ball this time Mark madsons got him bringing the ball up I like this idea kind of using him as a decoys a point and then try to get him the ball on a hand off or off a screen pin down on the week side Tim thats a great catch 14 points but 10 of those 14 coming at the free throw to get him on the ball here instead its Campbell with the left hand and Kell desperately needed that and it pins it down to a fivepoint game thats a good job by Campbell and dakovic just took the defense away allowed that middle penetration in after the unselfishness from pits theres the tap out and it will go back to Cal DJ Cs 62205 hes like a running back out there at the guard spot he just Powers through cunning Cummings Cummings doesnt have the strength yet yet to take him on hes got to force him away from that middle part of the floor coaching staff about Campbell says that he has nonstop motor he started the first four games for them but then sideline due to a groin injury where he missed six of seven theres a little bit of frustration there from Andre stovich hes not getting his normal looks that time he is running the point just put his head down and tried to thrust himself into the defense good job by Pittsburgh not fouling but protecting at 31 against Northwest states got a call away for the ball here looks like its going against money the 35th foul today 10 35 wow also got four techical fouls if you missed it kind of a wild end to the the first half that allowed in part for pit to get back into this game heres the foul left side of your screen they s a little screen on the outside Ms just trying to get through it I pass on that one but I didnt go to referee in school early enough in our career the veteran refs got to look at you got you cant disrupt the flow of the game iount of play thats a nothing play 35 ft from the basket second year at pit here for Zack Austin mentioned a shot blocking a ability threepoint shooting over 45 from three over a th Point score coming from from High Point a big piece to this pit Applause team pit back in the 23 theyll play a little tandem at the top theyll shift in the back theyll overflow overload a little bit on ball side and keep it out of the foul line area so yovich staying in the corner right beside us heres hson with five to shoot Campbell from 15 off the heel the whole way low gives it up to Austin delich read it perfectly for the Panthers I like that coaching by Jeff cable just changed the Rhythm every once in a while just give him a little dose of a new look on defense little out of control that time its a 2v one for the moments money from stakic Over Austin that time its a fivepoint game on the other end of the floor thats low slow to get up and you do not want to see that if youre a Panther fan hes a tough kid he just got bounced around a little bit I think the force of him off balance he hit the floor really hard and he got caught off balance with nowhere to go and this is what hell do on occasion you you dont want to Corral a player like jayen low but youve got to make sure he understands you got the green light most of the time but understand when you need to run the team and hes done a really good job with that especially here in the second half 22 11 this pit team last year 128 in the ACC they lost Blake Hinson and Carlton Carrington but one of the guys was low that was pointed out by the pit staff that really stepped up the season in many eyes from the media turned around last year when low was inserted into the starting lineup and his confidence really grew over time well hes got over a two to1 assistant turnover ratio for a guy who has the ball his hands all the time and has that ability to go score at well thats very very good numbers and so far this afternoon hes done a nice job of balance of running the team finding the open man and going to get his when he when needed pit will be in the bonus it is an Austin three over sto yakovich and lets see what what Cal can muster down by five black cheer gives it up its Wilkinson spinning around Cummings black share for three try to get on the board off the heel over sto yakovich leaping and theres Austin was a good look though cant complain with the offense the last few possessions Cal settled down a little bit more patient trying to get good looks about a sixminute droughts for the Panthers under nine to go in regulation at a fivepoint game as Cummings The Freshman doubled first career start for him its Diaz Graham oh boy he was fouled by Mahoney thats Forge and Mahoney cannot believe it should be three free throws up up Applause coming look like he got him on the arm little bit of a delayed call look where the ball is when he calls the foul the ball is well gone hits the floor then the fouls called whats really impressed me about the the twin brothers from the Canary Island Spain you look at them as bigs but when you pop on the tape and we saw this remember doing a pit fdu game a couple years ago with you Tim here is that just the shooting ability the numbers might not be there but the length that they have and the pris from Beyond from these bigs for pit from the twin brothers well I think G Modz gram is a guy that will get better I think good job staff does a really good job with Player Development and confidence you know understanding that listen hes not shooting the ball very well hes only 22 on the Year from the three but still allowing him to fire away knowing that it might be just a little bit of a confidence thing if he gets going he could really become another true threat from the three once they get in deep into the leag play thats his twin brother J who had surgery to repair a core muscle in May of 2024 its good to see him fight through the foot injury as well betrus M Tim hes playing with four fouls taking Jorge Diaz Grant with 10 to shoot blacker missed a three a moment ago five to shoot Wilkinson with the push off left hand strong but gets the contact on con and Wilkinson will go to the line in a sevenpoint game well thats a very good job by Cal they start out a little slow kind of looking at that zone running it from the outside but what pit is doing Dave is as soon as the ball goes into the middle of the floor or penetrates the threepoint line everybody matches up so theyre switching mid mid shot clock from Zone to man and theyre matching up and theyre staying home that time coming stayed home on sakovic and he was he was kind of Frozen on the Pere but they took advantage of it by Wilkinson just dribble driving into the Gap thats the one thing you want your team to do try to think too much out there looking at a defense trying to identify you just got to have to play when a team switches up mid stream on you you just got to play you got to get some movement get some player movement and try to attack off the bounce on ball reversal the 17th youngest player in the country Tim I got that almost to us hell turn 19 this is Wilkinson of Cal in March so its a team that has 16 new players to the Cal system under Mark Madson his pedigree at Utah Valley has mentioned early on getting them to the the NIT in 2023 and what hes done with this this Cal team attendance is doubled at Berkeley at hos Pavilion everybodys fired up to see them with that massive turnaround last year and what they can do and The Challenge from from going sixth in the Pack 12 to now playing of the riggers of the ACC you see the drought for pit trying to snap out of that here with Austin under 10 to shoot Blow pestered by door torge Diaz gra in front of his bench like we talked about a moment ago thats jayen low though dribble driving on the Baseline keeping his dribble alive head up he had one thing in mind not leave the floor and jump up and try to make a play but to wait for the defense to make a mistake and then retrieve Retreat it to the outside to G Mias Graham and just he was ready trying to break the Zone there into the high post they do to blackshire gets it back with five to shoot here for petritis foul inside I believe its going to be against kante and it will for pit at 728 to go in a ninepoint game this is what pit believes they can go to as they get into conference play play finding Modz Graham on the outside letting him get his feet set with Music confidence Taylor thank you very much Dave Leno Tim Welsh and our entire ACC Network crew happy New Year everyone with pit leading by 9ine over cal Its a cal team that was leading by 16 then we saw a lot of physicality and a ton of fouls 2 three in total in the first half then the tables really turn with Coran and low and Company for pit in the second half well pit match the intensity of cow Cal came right out and kind of shoved him around uh PS not used to getting shoved around they they can match that they just didnt at first and Jeff Cel got a little fired up and maybe thats why he got a technical maybe he wanted his team to take on the fire that he he has and uh theyve answered theyve responded low has been very good Corin has been very good setting screens at the top defensively rebounding the basketball and then as of late Diaz Graham knocking down shots the call out of the inbounds and havt that play over to Wilkinson who misses but hes got 19 that was a good look by petrius I didnt think it was a bad call out of the timeout well I would like to see him come down with it okay he really didnt have the good angle to finish the play buts scheme has been very good but that time low forcing the issue at The Rim hes got to look to dish that off a big block from dor that time blacker off trying to get on the board for the first time when we Face line here to yakovich they need him to get going late the best scor in the AC good close out on the perimeter especially when tried to put the ball on the ground black sure the kick out petrius fakes the three Coast in with the right hand thats a good finger roll and gets it to go good ball fak and dribble drive to the rim pit CAU caught a little bit slow on the backside with the help cour sets have looked more effective for Mark madsons team back down to a sevenpoint game with 625 at a turning clock here in the seconds but all low and Coran in the second stanza tend to shoot here for Jay and low with a kick out it is coming got it a timeout quickly called by Jeff cable and pits extending the lead to 10 oh good job by low I mean found people all afternoon because he keeps the dribble alive and he doesnt over dribble hes going somewhere with the dribble look at his head his head is up the whole time he sees Cal overh helping on the dribble drive and youve got to stay home if youre playing that ballside corner see blackshire hes in no mans landan he really is not in position to help on the drive to low hes got to stay home the helps got to come from the inside not the outside the Cummings Tim in the game with again the story with him the first career start for the Freshman from about 40 minutes away from linoln Park High School following in the footsteps of his brother Nelly whos in attendance theres Nelly great shot by our crew right there LED that that NCAA team from 22 to 23 in assists of Bowling Green to Colgate and in the living room of the Cummings home thats when Jeff cable not only recruited Nelly but also great picture here his brother little guy with the trophy and thats Brandon whos been delivering today its nice to have your big brother in the house and playing him oneonone hes got a little more size than his brother and eventually will become a very good point guard but hes learning under some good people with low and legging he just have a a Nerf basketball with a pit logo constantly have battles in the the Cummings household with all pit gear sto yakovich trying to get going from three they needed that to last time cies got caught ball watching got turned into the middle of the floor and he has been doing a really good job of staying attached to sakovich but he just extended way out and he got lost thats his first three in third field goal with 17 unfinish bidness for low heres to yakovich in a sevenpoint game with Jorge Diaz Graham on him the kick by low will stay on this end with Cal both teams doing a very good job of using their timeouts Mark Matson has tried to slow down every run that pits had just to make some adjustments not only with Subs but just scheme wise and theyve done a pretty good job against this Zone the last few possessions Wilkinson gives it up to Soy yakovich again now Austins on him not Diaz Graham rakovic the step back two the strong that time a really good job by Austin just not allowing stovich that angle to get to the rim and draw foul but all the numbers have escalated from his freshman year in Stanford to his a sophomore season here at Cal for sto yakovich 50 shooting for Pitts plus three on the boards for Cal it draws another contact thanks to low up top on blacker and thats his fourth should be a double bonus here for low at the line for pit and and look part of the big story line is a lot would be levied Tim as we documented on the shoulders of jayen low without Leed due to the ankle injury and I think hes handled it really well in the game especially starting with a freshman Cummings for the first time in the back well he has handled really well especially in the second half just adjusting to the defense understanding where he can get his shots his looks but that time on that black sh really a huge error in his fifth year basketball youre fouling jayen low 35 ft from the basket why you doing that youre putting them on the line youre give you might as well just give them two points youre trying to get back in this game just play solid defense let them then make the mistake dont guard him so tight and try to reach in 35 ft from the basket put him on the line it was a big hand a moment ago from Jorge Diaz Graham his twin brother guo in the same with Corin both are back in its a play with four fouls thats a good move by Wilkinson I would say hes a keeper from Mark Madson as freshman just playing with a lot of confidence got the strong body finishing traffic under control Wilsons got 2110 in the game with his four boards theres low Wilkinson yet again low tough shot for him to fade away that was no down well just kept his dribble kept his balance and when someones that good handling the ball and has such a soft touch on the fadeaway with great elevation its hard to defend I came in with the shooting numbers that werent that good four of his last 17 for low coming into the game but it shows you the prospect of what he can provide and not just you know with the threepoint shooting I know the numbers are down for low coming in at just 27 hes the best freethrow shooter on the team but what you can see on the dribble drives as Tim has pointed out sto yakovich for three way off that time theres the contest by Zach Austin you talked about with the length defensively Austin is a very good Defender and he is frustrating sakovich right now hes forcing the issue a little bit can make those shots we know but hes got to get him within the context of the offense but coming down to this end you know low is so impressive because Jeff cable little concerned maybe without like it in the game hes tries to do too much but he has been perfect in this second half running the team Austin for three thats what he can accomplish just like he did against Ohio state with 04 left at overtime to beat the Buckeyes gra really into it here at P I like his game too I mean hes hes a very good shooter but he doesnt force the issue and you weve already mention what hes done defensively so far for pit nor Diaz Graham tried to keep it in and thats what they can do because a lot of times on tape you got a four out one in with couron running the high post and Austin delivering from downtown well youre always worried when you go to the portal if someone will fit in looks good at one school maybe not at yours but Zack Austin has been terrific for Music Pittsburg been a much stronger pit team in the second half in large part due to the play of low and Corin you see the shooting from three and and Zack Austin providing that as well well its balanced save and balance is such to key to basketball and you worry about that tremendously when your team is overloaded with guard play and leg and low 35 points a game and you take out Le it and then you you dont have dun whos another guard at 11 points a game and you wonder how are we going to are we going to get to 80 points if we need to and you wonder whos going to step up and today its been Corin has stepped up but low is been the guy hes been the quarterback hes the guy who makes everybody better hes so unselfish but still he knows when to go get his and then of course Diaz Cameron has has been really good and I think he can be really good moving forward for pit and then Zach aw his defense and then his un really uncanny ability right when they need it to knock down shot thats on Cummings for pit to to start this 326 to go in regulation the 40th foul today Tim after four technicals at the into the first busy work here on New Years Day for for the officiating staff thats the stress level of coaching you come out of a timeout and your team fouls with a 12point lead three and a half minutes to go on a baseline inbounds foul stay on this end for Cal by the way jayen low leading pit with 21 points to go with his eight assists too shy of what could be his third consecutive double double with 10 plus assists Wilkinson also with a really good contest 21 points looking for 23 cant get the roll back tap there from Dort and into the hands of Austin and you see this team without ish legett without Damen Dunn and what theyre accomplishing here in this this comeback as C was up by 16 in the first half leads you to believe that that a postseason run I know its early were just starting conference play but a lot of belief here for pit theyre solid you watch them in the preseason in the preconference and you know theyre built to last theyve got depth theyre very well coached and terrific guard play that was Majestic from low ey Popp it what a game for jayen Applause low knew jayen low could do this weve seen him do it before they know the talent level he gets the mismatch against Mahoney he his eyes just light up knowing that if they dont double him out there hes going to school and but Corin is important Corin and Diaz Cameron G with Diaz Cameron those two guys if they can just step up their game to the level that they played today once they get leg it back and then they get done back now youre talking at Corin for losing a guy in fetty fed Rico kind of spots in for this team those quad one quad two wins we mentioned West Virginia LSU and at Ohio State for pit coming in at number 10 was ranked that was in the net rankings but was ranked in the AP Pole earlier this year no leg it today and low as we mentioned is teeing off leading all scorers with 24 and right on Q with 217 and a turning clock to go you know for Cal basically theyve got to get their defense organized where theyre they can match the physicality the toughness going on the road in a new conference and how you guys guard guys like that which is almost impossible when hes making threes from that range all loow today the crowd loves it here at the zoo and madsons team though a fun one to watch for cow was up by 16 in the first half sto yakovich looks downstairs to Campbell was inserted into the starting lineup because ol Joseph was out due to illness hes done it pretty much every way possible and here Cal gets caught on the on the switch they switch out on the perimeter but if youre going to switch youve got to switch you cant go out and just play 5et off a guy like jayen or else he will make you pay and thats what happened crowd loves their Panthers here on this New Years Day game what will be the eigh straight home win for pit this year unfinish business there at the charity strike for Campbell but a good game from him and and Cal as you mentioned with the newcomers smus been doing great under Andy edfield uh this year along with Stanford we mention with Kyle Smith and R now who who leads the nation in 10 double doubles those new teams its going to be a fun ACC season I like I like the new ACC its obiously geographically challenging for teams like Stanford and C but theyll figure it out I looking at the schedule I think the Leagues done a good job as well C goes from here move to Clemson on the weekend youre right and then Stanford comes from Clemson and they come here so yes we not going back and forth too many times on the across the country and Marks not going to go home with any timeouts and teaching moment for Mark Matson right on the money for this pit team they got Stanford on ESPN 2 on Saturday the tough schedule at Duke on January 7th Louisville is one of the toughest schedules in the Country Florida States been getting a lot of great play as well Clemson in action with Brad brells team we mentioned what Chase Hunter can do they beat Kentucky top Miami OT losses to Memphis and South Carolina for a Clemson side but it is hard sledding for p in all the the ACC schools in this conference Stanfords the team though I think that can emerge out of the teams that arent really being spoken about that are tournament teams at this time and usually we dont even look at that this early in the year here uh but these teams play such a difficult nonconference schedule its not like the old days where you just played you know the junior varsity and then got ready for your league now all these teams know that they have to get ready for the conference by playing good tough out of conference schedules and not only get ready for the conference but to have a strong resume moving forward Bruce Pearl doing great things at alurn led by John broom and Chad Baker mazera they beat Houston they also topped Iowa State in UNC and Iowa State off to a great start to the season much see you know you talk about we just spoke about it the you know playing The Varsity early yep and uh all those teams have gone out and challenged themselves cuz you cant just play Nobody and then step into league play and think that youre going to be ready and then especially if you put yourself in such a hole if you dont excel in the conference if you dont play anybody in the non League I think weve seen that over the years how teams have been left out of the tournament because they were didnt play enough good people before their league we mentioned one of the tougher strength of schedules a top 30 in that for Coach Cables team in pits extra possession thanks to Coran who we talked about a lot this afternoon Jorge Diaz Graham seeing his brother Mos twin brother doing things going to set the screen up top here for low brs got 1 three lost it in stride off of Wilkinson we stay on this end with three to shoot and I agree what you said a moment ago about Cal I think defensively if they get stronger under Madson in his second year youre going to see them rack up some wins in this league yeah theyre dealing with injuries too and if they get if they can get ho obviously that thats a big big thing for them especially defensive ly theyve got enough guys that can score got some inside presence got such a new team though its its its a tough run to have a new team and then youre traveling all across the country to play your opening game and now they got to go to Clemson but theyve got the right guy in charge that will understand how to manage this schedule Mark Madson talking to him last night you and I seems very confident about the team uh hes going to keep pushing them you see today he coached right to the and it doesnt matter theyre down by 15 points he used all his timeouts to help teach his team about every moment of playing on the road low misses tipped out by Coran over to Wilkinson 20 seconds to go yeah really excited to see what Cal can do the rest of the way as Corans going to foul out with Wilkinson going to the line shooting three to end this one just want to wish Tim you and your family and all our viewers on acc Network a very happy and healthy New Year in 2025 looking forward to seeing your coverage to him the rest of the way for one of my New Year resolutions is not to do this when a guy like Corin fouls a threepoint shooter and say to say you cant its not a smart move to foul threepoint shooter I think everybody knows that including Jeff capable but hell pass on the criticism for now itll be a film film session error tomorrow yeah 19 points 11 boards for Corin was out just want to thank our producer Jason Earl and director Jack Reynolds our statistici John pater in the great crew at pit they do a masterful job with their Productions Tim always great to be back with you on the call as well well very impressive win by pit and I credit the coaches the adjustments they made in game to get that man going because Cal came out with a very good game plan but pit responded made adjustments and proved that theyre a very good team moving forward in the ACC that is 14
