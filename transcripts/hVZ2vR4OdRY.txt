and they are four and three over the previous seven second straight start for Justin Taylor looking for a little bit more production from number five just two points in his last five games and one of 11 from the floor early in the year I mean he had 25 in the game against Bryant so you know the scoring is there this is Williams aggressively to the basket right off the opening tip for the orange carrying over from the pit game and that was one on two very confident move start off the game for him careerhigh 24 points against the Panthers on Saturday he made five threepointers five threepoint makes also a career high for the sophomore Betty Williams from Bowie Maryland I think youre going to see that zone extend out for Syracuse to try to cover threes and uh Kelly just took it a step further and knocks his first one down Miles Kelly the sophomore from Stone Mountain Georgia 71 made threes this season thats the best on the Georgia Tech roster Josh passner feels like theyve done well against the Zone theyve been able to score in the paint area but with this smaller lineup maybe a little bit more conducive to shooting the three Franklin tapped that one away as they tried to get it inside to Edwards while we have a sec Mike lets take a look at our Ford keys to the game GMan now we talked about it Georgia Tech they want to try to score inside Franklin has been on a on a roll lately for Syracuse get to the freethrow line thats how they had success in game one really outscoring the yellow jackets there and thats what Edwards will do backing down and making his way to the freethrow line Franklin picked up his first personal foul for Georgia Tech and if youre Syracuse thats exactly the guy you want to attack try to get Edwardson touches get Franklin in some foul trouble hey this you know Josh passner with this lineup is only playing six guys maybe seven if they get in foul trouble Steve three win for Syracuse at Georgia Tech on January 21st they had a 170 run in the first half and shot 55 percent in that first game Victory mic against the Yellowjackets a lot of good bigs in the conference this year Tom and uh certainly Jesse Edwards right there with that group shot blocker rebounder the key for him is to also stay out of foul trouble Edwards averages 27 blocks per game the best in the ACC Coleman launches a three Taylor pulled it down I see too many offensive rebounds out of this Georgia Tech Team mints with a double clutch in midair and Franklin grabbed it he got caught in between that time I think he wanted to pass the Edwards but they had him covered up in the LOB you just want to leave your feet with a purpose Georgia Tech scored 83 points in its win against Louisville that is Coleman knocking down the jumper look for Franklin in the short Corners in the back of that zone and he made a nice kick out to Pullman the 83 points against the cards the most in an ACC game this season for Georgia Tech he also shot 48 percent in that win against Louisville season high in an ACC game as well as that rattles out for mints thats not necessarily his game and hes shooting at 30 percent which is okay but hes much better when he gets into the plane hes only made 173 so far this season if youre Georgia Tech youre happy to see him settle for that shot look at Franklin just explode out of that corner and drive it to the basket you know I think hes listed at six seven Tom and that may be generous with Franklin but I said he he plays a lot bigger than that that was a strong take hes got incredible leaping ability and a quick First Step he just put it on display making the move past two Syracuse Defenders mids reloading for a threemike yeah and second Miss Lance Terry he hits and thats a three Coach Boeheim wants a timeout the senior Lance Terry knocking it down right in front of Coach bayheims bench and theres a Timeout on the court support Mike and has taken an early lead on the road a place where they have not won since 2019 perfect start almost for them four or five shooting two three from behind the arc early on Good Start good Rhythm good balance guys getting touches inside coach Pastor took the Georgia Tech program to the ACC tournament Championship back in 2021 defeating Florida state in the title game in Greensboro thats the destination this year as well after the stock in Brooklyn a season ago and that will stay with the orange final week of the regular season Mike it has gone by so fast theres still some things to be worked out yes here very much so and you know not only in the uh the bottom six but in in the middle as well the top four Applause freshman from Charlottesville Virginia just took it strong to the rack now the top four seeds really havent been decided although kit can determine its future at the tournament the best that Georgia Tech can do would be 12th and you would expect Mike the orange to be playing in the 89 game on the second day of the ACC tournament yep and uh you know and we see you talked about Virginia Tech coming from that Wednesday slot to win the championship last year it has been done means again and this time hes on target is challenging him to take that shot quick shot at the other end from Coleman Jesse Edwards grabbed the rebound theyre only sending one guy to the offensive glass maybe a half guy for Georgia Tech Sturtevant grabs the loose ball on the Run Kelly scoring the Pink Shoes tonight Coleman now for three picked that same spot on the floor just off the left wing look at mids charging to the basket score of the bucket and hes going to the line shoot him in followers on number zero Lance June of mens hit a threepointer and also drove to the basket got the foul on Sturdivant when we come back Mintz is at the freethrow line for the orange state to complicate things as well on Saturday yeah Clemson was very impressive on the road and and that coupled with NC State had been playing as well as anybody in the conference should be an exciting time in Greensboro North Carolina next week due to Mid standing at the free throw line for the orange by the way the 29th time Mike with the ACC tournament will be contested in Greensboro I know you are very fond of that City thats the only site I ever knew for the four tournaments that I was able to take part in uh so a very very near and dear to my heart my second favorite college uh Arena maybe my second favorite too Mike yeah Green Green Throw special Terry thats a three how about Lance Terry well and uh he did not play in the first game because of that hamstring injury and uh hes the one coming back from that he has been fabulous 12 points about just under 40 from three orange coming right back with Edwards well and I think you know if they go to him when he gets touches inside Franklin with that one foul is going to have to lay off a little bit defensively right now Jesse Edwards averaging a doubledouble with 14 points 101 rebounds per game second in the conference and Edwards was challenged by Franklin who won that battle hes not holding anything back and thats what you have to do against the shot clocker is attack in fact Im going right at him Gerard trying to get free for his shot hits the rim and Franklin elevates for the board Terry again no hesitation too strong Applause spin tough shot and he calculated the angle victory of difficulty has been extraordinary on his offense and you know I think really hes the guy that can beat you with a big game uh you know mints can go off Jesse Edwards can go off but when Gerard like he had 28 in the first game against Georgia Tech and theyre going to just lock in on him try to keep him quiet that was his first bucket of the game and now Terry again firing from the corner you know it took him some time to adjust from GardnerWebb and to to get used to playing in the ACC but since coming back from that hamstring its been solid 304 from threepoint real estate and nine points for Lance Terry Gerard The Catch and Release and he answers with a three of his own you know youre righthanded and you swing into the shot that way its very rhythmical um its tough to get yourself squared up the other way but its very natural coming the way he did Sturdivant with a three and its raining inside the Dome tonight Mike so far nine of the 12 shots that the Georgia Tech has attempted its been three and theyve made five of them mint stumbles against Coleman Franklin deflected it out of bounds and that is orange basketball Clarence Armstrong John Gaffney Brent Hampton our officials this evening inside the Dome although coach Pastor tried to make the call as well the officials did not agree in a teaching moment on the sideline with Benny Williams and the Hall of Famer the Nate Smith Hall of Famer Jim behind theyre playing on Jim Boeheim court tonight Mike yes we are man could it be named after anybody else and why just inside Edwards is having his way seeing a nice match up early on with Franklin and Edwards going at each other 47 years as the head coach his whole life of the orange program as a player class of 66 freshman walkon in 1962 Music played in the NCAA tournament assistant coach Jimenez amazing and another three and this one for Georgia Tech comes from Miles Kelly you know you look at the the opponents over the year against Syracuse and a lot you know they force you to shoot that three with the Zone Edwards does not get the roll Applause Terry On The Run accelerating to the rim fouled and score it and thats the one thing Georgia Tech will do theyll look to get up and down theyll be opportunistic when they run Terry doesnt knock down to three but he gets a chance to make it the oldfashioned way theyre showing no ill effects of that injury very quick and nice job up the floor not too many times on the dribble a couple passes in a layup Applause its for Terry who now has 12 points already in the first half Mike above his season average of 94 points per game for Lance Terry but Gardner Webb transfer and pays for a couple of hundred Point performances here early on Gerard stop and start leaned into it lost the handle I think he was expecting some contact Mike it was a little bit off balance wow thats the thing which you have to do is you have to concentrate on the shot if the contact comes be ready for it but go through that dont anticipate it sturdiven free throw line and the orange taking a timeout after the Sturdivant jumper its an 80 run for Georgia Tech first its Terry getting a three and then Miles Kelly does the same yeah Franklin in his last six ACC games averaging a doubledouble with 15 points 10 boards and shooting 61 percent in his Yellow Jacket teammates on defense driving and bouncing off on the Chance by Brown into the game for the orange the free throw line was a big Advantage for Syracuse in that game its starting to build into that right now this will be the fourth and fifth attempts for the orange here early in the game 57 from the stripe on the season formerly Brown The Freshman from Culpepper Virginia I think if youve got something to burn better to put him on the line than let him have a layup because of that percentage he did not score in the game at Pitt on Saturday played six minutes hes in the box score now with the free throw its brown at Georgia Tech in late January had 18 points a season high for the freshman Across the 11minute Threshold of the first half Coleman a few feet behind the line Taylor high for the board trying to beat Franklin for it it goes out of bounds and well stay with Georgia Tech Taylor could not save it couldnt track it down that was actually a very good defensive possession for Syracuse they covered the three Force Coleman into a tough shot but couldnt get the couldnt get the rebound despite that Miss Georgia Tech shooting 69 percent as a team 11 of 16 so far from the floor Syracuse not far behind its 57 percent field goal shooting in the first half both of these teams defensive numbers are not outstanding right around the middle of the pack in the ACC wow three for three on threepoint tries Miles Kelly take three shots score nine points thats efficiency yes sir Edwards lost the handle off the fingertips Sturdivant runs it up Mario pasta Terry in the corner right back to Sturdivant Williams who just came in for Taylor pulls in the board Gerard able to keep it alive Sturdivant to near steal Williams Thats it Applause Benny Williams came into the game converting on just 15 threes for the season knocking that one down for Williams Applause Kelly shot was too strong Applause and thats a you know again Syracuse is having trouble theyre getting the Miss early on but this is the second time they couldnt come up with the rebound and there was really nobody around for Georgia Tech coach bayheim 1014 career victories second most behind Coach K and about another hundred plus for that Kelly front rim got fouled on the threepoint attempts July grimacing you know its the last thing you want to do in that situation put somebody at the line especially a guy whos just under 90 from the line Miles Kelly at the free throw line boy this lineup is impressive to me Thomas so you know Ive seen him you know I play on on tape and on TV but uh hes Josh pastner has taken this group a while but hes settled on something good here yeah this group the starting lineup and limited substitutes have averaged 73 points per game over their last seven games and its above their season average and they have not substituted I think there will be a substitutes yeah points yeah that may be it but well see Gerard extending the range Edwards had the rebound the foul goes against the orange its the first on Edwards so cymer Torrance will come into the game for the orange and his minutes have really kind of dried up recently averaging about eight minutes a game over his last seven and I think thats just the expand or the play that Mintz has had and uh you know plus Gerard playing well you were talking about the starters Mike playing so many minutes for Georgia Tech recently Lance Terry along that sideline zero in old gold for Georgia Tech hes played the full 40 minutes four times this season and theyve all been ACC wins so well see if he stays in there for the entirety of this game four inbounds pass Mintz intercepts drives on Kelly got his own Miss Sturdivant in the neighborhood and may have clipped mince on the way up down up you know where that ball was inbounder for Georgia Tech is not an easy place to play and uh that had the Syracuse did a nice job of getting the turnover 74 free throw shooter shooter Applause theres your one substitute Jalen Moore comes in for Georgia Tech Franklin goes out yeah I think that more than anything and Franklin it did a nice job playing that stretch with that early one foul didnt get a second one lets see uh Josh pastors probably going to see how long he can ride this lead so Williams just came out for the orange Copeland is in 24 in white blue and orange first time weve seen extended defense by Syracuse at the floor Paris is a steal Oakland does not have the numerical Advantage lost the handle then got fouled yeah he got really bailed out on that play the fifth team fouled by Georgia Tech so not shooting free throws but he was a little out of control second on Coleman you know the Georgia Tech didnt react well to that full court pressure and I think that more than anything if they dont get the steal at least gets them out of out of their rhythm in the half court Edwards had to send it back out Edwards turns and shoot way down and out again especially with Franklin out of the game a shot you want him taking third of it really solid Edwards at the other end with a rim fender for the orange what a great pass ahead two from half court Applause Music Applause the inside of eight minutes to go in the first half Sturdivant again with a turnaround got a soft Dome bounce for two more and Kyle Sturtevant has been really solid in the middle part of that zone you want to get a guy there who can pass and who can shoot the ball hes had a couple of foul line jumpers Georgia Tech is led by as many as 10 so far in this first half versus mince in the paint front rim he wanted a foul didnt get it Mike and then Sturtevant turns it over with a travel pastner upset with that thats an unforced turnover so there is a Timeout on the court its 7 31 to go in the first half your look from right behind the backboard and Edwards slams it home Music back inside the Dome Georgia Tech firing away from threepoint distance Yellow Jackets seven of 14 Miles Kelly has 11 points Mike last four 1636 from three coming into this game so seeing a big basket from there just continuing here he said great looks not a lot of pressure he is the Georgia Tech leading scorer on the season 134 points per game yeah I thought looking at this and you know in Georgia Tech only four freethrow attempts in the first half so far I thought theyd have to make north of 15 threes and theyre tracking right on that pace uh at the moment they only average about seven and a half made threes per game eighth of the conference they are above that average or right on it roughly right now Copeland Edwards the catch in the Finish yeah in in the paint area hes had his way and theyve done a nice job loving to him running the floor exceptionally well as he always does double figures for the 24th time this season Jesse Edwards and you know the good thing I mean with Georgia Tech I mean theyre converting on their threes but theyre not putting any pressure on Edwards and hes not picking up fouls Coleman shot clock down a two for Terry in trouble Applause much better job defensively by Syracuse that time 52 from the floor for the orange three of seven again you know when you have the shot clock when it gets on your back against Syracuse its tough to do anything off the dribble getting into the the lane Gerard Williams and mince have made threepointers for the orange shot clock goes inside a 10 Applause three is Off the Mark late in the shot clock one of eight on the year from three probably not the shot Syracuse had dialed up right there so Copeland comes out quick discussion with Coach behind see how Georgia Tech deals with this pressure Sturdivant one man fast break got it right back they are really locked in on where Lance Terry is and hes primarily been over in that left corner thats where hes taken all of his shots from cymer Torrance picks up the foul for the orange the senior from right here in Syracuse the transfer from Marquette they got the three guards out there on the floor right now and if if theres going to be a guy to collect fouls you know Torrance can use his full compliment Georgia Tech made 12 threes in its win against Louisville at home on Saturday Franklin off the Miss from Terry with the rim rocking follow for the yellow jackets you know they got one guy going to the going on the offensive glass nobody got a body on him everybody was watching the shots fabulous finish Edwards Music trying to muscle it down against Franklin Edwards skillful to the goal you know Franklins still giving him latitude on those moves inside Jesse Edwards at 58 from the floor on the season second best of the ACC Kelly way behind the line used to be a Coleman who wore an orange uniform who played in this building Mike yeah not bad number 44 good defense from Georgia Tech produces a turnover just one of their last seven from threepoint distance after starting six of ten on threepointers right you knew that number was going to come down a little bit they do a Colgate impression inside the Dome Kelly from the corner right in front of the coach Gerard bumps going through the lane he traveled Clarence Armstrong is there was a foul but it was after he had shuffled his feet Music Jim Boeheim coaching in his 1454 career game Mike he has seen a thing or two National Championship in 2003 that team will be honored this weekend and on Saturday Franklin almost lost the handle Kelly watch out he is ripping the ropes for Georgia Tech this is the third time out the Jim Bay Heights called the first half Miles Kelly 17 points 507 from three how about Jayvon Franklin grabs it out of midair and slams it for the jackets Music the orange trying to get it done inside Mike for Edwards with 12 points to lead the way and hes been very efficient 57 now we saw the run out dunk right there but hes been playing around the rim for most of the first half needs some help Memphis got eight points but there you see the double doubles only two rebounds so far in the game for Edwards but youve got to think hes going to be hes already got the front half of that double double taken care of he is our Fresh Market discover the best Jesse Edwards the senior from Amsterdam the Netherlands out of IMG Academy in Bradenton Florida he and his teammates trailing with four minutes in change to go in the first half inside the Dome second to last regular season game as Syracuse will host wake on Saturday and thats mints Syracuse shooting 54 but theyre down by 11 right now the offense okay its just a threepoint shooting for Georgia Tech whos been off the charts shoot events with six of nine shooting in the lost that pit had 16 points right on his season average shot clock is down to five Dion Kelly and poked Away by Brown three seconds on the shot clock that nothing they got no probing inside that time everything around the perimeter and Syracuse able to lock in on each pass Applause Sturtevant needs to shoot it its deflected by Edwards mints not the defender in the air and then plays it off the backboard he worked Coleman all the way around himself before and there was no read between him and the basket but that last defensive play was terrific by Edwards he knew there was not a lot of time to gather so he was able to go up on the catch and get a piece of that threepoint attempt to start the break all right again deep in the shot clock for Sturtevant and he rocks that one home I mean theres theres been some ridiculous depth but some of the threes taken in this game and made by Georgia Tech Taylor inside follow the court this is almost hes almost out by the s ick I mean thats a good six feet behind the threepoint line 27 28 feet away easy 22 feet one and threequarter inches is that line its a little bit closer in the corners of course thats a harder shot Music Applause they can uh you know they they need him to come alive and Georgia Tech has been kept him under control for most of the first half Applause eight points for Gerard couple of made threepointers its now 294 threepointers made by Gerard in his career Miles Kelly looking for another one comes up short hes made five threes and two consecutive games now despite that Miss Ed Franklin given a little bit of support and Gerard on that three ass threaded inside to Edwards soft touch off the glass without fouling yeah and you know for right now I mean its a great take he knows that Franklin doesnt want to pick up that second personal foul little 50 run by the orange Mike yeah its you know get a little bit of a run going in half shot clock to seven tournament dumped it low Kelly Edwards is all over him swaps it away and recovers Edwards made that play almost by himself Brown trying to save it on the Baseline Terry put the shoulder into mints and miss we run it up and down the court with mince who gets fouled on the drive Applause endtoend action orange and yellow jackets and Miles Kelly as his first personal foul Applause Terry a little upset he didnt get a whistle on the other end but uh smart play by Syracuse to run it right up their backs three for three yeah and 12 points five assists for him really solid first half well we have a second mic a message from Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo so 70 orange run after the free throws by mince who leads the ACC and steals almost two per game shot clock down again Kelly inside Franklin full of Slam and he got fouled by Taylor and thats just really good Patience by Georgia Tech yeah the shot clock on their back didnt force things and uh Franklin for the most part its been quiet but a terrific half for him a chance to get to 97 Wards has three assists as well 17 assists on 19 May field goals for Georgia Tech and that went off of the orange after the Miss by Franklin at the line Applause Coleman on the inbounds Music five seconds between shot in Gamecock Applause inside a 10 on the shot clock 10 made threes in the first half Georgia Tech sturderman turns around comes up short theres Franklin right in front of the end of the shot clock Gerard gave it to mince who missed on the three in front of the game clock and so Georgia Tech will take a 5344 lead to the locker room after shooting 57 percent as a team and making 10 threes in the first broadcast position here at Jim Boeheim court inside the Dome Syracuse New York ACC basketball so glad that you are with us I was watching Georgia Tech warm up in the second half and their perimeter guys nobody stepped inside the threepoint line for there any of their practice odds lets see if they can keep that Torrid shooting going after making 12 with a winning effort on Saturday against Louisville Applause first shot from Kelly is a long rebound Miss and its not an overwhelming stat but Georgia Tech getting more Second Chance opportunities than they should Coleman and thats where you know theyve got when theyve just settled to passing the ball in the perimeter they have not gotten good looks but when that ball goes in and out its got the inside touch they got a much better look from three nine second chance points in the game for Georgia Tech heres a steal Franklin all the way to the basket and another slam that was the first pass to the fast break you get that pass a turnover going back out to half court and a guy who runs is and you got Edwards whos pretty quick in his own right but hes not going to chase Franklin down first five points of the second half belong to the yellow jackets missed from Gerard hes trying to get going he had to grow through the quiet first half I think its really the size of uh you know Georgia Techs guards that bothered him a little bit theyve had a little taller cover on him points in the first half for the orange leading scorer JoJo Gerard Kelly lost the handle in the corner it will stay with the yellow jackets 11 made threes in the game Georgia Tech Applause shot clock at five for Franklin sends it out to Terry he hits another three and I tell you what Franklin has been fabulous in this game his fourth assist its been kind of lurking in those short corners and Jim Boeheim another timeout Applause foreign Applause Music of that half a 120 run which is our second half 6144 theres our Coyote Tractor Turning Point 80 run to start the half and starter right and then picked up right where they left off three of four two three from behind the arc heres the heres the thing to look at it too Tom youre at Georgia Tech right now shooting 59 from the floor all right theyve missed 16 shots theyve got seven offensive rebounds for 12 points thats just too much to overcome Applause Edwards trying to get away from Franklin you can be a little bit more aggressive right now in this half and he is at a terrific oneonone defensive play there in the post basketball coming our way right to GMan he was ready to shoot Im always ready once you pass it inside to GMan dont expect it to come back yeah they called me the black hole for a reason the AllAmerican from duke light disappeared in the post when it went in there thats why they call it a black hole Yeah gravitys so strong not even light can escape but I digress shot clock is seven Applause Kelly theyre just flipping that ball around a Terry and thats a three in front of his own bench I mean their their execution offensively has been Flawless in this game six for their last nine from three and Edwards drops the hammer at the other end for the orange right now theyre playing two for three and this is uh you know Syracuse has to get some stops you know in that game that pit on Saturday Syracuse watch the Panthers launch 413 attempts and make 16 of them foul on Edwards on the push and its been a similar view well and you know the thing is you know against this Zone you want to be front running you want to be shooting with especially the three and what it does is spaces everybody out get that extra pass or Court Cross Court pass get good looks Terry leads the way with 18 points double team on Franklin and a foul is called Edwards and Copeland in the neighborhood thatll be the first on quadir Copeland The Freshman from Philadelphia Pennsylvania Edwards recovered defensively as Franklin was going in for the dunk what a pass Williams from mints and he was met in midair Franklin returning the favor on the other end Sturdivant right into Copeland whistling foul you know you look at a guy I thought I compare him with omir you undersized but but a bigger body and you say all right I get the dominant thing but you look at Franklin man he just almost like Bill Russell the way he gets up and the way surprises you with his shot blocking ability Applause time for CPI Security Mike protecting the paint well get to that in a sec well start a minute the free throw line Applause you mentioned Franklin 14 should no Meer yeah at least yeah DJ told DJ Burns in the mix from North Carolina State you know you know I think it took those guys coming from mid major programs a little a little while to adjust to the size Copeland recovers and misses Applause side Franklin right back out to Terry and he hits another three and hes all smiles up the court and a high five from Kelly and we may be witnessing a triple double here by Franklin eight rebounds six assists for him plenty of time left in this game Franklin lost it out of bounds so its been all Georgia Tech at the start of our second half Jayvon Franklin and his teammates extending the lead here in the second its in Franklin and they have been stepping up Music four blocks in the game for Jesse Edwards leads the conference in blocks per game but right now it is the orange Edwards and his teammates in a sizable hole Mike here in the second half against visiting Georgia Tech yeah and I like the fact too Franklin is hes much more aggressive defensively has two fouls he picks up that third things could change a little bit Gerard quick shot its just uh offensively Syracuse really out of sync in this half one seven now but its just the quality of shot that theyre getting is not good and this is after both teams Mike of the first half shot 57 percent Edwards produces a steal yeah nice job over playing Franklin out front Williams lays it in Applause could that be a turning point for the orange yeah and now you know we talked about Jesse Edwards as a shot blocker but showing his ability to get out on the floor and play some uh some defense as well 35 Steals on the year looks like the orange Mike moving to a mantoman defense and that does not stop Miles Kelly who went by the bigger Edwards yeah and well you know what you drove him off the threepoint line but that length able to get in and finish Copeland in a congested area Applause looking for assistance gotta from mince he was tripped on the way up and it appears that Mintz will go to the freethrow line elevating to the rim good to see him up and walking just caught a foot right there with Kelly and lets see uh you know he converts on both of these free throws and Syracuse pushes up and uh applies a little fullcore pressure Vince is five for five from the stripe of the game yep every point so valuable at the Orange attempt to make a comeback in this one as mince converts on the second free throw George attacked with a nine point halftime lead and the threepointer has been their chosen weapon tonight 14 made threes on 27 tries for Georgia Tech Applause that is twice as many made threes Mike as they average per game Coleman shot clock down to three Gerard runs it up for the orange after the Miss well I think Josh Pastor knew they had to shoot at that sort of uh clip to have a chance in this game mints too strong log rebound to Terry again Ill say Georgia Tech will take that shot from mids its about the only thing that mince does not do at a very high level just 30 percent on the season from threepoint real estate that bounces out for Coleman Applause all of a sudden the rims are unkind to both teams a little bit of a drought here for uh Georgia Tech Gerard on the foul Terry fouled them Applause second on Lance Terry to his disbelief thank you heres the look again you know dont block the shot and just get a hand up in that situation you know the more as we look at the last 13 35 here that Syracuse can score without the clock running is going to be to their benefit s first trip to the line tonight for Joe Gerard 85 percent from the line best on the Syracuse roster and fourth in the ACC you know it truly is amazing too with with tech only six guys who still played and really more only a few minutes didnt score its been the starting five for the whole game same lineup for eight straight Games Starting for Josh pastner and nobody complaining about minutes Joe Gerard the senior from Glens Falls New York Applause trying to get behind the team especially in the defensive end of the floor to get a stop Torrance you know things change when Syracuse goes mantoman Applause Kelly down the lane his pass goes out of bounds and probably nobody shocked more than Georgia Tech playing against his team theyve had a couple of turnovers now against this uh man thats seven turnovers for the game for the yellow jackets Torrance Williams that was a two Mike lets see uh well Josh Pastor stolen 19 point or so 17point game how long he goes before he uses a timeout gonna let his team play through it on this possession Yellow Jackets seeking their first ACC Road win of the season weve had some close calls Sturdivant put a little backspin on that one soft bounce on the heel and it drops boy Ill tell you what though the offense really runs well and great right after a made basket mints just converted her about five seconds Applause youve got to find him and stop the drive up the floor 17 points for Judah Mintz leading freshman scorer in the ACC as Kelly misfires and now four of eight from threepoint distance second half for Georgia Tech Gerard on Terry put the shoulder into him I dont know if thats necessarily Joe Gerards strength right there Applause Georgia Tech went six of ten on threes to start the game then just one of seven now seven of their last 10 you know and this is whenever a stop at the play and theres an Under 12 coming up Georgia Tech is going to have to talk about playing against this man Franklin from Sturtevant and theres the guy you go to Applause seven of eight 14 points for him nine rebounds seven assists Music four players in double digits for Georgia Tech after the Torrance Miss led by Lance Terry with 21 points Terry around the edge over Edwards Franklins in there kept it alive for Kelly thats a three from Miles Kelly and heres what happened Edwards is going to go for the block Franklin just followed right in behind him to get the offensive rebound that was Torrance on the Move offensive foul against the orange Applause there is a Timeout on the court Miles Kelly the leading scorer in the game for Georgia Tech hes got 22 and six made for our zMAX Max performance and putting on a show and a jacket uniform tonight yeah I mean 18 and a half or 17 and a half points in his last score hes uh moving that number up and just as soon as youve seen a big big basket all game long especially from from Deep six of his seven made field goals from three probably should have expected this from Miles Kelly his four games prior to tonight he was averaging 17 points per game and shooting 48 percent from the floor and he has backed it up with a 22 Point performance and that number leads everybody tonight his teammate Lance Terry has 21 points and he is our Max performance sponsored by zMAX Miles Kelly and really balanced scoring two Debo Coleman is the only one struggling from the floor one of eight from three but everybody else having a terrific night oh Syracuse staying in that mantoman lets see after that time out of Georgia Tech executes a little bit better Coleman into traffic puffed it up Torrance had it poked Away by Terry Sturdivant couldnt save it this is mince the last thing you do is save it under to the other teams basket just take the turnover right there and set your defense giveaway two Applause 20point game the largest lead for Georgia Tech 23 points here in the second half after leading by nine at halftime Applause Franklin touches the ball and the offense runs through him good things happen lets see if you can bail him out at the end of the clock one second on the clock Franklin got it away Edwards defended it well Applause closest call this season for Georgia Tech on the road was that way Forest midFebruary really nice man defense inside getting the steal moving your body readjusting jackets lost by a point on the road at wake 7170 this is Coleman for three front rim and Edwards file at the other end Applause remember Georgia Tech has won three of its last four Mike four of its last six four and three in their last seven games and they completed the home schedule with four straight wins playing some of their best basketball of the Season Torrance inside from Edwards centers are passing the ball well in this game good find one thing to keep in mind too Syracuse does not have a timeout left in this game Tom 45 left sometimes you just have to shake the guys hand and go down the other end of the floor that is a new career high for threes made in the game for Miles Kelly Gerard cant find the range from threepoint distance smack dribble from sturdiv and then he goes old school with the runners well and Edward was was caught in between there was nobody there to to guard Sturtevant and the lead is back up to 23 folks inside the Dome stunned Edwards still fighting hes got two Georgia Tech has not won inside the Dome since January of 2019 defeating the RN 7359 really the only threepoint threat that Syracuse has out there is Gerard and theyve locked in on him so theyll uh theyll play twopoint basketball with Edwards inside right online for Kelly and somehow that bounced out mints Applause good job not fouling mints in that situation and bailing him out Kelly with a Miss in tight ball back to the orange both teams still shooting over 50 percent for the game they both shot 57 percent in the first 20 minutes Applause against ACC opponents this season on their home court out of the double to Torrance Applause Edwards standing around by Syracuse no ball movement no player movement just look at the body language with the Georgia Tech players and they are just playing with Supreme confidence well and uh theyre starting now with this man to use the clock a little bit too being a little patient in each possession Terry twisting his body awkwardly he got it back for a three he shoots that low liner three Mike and its money for Terry 17 made threes in the game and still time to go Terry now has seven made threes thats a career high for him Sturtevant on the turnover oneonone with mince with the bump Applause Georgia Tech maintaining its lead as Mintz picks up his second phone personal foul Lance Terry and his teammates all over the orange stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer prior to the start of that season finished 30 and five and a national title well you know the prognosticators have gotten some things wrong and I you know I I dont know that anybody thought about Carmelo Anthony as a freshman you know having that type of year so well well let him off the hook a little bit but just the dominant performance he had 20 points in the title game Jerry McNamara made six threes at 18 points and the orange brought home the championship it was a much brighter Outlook than tonight Mike its been a struggle most of the evening for the orange really kind of a shocking you know I I agree we knew that Georgia Tech was better but this type of output especially in the way they did it shooting the way they did from behind three Franklin with a double double as well hes closing in on potentially a triple double they havent had one of those since 2011 at Georgia Tech not and you know that for Syracuse the switch to man to man something drastic had to happen and uh even that has slowed Georgia Tech bands so both of these teams with one more game this week coming up on Saturday Ill head to the ACC tournament in Greensboro North Carolina this is Coleman for three of the 173s the most under Josh Pastor for Georgia Tech mince was driving and got hit Georgia Tech is at Boston College Mike coming up Saturday second foul on Sturdivant checking on Franklin he just needs two assists right 14 points and 13 rebounds and hes hes actually had the pass that a couple of shots have missed that were wide open looks too its got two blocks two steals to go along with that potential triple double five double doubles in his last six games eight on the season for Jayvon Franklin We featured him at the top of the broadcast and for good reason well you know and the thing is too that you know a lot of times youll see stats front end loaded against maybe a weaker nonconference schedule but hes done his best work in conference you know by a lot leading rebounder for Georgia Tech this is off of 21 points to lead the team and 13 rebounds against Louisville the home win on Saturday averaging a doubledouble for his last seven ACC games as Mike mentioned so strong in conference for number four in old gold and blue looking for the assist that he got it he got it to Miles Kelly and thats gonna put him Mike nine one assist away from a triple double and Ill guarantee you everybody out on the floor knows where hes at number one this is the offense has been terrific when hes when its run through him and hes been making decisions there have only been four triple doubles all time for Georgia Tech the last one was 2011 that was Iman Shumpert against Virginia Tech at home so were keeping an eye on that potential triple double for Jayvon Franklin hes played in many locations coach bayheim has to watch his team kind of trudged through these last few minutes Franklins a transfer from Auburn and South Alabama first year in the Georgia Tech program hell allow that bucket for Brown some portal guys who have made a difference PJ Burns has been terrific for NC State out of Winthrop University in the Big South yeah Appleby at the back to back portal guys door Chad OMeara and Nigel pack yep for Miami a team that could still be tops from the ACC Clinton post for BC and Stephen Coleman who has had an off night the only yellow jacket you can say that second three for Coleman Sturdivant Terry try to jam it Torrance went up tried to meet him Applause well sort this out when we come back it was Terry hanging on the rim and well take a look at it when we come back with Coach pastors team way in front on Saturday Lance Terry one of the potent scorers in that Georgia Tech lineup Terry in the game with 24 points Trails only Miles Kelly with 28 for the team lead in eight of 13 is Good from the field but when youre seven of ten three you know take 10 shots there and score 21 points that is uh you know that is just huge and then you know we talking about you know 94 points that the team makes 18 of 37 threes against you thats a lot to overcome for any defense that was our worth the watch presented by Principal Financial if youre a Syracuse fan you might want to turn away if youre Georgia Tech theyve made 18 threes Mike that is a School record because the 17 threes was tied with the single game record for back in 2001 against Clemson and then Coleman made another three its a new school record tonight for Georgia Tech on made threes in a single game amazing simply an amazing performance on the road all right Applause Applause Music Rim rocker for the orange not going to be nearly enough tonight they drilled by just nine at halftime Georgia Tech came flying out of the locker room Kelly again Franklin is one assist away from the first triple double since 2011 shot clock at three Coleman Franklin got it second offensive Rebound in a row thought maybe Terry would shoot that because he got the pass from Franklin yeah I think while just Josh pastner put up the third base coach stop sign I would watch the third base coach hes not waving you in sometimes you got to run through that no laughing matter for the orange Mike they have to regroup quickly at home they play Saturday against the week and they certainly need to make a run at the tournament to have any shot of postseason hopes I mean realistically winning gonna have to win it yeah gonna have to win it last year they made the quarterfinals Applause also made the quarters in 2021 losing to Virginia in Greensboro you know now a and I know that you know the coaches theyre not surprised by certainly but you know just facing this Georgia Tech Team a little bit different than it was in January and you can say the same thing about Boston College Music absolutely species on the road tonight against Wake Forest and theyve got to lead late in that one theres the shot there it is triple double and the bench knew it too Kelly hit the jumper Franklins got assist number 10 they havent credited it yet but thats it was definitely him who threw the ball out official score readout still says nine assists for Javon Franklin and theyre taking them out of the ball game too so Mike weve got a running playbyplay on our monitors and the assist has been credited to Lance Terry so not Franklin Applause follow bucket Brown Applause so Franklin out of the game with 14 points 15 rebounds and right now the nine assists because I I look like it looked like he just he tossed it out to him and he made shot him Im almost positive it was him where you know that should have gotten the assist maybe well get a look at it it was again credited to Lance Terry according to our readout so theres Franklin here it is and just he gives it off the Kelly I mean thats thats an easy thats going to be corrected thatll be corrected I mean theres Visual Evidence right there theres no doubt that it was Franklin with the handoff to Miles Kelly for the jumper so even though officially right now hes given nine assists and now Terrys coming out of the game as well Lance Terry with 24 points by the way Miles Kelly 30 points Mike yeah you got youve got two 20point scorers in a 30point score in this Five Guys basically have scored for Georgia Tech those 30 points easily the best scoring performance by a Georgia Tech player of the season in fact Miles Kelly had it at 24 he was tied with Lance Terry they both had scored 24 in a game prior to tonight but its 30 by Miles Kelly Georgia Tech has made some substitutes now Mike yeah I know it but just just an incredible performance Applause 359 seconds to go and the Georgia Tech side of the box score is eyepopping as Mike just said two 20point scores a 30point scorer and a guy with a triple double 18 made threes School record and what we think is going to be a triple double again officially it has not been changed but we just showed you the video evidence and how about Devo Coleman didnt shoot the ball well but he had eight assists 18 threes on 39 tries that is 46 Mike jaminsky and 27 assists on 35 made field goals I mean if coach Pastor could bottle this effort up he would and they could sell it for a pretty penny and nine only nine turnovers hard to find any deficiencies in their first ACC Road victory of the season for Georgia Tech it took a little while but it was worth the wait and theyre going to improve the 13 and 17 as they try for another three that one from Coleman Boyd he was one of the seniors who was honored prior to the game on Saturday Nico Ruffin with the layup and the final seconds will take off the clock how about this win by the yellow jackets Mike 9676 is the final their first win inside the Dome since 2019 and Coach pastors team came to play tonight especially from Beyond The Arc well and it was you know it was really right from the start I mean Georgia Tech came out ready they were knocking down threes Jim Boeheim had a call a number of timeouts in that first half just to try to rain some things in
