goals made per game I think the other big number theyve cut down on their turnovers and thats going to be key in this game tonight on the road this is not going to be an easy pass though for Pittsburgh at home our officials tonight Bert Smith Clarence Armstrong Ted Valentine Pittsburgh and white Louisville and red we are underway from the Pete Cardinals win the opening tip pocket you talk about the fight that Louisville fans want to see Kenny Payne want to see see it on the opening tip off right there yeah the energy again credit Kenny Payne and staff theyve done a good job they could have easily packed this thing in and we had a chance to speak with him yesterday and Ive been impressed though with how hes been able to keep these guys fighting in the season that has been a struggle and as you said as of late been playing really well take a look at the Cardinals starting five they go right inside to Sydney Curry who cant come up with the opening bucket Applause starting five so much balance from these five transfers that have come in and given this proud pit program new life Music Applause Im gonna say it again set it into top but hes a guy underrated I think when you start talking about some of the best players not just in the ACC but in college we said right now he is the only guy I think 16 shooting over 50 percent and close to five assists per game last time showing off the midrange game now Alice contested deep three goes begging Applause Burton tries his luck again this time off the mark see Louisville last through the ACC in points per game L Ellis has more than a quarter of their scoring Jalen Withers has gotten in on the act as of late but just lacking that consistency from any bench production and somebody really outside of Alice and Withers Jeff Capel in year number five is pit head coach Joe lunardi has the Panthers as a projected eight seed I wouldnt be surprised if that seating is improved come selection Sunday Im not sure what the numbers and how they calculate all this BPI and that all that but they have some very good wins in ACC play and again Jeff people another guy that should be at the top of the discussion talk about hoax of the year in the ACC doing an outstanding job with this program this year and we showed you the standings a half game back of Clemson they are right in the thick of this tight ACC race and looking broadly at the NCAA tournament as the Panthers desperate to get back into March Madness look at what theyve done in q1 in particular five and two in Quad one eight wins across quad one and quad two I mean thats what the committees telling us that theyre dialed in on and Jeff capels team an impressive resume on that front and Im you know again not sure all the calculations are a lot more smart people doing that but Id be hardpressed to find too many teams in college basketball but with the resume that they have Marius Burt took a shot to the face referees still letting him play on but something were certainly going to watch hes just play progresses shot clock winding down into the lane scoop to the hoop beats the buzzer Mike James theyre gonna take a look at this I think he got it off in time Malcolm and I think also too theyre going to take a look at of the hit yeah now again that looked like okay anytime you get hit now again I think hes just trying to reverse Direction but I think the referees are going to take a look to see if theres anything flagrant and then obviously I think theyre going to take a look at to see if he got the shot off I think those are the two things theyre probably reviewing right now right now looks like theyre looking to see if the shot was off in time dont see any light come on yeah I think he got it off plenty of time yeah definitely well before that clock hit zero the ball was out of his hand one yeah he got it off angles yeah both even with Music that angle there it looks like theres really no doubt whether or not the ball was out of his hands dont know whats taking so long because the the angles weve gotten have been pretty conclusive that would mean back to back made baskets for Louisville after starting over three Ted Valentine having a ward with Kenny Payne now again and after all that no flagrant foul and theyve counted the basket and I think thats the right ball again it did not look like he swung his own hes just trying to reverse directly because one of those he just happened to get caught so again good job they took a look at it and I think its the right call veteran officiating crew Greg Elliott drains the three to fire pit back in front any pain when we talked to him he said defending the threepoint line was going to be key in this game first fit they have to do a good job being there on the catch and running guys off the threepoint line that rolls out from Withers he battles for the rebound and wins the ball back for Louisville underneath their own hoop okay on the other side when we spoke with Jeff Capel and he said defensive rebounding is going to be key for us in this game but we must keep Louisville off of the offensive glass those are two concerns that both teams and coaching staffs came into this one I think top of the list you mentioned our conversation with Pitt head coach Jeff Capel he told us look people are going to look at three and twenty our fans our players and not worry about it he said Im worried this Louisville team the last two games they have shown fight and remember this pit team their last loss was against Florida State who Louisville took down to the wire over the weekend and the Cardinals have come out shooting well Mike James hits that three and this is exactly why Jeff Capel said you cant just look at the record in this business team and the key thing weve said in this opening a fourminute stretch no turnovers about Louisville as we take a look though uh pit continues to execute well offensively were seeing some highlevel offense early from both these teams I think the key number for Louisville though no turnovers theyve hit some high percentage shots off the excellent ball movement early Applause right on cue good ball movement leads to a three cant connect though JJ trainer got a good look Elliott lobs it up Federico Federico throws it down rebound and then run the floor and get paid uh with the alleyoop the Federico Federico has been huge for this pit team where theres the immediate answer they call it a deep two for Jalen Withers whos been red hot from downtown 12 of 21 from three in his last four games Applause Elliott hits it again his second three of the night and Pitt has made four in a row and again uh poor Closeouts that time by Louisville a good ball movement and Screen action by pit you must be there on the catch with this pit team really good look nothing but the bottom of the net Mike James answers from three cannot ask for a better start on the road if youre Kenny Payne uh his Louisville team uh executing really well offensively early Louisvilles bench thought Henson got away with a push stole it away anyway Cardinals have made five of their last seven theyve got a good flow offensively on the road here in Pitt Curry trying to muscle it left it way short Nelly Cummings in transition might have rushed that shot no good Applause trailing three James too much on it almost had his own rebound and said it falls to Burton splits two Defenders and hell be at the foul line when we come back tied at 12 a frenetic start high Pace both teams dialed in on the offensive end he said when you win the fans come back the sellout it a great comeback win against top 20 Miami at the end of January a big win that helped an NCAA tournament resume that right now is a projected eight seed according to Joe lunardi and Ill tell you what this pit team at nine and three in the ACC could very well play their way in to an ACC regular season title Malcolm wins against Virginia and Miami could serve as tie Breakers and who could have seen this coming preseason well I think Jeff Capel talked about it he gives a lot of credit to his staff his brother on staff uh assistant coach of Milan uh Brown and Tim OToole uh he says look I put a lot of faith in my staff when we were building this roster this year and it certainly has paid off I think the big thing uh Jay is the balance that they have offensively they got four guys that average double digits and then they make it difficult for you to guard them because theyve been shooting the ball well and theyre all unselfishly really uh they have been playing and become a really difficult team to match up against them these were the days that Pitt fans had not given up hope on a proud program that was at the top of college basketball a little more than a decade ago went through some really hard times Louisville fans right now watching hit fans can relate to you not too long ago that Owen 18 seasoned at ACC play 20172018 team and these are two both proud programs that expect a lot out of their team and it doesnt always go to plan nobody thought this Louisville team would be three and twenty but as we told you at the top of the show theyve been showing a lot of fight as of late and theyve come out and shown that you would never know they were three and twenty looking at the way theyve started this game now yeah Kenny Payne and staff again Ill say it but look they deserve a lot of credit for keeping these guys focused look they have every reason to pack it in and really not play hard in these games theyve done a pretty good job to take a look at assistant coach Danny Manning theyve done a really good job kind of holding the fort together in these last two games theyve played uh really well much improved and right here on the road if they want to pull off the road theyre going to have to defend the threepoint line and then limit the turnovers in this game hard foul on the Freshman Guillermo Diaz Graham seven footer from Spain okay this is set up excellent screen and then because Louisville so focused on defending the threepoint line The Bigs of Pitt are going to have some opportunities to have some room to operate down low when they dive off of those screens excellent offense and spacing by fit with no John Huguley for the rest of the season Guillermo Diaz Graham Has Come Off the Bench and played big minutes inside for Pitt Applause hes got great size and really skilled both he and his brother really skilled Biggs and its been a pleasant surprise for Jeff Capel and staff how well both these guys have progressed as you said the John hugely out are now for the rest of the season its thrust them into playing times and theyve been huge for them off the bench Louisville still no turnovers tonight although inches away from having one there seven minutes into this game on the road great environment with the Oakland Zoo in full voice with Pittsburgh playing so well you said that was the key to this game tonight and so far they havent turned it over Malcolm no again Kenny Payne said it he did not miss any words hes like look for us in particular with L Ellis behind the guards they have to turn the ball over as you take a look at them crafting offensive blast I think theyre going to take a look I think it should be a shot clock violation I dont think that hit rim yeah thats a shot find violation Im definitely I dont think that hit any Rim hit the bottom of the backboard now our angle it looked like it did not hit the rim so this should be pit basketball leading by two yeah that does not hit rim so wave off the bucket from JJ trainer Pittsburghs made four of their last five shooting 71 percent from the floor to start this game Elliott steps out from three knocks it down again Elliotts third of this first half great footwork off the pin down but you cant get open unless theres a good screen again at that time another excellent screen up I pit to free up Applause high off the window and in nice answer from Louisville as Pittsburgh had their largest lead of the night at five Applause all the way to the ram in Pittsburgh has started this game shooting seven of nine red hot foreign Applause Music Applause lands an air ball again trailing three Off the Mark good job on the defensive blast back to the previous possession you cant ask for it but more open look off a good ball movement just unable to convert the three Cardinals desperate for a stop Pittsburgh getting everything they went want offensively to start this game shooting 70 percent from the floor Hanson continues it with a deep three Kenny Payne talked about this and he said uh when weve gotten into trouble this year we have not followed the script The Scouting Report again you must defend the threepoint line when you play Pitt thats too much airspace you have to communicate on those pin Downs either switch or The Bigs have to give help cannot let Pitt continue to come off these screens of that wide open Applause shot clock under five deep three Al Ellis if Pittsburgh scrapped control of this game Henson offensive foul Applause largest lead of the game for Blake Henson in the Panthers though as the threes have started to fall Greg Elliott hes three for three from three and then Hinson womens college basketball on acc Network Thursday right now pit up eight uh Jake he in this game defending the threepoint line you must communicate uh right here okorafor needs to be locked in with of the Guard uh you cannot give this much ear space either you have to help as the big but you have to be connected part of this is communication the guard must lock and trail on that and then the big if he sees the guard late must give some coverage it is key that they communicate on these Bend Downs right now you look at Greg Elliott Five Points Wednesday versus North Carolina hes already got nine early in the first half in this game a lot of those have come off some clean looks credit pit theyre running some really good sets for him yeah those defensive miscues from this Cardinals team have punished them all season you see it there Elliott has made them pay three for three perfect from deep and Pitt is a team four of six from three that people changed up defense gave a little threequarter court pressure really what that is just the slow pit down and do exactly what theyre doing now get them deep into shot clock Cardinals have now missed seven of their last eight they were in a good Rhythm to start this game Malcolm whats changed I think the ball movement and credit Pitts defense they forced them deep into the shot clock and then now instead of getting high percentage looks uh theyre taking some contested looks deep in the shot clock I think a couple of things number one Pitt has been really good offensively so its limited their opportunities to get out and transition and then defensively uh they forced them to get into the shot clock foreign heres Burton double team comes in passes out of it gate Santos counted plus the foul a chance for a fourpoint play the hockey assist by japaris Burton double team he gives it up extra pass uh you cant ask for a better Offensive start if youre Jeff keeper right here jamaris Burton giving it up extra pass into corner and that is a really unselfish basketball by Pitt fourpoint play completed Pittsburgh on a 142 run Louisville in a scoring drought of nearly three minutes and its allowed Pittsburgh to really grab control of this game Googles got to get into their offense a little bit quicker last really four or five possession theyve been deep under really 10 seconds and the shot clock before theyre really having anything going towards the basket Applause the force three from Al Alice brims out not too long ago these two teams were tied at 14 since then pit on a 142 run looking for more so Bandy hits it the wide open in desperate need of a bucket and they need to get back to early on in this game they were getting some dribble drives and then making some extra passes and getting some higher percentage shots that has not happened in this last four or five minute Express Withers drawing contact shes trying to get something going for Louisville as Pittsburgh has extended this lead to 14 on a 162 scoring run over the last five minutes Jeff Capel pleading his case and he was moving forward now I know what deaf people saying now if he was standing straight up thatd be one thing its because he was coming forward I think thats a pretty good call by the ref if he was just going straight up and he moved into him Withers then I think he has a more valid argument all right Applause everybody knows the ACC tremendous fans and the ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so take a picture or video tag it with all the devotion on social media you might just see it right here on acc Network Jalen Withers ends the scoring drown of nearly four minutes with that free throw but Louisville has dug themselves quite a hole and Deja Vu for Cardinals fans just a fiveminute lapse they had played so well this game was tied at 14 and then you know five minutes of play that just gets away from you and youre down by double digits so Bandy hits a deep three Pittsburgh red hot from three they have made six of eight Applause oh theyve changed up their defense of that last possession gave some threequarter court pressure looks like they brought back into some type of a matchup to Zone and uh it did not work its still able to get a three number four Pittsburgh has made another four in a row theyre getting everything they want from Deep six of eight from three a big this game wide open and theyve done it a little bit different inside outside right here excellent ball movement The Bigs of pit Ive been impressed theyve sent some excellent screens and the ball movement continues to be positive of poor Jeff Capel he said theyre at their best when the ball is not sticking to one side but they have come out early in the first half and put on a ball movement Clinic youre coming off that crucial win on the road in Chapel Hill to complete the season sweep of North Carolina but they didnt do it with threepoint shooting on Wednesday just 7 of 19 tonight look at that 75 percent six of eight from three and its been all high uh percentage looks I think on the other side Louisville look they started this game off moving the ball well they were getting high percentage shots and that just really uh disappeared really in the last five minutes stretch a sixminute stretch its been a struggle for them offensively and a big reason why I think look they just got away from what was working for them early they got to get back to that move the ball too much oneonone and theyve been getting deep into the shot clock Burton leaves it short thats Pittsburghs only fourth missed shot weve played for nearly 13 minutes and Pitt has only missed four times step back three rattles in and out no good from Withers Applause Louisville just desperate for a basket five minutes and 22 seconds without a made field goal foreign Music Applause heres Burton hes usually the initiator late in the shot clock its great passing so Bandy cant connect on the three oh my God Music foul down low Roosevelt wheeler was in good positioning to end this scoring drought but it was found before he could hang onto the ball Jay Louisville needs more of that right there dont settle for jumpers try to get some dribble drives if it comes off of a kick after drawing a couple of Defenders thats fine but dont try to shoot a contested jumper but without any ball movement or dribble penetration Applause Music Applause this game was tied at 14 since then Pittsburgh on a 193 run Louisville is now made a field goal in six minutes stole it away good transition defense from Louisville Music Music communication on these ball screens keep for Louisville as they come up with a turnover James has been the lone bright spot offensively eight points out of the Cardinals 17 Applause Cross Court pass finds trainer Louisville desperate to make a shot they just theyre getting good looks Malcolm they just cant knock him down yeah that right there probably their best offensive possession really in the last four minutes Cross Court paths they get a pretty clean book from three as you said just unable to convert and now for the game they are 18 from the threepoint line go over two of 11 Nelly Cummings drains it from the corner Applause largest lead of the night for Pittsburgh seven made threes for this Panthers team oh they rejected Federico says no James stays with it Burton rips it away pit has numbers and they cash in timeout Louisville its a 191 pit run well big story line this season has been Pittsburghs offensive prowess but how about the defense Malcolm Federico Federico I think kind of the unsung hero we talked about it without John Hughley the guy they thought they would be counting on a lot and you look at what hes done he is third and the ACC close to two blocks per game now you look at Derek Lively that number probably jumped the bunch from his performance the other night but Federico Federico has provided them really an excellent postpresence on the defensive side and then his REM running has been really excellent after his Blocks hes a big thats mobile really its been phenomenal of what hes been able to provide before this team and look what hes done against Armando Bay Khan who many believe could be ACC player of the year he has held him in check not just last Wednesday but in both meetings his pit swept Carolina in the season series I think Federico Federico a sleeper for ACC Defensive Player of the Year absolutely I mean hardly argue when youre guarding uh arguably one of the best players not just in the ACC but in college basketball and Armando baycott and you hold him to those type of numbers you have to be in the discussion for one of the better players defensive players in the conference I dont know if hell make the alldefensive team but hes made the allname team with Federico Federico as he comes up with another defensive stop Applause foreign big smile too for the sophomore from Finland if youre Kenny Payne and he talked about it uh just following the the script the The Scouting Report well he said it look we must defend the threepoint line uh end this game right now but Pittsburgh 70 and theyre going to get another clean look from three thats a break that time but theyre uh well over 65 in this game from three and a lot of them have been some clean looks they have to tighten that up they want to try to go on any type of run to shrink this gap of 18 Music theyve dug themselves a hole on the road down 18 yeah and a lot of these different numbers but anytime you can win on the road I dont care what conference youre in uh but in particular in the power five in the ACC its pretty impressive and theyre in pretty rare company right there as you showed two of the top teams in the country uh one of the only few to have more than five uh Road wins uh in conference really impressive what deaf people has done with this bit program Applause right now trying to take care of business at home improve the 103 in the ACC as they chase the Clemson Tigers just a half game back its going to be a fun finish in the ACC about six teams battling for the ACC regular season title stole it away Applause Al Ellis all the way to the RAM and he misses the layup thats the type of season its been for the Cardinals and called for a foul on the other end I mean talk about not getting a roll yeah and thats a tough break right there there with the chance to cut this thing and thats just the Miss again great job of getting this steal just unable to convert thats when he would like to have back take a look at his numbers uh certainly no he can score I think the thing when we spoke with Kenny Payne uh his turnover numbers have been down over the last four games thats the key for them Federico Federico continues to Feast inside on both ends Louisville was just made one of their last 11 Applause stolen away so Bandy oh he tried the windmill and he missed the dunk and then he hits the three he ends up gaining a point with the misdom because he atones for it with the maid three wow I can tell you Jeff Capel though probably not happy but with the Miss dunk but hes going to talk to him about that again uh this game uh he understands but right now it is rolling Nike sapandy with the windmill misses it but then he atones for it with the maid three it has been all pit in the first half seen that but then seconds later he makes the three Jeff Capel takes a timeout a unique sequence for sure as Pitt finds themselves up by 21 Applause Curry draws the foul inside and if youre trying to find anything positive uh for Louisville and again its been tough in this last stretch for them in particular on the road in this game I think look thats a matchup where right now the three ball is not working and the curry certainly has a clear strength advantage over Federico Federico but give him some touches in the paint see if you can get Federico Federico and foul trouble certainly its a higher percentage shot if youre in the paint because the three ball has not been working for you three or twelve from the threepoint line trying to make it easy for yourself and then defensively look a sound like a broken record its simple as this theyre going to have to do a better job defending the threepoint line the pit has made eight threes in this first half shooting overall 65 percent and another main three This one belongs to Nellie Cummings Gamble and then it leads to another wide open three well that right there Kenny Payne is not happy with that defense again they go to Zone you gamble you dont get the steal extra pass by pit and they get another wide open look Applause foreign Applause contested three Louisvilles been looking for that this entire half Mike James has been the bright spot with 11 Applause back into this matchup Zone even communication any screens and then you cannot gamble out of this day Music ton Applause a deep three James left it short and itll be pit basketball shot clock off as it stands 46 points the second most the Panthers have scored in a half this season an offensive explosion capped off by nine made threes Jeff Capel uses a timeout whats impressed you most about the Panthers in his first half Malcolm as we take a look at Jeff capels huddle a couple things to jump out the ball movement into balance we talked about it after tip they have four guys that average double figures uh for this team and then Federico Federico again hes not a guy thats going to score a bunch of points but I think he does all the little things for this team hell rebound the block shots hell rim run uh either get it on lobs or just draw the defense in Ive been impressed with his allaround defensive play and presence of Fort Pitt thats what makes it so difficult for opposing coaches when you try and put together a Scouting Report what name do you put at the top for pitch sure I think Benny would say Burton but you look at that balance so many different guys can beat you yeah I mean look the Cummings Elliott uh Burton uh Henson uh those guys all of them sabandi they bring in Nike sabandi Off the Bench hes another guy that can fill it up for them so youre right very difficult but the Scout because On Any Given night any one of those guys can go off up from Beyond The Arc and also beat you off the bounce thank you ten seconds left to this first half Music Santos a three Applause on the follow the whistle with under three seconds left before halftime thank you said Bandy almost with the Highlight putback dunk my goodness foreign thats the problem when you go to a Zone Pittsburgh an offensive explosion in this first half 47 points shooting better than 60 percent from the field nine made threes at a really complete first half out of their 16 made field goals 14 of those assisted impressive first half all around for Jeff Capel a balanced offensively defensively they took Louisville right out of the Rhythm they had early in the game impressive all around Jeff Capel must be pleased with how with running the floor uh he really I think has been uh really an X Factor guy for Jeff Capel and Pitt and a fan base that is gotten to new lease on life this year season now well on their way to 103 in League Play Greg Elliott dials it in from Deep his 43 of the night and Pittsburgh picks up right where they left off well I was going to talk about second half adjustments for Louisville again uh one of the things Kenny Payne talked about uh his team continuing to fight again I know of this program uh theyre not going to accept the losing I think the biggest thing Kenny Payne and staff are looking at is if guys are going to continue to compete but then I think they got a lock in on The Scouting Report again just come out in the second half you know Pitts hat from the threepoint line they give up a three early uh end of the early minutes and first minute of the second half they have to lock in and communicate better offensively and again it it wasnt too long ago that Pitt fans would tune into games like this and were on the Louisville side of things thinking how could a program with so much tradition and pride find themselves in these situations and Jeff Capel has come in trusted the process it didnt happen overnight this is your number five that the Panthers are finally tasting that success well on their way to getting back to where they belong in the NCAA tournament and it continues from three hit red hot right now Applause offensive rebound rejected at The Rim Federico to the rescue again transition three its good Nelly Cummings they should give Federico Federico the assist because he started off that play with the block and the REM run brought into D and that Ill tell you right now has been of the story with Pittsburgh Federico Federico one of the better Rim protectors and then right here Cummings in the break unselfish Play Again by Pitt and its been that type of night for them they cannot miss from Beyond The Arc 12 made threes shooting 67 from three this is a pit team that set a program record with 18 made threes against Wake Forest and only average nine per game that record could be in Jeopardy tonight Hawk theyve already made 12 Ill tell you what if uh Louisville does not either switch or better have better communication as we take a look and another breakdown that time out of bounds underneath they could break that record Applause it feels like a different game that these two were tied at 14 since then Pittsburgh continuing to pour it on an eightnothing run over the last minute just the latest run of this game Applause still playing with a lot of pain timeout Kenny Payne Pittsburgh a perfect five for five to start the second half it is all pet wind would bring the Panthers tied with Clemson atop the ACC for a team that was picked second to last through the preseason poll in conference we asked Jeff Capel whats his message to the team as they battle for an ACC regular season title and he said were not worried about the ACC title his message to the team comes from a book he read this off season the boy the mold The Fox and the horse by Charlie McAfee I cant see a way through can you see your next step yes so the horse says Jack just take that and he said this whole season is about just taking the next step not thinking of the big picture just going 10 they say 10 at the end of every pregame shoot around and in a world where its so hard to focus on the presence this pit team has been so dialed in to just taking that next step whats right in front of them Applause and hes been very consistent but Jay all the games weve had a good pit thats been his message he is not a move from that end its really a great one as things start to get a little heated and I think that frustration and some chirping going on Applause but certainly that is a frustration and you know look Kenny Payne talked about this now again obviously I dont want this to get into any extra curriculars but I think it goes back to guys taking Pride that time I think they were a little exception of with the throw Federico Federico going after the ball but you know Kenny Payne talked about this look he wants our guys no matter what the score is show us some pride show some fight I think the bigger issue right now as the referees look to review this the breakdowns again theyve had spurts but where theyve played a good ball and this game I think is a little different but theyve had other games where theyve put together 35 minutes of good basketball 36 minutes but not able to go through these Sprout uh spurts bear they cant score the ball or they have breakdowns defensively I think tonight obviously the numbers will tell you uh right now Pitt 67 percent from the threepoint line that has been the biggest issue for them of defending the threepoint line and coming into this game that was right at the top of the list of keys for the game now hold on a second they just announced that its a technical foul against Federico Federico as well as Mike James so a technical foul to each team thank you okay I think that is more to do with the referees basically saying all right were going to ding both of you and we dont want anything else to go uh from here were just gonna knock it off were going to get both guys a tech and then if theres anything else going on in games were going to start tossing people and again veteran crew they just want to get this thing under control again two guys going after the ball and thats four fouls now on Federico so he has to take a a seat and youd expect it to be a long one actually going to toss somebody from the bench but they said they took an extra long look at the replay to make sure that there were no infractions against the bench just the two technicals against James and Federico so nothing against that Louisville bench Applause that ends a two and a half minute scoring ground for Louisville mark this right here down 30 Louisville you have the technical and obviously this game down 30 but lets see again if they try to go on any type of run defend this right here they just cant stop the threes Guillermo Diaz Graham getting in on the ACT his first made bucket of the night foreign off the floor with four fouls he got five shooters for Pitt much needed three for Louisville Kamari lands nothing but the bottom of the net Applause inside to Hanson whos fouled tonights all been about the threepoint shooting though Pittsburgh 13 made threes casing up by Louisville they have five threepoint Shooters out on the floor again right here Louisville they must communicate you almost have to switch this or have coverage of the big does not Step Up doesnt help and another clean look of four pit from Beyond The Arc that has been the type of night a lot of these open looks have been off of breakdowns by Louisville Im almost at the point right now if Im Kenny Payne you have to switch any pin down any ball screen because right now a pit is dominating them from the threepoint line six different Panthers whove made a three Applause Pittsburghs 22 made shots have been assisted so Pittsburgh just getting everything they want offensively Alex and Malcolm talked about at the beginning of the show youre seeing that with the threes with six different players making one from Deep threepoint shooting success only working one way Louisvilles attempted 173s only made five heres Henson kick out Elliott of three his first Miss from three tonight he was fourth before that one great defense from Nike sabandi Music Jay you talked about it the 18 assists I think that is the number of deaf people that he said look oh were a team uh the thing he likes about this team is how connected they are uh any given night somebody can go off and all these guys no matter what whether theyre scoring or not theyre willing passers and guys that are able to space the floor and then make the right read Applause so Bandy pull up three brims out how difficult is it Malcolm to guard a team that has five threepoint Shooters on the floor at the same time uh absolutely its very difficult and particular the way the bigs are screening for pit but I think really for Louisville right now well the biggest issue theyre having is communicating and then being locked in uh guys are getting too much space off of these pin Downs The Bigs have to either clip out heads and show or switch on those screens the communication really has been an issue for removal tonight Jalen Withers was the hot hand coming into the night hes been quiet but made a muchneeded three there Music hits in contested three nothing but the bottom of the net Blake Hanson knocks down his third three of the night they are putting on the clinic right now with their spacing and then dribble drive and they continue to make the extra fast Music Applause oh Cora Four showing his range in just his fourth game as a Cardinals is coming over from Nigeria Emmanuel okora four hes been a spark in practice and Kenny Payne was singing his praises to us during our coaches call and youre seeing it in game action now yeah theyre really high on this young man I asked Kenny Payne you know what he brings he said the biggest thing weve seen a difference in uh the practice that he is just a competitive uh young man and they are really high on what he can bring on both ends of the court for this Louisville team Applause that was his first made three hit a Louisville uniform and Mike James who stays down for Louisville after the make now gets up to his feet Applause Applause that ankle looked like it doesnt go or tell certainly better to see him walking off on his own bill really bad at the beginning Music Applause Santos off to sabandi rejected by okorafor hello thats probably the best sequence of the night for Louisville Percy Miller Cashes in on a three after a good defensive stop yeah and again excellent ball movement something really the first five minutes of this game but Louisville had it going it said this game was tied at 14 Applause foreign Music just the opposite emotion out aboard the pit bandwagon and for good reason Tuesday night the Oakland Zoos been rocking Pittsburgh up big 7042 love seeing Ryan Shazier out at the peacock yeah its so great to see him but looks happy looks really good and certainly a great atmosphere for him and you said it right uh just a remarkable story seeing him being able to come to this game on his own will a lot of folks smiling not just in Pittsburgh but all around the world seeing his recovery continue I mean to have that spinal stabilization surgery and learn to walk again that its such an unbelievable story about applicable to life right down but not out everyone can take something from Ryan Shaziers story well I think the biggest thing appreciate it you know the little things being able to get up and walk on your own will get out of bed each morning and certainly oh that was in doubt for quite some time with him but again really just so happy to see him able to get out and about on his own will really just a remarkable recovery and what hes been able to do 100 percent no wonder who uh Ryan likes in the Super Bowl this coming week Chiefs are eagles who do you like Malcolm oh man thats a tough one that you cant go wrong I Im gonna say listen uh Im not a fan of either but I like both quarterbacks um but for me Jalen hurts what hes been able to overcome you think about him losing his starting job moving off from schools and just stayed humble the whole time really hard to root against him man so if I had to pick one I I would say Im going Philly man I really just love his story and what he represents in terms of just fighting through adversity and staying positive the whole time and you talk about believing in yourself I read an article today that a scout asked Jalen hurts during the draft process are you cool moving to running back and he said Im a team player Ill do whatever the team wants but Im a quarterback he believed in himself when so many doubted and now playing in his first Super Bowl against Patrick Mahomes that thatll be an incredible game come Sunday sum that up and get back the ball uh I want to know who that Scout was they need to get their head check to see if that guy is not a quarterback because Im gonna tell you right now um Im not a football guy but I dont think it takes the jeans to figure out that that guy is a leader and he is a quarterback and one of the best of the best in the NFL right now did you ever get some weird feedback from from a scout as you were trying to make Transition from college to Pros uh no I mean look I was drafted by the Houston Astros for baseball uh I thought I was a short staff and they said no son were going to draft you as a third baseman and maybe stick you out in right field that was a little salty about that but on the basketball front now I came in look that was a threepoint shooter so you are who you are no weird feedback on that I knew who I was you told me uh when youre trying out with the heat that they made you shoot a hundred threes and you had to make 80 if you didnt make 80 of 100 they they said theres the door well it wasnt no so much the door but you cant call yourself the threepoint shooter and not make uh open threes with no defense on it so certainly that was a deputy nerve wrapping pass as we take a look at it more uh offensive rebounding for a bit yeah look Jeff Capel the other day when we spoke to him about this team he said look we dont have a team uh that is just one guy thats going to go off for 40 or a team that has guys that really are superstars he said look we have to play as a collective unit and thats what they have done and talked about it throughout this game to balance that theyve shown uh you look at their scoring and then just how they spread the ball around theyre going to be up over 20 assists when this game is over and thats what deaf people talked about theyre at their best when theyre sharing the ball but I think the other thing deep defensively uh they really really good to look at their win versus North Carolina they have North Carolina to 18 from the threepoint line and 34 from the floor I dont think they get enough credit for how well they play defense they make it really difficult for teams I think a big reason why theyre bigs in particular Federico Federico and the twins on the back end they give them some really nice red protection its getting to the point Malcolm where you have to ask yourself could this pit team win the ACC and you look at the upcoming schedule and I think its favorable I think they could play their way into winning the ACC regular season title theyre going to have a tough one uh look they this one they gotta take care of business the mass 920 they have a sizable league but at Florida State thats going to be an interesting game Jeff people talked to us about this movable team that really gave this gave Florida State all they can handle we called the Florida State game when Florida State came into pit uh and handled them they gave Pitt really all they can handle so that one at Florida State uh that ones going to be a very interesting game lets see if they can get some Revenge battle underneath Diaz Graham fighting both twins are in on the scene talk about great fight from both teams you would never know this was a lopsided game both teams still going hard underneath the hoop Applause this just of the REM protection this time the twins are getting in on the Block acting physical game and the open field is a loving this effort Applause interesting freethrow routine you know rarely see a guy take a step back and then go right into his free throw shot take a look at this right here but it works hes got great mechanics takes a step back with that right foot and then steps right into it Applause four for four for Jorge Diaz Graham from the line so its working Music Applause thank you shot block violation again I think credit the Oakland Zoo for causing the shot clock violation there Applause Music this has been the type of night has been a four little nothing coming easy it blows out uh by Nike so Bandy I think the key thing in that it pulls out without fouling Applause we were trying to change it up going to a little threequarter court pressure Applause offensive rebound Applause this match trinelli Cummings working on the freshman thats a turnover but a turnover pick can afford Panthers up by 30 with under eight to play 15 minutes right here on acc Network a top 25 matchup NC State turquavion Smith red hot in Charlottesville to take on Kihei Clark at number eight Virginia Malcolm Huckabee that is a game that could very well decide who ends up winning the ACC two of the hottest teams of the conference right now and its going to be a fun game really uh tough to call that one right there two really good teams well coached uh two really good backcourts as you said it took Way Beyond its been really playing at a high level but TA Clark man so that ones going to be a fun one cannot wait to see that one and two of the teams including Pittsburgh log jammed at the top of the ACC it will very rarely see uh a league is wide open as this one is in February down the stretch of the season a critical matchup now Miami got the big win against Duke last night the hurricanes are definitely in the mix Wake Forest theyre up really big on North Carolina that lead down to 10 over on ESPN and then after us on acc Network its NC State and Virginia foreign theres really just not much to separate those teams at the top of the ACC it was Clemson and Virginia that is trying to separated themselves for a while but Clemson Pitt Virginia Miami NC State those five uh whats going to separate these two these five teams down the stretch Hawk well I you know I I dont I think you feel schedule out of it I think its really going to come down to uh matchups teams that you know against certain teams are just a better match up for whatever reason it is and I think thats going to really uh play a huge uh key and factor into these closing games as we get closer to Mars certainly though being at home always helps so the team probably with more home games and that Bunch give them a little advantage by this home crowd like you said Malcolm hey hey Jay this has been I think the the biggest difference before this pit team again when they lost John Hughley you insert the twins to go along with Federico Federico and uh although they dont score like giant usually did they provide that right there Santos fouled for the second time tonight shooting a three he missed this one but well get three shots out the line Music Federico Federico on the bench those has given Jeff Capel some nice fun minutes in this game allowing him to rest some of his starters with this sizable lead have been able to keep it Jeff Capel as we talked big picture of the ACC is going to receive a lot of ACC Coach of the Year votes come the end of the season always enjoy speaking with them and he said look hes become very close with Mike Tomlin the head coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers and they share a lot of stuff a lot of similarities some things talking about managing a team in leadership and certainly a lot of those conversations coming into this season have paid off well his team really has bought into that for one game at a time dont want to know every time they come out focus on whats in front of you and take a look out for the last four seasons theres six to win and it is night and day difference of this season right here and I think a big reason why the balance theyve had and then defensively and cant say it enough yes theyre very good offensively we talked about the balance they had jamarius Burton a guy that should be uh at the top of the list for uh ACC player of the year but a defensively again coming up with the steal they do a really good job defending the threepoint line in enforcing teams uh ended turnovers big reason why theyre mobile bigs they do a good job protect me and then also running the floor 15 made threes 18 of 20 from the foul line this has been a clinic offensively on the other side but Kenny Payne did not hide from okay season that theyre having right now so look our fans the book theyre very uh used to theyre used to uh Wayne ways hes been part of that uh winning a national championship and he said look the expectation is not going to change for them and he said look uh I welcome them Boone I welcome them getting on us in need because they deserve better and he knows that they must do better is up the game Applause Capel takes the timeout after the Nike sabandi three 163s on the night for Pittsburgh as a team just too shy of a program record 18 Five Points shy of a season High 91 points now Malcolm sometimes youre just feeling it and this pit team has been feeling it not just tonight but the last month or two hey they really have excellent ball movement right here though of the communication and breakdowns by Louisville really has been problematic Federico Federico with the block and then right here in transition another wide open look unselfish look at their spacing I think this is the thing that makes them difficult they have four or five guys out on the court at times that can shoot the three ball and all of them can put it down on the floor and then they have excellent spacing as you take a look at their threepoint shooting 18 made on January 25th against wig right now theyre at 16 but I think Jeff Capel is going to empty his bench get his starters out of the game get some of the reserves and that dont play that much Applause Music foreign Music big picture you know how does the Louisville close out this season how can they Music try to get some positive news uh going into their last games of this agency season yeah I I think look there were a couple of things today that really werent happening in their last two games we talked about it in the tip their last two games they have been much better turn with their turnovers and their efforts defensively uh first five minutes it looked pretty good for this move and then from there basically it went South and it went South quick I think the biggest problem uh for them tonight wasnt the turnover it was just the lack of ball movement and then defensive uh really did a poor job of defending the threepoint line look theres no other way to put it a pit just had way too many open looks from Beyond The Ark and I think whats so difficult for Louisville is this is unchartered territory and the programs a hundred and nine year history theyve never lost more than 20 games theyve lost 20 one other time but theyre three minutes and 53 seconds away from losing a 21st game as you see Aiden fish head to the scores table hes a fan favorite well get to see him come onto the court when we come back Music for I would less than four minutes to go and pit up comfortably Here Comes Aiden fish and what a great story fish has grew up in Murrysville Pennsylvania just 20 minutes away from Pitts campus started as a student manager in the 20182019 season then became a walkon in the 2021 season and in his final season with the Panthers he is now a scholarship player Malcolm and I weve been at a lot of pit practices shoot arounds he is so active such a vocal leader energetic piece of this pit team and now in an ACC game he gets extended minutes and you know that Oakland Zoo is going to go crazy every time 13 touches the ball thats a great story it really is again the guy that came in and Jeff Capel talked about it look hes just done nothing but work been a great uh teammate certainly nice to see him get rewarded his final year and anytime they get a chance to get these guys in the game they do all the work and practice go over to scout team do all the training and so forth and rarely get a chance to play so certainly anytime any coaches can get their WalkOns on or guys that dont get a lot of minutes certainly a good thing the reward then and the other thing that fish has gone through that a lot of these transfers have not is the pain and suffering of these last four seasons it has not been easy for Pitt as Jeff Capel has rebuilt a program that went winless in the ACC before he took over fish has been a part of that rebuild not sure what the referees are looking at right here yeah weve got to get to Virginia NC State we got a top 25 matchup coming up next on in a 33point game with three minutes left I dont know what you could possibly be reviewing looks like it nicked the rim right here so I think its a shot clock see if it should have reset Im not sure theyll take this much time youre absolutely right Teddy Valentine give him a little laugh right there glad they did not take too much more time on that one coming up next NC State in Virginia will likely start on the ESPN after then well get you the Charlottesville as soon as we can sir quavion Smith Kihei Clark excellent guard match up that game is going to be a lot of fun as our double header continues here on acc Network three minutes ago Pittsburgh up by 35 foreign Applause ell but you know I almost think we penalized Tony Bennett for being uh in the top ten again the job that hes done with Virginia again I know everybody else is talking about the progression that Clemson has made and certainly the game we have right here Jeff paper but Tony Bennett the guy that hes been with this Virginia team certainly hes but we probably wont but its its certainly the a name that should be in the discussion as well too what hes done with this Virginia team the consistency that they have had well we both vote Malcolm and I am dreading filling out coach of the year and players of the year because its so balanced at the top of the ACC its really hard to separate its really good to come down to those final standings I think is the tiebreaker I almost think thats really what its going to come down to the team uh that finish is at the top of the standings I think you can almost pick the player and also Coach of the Year from that team I think its just that tight of a race when you start talking about Player of the Year and also both of the year Pittsburgh by the way is tied a season high with 91 points in this game a statement win for a program that will improve the 103 and ACC play and will now move tied with Clemson into first place through the ACC take a look at the threepoint shooting numbers tonight 17 of 29 right now pit 59 percent one shy of their program record 18 made threes and really you know Jay youve talked about it weve talked about it its uh how they got those made buckets the assist theyre at 23 assists for the game uh right now again they put on a clinic with their ball movement screening and spacing and thats a season High 23 assists for this pit team Applause Music and I think at this point the rest of the ACC has no choice but to take note as a team that came in preseason second to last in the conference is 100 percent in the race to win the league this pit team this program that has been dormant for the last decade is back in a big way it really is look at how theyve won weve talked about their Road wins of beating teams like Miami uh going on the road winning at North Carolina nobody that you look at where theyre at right now and where their preseason projections were including me and you nobody thought they would be sitting in second place right now uh at the top of the ACC standings and pretty much and all the projections a lot before the NCAA tournament Applause Music Joe minardi has Jeff capels team is in eight seed right now wouldnt surprise me if they continue to build that resume and are closer to a four or a five seed come selection Sunday well I I think the the big test for them is going to be uh their Road game at Florida State remember Florida State came in on the road probably played their best game and Ive seen them play this year and beat them so theyre looking for some Revenge at Florida State but as you take a look at uh Joey brackets and the projections to be very interesting uh that Wake Forest Music Applause really impressive allaround offensively and defensively for Jeff Gable and Pittman pit left no down and with that win he improves it 103 now sitting tied with Clemson atop the ACC two teams that are
