Jones are in the starting lineup for Florida State here this afternoon SMU 22 and 8 13 and six in the ACC a terrific Road team this season Florida State 16 and 14 7 and 12 in the conference theyve lost four in a row and they hope they can snap that streak in a big way for Coach Hamilton three ball launched in the air oh back iron no good Jesse Jones wasting no time as we take a look at the Mustangs so starting line of Edwards bopy Miller back in there Chuck Harris Matt cross and CIT he getu phenomenal starting five a n excuse me a a Mustangs basketball team thats one of only two in the country with six players averaging double figures AR I think a big thing for SMU is theyre going to attack the switches that Florida State have Florida State likes to switch one through five they have to be able to recognize the mismatches when they do cross m cross the senior from Beverly Massachusetts his fourth College hes playing in in his career and his third ACC program hes made stops at Louisville and Miami got the offensive rebound and a foul called on Florida State Down Low cross lays it up and in and the Mustangs are on the board they get us started off on this Saturday afternoon in Tallahassee the old starting five we talked about Jones and Simpson Holt a senior Watkins a senior Malik you and back in there there after missing two games due to an ankle injury boy they missed Malik Yuan didnt they they missed Malik Yuan and one of the most talented most skilled centers in the country they need to go to him early and often and he needs to be aggressive when he gets the basketball turnover there was looking for Watkins Edwards one of the best defenders in the ACC comes away with it heres boy Miller transfer from Wake Forest Edwards finding it to the rim flips it in no could not get it to go down all right one of one keys for this Florida State team defensively is keep the SMU guards out of the paint you want to try to keep them on the perimeter as much as you can its Florida State team that though is averaging 8 threes made per game over its last three contest but not a terrific shooting basketball team on in the Year Andy Enfield telling us about how he planned on defending Florida State and attacking the switches as you mentioned cross very good threepoint shooter cant connect NOS want to run Simpson attacks high off the glass no tip in no and its Boston Hol who ties us at two three chances there a lot of energy and if Florida State really wants to give themselves a chance thats how they have to play they have to be able to create offense from their defense get out in transition and try to find easy and early opportunities oh what a shot from Harris Chuck Harris the senior transfer from Butler has been outstanding for a couple of Seasons here he gives the Mustangs the lead love Chuck Harriss game he could do it on all three levels shooting the three midrange and get to the rim you Baseline nearly lost the basket ball but he did step out of bounds this is how FSU has to play they have to try to get out in transition get early and easy opportunities and if you miss you have to be able to crash the glass and on the other end SMU Chuck Harris knocking down to three thats what Chuck Harris does is get Buckets six straight games in double figures for Harris averaging 15 points per game in his last 10 and and now its even easier for him because they have their leader back on the floor and bopy Miller he can kind of just go back into that scoring mode how does bopy affect the rest of the roster well offensively and defensively defensively hes guarding the point of attack hes averaging almost two steals a game then offensively hes a Creator hes getting people in their spots and youre just making it easier for everyone else no doubt about it the record doesnt lie when bopy was in there they were playing at a high level at 20 and five on the here you see what he did in his return against cuse 11 points five assists 17 games this season with at least five assists in the last possession of that game versus a c even though he missed a shot he just caused the defense to everyone look at him and that allowed h Hilton Ambrose to get on the rim for the game winning two tipping at him and it was a unbelievable win come from behind for the Mustangs they trailed by as many is 12 he it here we go a throw down for the big man Applause 54 JJ Starling shot against SMU rimmed in and out at the buzzer at a 7775 win tried the alleyoop a little too strong for you and SMU trying to slow things down now ah got sped up and a turnover no one to run what a ball what a feed and a throw down from Watkins and honestly AR this is how Florida State wants to play they Thrive when their defense can create turnovers and they can get out in the open court Jamir Watkins nine straight and double figures averaging 22 points per game in his last four contest top five in the ACC and scoring making a push for First Team all ACC honors here on this final day of regular season Harris snow on the runner Jackson a veteran fouls lead by one 6 to5 high energy on an emotional day in tallah has Florida State they Thrive where they can create turnovers get out easy opportunity to see Malik Yan with the long out left pass Jamir Watkins doing the rest Music finishing man was a part of two of them as well as one to lead eight so t man who got drafted by the Clippers signed a massive extension was traded to the Atlanta Hawks hes now closer to Tallahassee where he called home for four years I remember watching Terrace man he was a guy who really did it all and then when he got to the NBA he got even better at scoring the basketball finding the spots on the floor just becoming a better overall player one of the best role player Swiss Army knives in the NBA Florida State leades six to five Watkins goes down no whistle play on didnt travel either Jackson at the buzzer he misses everything terrific defense from the Mustangs well you see every time jir Watkins is going to drive a basketball SMU is going to have a guy in the elbow and theyre going to have another guy thats going to slide in helping Florida state has to try to find a shooter to be right on that Wing to give jir op jir Watkins the options to kick out for that shot well teams have no doubt been focusing all their attention on Watkins for much of the Season him and you and do much of the score but with you and out with the foot injury great defense from the Luke you got to think game plan focused even more on slowing down Watkins well absolutely and honestly for FSU to give their themselves a chance to win this game they got to start how they started out creating turnovers and getting down play in transition they got to try to do that throughout the basketball game cross open three lets it Fly and barries it what a shot there from Matt cross has 17 games this season with at least two threepoint shots made in a game he got one there Mustangs Lee respon Watkins a much improved threepoint shooter of his own well every single year hes just improved in some area of his game and shooting almost 40 from the threepoint line and how he can get to the rim you add that jump shot hes going to be a tough guard every single night how about Chuck Harris were trading threes yeah talk about a tough guard Chuck Harris he can do it from three can do it midrange and finish at The Rim as well Florida state has to push up no doubt is that midrange J not their offensive rebound for Boo and double teams it will be jump offall possession arrow pointing smus Applause way see right here aqu quino good job swinging Matt cross hes another guy whos just improved every single year he can do it inside and out kn down the triple terrific rebounder as well at his position averaging nearly eight a game top five in the ACC interior pass cross Harris drives muscles his way layup count it hes so strong was a good defense right there by Thomas Harris just bullied his way in there got close to the rim and finished and ball movement is going to be very key for SMU if they can get ball movement create space in the half court theyll have opportunities to drive and kick Thomas fouls on the drive will go to the line for two Harris who had 24 points against Florida State in a matchup last season has eight already he just hit knock down two threes he said okay its time to go inside just put that shoulder in his chest and finish strong at The Rim was an all conference performer in the big EA Butler prior to making his way to the Greater Dallas area Thomas front iron on the first one do want to remind you tonight oh its one of those nights 630 Eastern on ESPN its the featured college basketball matchup Cooper flag second ranked Duke taking on North Carolina in a Sonic Blockbuster Oh cannot wait heels and blue devil baby throw the records out AR throw the records out for that game obviously Duke is on a major run this season but whenever you get Duke in North Carolina last game of the regular season its going to be a dog fight Carolina playing better basketball as well absolutely Thomas splits the free throws coach Hamiltons final game as the head coach in tallah Mustangs by three Drive layup no he was fouled though on the drive it was Caro quendo Arya offensively they have four guys who can take you to the rim hes just using his strength one of the strongest guards probably in college basketball looks like a football player out there getting to the rim and giving himself an opportunity at the line but Chuck Harris quindo bopy Miller and also BJ Edwards all four guys can shoot the ball and also drive to the basket all they need is space to create especially okendo who stepped up in bopy Millers absence hes a Floridian by the way from Titusville got family and friends here watching the game against the nolles nothing but athletes down in Titusville no doubt about that nice feed you and got a friendly roll gravity pulled it through and I know its his first game back after missing a couple games but they have to try to establish him every time in the half court just try to get that inside outside balance going can you already tell the difference youan makes as Miller pulls up all connects sweet midrange touch and just like FSU Miss Ying SMU really miss boopy Miller just creating with nothing being able to get to his spots knocking down the jump shot you look all around the ACC a lot of injuries to some teams a lot of key names Marcus Burton JJ Starling of course the two we mentioned tonight jumper not going to fall a quendo Trail three thats too strong rebound Hol it was tapped away from Yan and Hol chased it down NOS one a run Holt head down getting to the rim stops floats off to the right AR I think a important part for Florida state is to besides Watkins and Yu especially with Davis not playing today a guy who usually could get in the lane and create as well whos going to be the next Guy step up talking about Hol is it going to be Thomas is it going to be B Bowen they need somebody else to step up offensively and conri and contribute active defense there wide open three Deng lets it Fly thats not going to fall Second Chance Den same spot connects that time Jerry Ds been playing well over the last three games for Florida State well how about jir Watkins pass it to him the first time missed it got it right back and he said hey I trust you pass it right back to his guy dang knocks it down Miller cant connect from about 12 ft Watkins handles the rock deep three straight away short yeah those are the shots right there ARA that you want to try to get a couple more passes I know hes feeling good but you didnt have any passes you had no side to side movement thats a tough shot right there by Watkins Miller cant hit the three heres a Applause Music foul its 1715 SMU Florida State though making a push how about the defense right there Watkins coming from the weak side blocking the shot which results in a three on the other end by Music g i um last night we had a little reunion reception and to see the guys uh respect uh that made the effort to come here and show their love for him uh its more than the game of basketball when you talking about Coach Hamilton Watkins do you and what does that say about the impacts coach ham had on a number of guys lives at a number of different programs thats a good point because obviously I just know him from the University of Kentucky but now Im a 63y old man that I told him last night at the reunion that I thank him for uh creating and uh developing the man that I have become today uh hes been beneficial for my uh children as well as my grandchildren and uh as an 18yearold kid I needed some guidance and he was there for me well Sam he I was talking to coach Hamilton in practice yesterday and he had a story a recruiting story about when he was recruiting you he said he he stayed in the truck stop Motel he didnt want anyone to know that he was recruiting you and what I guess what was his recruiting pitch to you that really you know stuck with you and got you to go to Kentucky you know to be honest with you when youre 17 years old and youre told youre the number one number two player in the country thats human nature to think that youre a little special and uh but with Coach Hamilton he never promised me anything all he told my mother and my father was that he would be there to take care of their uh son off the court he thought that my skills would take care of itself but he uh instilled discipline yes sir no sir um and the most that I received from coach Hamilton was off the basketball four and thats why its funny that you say that cuz every former player that I talk to we all know about his Hall of Fame coaching basketball career but none of them even mentioned that they were talking about the impact they had off the cour they come into Florida State or Kentucky or wherever it was he is at Miami you know maybe a immature young man but they they leave being a mature grown man and and learning about the impact of you know having on peoples lives off the floor and whats uh really touching is um seeing him last night relate and remember the name names of the nieces the nephews the cousins of all the players that he has touched over the years uh its just incredible because in order for him to do that it had to be genuine uh theres nothing fake about Coach ham and uh I think thats the drawing uh card is when he looks you in the eye you see a man thats being sincere and uh hell make you want to play hard for him I cant remember what I ate yesterday you know and for him to remember you know the and nephews names I mean that just shows you the attention to detail that coach ham has thats exactly right and I tell you he uh he was my assistant coach obviously under Coach Joe B Hall but back then he recruited all of the uh players not to take anything away from uh coach Hall but Leonard was the man to go out in the field and recruit the talent and uh he went in some neighborhoods that uh you would think you might need a little police escorts but coach what can he fit in any environment any atmosphere and knowing his upbringing who pause what a throw down there on the Alley looking like your old days is playing ball it must be nice to be young can you describe coach Hamm in one word no I cant fair enough no thats uh thatd be uh Id be lying to you theres uh not one word 2220 and a traveling Applause violation Sam appreciate you joining us here on the broadcast my pleasure glad be Tucker appreciate you Sam Ed break it down for us and you hear this is what Florida State thrives off their defense into offense getting out in transition in the open man Malik you a knows what to do with it 2017 NBA draft first rounder one of Coach Hamiltons top recruits ji made an NCA tournament with Florida State and again coach Hamilton a guy whos impacted so many lives in different ways and you think about a a conference that at the time UNC Duke right where the juggernauts you had to find different ways to be able to compete and so coach ham said I cant beat them with my starting five I got go beat him with 6 through 12 and its not easy to recruit seven or eight different interchangeable parts that the intensity and the energy and the execution doesnt also drop off and out of those 12 guys half of them are 68 and over you know and they can dribble the basketball can shoot the basketball but I was talking to Jim Bentley who was a former teammate of Coach Hamilton at UT Martin and he was saying that coach ham really took pride in playing defense and you can see his teams take on his personality and thats really how they Thrive when theyre able to create turnovers get out in transition and get easy opportunities at the bucket and thats whats kept him in this game so far Florida state was known for a number of years is having the ACC Sixth Man of the Year and those guys would go on to be first round draft picks you know fondu Cavin gelly Patrick Williams he wasnt shy about having Superior talents premium talents come off the bench for and and also it goes to show the development of his players you know guys who may come in a little bit raw but have that size and athleticism but when they leave you know theyre developed theyre shooting theyre dribbling and just their overall skill set and then get a chance in the NBA or or play professionally Watton stays with it and hes fouled great intensity from jir around the basket again this is what Florida State has to be able to do get out get easy opportunities and it doesnt hurt when you got a guy like Malik you and you can just throw the ball up to when he can go up there and slam it home Chuck Harris off to a terrific start SMU trying to get some of these other guys going on their Team Ambrose Hilton has three points Millers got two cross does have five but its been the Chuck Harris show so far SMU I mean they probably have some of the top guards in the country just being able to create by themselves shoot the basketball get in the lane and create for others and on the other end Florida States done a great job of attacking the paint 10 paint points here in this first half and jir Watkins using that big 67 215 lb frame to get in there create contact get an opportunity at the foul line nolles have been getting to the bucket 10 points in the pain Ed you talk about Florida States action trying to create paths in Lanes to the bucket theyve had a number of guys who swarm the basket for followup tapin and they had 16 offensive rebounds against Virginia in the midweek even in the loss well look they thrive in transition they want to try to get out and and play in transition but if they cant if they have to play in the half court set they have to be able to move the ball side to side and create opportunities to drive the basketball get into the and when they miss those shots everyone has to crash the glass get Second Chance opportunities Miller oh that was pretty are you kidding me boopy Miller talk about having a guy coming back who just can create on his own a little up and under George ginish finger roll you remember George gerin I know the name oh Eastern Michigan Detroit Michigan I got a shout out my home state but that was a little gerin is right there from boopy Miller is he old enough that I got to YouTube him is that is that where were at yes Taylor B Bowen well dont got a YouTube back its right in front of us well they have to have other guys step up and contribute and we know B Bowen is capable that we had a game early this year where he almost had a triple double so hes more than capable to contribute for this Florida State team tie game three ball rattles out for Harris hes had the hot hand early offensive rebound finger roll is there for Edwards Edwards known for his defensive prowess leads the ACC and steals but the jump in scoring Four Points a game to 10 points per game this season has really boost at SMU you see right now SMU going to a little bit of Zone great job by Florida State getting into the middle and thats what its going to create the defense to come in and you want to have opportunities like that you just have to knock him down if youre Jackson Edwards stps it away from Yan who thought he might have an easy put back opportunity Mustangs by two its a huge game for SMU and Andy enfields Enfield a former Florida State assistant Miller stayed on his feet Balo and got his hands on it a deflection out of bounds itll stay for the Mustang and hello boy Miller little Up and Under and a little George Gish a little flavor right there on the finger roll for boopy Miller they really miss boopy we thought he got hit on the face there as well and he might have had a point we talk about the straw that serves the drink Miller not just his ability to score he shares the basketball he plays great defense as that three ball is short offensive rebound for cross leads to an open three Harris lets it Fly that skims the front IR the two your point area offensively obviously hes getting guys in their spots and hes the leader but defensively hes guarding the point of attack hes keeping guys in front and hes one of the leaders and steals in ACC almost two a game yeah top 10 in the conference complete basketball player what a feed there you and made the mistake of putting the ball on the floor and SMU one of the conference leaders in Steels right behind Florida State actually they lead Florida State now they took the lead last weekend most Steels in the ACC is now SMU Florida State who led for most of the year as a team is second but you see what both teams were able to do and its no surprise right Enfield learned from coach Hamilton yeah well you hit it on the head in the beginning he cant put the ball on the ground right there when you get it that close to the basket you got to go up and try to dunk on him B Bowen Baseline attack active hands again for the Mustangs another steal here heres Miller open cork they want to run kick to the corner open three too strong a fight for the basketball last Touch by SMU in those black and blue Unis the Florida state cannot afford to turn over the ball anytime in transition or in half court giv SMU extra present is something that you cannot do if youre Florida state theyre already tough enough to Music guard little bit of pressure right here by SMU twopoint contest Ario mudi Eric dendor on the call here Saturday afternoon at the tuck one final time for Coach ham how about luk hes starting to come to life late in his freshman season well thats what you have to do put a guy in the middle whos capable to score the ball capable of making plays and once you get it in that high post area turn and be a threat great job by maluk turning seeing the open shot knocking it down he reclassed one year should still be in high school at eight points four rebounds against Virginia in the middle of the week his best stat line to date its a tie game late in this first half and how about the defense by maluk a 7ot center power forward guarding one of the best guards in the ACC in boy Miller and staying in front yes indeed Watkins on the attack strength hes fouled tried to torque his body for the Finish will be at the line when we return four to six seaing wise the double bu could be a big deal could we see Mustangs tar Hills two teams that are battling out for one of those final spots and they want to play a good quality opponent because they want to try to get quad one wins and look with all the situations and all the scenarios a lot of that stuff is out of your hands right just do what you can whats in front of you win this game and then win the next game and go forward Watkins connects on both first leads for Florida State and since it was 9 to8 early in this half 2927 AR you knowah or excuse me Florida States doing a great job of keeping SMU out of the paint and then when they do get in the pain theyre coming from the weak side blocking shots and then getting out in transition jir Watkins again using that strong body just a freight train getting downhill opportunity at the free throw line and EG boopy Miller committed the foul but might have took the majority of that contact look at this great start though for the nolles here defensively on the highl well thats walking second weak side block and then if he gets the ball hes just out and running freight train and you said it booby Miller if you get in front of him and we wish you the best you know what that reminds me of Eric think of when like an a huge NFL running back starts running downfield you see a corner come in to try and make a tackle and they regret having attempted The Tackle well thats why they get paid Millions to step in front of those type of of those big guys then usually get get your head knocked off a good portion of the time how about this no 1600 career points one of nine active players in the ACC for jir Watkins congrats to him congrats to him in every single year hes improved every single freshman sophomore junor in his senior year hes improved and hes added something to his game and this year we talked about it early on nearly a 40 threepoint shooter hes got 11 in the first half to lead Florida State simal by by four defensively theyve made life tough on Music Applause SMU boy Mustangs cant get anything at the bucket to come easy you thought Florida State might play for Coach ham at a different energy level here today well when they play with you know energy and effort and are active on the defensive side of the ball I mean you look at it 66 67 68 611 what a block Taylor Bowen sent that in a different area co when youre that size and have that athleticism if youre playing with energy and and active its going to be tough for the opposing guys to finish at The Rim B Bowen showing his length in athleticism right there and a quendo no sir aeno touche Applause Taylor bbo in top five in the ACC in blocks and Florida St leads the ACC in blocks theres a foul on the floor with the nolles leading by four and ARA a big part of smus offense is in the pick and roll and when you play against a team who switches everything it really negates you know the effectiveness of the pick and roll so SMU struggling right now to find that Applause Advantage just incred incredible intensity defensively from Florida State thats going to stay with SMU Andy Enfield talked about needing more back Cuts right against that switching defense trying to use that aggression against Florida State and you have to do it quick so on that switch you have to try to get by right there and just create that opportunity with a cut or a or a lift off of that corner just try to get an opportunity at The Rim or an open jump shot Miller will try to break b b and down help defense Watkins out of deflection six on the clock Au quendo against Jackson hes stuck on him like glue fade away three is short shot clock violation that is classic Leonard Hamilton Applause basketball and I tell you what if if youre going to play ISO oneonone basketball against Florida State youre going to be in trouble because with the length and athleticism that they have with the mo Mobil of their guys they could stay in front its going to be tough all night for this SMU team well the Mustangs are 0 for their last eight from the floor simol with his fourpoint lead trying to extend huan stays with it I dont know how he made it leaning and fading away and you know theyre doing a great job of just getting the ball in the middle against the Zone when you getting the ball in the middle against his own the defense collapsed and now they have to make a choice either stay there or get back out in the shooters you in with a great job of getting in just going up strong a minute to play in the half Miller step through layup o explosive to the rack from boy if youre going to go on Florida State you have to be decisive and go quick youing just a little late on that backside help right there timeout taken by Florida State they lead 33 29 well be right back Music oh its a great job by Florida State getting the ball into the middle of that zone good Patience by Watkins good job by you and just being there and then just being strong being aggressive going up finishing against the trees and thats what Florida state has to do against his Zone get the ball in the middle and then just be able to make good decision you number one in the ACC leads the conference in field goal percentage high efficiency player around the rim its been an excellent find for Leonard Hamilton and Coach Jones Stan Jones a longtime associate head coach I think thats a guy who doesnt get enough credit for what hes meant to Florida state has been Leonards righthand man the entire Music time Harris trying to break down Watkins excellent help defense from jaylor Jackson Yan has it knocked throws it to the back court see what they call that it will be over and Applause back I think its technically correct it it it is technically correct but just the activity and guys playing hard jir Watkins doing a great job of his chesting up and you see Jackson coming from the weak side ripping the ball out and then just bodies everywhere getting on the ground hustling showing effort and energy thats what you want to see if youre Leonard Hamilton in this Florida State basketball team guys showing effort being active bringing energy on the floor to take a line from Ron bergundy and Anchor Man boy that really escalated quickly and while Eric gathers himself Championship Sunday the womens game day crew will be at the well in green Greenville South Carolina at noon Eastern to get you set for six Title Games highlighted by these three on ESPN The Ally ACC Championship match up begins at 1 followed by the SEC and we finish up with the Philip 66 Big 12 title on the line what an afternoon from Championship womens Hoops that tournament is poised the big dance to be unbelievable on the womens side as well its a lot of talent overall in in womens basketball its college basketball professional basketball the tent just keeps Rising each and every year 156 seconds left in the first half Florida State leading by four a spirited opening stands especially defensively theyve held SMU to just 34 from the floor and they force seven turnovers SMU is a team thats averaging 80 points a game great effort defensively this half by Florida State on the floor that is only Florida States sixth team foul it is Watkins second foul he will go to the bench for the final eight seconds if theres one thing that FSU wants to clean up in this second half its those nine turnovers that they have they want to be able to clean that up and not give extra possessions to SMU because when you do you got guys like bopy Miller knocking it down in your face right at the buzzer I think create great conversation little smarter than both of us I guess but if you have a fourth best team in the ACC compared to a 13th best team in the secc I mean I guess Im not a mathematics major but you would think that four seed would get in thee a foul on Deng after he missed the jumper Florida State Leads Here by one Joe Lenards got 13 SEC teams in I mean theyve been a phenomenal conference the best in college basketball at least this season big 10s got 10 Big 12 eight then its Big East Mountain West you know five and three ACC just three and and look Kudos the SEC they have had an unbelievable Year great teams but 13 bids youre leaving out some good teams from the ACC we talk about SMU and North Carolina the way that theyre playing I just think that if these guys go on a run win two three more games especially get a quad one win theyll put themselves back in in a spot to be in the NCAA tournament that ball bounced away twice from IGI three ball Corner Pocket connected Jerry D is pure from threes Florida state has to keep getting out in transition creating easy opportunities great job getting ah head to Thomas Thomas a great look in the corner Danang finishing knocking down the corner three Edwards had it blocked by you and oh thats a really late foul Applause call great job passing ahead Thomas touched it got right out of his hands with the open dang knocking down the corner three and this one right here AR you cant call this on leard Hamilton day okay regardless and I dont even think it was a foul at all but neither neither did the ref until a couple seconds passed exctly Applause Applause free throw good for Edwards started his career in Tennessee and BJ again known for his defense with the physicality he plays with hes had some incredible games hes also shared the basketball in Elite level top 15 in the ACC coming into the game knocks them both down and Ari hes another guy that with bopy Miller back on the floor he could kind of settle back into the role that he was playing in in the beginning of the season and hes another another guy whos capable of doing a lot on the floor dang was wide open for three that time maybe two open didnt knock it down Florida save by one Miller tried to flip it in and off his off foot good idea but thats just the length in athleticism you see Malik you right there man baby this guy has an NBA skill set one thing thats holding him back is just his effort and energy if he can continue to play hard 40 minutes no question that this guy is an NBA Prospect you give that kid a jump shot good luck yigu patient Applause foul how about your Center coming down the floor behind the back and then an Up and Under finishing with the we talked about George gerin finishing with the finger roll and hes doing this against bopy Miller whos one of the top guards defensively in the ACC Malik Yuan if he continues to play with effort and energy this guy is no doubt in my mind an NBA basketball player a big man with that kind of body control and the ability to hang in the air thats rare well this is what the game is now you see all the bigs at every single level their skill set is on the perimeter they got Inside Out game and Malik Y is just another example of that s gou hits a couple from the line 15th game you and Watkins have both scored 10 points and see what that means is Watkins aggressive to the rack REO and sers you and I have had a chance to see those guys a couple times good do0 in the ACC but Florida state has two guys that are aggressive for them each and every night and Im just big fan a walking this is the fourth game Ive done for Florida State and when hes aggressive when he puts his head down and get to the basket theres nobody in the country that could stop him 67 215 hes an improved shooter from the perimeter this guy has a bright future and mind you he has another year of Eligibility left Watkins hits the free throw time now for UFC 3113 its tonight and its in Vegas highlighted by a light heavyweight title fight and Justin gais return to the Octagon prelims begin at 8 Eastern on ESPN news and ESPN plus main card begins at 10 Eastern on paper review to buy the main card go to ESPN pluscom ppv Watkins has been perfect from the free throw line hes now eight for eight and AR just a little thing that I see on a shot sometimes he almost goes straight but when he gets that elbow up and through that shot out his money NOS by three Harris cross at the Block wrap around he walked took an extra step cross didnt think so neither do his head coach Andy Applause Enfield and and honestly Malik you and you have to go up and wall up right there youre just getting out the way really got lucky that cross got away with the travel or he didnt get away with the travel but Yan you have to be more aggressive defensively and be a presence around the rim Fe down what a move and a reverse from you and is pure thats my thing dont show me what you can do on this side of the ball and then come down on the defensive side of the floor and play oay defense do it on both sides of the floor and just continue to give effort and energy biggest lead is five Yan a special player down low for Florida State back after missing a couple of games and boy did the nlls miss him its an FSU team whos lost four in a row alyo flush nice feed there from Chuck Harris to trayor Johan trayor getting some minutes in this one the Junior from France and he you know what hes athletic hes active and he just does a great job of being around the rim you see right here maliku and hes showing his skill sets spinning off right away finishing on the opposite side of the rim we just talked about having continued continued effort on the other side of the ball as well you and dominating he is just completely taking over this game counted and one all right I Im going to quit talking about the defensive side of the ball were going to stick to offense if hes keeps producing like that get him the ball in the middle and he is being decisive tonight against SMU attacking the basket much to the Delight of his teammates Maliks got 14 in his first game back not showing any signs of rust splashes home the free throw as well but AR theyre just a totally different team you know without Ying they dont have any type of inside presence and all the pressure really falls on jir Watkins but when he plays they have that inside out balance much much more coach Hamilton Coach Jones known for developing big men and you and the strides hes made from game one of this season to where we are now in game number 31 has been immense Florida State basketball at its finest defense to offense length to transition and its a timeout taken by SMU cannot be Loos with the basketball against this Florida State team Justin Thomas getting a hand on the ball getting out in transition where Florida State thrives finishing at the bucket for two really changed this Renaissance of Florida say basketball playing a spread offense five out at times four out one in and the talent level really Skyrocket at the ns second run under coach Hamilton well how about that back court right there talk about shooting and playmaking creating ability Music je Florida State playmaking so far here today the lead by eight Miller was looking for a response cant get it h pushes it up too strong for B Bowen chase down by Miller Edwards to the wing cross attack layup count it from the Baseline quick hitter there for the Mustangs and y does a great job of of getting the ball out but he has to be more selective when hes doing it and again defensively he has to show more effort getting to outside of the block and trying to contest that cross layup cross has seven and four great extra pass Thomas cant hit the three clean look from the right wing Miller pushing the pace layup it goes in anyway that was Jerell Colbert number 20 and just overall defensively theyve been active theyve been playing like Florida State basketball when it comes to defensive side of the ball Ed has SMU found something with some of those quick hitters fueled by their defense I think you have to against this Florida State Defense when you let them set up and having to play against that length and athleticism and and Mobility that those guys have you have to be decisive in your decision making or your drivve to the basket and SMU is do a much better job this half doing it bling staying with it attacks counted and the basket he was decisive Applause Music there that is grown man strength from number one and you said it grown man strength and he doesnt really he he doesnt show a lot of emotion but he just plays hard as heck hes 67 we talked about 2115 hes just a bully down there at the guard position and hes able to fight down there with the big guys and finish around the rim and have another opportunity at the free throw line where he spent a lot of time this season and hes done it in a variety of ways now 15 points six rebounds three assists make it 16 Eric where does he fit in do you think at the next level in terms of the NBA and where he might be able to get some opportunities well I think defensively you know for teams he hes versatile he can he can guard one through four hes strong hes got better at his decision making as he continues to his improve his jump shot he could be a guy who could really be you know possibly a three and D type of guy but I I see a guy coming off the bench having a role being a really good Defender and and just playing those spot minutes when he gets the ball you know getting out in transition and trying to contribute on the offensive side as well a some comparisons to Carris Levert of the gaps some people like the way that that matchup fits and that comparison fits 50 to 43 nolles by seven Harris strong move oh it rattled out on him as SMU able to retain possession yes they are cross and Colbert just combined on B Bowen there and Clos down the angles cause the turnover out of bounds they only get a fresh 20 oh AR sorry to uh one thing that Florida state has to do when SMU drives they have to get off that other offensive player and then get over quicker on that weak side help and try to protect that Rim better another deflection leads to a steal and a foul Miller thatll be his Applause second thats 10 turnovers on SMU thats what Florida state does well just being active getting deflections getting out in the passing Lanes being disruptive with their length and athleticism theyve been doing a really good job this whole game of making it tough for SMU defensively Virginia 11 for 24 against the nlls in the middle of the week from Beyond The Arc SMU just five of 16 simal have ran them off the line near steel Watkins will call his own number from three nearly had it rattled out cross Aly thats perfect well done by the Mustangs o quendo on the Finish FL stay has to get back when theyre missing shots and transition theyve been doing a good job of making SMU play in half court dont let them start getting out transition getting easy looks see if that gets a quendo going hes only got four Thomas wraparound layup no you and too strong on the Block one of the best offensive rebounders in the country and he was fouled there oh they average 80 points a game and great job by getting the ball ahead AC cross and then the Aly do a quendo and he knows what to do with it explosive athlete finishing at The Rim third in the ACC in points per game second and field goal percentage to just Duke second and threepoint field goal percentage 31 though today are the Mustangs H soft spot tried to make an extra pass instead of going up with it its a turnover Mustangs have been dangerous here Miller yes and one you said it ARA when you get the ball in the middle and your seven foot do not pass it anymore if you have to wait play off two feet go up strong thats a great job by acendo getting back in there getting a deflection on the ball and once this man boy Miller gets out in transition good luck bopy a blur in that moment hes got 11 started his career at Central Michigan hits the free throw there hes 81 on the year phenomenal boies hit some just huge shots against Virginia gal Baptist to win some games late this season on the way to 22 overall victories for the Mustangs Watkins slices to the rack Applause wow that was an assertive drive for jir its 5248 he really needs no space once he gets you on his hip its over for the defender hes just way too strong cross snow Watkins collects the rebound thats his seventh jir on double double watch fired inside Yan fouls hes nearly automatic around the rim hell go to the line andll take us to a break with the NOS leading by four and good luck when you get this guy guarding him on your hip strong shoulder in your chest finishing with the inside hand of the rim jir Watkins even after the buzzer the buzzer sound so I mean hes had definitely an impact in our lives in my life for sure as Yan knocks down the first of two free throws how much fun has it been to watch Malik youan play today oh man hes very athletic wish I would have had him on my team as well hey talk about you kind of mentioned the impact that coach Hamilton has on his guys off the court I talked to a lot of former guys at practice in that shoot around we know about the Hall of Fame the basketball career that coach Hamilton have but no ones really even said anything to be about that everything every player said to me is about how the impact they had on them off the court and and growing them growing them into uh into a man I I know for sure like he um he put two books in my life one was called um the Bible for one and also uh Point man um two two books that I still read every day um and he he definitely had a lot of great times talking talking with them throughout the season and after the season as well give me your sorry are give me your best coach Hamilton moment oh man its too many to pick um I would say probably um this is interaction in in practice with this like he knows how to balance the room and read the room as far as like knows how to have fun but also knows how to be serious with us at the same Applause time a quendo just hit a shot inside that time no you and who connected for Florida State to extend it to five big man bringing the ball down wants to take it himself oh baby Coast to Coast good move Music Applause Good Michael how do you describe Leonard Hamilton in one Applause Music word I I would say I would say greatness I I would say greatness for me I mean he hes definitely had an impact in in not just my life again but just the other players and and people that hes coming to contact no doubt weve been talking about Malik ying a lot today and his skill set and what he provides on the offensive side of the ball being able to dribble pass shoot tonight hes getting to the rim and finishing strong Edwards BAS sline wrap around three ball oh yes Kio Endo trims the deficit to four dang he wants a three thats too strong oh theres a scrum underneath and coming away with it his SMU what was one thing coach ham taught you just how to deal with adversity um nothings going to come easy um and I didnt expect it to be easy but just to keep keep fighting and I think its helped me out in the Journey of my life as well theres a foul there on the floor Michael let me ask you this we talk about you the transition between coach Robinson to coach ham Hams selling you his vision to see what that program became in the years after you moved on to your professional career did you ever think it would get to the heights that it did of winning ACC and making Elite eights I knew it would one day um just because of what he had did in Miami and what he had did like before he had got here um and also just the type of players that hes brought in here hes brought in guys that are more like blue collar players rather than McDonald all amican all the time so guys that wanted to play and they and they guys came here and they wanted to play for him and they played hard how cool is it to come back and see all these former guys throughout a bunch of different eras of Florida State basketball come back hang out talk about a bunch of old stories like a fraternity its surreal to me like you guys could have told me this is coach him last basketball game like just to see the GU to see the love just shows you how great of a man hes been not just as a as a coach but also a father figure to a lot of us players here on Leonard Hilton day Florida State leading by four defensive intensity leading the charge here for the n the intensity coming from SMU on that possession defensively theyll have the basketball Michael whats the whats the difference when you played and how the program was compared to now obviously the nil we Wen look they owe us some money I know that right yes they do they definitely owe with some money but I would say I would say man like the guys are just longer in taller Im at every position I would say um obviously I think the start of my era was more the point forward you know the guys like can the four is like myself we can bring the ball up ourselves but the point guard its just the game is Just spaced out five out four out guys are everyones creating I think I should have played in this era yeah me too you coach from WNBA now as well how do you see both sides mens and womens games is continuing to evolve its definitely definitely evolving um the womens side is definitely fun out there in Phoenix with the Phoenix Mercury um obviously saw the emergence of how Caitlyn Clark has coming into the game as well and just uh even with d Diane terasi just leaving right now leaving the game in a great place so its definitely definitely emerging and definitely going to keep continue to climb and grow let me ask you this too Mike is tan Ladson on the radar talk about womens tanayia Ladson she on the radar the WNBA Florida State star I really think she is um I I really wish I would have been able to come out here to see more games but I know she has a great coach in Brooke so uh Brook was here when I was here as well so I know Brook is teaching her the right way but this get a chance to see Natasha Howard play as well um play played against her as well um for Dallas former former seminal a legend for Florida State meanwhile its a twopoint game SMU is Tri the lead oh over the top Yan at the bucket cant get the friendly roll he will however go to the free throw line thats what you have to do if youre Florida State against this Zone get the ball into the middle and then you have to be able to turn and make a good decision just be aggressive if youre Malik Yu and attacking the basket here with Florida State former star Michael Joiner you see Harris 11 point points in the first half none in the second youan a 20po performance with 12 in the second half make it 21 lead extends to three Michael what do you think about Malik euan and his chances of playing at the next level in the NBA I think he has a good shot um he definitely has a good motor um hes athletic uh obviously still some things we probably could work on but I mean I think he has a solid shot playing pro 5955 a quendo from the other Corner no rebound dang see if Florida State wants to run pushes it up ahead Watkins Deng left wing back up top simal will run their offense H floater oh my goodness his kids in his back AR is funny I saw him working on that with Coach Jones earlier and shoot around just that short roll getting into that floater and thats the exact same shot that they were working on lay up on the other side Au quendo hes coming to life here for SMU last couple moments hes like a linebacker out there at the guard position right there if you get in his way good luck to you timeout taken by coach h Michael appreciate you joining us man of pleasure thank you all for having apprciate man doing a good job Ms by four Here Comes Florida State and SMU he worked on that earlier the flo for the big get over that home I mean yeah you would think look we we talked about having 22 wins back in the day that automatically got you in especially in a conference like in the ACC but I I think two quad ones would probably yeah put him in the AC NCAA tournament for sure havent made the big dance since the 2016 2017 season offensive rebound and the stick back by D thats pure heart pure hustle Malik Watkins or excuse me Malik Yu jir Watkins 16 from Yu this half seven from Watkins but they need these other guys to step up and Ds been a guy who stepped up the whole game he has 11 points and hes been active on both sides of the ball Florida State extends that lead to six seven minutes to play cross into that corner okendo has had a nice second half step back shoot no offensive rebound tie up should be a jump ball possession arrow both guys fell out of bounds yep two thumbs up itll stay with the Mustangs great effort for SMU there as well to keep a SMU team under their scoring average isnt an easy task AR you so it just goes to show you how active Florida state has been on the defensive side of the ball in this Music game Miller inbounds endo one of the best offenses in the ACC one of the best in the country Endo leans in hes fouled draws the contact and hell go to the line I mean look if he gets any type of step ahead of you theres no way youre going to be be able to get back in front of this guy I mean look at his shoulders hes just going to put it right in your chest hes going to knock you off your spot there opportunity at the line and knock down Music two Caro an 81 for free throw shooter began his career at Florida Southwestern before going to ug in the SEC average 15 a game at one season for the dogs then went to Oregon now SMU and Andy Enfield cour splits the free throws fivepoint game in Tallahassee on Leonard Hilton day his final contest and final regular season game this one at the tuck and tally Wat put his head down and the ns are in the bonus so hell go to the line simal by five have played outstanding defense Eric its an SMU team that scored nearly 120 points against Miami in a game earlier this season what kind of effort have you seen from FSU in coach hams D well first off scoring 120 points in college basketball is unheard of but just defensively for Florida State theyve just been ac they making it difficult for them SMU when they get to the rim with their switches its been tough SMU hasnt really been able to get any advantage in the pick and roll but offensively you said it theyre in the bonus for the rest of the game they have to continue to be aggressive these last 6 minutes its a big Miss there on the front end Harris working against Dan step back doesnt shoot it pass him intercepted Thomas into the lane lays it up and in timeout taken Andy Enfield is Music Applause furious Florida State leads by seven its been a classic defensive performance from coach hams nolles Music Music Florida State by seven coach ham lot of emotion here in his final game in tahashi well how about Thomas hes just providing that defensive spark and thats his second time getting still getting out in transition and finishing and leard Leonard Hamilton on Leonard Hamilton day thats his happy face and that one is what a gem this games going to miss him no doubt about it Florida state will miss him college basketball will miss him 100 under 6 minutes to go for Florida State to get a big one against SMU on Leonard Hamilton day the Mustangs need a comeback similar to the one they had against Syracuse in the middle of the week a foul there Onan Q led by 12 in that game in a furious rally and what they call Moody the Moody Coliseum in Dallas allowed SMU to get a tip in right at the buzzer essentially with 15 seconds left and Starlings attempts at the actual buzzer rattled in and out do we have to talk about that ARA the C do we have to talk about that game only because its relevant to this game my friend absolutely front end Music connected Qui a game from CET Florida State size y specifically has given the Turkish big man a problem hed been fantastic IC coming in had 12 against C 19 games in double figures for the Mustangs this Applause season not a great free throw shooter and he splits him Sixpoint contact I think just as much as the size but the athleticism and the mobility of this Florida State defense is really making it tough for him zone defense there leads to a Miss B Bowen from short range thats a spot you want to get it though you want to be able to get in the short corner its a great opportunity you just got to finish it Edwards short corner backs it out heres bopy Millers got 12 points had nine in the first half just three in the second Edwards drives Lefty no off the backboard rebound Applause Thomas almost some friendly fire from Florida State B Bowen picks up his dribble the Comfort to let the big man go to work but couldnt connect and a foul going the other way Mustangs will be at the line but he has the advantage Malik Yan every single time he has the basketball and he makes C come out from the basket he has the advantage with the speed and athletic athleticism to get by just got to be able to finish those at The Rim but keep attacking keep being aggressive when you get the ball you has tied a career high hes got 24 points did that against Miami as well its a double bonus Applause here cross connects in case you forgot which Im sure you did 630 tonight ESPN its our featured college basketball match up continuing with Cooper flag second ranked Duke taking on UNC our Sonic Blockbuster oh baby five me up who you got oh I think Duke Carolinas playing at an incredibly high level though so and they need the win are they at the dean Dome as well I believe they are RJs got to go for like 30 yeah I Im with you Im taking D taking the easy way out well whos going to stop out watch youre right well whos going to stop Cooper flag nobody nobody has been able to exactly and the first game in Cameron wasnt close and theyre a wagon this season are those Blue Devils got Tyrese Proctor back as well its a big deal theyre going to be competing for a national championship 100 Miller connects fading away from about 10 ft well if youre SMU you just have to continue to be aggressive your guards are who have been carrying you the whole season keep being aggressive contining trying to make plays four straight points for the Mustangs its just a twopoint game Jackson working against the Zone turning facing flipped in theyre going to count the basket couldnt quite tell who got a hand on it and the officials thought it was awkward as well it is going to count great job right there by Jackson getting to the rim collapsing the defense count the Tipping Florida State gives him another shot associ should head coach Stan Jones said hes basketball immature hes still trying to figure out his game hes coming to life late in this season so one thing I I know that Malik yui needs me and you to do more of his basketball games thats what he needs thats going well when you and I have been here its a good basketball game here offensive foul called on a quendo Watkins went tumbling to the wood Applause Jamir Watkins for me hes an underrated Defender I think hes one of the best defenders in the ACC from the guard spot his versatility on that end he could switch he could guard bigs just a great play right there a great effort play by jir Watkins mendos got three fouls Nolls out scoring SMU 3224 in the paint Florida State also has 12 Second Chance points in this game leading by four smus gone to his Zone last couple of possessions ball bow and good catch and shoot threepoint fires away and connects and AR I think smus whole idea is they dont think Florida state has a lot of Shooters in their right but they do have capable Shooters if you can beat the Zone shooting the basketball having open opportunities both bowling knock it down five straight games for B bone with at least one three made hes up his average 30 from Beyond The Arc in this sophomore year cross the response thats huge for the Mustangs had to have it a sevenpoint deficit now just four noes and M Mustangs exchange threes a little over two minutes to play screen set Kick to the corner Jackson Baseline attack couldnt finish foul called its on the floor Yan went down hes in some pain looks to be okay double bonus time for Florida State theyll shoot two great job by Watkins just attacking getting into the paint kicking out to his shooter B Bowen knocking it down thats one way to get a team out of the Zone then on the other end Matt cross you cannot lose him you got to know where Matt cross is at all times hes going to knock that down every single time if hes open cross has 12 points 14th consecutive game for cross with at least 10 points in those double figures so you and at the line Malik four of five here today just 65 on the year and these are critical now first one is good new career high with Applause 25 and Arya its a huge game obviously because you want to win it for Leonard Hamilton but I think just having some momentum going into the ACC tournament we know last year what nc8 did and went on that historic run all the way to the final four they have the players where they can go on that same type of run smus got to get this win and need some help or it might be a crucial ACC tournament Brandy enfields Club down six foul Applause calls Jackson got a little hands he wanted a jump ball instead cross will go to the line for two free throws its a good job being aggressive defensively but he just got caught you got caught with your hands in the cookie jar but going into this postseason play defensively thats what going to win you basketball games you have to be able to lock in on the defensive side of the basketball you have to bring that energy and that effort every single game on that end critical Miss cross 71 coming into today he was two for two prior to that one the UMass transfer Atlantic 10 first team m one season too takes a deep breath second free throw count it five Point deficit coming down Florida State just execute you dont need to rush anything get some good executions move the ball from side to side try to create some openings and when you see it attack it as you might guess Watkins will have the ball and touch it a lot on this possession and probably look for number 12 Malik euan as well High screen coming its set there from muan switch by the Mustangs tough fade a jumper is pure thats a Next Level big man move there from Watkins and the response from Miller quickly as theres just a minute left to play well you got to be able to get back and set up defense in the half court but if youre Florida State give jir Watkins the basketball and let him create Yan behind the backpack Applause be careful with that one near steel Watkins comes away with it dribbled it off his leg Mustangs get the turnover Harris into the paint pulls it out to Miller Miller cross deep three in the air back iron battling for it Thomas comes away with it foul by Miller and Florida States faithful on its feet here on Leonard Hamiltons de fivepoint lead a little over 25 seconds left for career ACC win number 200 for Coach H Arya we talked about it before the game and just how much of a honor it is to be able to do Leonard Hamiltons last regular season game and for his team to show this type of effort send him off with the win in front of the home crowd unbelievable feeling for Coach Leonard Hamilton Thomas sinks a big first free Music throw second left and short rebound eigi Miller inside the point speed Edwards fires a three partially blocked thrown down to wkins Watkins Ball B it he pulls it away six now with five and a foul call with 39 that ignites the tough Florida States going to get the job done here for the headman one of the alltime Legends Leonard Hamilton Applause Music Applause Music coach ham loves it the effort the hustle jir Watkins will come off the floor one final time for FSU you can see the emotion starting to build inside of Coach ham he told us I wasnt going to think about it because we have a game to win but certainly now its setting in well thats what type of guy is he doesnt want any of the credit right he gives everybody else the credit but man I tell you what theres not many coaches forget college basketball in sports period that could be with one team for 23 years unbelievable job by Leonard Hamilton coach Hamilton changed the way Florida State fans believed about what they could do in basketball in the ACC couple titles took down Duke in North Carolina a handful of times as that one misses but in the end one of the Legends one of the alltime greats he ends with a victory here in Tallahassee 200 career ACC regular
