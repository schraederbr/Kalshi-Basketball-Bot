they played really good defense in that one they absolutely did play great defense and of course we talked about baycott chasing Jordan that would be to enter the top 15 in scoring for the University of North Carolina which of course has produced 81 1 000 Point scores yeah thats it thats all a lot of history there speaking of History FSU with some kind of comfort behind win against of all people Miami a lot of people will tell you the best team in the league there were 25 down came back and as you said Matthew Cleveland hit that shot trying to get a quick strike here but Worley cant get it to go and Florida State got the exact action that they wanted will be unable to handle the lob with great execution to start the game North Carolina holding Virginia under 40 percent on Saturday so their D really did the deed well gives it up for Davis coming off a really nice game 16 points and 10 rebounds hes had a few more double doubles than people think absolutely you think about the point guard going out and getting double doubles with rebounds and get a chance to look at the starting lineups for Florida State tonights lineup brought to you by CDW that includes Cleveland Yates to start a senior thank you very much hey Cleveland hes getting more minutes than I was expecting early Caleb Mills already at the scores table but of course Cleveland Yanks has gotten a minute under his belt early okay the typically 13 points a game and the North Carolina is starting five brought to you by CDW Music he black in there at six nine well we say six nine I know you were giving him the business earlier today you guys have a relationship so you can do that we can do that and again you know I will allow the program hike to say six nine I wont call him out anymore as if I havent done it enough love and that didnt touch anything it does get back inside of the block of the foul will go against Matthew Cleveland offensive rebounding that is one of the shrimps of North Carolina of course Armando baycott leads the ACC and offensive rebounds over four per game but one of the weaknesses of this Florida State team something that the Seminoles are going to have to take care of their defensive board in this game of course always a superb Defender this season no different as he drops in number one tough season for Huber Davis but people have been talking about this for you know about a week two weeks it Bears a lot of resemblance to last year around the same time when they played their way into the NCAA tournament but Huber made it very clear to us early today that regardless as to what has happened hes proud of his team and the way that these young men have developed throughout this season not just because of their win on Saturday but what theyve done all season now now for FSU a win for the ages against Miami Saturday 8584 on Matthew Clevelands buzzer beater that was the biggest comeback in the history of the ACC the jumper is going to be in and out and actually when you think about these two teams matching up the largest comeback in the history of ACC basketball was between Florida State and North Carolina until that win for the for the Seminoles on Saturday they cut working working high off the window but no a Scramble for it comes back out for Nance and hell stick it from threepoint lead hes coming off 22 against Virginia and Pete Nash picking up where he left off in the first half on Saturday he was four for four from Beyond the threepoint Arc didnt take a threepoint shot in the second half off the fake Mills to drive it with the left hand oh thats a pretty play nice comp fake by Kayla Mills to get Caleb love off of his feet and of course the C party for him to be able to get to the rim of the easy finish getting back to Pete Nance I mean there have been critics of his play this year that Moore was expected of the transfer but lately he is starting to really play and all that criticism comes because Brady manic was so big for Carolina last year speaking of big for Carolina leaky black in that corner he is a very good Corner shooter of course most teams know that so he doesnt get as many opportunities but North Carolina although a great but gonna be a whistle before and he shot attempts Leonard Hamilton head coach for FSU highly complimentary of the Miami team his Seminoles rallied to defeat over the weekend but it has been a lost year for the Seminoles at 9 and 27 and 11 in the ACC but I can appreciate the way the Seminoles continue to battle I mean again seven ACC wins they only have nine overall wins on the season this team has gotten better as ACC play has gone along the playing against better competition yeah they get up here Dreadful start knocked down by Worley shes in the Worley to sophomore out of Pennsylvania who recently lit a pit for 23 basketball dance up top for bacon Armando gives up the dribble heres Davis wanted that lane and knocked away from him right into a fast break Mills all the stuff hes a oneman fast break Caleb Mills recognizing leaky leaky black shirelling that play you have to dunk that you lay it up as getting blocked Kayla Mills with a strong finish and hes been great since coming off the bench so one point game early Applause baycod again hes working on the 74 nahima cloud love will drive it and gets the scoop Music averaging 17 a game you remember how good he was in the NCAA tournament last year throughout the tournament averaging 19 the sevenfooter blocked by black a demanded he covers some brown you remember what I just said layups get blocked you better dunk it nahim McLeod the seven footer you better dunk it and the cloud on the other end Returns the favor Armando baycott you better dunk it kills no off the back of the iron one and done for the Seminoles yeah we have some shot Pluckers on the floor thats usually the case when you play Florida State regardless of their record at the time and Davis will set it up about 15 to go here in the first half shot clock at eight thats tipped by FSU Nance goes Sports shot clocks at four got to get it in the air and thatll rattle home by Caleb love Caleb love just a quick Glimpse over to the bench where he finds his former teammate Cameron Fletcher who is out injured for Florida State after tearing his ACL those two guys with AAU teammates its been a big part of the narrative for Leonard this season injuries along with players who did not return to the program he admits kind of by surprise a little bit Cleveland will draw the foul Matthew Cleveland having a very solid individual year for the Knowles I believe thats going to be the second foul on Armando baycott but Caleb love off to a great start the nice decision to find leaky black in the corner whose three is good but on the other end of the floor speaking of great decisions Kayla Mills decision to dunk it was the right one 50 percent as a team at the three for five out of the gate and they lead it 126 time to bring in Angel gray Angel both sides have something to play for going to be interesting to see how they get there tonight absolutely OB will veteran experience a huge Factor coming into this one for this very reason UNC has not won in this building since 2016 so you have the Tar Heels who are not only playing with a different level of desperation theyre playing with more experience so coach hams trusting to his team not only playing with that energy and effort but on both sides just fight what their records may be coach coach Hoover Davis saying the exact same thing we were in their shoot around earlier he said listen attention to detail and sharpness Corey I ask you how are both teams doing at this point I believe both teams have gotten off to a great start with everything that their coaches were preaching in their shoot arounds this morning angel but the attention to detail and we Huber Davis almost had his guys running lines this morning he was on them making sure they understood the importance of this game and stepping up at the most important moments again they cant look ahead to Duke on Saturday theyve got to take care of business here tonight and theres another level as you said eyes on it because theyre a bunch of NBA Scouts how many did you say are here 15 NBA Scouts in the building and many of them here of course to see Baba Miller from Florida State but leaky black has become very intriguing to many of the NBA Scouts his defensive ability and his ability to knock down Corner threes and list it at six nine which of course you know how I feel about that but still has great positional sizes a three and D guy hes starting to become very interesting to many NBA personnel Bob Miller we had a quick shot theres 611 freshmen from Spain went from 62 at the age of 14 to 611 at 18 his age now turn around in the paint and Cleveland whos very active with the basketball draws another foul so he rises up just as we say 611 from 62 in a heartbeat yeah you get the opportunity to look at Baba Miller who came over and introduced himself to us earlier today great chance to talk to him and very polite young man I know Leonard Hamilton of course would love to see him stick around for another season at Florida State but one thing that coach ham would not be as surprised by anyone leaving the program at this point yes unfortunately hes talked about that lately you know maybe a couple times being caught by surprise not that he didnt have discussions with a handful of players but didnt really think they were ready to go yet to the NBA well if you look at this roster there are four guys from last years team alone that could be on this roster and would have made a complete difference for this Florida State team a season to go and you think about the four returners from North Carolina when you of course leaky black Amanda bacon RJ Davis a cave of love from a national championship runnerup team a year ago theres a completely different level when you add the fifth cover gear in now to guys that could come back and be a part of your program Music Carolina with it shot clock to seventh Applause its up top Davis off the fake hes at that wont touch the thing and its a shot clock violation Applause Music Applause Cuba Davis a little concerned about his offense on the last few possessions of course baycott on the bench with those two fouls things have slowed down a bit offensively for the Tar Heels Cleveland with a pop no individually hes having a nice year 14 points he rebounds the game but a team has struggled as mightily as the Knowles you know no one notices Glenn turnover Clevelands also dealt with a couple injury issues and missed some games throughout the season but hes definitely one of those guys thats intriguing as well coming up next on ESPN we take it to Gallagher Iber Arena in Stillwater its number nine Baylor squaring off against Oklahoma State Baylor coming off an impressive victory at home against Texas over the weekend under 13 here in the first half of Tallahassee not to rub it in but its about 78 degrees wherever you may be theres someone out there thinking that that may be rubbing it in yes Im sure more than one Applause taking a tumble and that ones going to roll out of play North Carolina with the turnover the gift would have stayed a lot of credit theyve locked in defensively over these last few possessions and really stalled North Carolina unable to get really much of anything going on the offensive end of the floor back to back turnovers for the heels hell throw that away so a bunch of turnovers for both sides suddenly and thats where you just have to know your personnel recognize thats leaky black over there guarding that guy we dont want it to be risky around leaky black Applause slicing in and another turnover Davis looked like he just wasnt ready for the pass a great decision by Caleb love to find the corner and RJ Davis of course at times can be a knock down shooter just taking his eye off the ball thats almost like a ground ball going through of course the five hole on a second baseman not getting low enough to pick that one up before baseball reference down stay down thats right 11 50 to go in the first heres Cleveland 67 sophomore from Atlanta Hills will kick it the shot switched it by Jackson former Mr basketball out of the state of Tennessee yeah Chandler Jackson backtoback careerhigh 10point games his last two games starting to find his role with Leonard Hamilton coming off the bench as that back up point guard so dead even at 12 swung for Nancys left open he cant he cant answer Applause and itll be tapped Out hell stay on this end 1114 to go in the half Im talking about the coach Leonard Hamilton in 1974 by becoming an assistant and eventually an associate head coach at the University of Kentucky under Joe B Hall making him also the first black coach in the SEC Cory I know earlier we were able to talk to coach ham how amazing was it to just revisit how his trip to UT Martin Austin Peay set him up to experience that verse for him well angel of course its always a treat when you get opportunity to hang out with Coach ham and hes in the Record Book for a number of reasons 56 wins as an unranked team overranked teams as the head coach as a NCAA record as well as 13 consecutive overtime wins but OB to me Leonard Hamilton has is was part of the reason for one of the best ever chance from a crowd during his time at Austin Peay he recruited of course fly Williams who ended up becoming a great basketball player led NCAA in scores well there was a chance at Austin P that simply said fly is open lets go pee but you have to love that the coach have is squarely behind all this mentioned to him today he just smiled ear to ears very fondly I guess another one thrown away here in Carolina with a bunch of turnovers despite a couple of good passes has nothing ready yeah six turnovers already and Florida States already scores six points off of those turnovers one of the things that Virginia did not take advantage of against North Carolina on Saturday Applause Davis for black Davis will launch and hit nothing but net on a triple Huber Davis right now Im sure telling his team hey guys lets just make sure we get a shot give ourselves a chance and that broke one was over a four minute long scoring drought for North Carolina they have been stuck on 12 for quite a while heres Jackson freshman from Memphis on a hard drive and its blocked North Carolina in transition trying to turn it into points love is trying to Palm that one and a turnover interesting to see if he touched that basketball because the heavy looked really nice but the turnovers for North Carolina leading to points on the other end of the floor for Florida State and some of the turnovers from North Carolina just careless turnovers not handling the basketball not catching the basketball cleanly thinking about something else before they actually got the hands on the ball and six turnovers in less than five minutes in this stretch been kind of ugly Applause tend to shoot now for the Knowles Kayla Mills on a penetration and some body love gets hit for the foul Caleb Mills has been aggressive since checking into the game did not start with this being senior night Cleveland games getting the nod early but since coming into the game Caleb Mills has been aggressively attacking trying to get downhill and of course getting to the freethrow line where hes been great his entire career and really good 84 percent Junior from Arden North Carolina and another one coming Im talking turnovers yeah not all turnovers are created equal and of course RJ Davis takes his eyes off the basketball but have more to do with the reaction on the Florida state bench lets see what what had happened was yeah I love that explanation thats all the explanation you can have for that 1514 Carolina pressure here from the Knolls but blob will bring it up for North Carolina looking to win their 19th game of the season here tonight and one backtoback games be Notre Dame and top 10 Virginia which is at first quad one victory of the entire season Applause back outside Styles lets fly and knocks it down Contra style stepping up knocking down the three North Carolinas been good from Beyond The Arc here in this first half similar to the way they were against Virginia Saturday theres going to be a traveling violation obviously on Miller no a glance at the Carolina resume Joe Leonardis been talking about him a lot gets a lot of questions about them already saying right now the first four outs boots North Carolina do you think they win tonight if they knock off Duke and a whistle off the ball here and that foul will go against Cameron Corin th do you think they have to win a game or more in the ACC tournament to get into the big dance yes in order to get it at large bid if they dont win the ACC tournament I believe they have to win of course this evening they have to be Duke and they have to win one or two games in the ACC tournament probably getting to the semifinal round to make sure that theyre on firm ground and solid footing getting into this they kick it over again Applause is green cant hit the three North Carolina shooting themselves in the foot over and over North Carolinas operated golf has been when theyre getting shots at the rims the problem happens when they dont get the shots of the room as RJ Davis gets downhill and gets a bucket when theyre not turning the basketball over theyre shooting the basketball pretty well seven for 13 for 538 percent Music and leading you 20 to 14 and then Worley slamming on the brakes up top of the long run its going to be switched in by Green nice response from Deontay green stepping up and knocking down the jump right this is one of the maturity areas for Florida State a number of guys at Leonard Hamilton had no thoughts of playing this year have had to step in and play roles many of those guys freshmen but theyre starting to grow up at this point of the year you say the freshmen are no longer freshmen anymore Davis got a pretty good look cant connect on the triple Cleveland outside the three directing some traffic heres warley and the lane off the back iron see if North Carolina can do a better job hanging onto the basketball here love will be quick with it Applause foreign Applause didnt come to Florida state known as a guy that shot the basketball really well has improved on his jump shot one of the reasons why many Scouts are interested in him as well they recognize the work that hes put in thats your Sixth Man of the Year down the lane thatll get to Nance Nancy with a misfire Florida state with an opportunity to take the lead they throw it away picked off by Seth Trimble trimbled down the paint and a whistle Kissinger RJ Davis starting to get it going for North Carolina on the offensive end of the floor play with tape on his hand the majority of January and February the tape is off but the bucket is season a big one door taken on Duke at seven Eastern and then number three Kansas they won sixth straight leading Texas right now by game in the big 12 they take on Texas Tech at Allen Fieldhouse both games on ESPN and the app thats a big game at Cameron NC State coming in who of course beat the Blue Devils earlier this year at PNC Duke looking for some get back and I believe that one has a lot to determine who is the fifth seed in the ACC tournament between those two teams coming up as we look at our Bracketology by Joey brackets right now youve got five teams for the ACC firmly in the field and two on the bubble with North Carolina and Clemson love off the fake after a couple of foul shot misses Nance from the corner got it with a threepointer heed mans continues to shoot a hot basketball two or three from Beyond The Arc in this first half so forget about the two free throws take the triple yeah exactly Armando Baker back in the game with those two fouls be interesting to see how Huber Davis looks to get him involved on the offensive end of the floor foreign ACC player of the week you see right now trying to go to him to get Beyonce green a lot of credit denying love off Target hes scuffled all year from threepoint territory 31 but that was on the money but when hes taking good shots hes a good shooter Caleb love has shot 40 from three over his last nine games shooting the basketball well when he doesnt have to take shots off balance heres Cleveland too strong followers on missed though he stayed with it leaning into it green but no averaging about 14 again to transfer from UCF Applause black left open he says why not for a threepointer and Im wondering why he thought about it Caleb love did the did the work he created the open opportunity for leaky black leaky black thought about it we talked about him being a great Corner shooter but you find him on the wing its the same distance in college basketball Let it Fly Carolina building a 10point lead on the road here at the top at Notre Dame game in the second half East game the Tar Heels had zero assist in the first half in the second Pete Nance had five alone to Pete to Armando Bay Cuts Pete Nance also had four threes in that previous game against Virginia for them hes been that person thats been able to stretch the floor he absolutely has been that of course Pete Knack comes Pete Nash coming back after missing games due to soreness in his lower back has really bolstered the offense for North Carolina but right now theyre eight of 13 from Beyond The Arc here in this first half and when they shoot the basketball like this theyre difficult to beat going airborne at a very very tough play of an offensive foul there on Seth Tribble but North Carolina does not live and die on the three but theyve already hit eight of them in this game and what Id love to see after this play now again I understand the rules I personally think even though you get the offensive foul that bassist account but Ill take that up with the rules committee later but but Caleb above going right in and help set Trimble up and lets him know Pete Nance was open and on the opposite side of the floor so when you get in there keep your eyes up looking for your teammates Beyond The Arc Carolina opening up pointy lead Mills trying to get close cant do it now too Cleveland on bacon who stage with him and harassed him into a bad shot blob on the breakout and hell draw the foul as hes fouled by Jalen Worley trying to deny an easy basket moving along here the first half Carolinas up by 10 Music you can check the chance points thats the way they need to play thats the formula to play yourself in the NCAA tournament Carolina leading it here after the foul shot by love 30 to 19 and theyre on a 10nothing run here so threatening to end this first half and a big uptick meanwhile FSU one for their last seven shooting it well and thats been the difference for this North Carolina team really when you think about what they were able to do at Notre Dame of course Saturday against Virginia they have been better defensively were not going to call them a great defensive team but they have locked in paid more attention to the scouting report and give him more effort on the defensive end of the floor foreign Applause likes that corner shot Applause Cleveland wants to really push the Temple of the blink of an eye thats going to be a stop on the play and a whistle as well but Cloud practically on the rim anyway with his size but McLeod does the right thing in gathering and going up and dunking the basketball we saw him try to lay it up earlier and it got blocked this time McLeod really boxing out Jay in the Washington even though hes on offense picking up the offensive rebound the finish and not a long way to drop when youre 74 hanging on the rim his mom is 55 his dad 75 yeah so raheems a little fella hes a family hes Junior hes got a twin sister thats six six as well so you know but when your dads 75 and youre only 74 then youre the little guy yes fouled by Kayla Mills 256 to go it happens take a look at how far he actually had to come to come down oh great angle right here of course you get the opportunity to see where his feet are and again hanging on the rim what do you got two three inches right there from his toes to the hardwood Caleb love Applause sinking number one and Caleb love I think you have to give him credit where credit is due here lately hes taking better shots doing a better job of the basketball and hes Distributing the basketball theyd always end up in assist but hes attacking getting him downhill and putting pressure on the defense not just settling for me on the perimeter 11 first half points for him Seminoles with the basketball in front of 15 NBA Scouts here tonight bills penetrate scoops and it rolls in okay the Mills continues to get to the basket hes shown his aggressiveness throughout this first half Applause heres another one the young men that the scouts are here to watch Jayla Washington number 13 Davis in the three in the ninth threepoint field goal made for North Carolina 9 of 15 they were nine of 16 in the first half against Virginia Huber Davis has found something in the first half for his team now hes going to try to see if he can get to carry over in the second half all of a sudden its become a big weapon for the entire heels and a fouled him with 205 to go in a half and were talking about a team that for the season coming in right now shooting 304 percent for the game as RJ Davis is able to knock down the three off the move the dribble handoff for Washington the 304 percent would tie the 2020 team with the worst threepoint field goal percentage in North Carolina history that is up from 299 which it was on Saturday going into that game and now 915 here in this first half I believe will help raise that as well why is she doing the foul its before halftime at times it looked like looked like Tar Heels were just going to get up and goal and take FSU out but the Seminoles came charging back Applause Davis catches fires hes hot another three for RJ Davis and 10 threepoint field goals made toward North Carolina they average 86 threes made in wins the 18 wins this season theyve already eclipsed that here in the first half bills cant get it to go off the window and there is a foul underneath with a minute 29 to play in the half a Wednesday in the association our doubleheader starts to Boston Jason Tatum in the Eastern Conference leading Celtics hosting the Cavs at 7 30 thats off to the Rose City lasers hosting Brandon Ingram and Pelicans coverage tipping off with NBA Countdown at seven and you see that Portland at the bottom 71 points last night 13 threes made which is oneoff Klay Thompsons NBA record 14 threepoint field goals made in the game 71 a true field goal percentage of 80 percent remarkable he just had the most efficient 60point game in the history of the league and I believe that might have been the most efficient 70point game last night Davis is feeling it kind of split two Defenders Cleveland reaching in Jay Davis right now just smoking as Cleveland collects the personal sent him to the line Davis outstanding foul shooter leading the conference 87 percent the game recently at NC State and she was at the Smith Center but again since NC State went 1414 Im just waiting to see the result after all that oh look at that hes so good hes too good for the announcer jinx I was holding my breath because you know exactly where thats going and deservedly so I mean show his Wade say after the fact you know what he never missed him hes that good 88 leads to ACC coming into this game continues to be dynamic from the freethrow line as North Carolina who leads the ACC in free throw attempts and makes his 17 attempts to 23 Im sorry 17 makes it 23 attempts per game those pass never got there knocked away good job by Davis he hit the deck kept it alive great Africa RJ Davis on the defensive end of the floor love another one from threepoint land where Carolina cant miss tonight and someone behind us just said oh no and again weve heard that at times in Chapel Hill where their fans have said oh no dont shoot another three but not here Florida State the fans here do not want the heels tanking four threes Bill slapped away and its going to be off of FSU another good defensive play by Davis or if youre Caleb you have to love these opportunities to be able to pull up on the break excited for the way your team is playing and I believe he and RJ Davis really have played very solid basketball with the basketball to hands making the right decisions and taking good shots in this game of course it never hurts when the threes are falling North Carolinas hit 13 field goals 11th our threepointers so far Music sharing the basketball continuing to be an attack mode getting downhill and also has the ability to score it on his own his decision making has been good throughout this game of course that one Deontay green is wondering what happened on that play Ed backcourt for the heels has been nothing short of Sensational theyve been great throughout this game Caleb love with 14 first half points RJ Davis with 13 for first half points 27 points combined those two guys have scored more than Florida State here in this first half first Florida State fans are saying wait a minute weve got them exactly where we want them after coming from behind to stun Miami down 25 on Saturday and one another threepointer by Cleveland at the buzzer 4325 North Carolina and a bleed the clock down Steve Davis gets in a shot in the air now gets it away for Washington and a rare Miss from way downtown and thats how the first half comes to an end but it felt like they hit every other threepointer they tried it seemed like an 11 of 18 from Beyond a threepoint Arc for North Carolina 11 of their 13 Mayfield goals from Beyond The Arc if youre Huber Davis you go in the locker room and you tell your team hey guys we did that lets not fall in love with it and know that this one is 18 from three loving Davis had been marvelous in the backcourt of combined 27 the two in the backcourt have outscored Florida State by themselves but Armando baycott coming into the game needing 12 points to pass Michael Jordan to get to 14th on the alltime scoring list at North Carolina zero points but yet his team still holds an 18 point halftime lead hes going to start shooting threesome but thats the 10th turnover for North Carolina in this game and thats one like Pete Nance with the ball in his hands I know what the play was called for was to see if they could get the back door but its not there youve got to recognize not there going to the second option of the play thats the only thing that North Carolinas done poorly here this evening and yet leading 4325 on the Drive Cleveland Look for the window but came up empty Davis off to love with a bounce gave it away another Carolina turnover Worley through the lane for two and thats what Florida state is going to have to do theyre going to have to take advantage of North Carolinas going to continue to turn the basketball over theyve got to take advantage of those opportunities now the 10th point off turnover for the Seminoles Applause put away already by the Tar Heels not for all the turnovers Florida State nine and 20 got out to Dreadful start to their season losing nine of their first 10 glove in and out with a triple and they were losing to teams like Stetson Troy Siena thatll go down a big three from Worley we mentioned the Virginia game and North Carolina going 916 for the first half from three Virginia started the second half on Saturday on a 70 run a 50 run right now for Florida State and if they can get another stop here they can truly build some momentum here on their home court Applause little give and go into the corner heres black cant argue with the caliber of the look he got he was wide open Mills up top is scoring and thats too long big freshman Ill make there would have gone a long way for Florida State Im sure we would have seen a timeout from Hubert Davis had that gone down Armando underneath blocks Cleveland keeps it alive at the tap okay labels leads in no wins the rebound up against Davis and draws the foul he will be at the line you know Angel green was a big star here absolutely look at this shes got her own fan session welcome back Angel gray once the star here youre always a star here angel its a very small piece of the puzzle its like the corner piece you put that first and then everything else comes thats nothing thats me but it was fun its cool seeing the banners and the Raptors too for those ACC regular season yeah thatd be a really nice feeling how about the coaches now at halftime well Ill start with Carolina Huber Davis told me well first I asked him what contributed to his backcourt success he said Angel honestly were not turning the ball over he had seven turnovers early and he said he just made sure that his team understood attention to details much what we heard and shoot around him starting off this second half with two straight turnovers he was visibly upset he also said the message to his team this team can come back you already saw what they were doing for Miami for Coach ham I simply said 11 threes he shook his head he said theyre making threes were missing layups we have to be better Angel weve just seen the third turnover of the second half for North Carolina on the offensive foul right now a 12 point game and you mentioned of course they can come back we know that theres something that the Seminoles have in their arson Nance although he was pleading his case with Doug sermons there batted Away by Nance he forces the turnover you know Obi one of the things that we also have to mention in Florida States come come back win first Miami they only had one second half turnover so they cant give the basketball back on the back down Johnson got too close to the iron he wasnt sure where he was Mills will lock them up there that didnt touch the thing Applause I love coming off an outstanding half so is his backboard mate Davis interesting to see Huber Davis taking a Mondo Bay cut out of the game early in the second half getting pop Johnson on the floor and this is the team that was able to build that lead Nance yes on a triple Brady manic anybody Im sure there are a few people who will still be talking about Brady Manning but Pete Nance making them forget about Brady manic over his last few games a rounded out by Green Junior North Carolina Back on Top by 15 Davis Little Fall Away one and done Matthew Cleveland averaging 148 will drive it and the follow is Up and Good by Corinth Applause 4633 Carolina Music our Hills can afford zero slipups its really on a night like tonight and a

Africa record at East Carolina but a great man that you will not find anyone who has a negative word to say about that you didnt play from the Ralph did yeah yeah he he built quite a program there uh while I was growing up well you were just a little guy head coach from 74 to 90 at Virginia Cleveland Airborne with a misfire Applause Carolina looking to grab some momentum they had plenty of that in the first half Nance swooping into the lane follows his own Miss kicks it out Davis will swing it is love love working on Jackson boy went right at the Freshman no pun intended here but I love it the fact that Caleb love did not settle for a jump shot once again gets downhill puts the pressure on Florida States defense to keep him out of the paint and then doesnt over penetrate pulls up and gets the easy one Jackson nearly left it behind and get the feeling this is a breakaway zone for North Carolina was loving that right hand but it wont drop for him loose ball right back to the Knolls and a foul in the lane that will go against Nance Caleb love not settling challenging Channel Jackson to the rim theres some contact but thats okay because Caleb loves it see what I did there I am Im sticking with you tonight its not an easy thing to do but oh no not easy at all I get it its always a challenge Cleveland to shoot and drops to the first one by the way working with Dicky V over the

cancer survivor in his own right but hes been doing this for decades just a gigantic heart Applause and transition now the Seminoles trying to cut in its just another 13 minutes to go Hills in the paint hesitation nicely done there for Kayla Bilson too Mondo baycott watching Applause our only exit here to start the second half averages 17 points per game fourth in the ACC and right now Huber Davis going without his star as his team is having success on the road against midrange he was open Applause 5138 Carolina Cleveland batted away good defense and Recovery there by RJ Davis got to the other end and deflected it weve seen that happen with RJ Davis a number of times throughout this game getting back defensively and deflecting the basketball as baycott reenters the game for Pete Nance La Pete Nance doing a tremendous job at that Five Spot this evening so much that Huber Davis can afford to keep bake out on the bench Armando North Carolinas alltime leading rebounder way downtown off the back of the iron there by Greene Applause love with the kick and it eventually does fall down for Johnson thats the way the shooting night is gone from time to time for the men in blue and its just been that type of evening for the Tar Heels shooting the basketball from Beyond The Arc would give Caleb love a lot of credit once again getting downhill looking for his teammates and the only turnover for the nose Davis with the pass for Black and two and leaky black was telling RJ Davis throw that one up throw the lob in comparison to dropping it off but either way when you get the two points it really does a mess same result 5638 Music rain with a leaner no fake hot there for the rebound Davis love is going to be held up and fouled by Chandler Jackson stops the clock with 1116 to go North Carolina threatening to break away here in Tallahassee this point at 74 is a very interesting quote that he left everyone with he said I always tell my staff if I dont come out at half and sit on the wrong bench then Im going to stay here and rightfully so the amount of history and accomplishments he has on his resume here in Tallahassee he is a living legend an angel what has not been a traditional season for Leonard Hamilton the success theyve had as of late has really motivated him he talked to us today he told us how encouraged he was how motivated he was to build this team to be a winner a season from now nearly picked off there by Cleveland another long one coming for Carolina theyve been dying it might be on the threepoint line cot was what you would think normally shorthand had offensive rebound just unable to be able to gather that one in get a chance for Second Chance points but baycott scoreless still in this game and were talking about the fourth leading scorer in the ACC who has not had his night offensively Angel you had a followup I think just looking at what you were talking about earlier Corey about what this team is made up of as far as the roster and they used and the veterans on the team coach ham said listen Im just trying to get everything I can out of the roster now they only have three players on this team right now that were on that 2021 team and theyre all WalkOns so when youre looking at what hes been able to establish you said yes I still want to make sure they understand were playing for the future right now love too strong fake cuts up stronger Applause and thatll go back over to FSU I know the reason why Leonard is super motivated about next year in the years to come hes lying about his age theres no way that man is 74 years old or hes found the Fountain of Youth which he doesnt want to share with the rest of us I wish he would stop hiding it Music he looks like hes in great shape Miller Airborne a lot of NBA Scouts here to watch him perform tonight thats the reason why basketball is my Ministry love that quote yeah this is my calling to help young people fill their lives he talked to us today about his coach at UT Martin Lake Kelly and the way that he would go about you know caring for his kids and thats the one thing that he gathered and one thing hes took taken with him his entire career as a coach is loving on his players making sure they were good no matter what North Carolina did everything they needed too to get off a good shot buff Johnson got off a good shot he hit the deck he turns it over as well love as they run the break and a foul Styles head of the line with 909 to go youve seen more of that here in the second half that classic North Carolina transition basketball well North Carolina always wants to play fast but part of that is being able to have the guys who eat whether you score on them or they make a shot get it out and run up and down the floor they want to be able to get it out quickly miles in and out the 70th annual New York Life ACC Tournament begins next Tuesday afternoon in Greensboro Coliseum we have all three first round games for you at 2 4 30 and 7 Eastern on the ACC Network and the ESPN app youre going to be there Ill be there looking forward to it my friend and going into this years ACC tournament no clearcut favorite to be able to cut down the Nets in Greensboro which makes it so exciting when you have so many teams coming in there that can have success but if I pressed you to make a decision on who you think will win it who is it itll either be you ready for this yeah Miami Clemson Virginia NC State Florida State into North Carolina dude I mean I can keep going thatd be so many different teams have a chance to be able to get in the mix during the NCAA tournament as part of the ACC tournament they just kept hot and play that way in remember Virginia Tech was I believe a eight yeah what a run they made and thats Miller Bob Miller the 611 freshman some performance minutes for those NBA Scots here in second half with the big under eight and a half to play Applause North Carolina all for their last four shooting it after a red hot first half beyond the threepoint line where they made 11 out of 18 shot clock at four Davis with a triple and just not falling suddenly here well in in typical North Carolina fast in the second half they havent shot the basketball as well from Beyond the threepoint r but still able to maintain the 13 point lead right now a lot because Florida state has been turning the basketball over and they have not been able to make the threes and the shots that they were able to make in their comeback versus Miami on Saturday Junior with a quick three a moment ago couldnt find the range on that hes trembled Applause a clock to four Black Ops a fake a twopointer coming out right back to Davis and thats one of the things that Armando baycott has mastered if he cant gather the basketball he will tap it out to give his guys an opportunity to run it down and come up with Second Chance opportunity Carolina winding the clock down on the drive nicely done all the way to the Cup by Davis its really been the star of this one for North Carolina he really has and being aggressive attacking downhill when the threepointers arent going his added to his game as well as king of love one and done for Miller back to him though second opportunity Worley yes and you can see Florida State playing with a little more energy here in this second half a little more effort but just havent been able to get over this hump 13 is about his post theyve been able to get it need to come up with a couple of defensive stops here in this last six and a half minutes back out for Davis and again hes going to burn some clock under six and a half to play here in Tallahassee black from three yes sir it doesnt have to be the corner leaky you can shoot from the wings thats fine hes showing off his ability to be able to knock down threepointers from all over the arc not just Corner three 14 for Hammonds double as average lofted it up there by bills now to turn around and the whistle as well as Corey got it to go and hell be at the Line Liquor threepoint play when we come back and we get an opportunity to go and check out a fiveyear RJ Davis whos been dealing with an injured finger for the last couple of months reactivating that injury going after a rebound you see him favoring it on that right hand that shooting hand which has been an issue for him throughout this recent stretch finally finding his shooting stroke as of late as the Tar Heels have knocked down a bunch of Threes here in this game oh hes made three out of seven and so has Caleb love they have 15 and 16 respectively North Carolinas turnovers have kept Florida State somewhat in the game green goes there born and a whistle on the play with 5 41 to go and a foul against Carolina as we get an opportunity to see Kirsten steinbacher who is now in her fifth year as a manager for these North Carolina Tar Heels graduate manager using her Covenant year to come back and be a part of it I saw Kirsten earlier today and said it seems like youve been here forever in Armando baycott uh Caleb left all the guys turn around and said she has shes been here longer than all of us shes actually was here for the last time Armando had a scoreless game which was during his first year at North Carolina his second game of his career against UNC Wilmington and scoreless thats the only time hes been scoring this his entire career as a tar heel spend a lot of time on the bench tonight some of that first half was a couple fouls but its been a different looking Carolina Tim its going to be a foul against FSU on the reach by Baba Miller yeah and that is going to result as a is it a technical foul or is it a flagrant foul but when you touch someone out of bounds so that will be free throws and the basketball for North Carolina Doug Shermans coming over so as Doug explains it thats a flagrant one so foul shots coming and the ball theres the reach in this is out of bounds yeah thanks to Ducks arm is coming over letting us know by rule that is a flagrant one foul so itll be two shots and the basketball back for North Carolina and North Carolina still will have the ability to run the Baseline and again this is just something again when you have players who come in from Europe there are different differences in the game Baba Miller you know who missed the first 16 games of this season due to suspension a little over aggressive and just trying to be active disrupting leaky black makes contact which ends up the resulting in the play with one foul yeah I grew up on the Mediterranean island with Majorca 611 freshman something about this sounds very nice yeah that sounds pretty cool exactly another five and a half left this is a major swing potentially for North Carolina because Florida state was within Striking Distance heres Nats on the way I could have gone a long way to burying the Seminole it really could have could have been a 5 20 possession for the Tar Heels Mills and dribble down for two but this has been the character of Florida State give them a lot of credit theyve continued to fight throughout this game havent played well turnovers you know and havent shot it great but at the same time they find themselves down 11 still just under five minutes remaining in a chance to get back in to make this a game at this down the stretch Music Applause off the side he goes down no whistle early beating the big trip again Miller and then on out of it well theyre coming off and his story come from my victory shocking Miami when 25 down over the weekend to win at the buzzer theyve got this crowd into it love trying to silence them through the lane but no 455 and theyre reaching the foul by Davis are the Seminoles going to do it again another superhuman performance maybe and the tuck has come to line as as Mike Ray would tell Leonard Hamilton about a Cop gospel concert its some juice in here baby Music John Holmes got to get it going last three losses only seven points but last three wins 18 points in those three wins hes got to get it going back to Obi Cory angel gentlemen thank you very much I like that Fonzarelli uh yeah you know of course stephancos gonna have the great names and you gotta have one for fun warley at the line I guess it doesnt need to be said but North Carolina cannot afford to stumble against anybody you know with a couple of games left here in the regular season let alone a team its nine and twenty no they cannot again we talked about this game for North Carolina beating Florida State doesnt do much for you in your resume but losing to them crushes your resume and right now a seven point game all the momentum is on the side of the Seminoles here trying to make another historic comeback with a second straight game fouled off the ball Carolina has gone cold 22 for their last 11 cereal price need to know with North Carolina leading 6457 talking about that resume and finally eight quad one win and we talk about North Carolina and their shoot around this morning Hubert Davis asking his team to pay attention to detail and they were great at it in the first half outside of the nine turnovers but the second half that attention to detail has not been there and they have not made the threepointers to save them 337 to play Love cant get close theyll stick it right to him shot clock for three short rebound tip controlled there Taylor Mills and FSU can make this even tighter green thought about a triple Applause 6457 Mills over the top and not bad 6459 and what is going on here in Tallahassee weve got a ball game taken away by Mills in transition to Seminoles another one over the top but a foul on the play the LA for Worley and a whistle of 2 45 left this has been in the second half a Monumental collapse thus far for North Carolina and Huber Davis and you have to know that right now Hubert has talked to a team about Florida State coming back its in the minds of the Tar Heels right now theyre fighting that mentally trying their best to make sure that they dont allow it to happen but oftentimes the things that you fear the worst you allow them to manifest because of that North Carolina playing very tentative right now lets go to Angel Corey going back Applause to what coach said to his team where he had stoppage of play he said one turnover becomes two two becomes three a bad pass goes into the stands weve seen that collapse mainly because they havent been able to take care of the ball thats exactly an angel and turnovers have been an issue as of late and now Florida State cutting this lead to four trying to get another stop Davis on the drive Banks it in they desperately needed that one they absolutely did RJ Davis has made big shots for the heels all evening long and comes up with a huge one there and Carolina on the Baseline Applause he has been an olds best player all season long and I like Matthew Cleveland recognizing thats a mismatch its difficult for Armando bacon to try to guard him out on the wing no money in the crowd on their feet here but a minute 50 to go Seminole storming back as they did against Miami on Saturday although a gigantic deficit in that one coming up Davis wants the ball again his black off the fake takes it slams that and what a dunk wow wow thats emphatic green spins way short a scrap for it it comes right back to Bangkok Applause that Rim is still rounding that might be for half an hour be fair to say that everyone may have a leak in it at this point 6862 said a big night with 189 under a minute Carolina leading some clock Davis pulls up and yes a nice roll hes got a couple of big shots he absolutely has and again Huber Davis is comfortable with the basketball in his hands late game situation Clevelands going to get a shot in the air over Nance that just fires and a foul on the deck with 399 to go back up to an eightpoint advantage for North Carolina Davis got to be exhausted the pump fake the attack leaky getting freaky with it oh my you talk about point of emphasis and the bench loving it that possibly is a seasonsaving play for North Carolina could well be leaky blacks attacking of the basket not selling for a jump shot and this is something that theyve asked leaky black to do for five years at North Carolina be aggressive he has the ball handling ability he has the size to be able to attack as our officials are going over to look at some of the extracurricular action that happened after the foul with RJ Davis okay Davis yep theres your reset North Carolina no fouls to give still a lot of timeouts available three apiece and FSU has the possession arrow and Doug sermons let us know exactly what they were looking at with 399 left so the first foul is going to be on RJ Davis and UC Davis pushing Deontay green trying to get him but there will be no extra curricula theres nothing else outside of that great officiating by this crew Kip Kissinger Keith Campbell Doug sermons on the call clean game for this group they really have deante green at the line Applause and that one catches a lot of iron bad of the way controlled by Carolina Seminoles fouling 384 to go and coming up next over on ESPN well take it to Stillwater number nine Baylor squaring off against Oklahoma States Baylor coming off a really nice win against Texas at home over the weekend so North Carolina to put it in and trying to hang on and get a win they absolutely must have love theyre trying to trap Tim hes trying to get away and theyre going to take a timeout North Carolina with a timeout 277 so we will take the break as well 7062 North leaky black showing up in a big way here with 18 points that ties his career high and hes done the job defensively all season long but has some timely offensive games as well and the more aggressive he is offensively especially looking for those threes I think it makes this North Carolina team even better something to behold and again a whistle with 261 to go and have one and one for Armando bacott who is scoreless in this game and Im sure anyone tuning in would be surprised to hear that if theyre tuning in late to hear that the fourth leading scorer in the ACC has not scored a point opportunity for him to scratch here at the free throw line 17 points on average for bacon and drops in the first one Leonards going you know we almost held him scoreless tonight and shes a feat 7162 Applause dunked by black some dunks are worth more than others they just thought that should have been worth about three points and the foul as they wrap up dance and hell be at the line for a oneonone 25 seconds to play and a bunch of fans are heading for the exits here in Tallahassee these fans were treated to a nice comeback attempt by the Seminoles just got down so big in the first half but youve got to take your hat off Leonard Hamilton and his staff for the way theyve continued to Coast these guys up they continue to play 40 minutes not going to let up the entire game all fair to say you totally agree but with a loss theyre 921 if youre North Carolina under any circumstances you cannot slip come up here on the drive bills will lay it in well at this point of the season and college basketball we know the terminology survive in advance at the end of the day for North Carolina as long as they win by one point thats what matters most and Huber Davis of course wont be happy with the way that his team finished the game down the stretch but he will be happy if theyre able to walk away from the Donald Tucker center with the win right survive in advance they did it so brilliantly in the NCAA tournament all the way to the national championship game absolutely and again this is a team that returned four starters from the national championship runnerup team a year ago the expectations were so high Hubert Davis has made it clear this is not the same team this is not last years team this is a completely new team and this team with a win here tonight continues the chance to fight on and see if they can get into the NCAA tournament big matchup coming for them Saturday senior night in Chapel Hill with the Rival Duke Blue Devils coming in youre not lying 18 seconds left in this one 7364 the Tar Heels game day of course will be there for Duke and Carolina always seems to be something huge on the line with Dukes playing exceptionally well Nance is filed on the play North Carolina good foul shooting team a big matchup for Duke coming up tomorrow night NC State coming into the building after that loss at home to the Clemson Tigers and you know the wolf pack will be hungry but as you mentioned the Blue Devils playing much better down the stretch getting healthy and their freshmen are starting to grow up Applause well Pete Nance a good night as well 611 Brad so anything new do you think out of Joey brackets after this game tonight I think hell simply say they won a game that they had to win to get them to the game on Saturday you know now after losing to North Carolina state it was pretty much written in stone North Carolina had to finish out they had to win out to have a chance at the atlarge bid if they dont win the ACC tournament and theyve won three straight at this point elves with a driving stop a little under nine seconds to play Seminoles still playing defense and they will tie up dance again and he will March to the other end but foul shooter at 81 percent so looking like I miss you will drop to nine and 21712 and the conference could not follow up what they did over the weekend and ridiculous Comfort mind 25 down against Miami which was by the way the largest comeback in the history of this conference its coming up 22 against Virginia no question he is stepping up his play another level he he really has and again a guy that I think will be very important for them on Saturdays birth to Duke Blue Devils because he can space the floor and of course very comfortable shooting with three at home playing his best basketball of the season and Im going to go out on the limb and say no way cut only has one point on Saturday on his senior degrees three at the horn wont go and theres your final North Carolina survived the late storm there by the syllables to pull it off 7766 they absolutely did survive is the right terminology for that our Capital One rewarding performance tonight and well call it the three ds of
