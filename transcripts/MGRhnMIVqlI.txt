Ron theyre a little undersized but they swarm defensively and thats what weve seen so far hows it 81 Clemson seven and two Towson 40 and true Road games this season Clemson 60 at home and Clemson is having struck a tough time containing towsons interior threats Holden gets two inside and stretches the lead to six and thats clear Clemsons defense in the half court you have to jump to the basketball and get over those screens if youre a Chase hunter or you leave yourself vulnerable for layups Tyson knocks down the triple how impressive has Hunter Tyson been this season selects to come back for his fifth year in a tiger uniform hes the emotional leader for this team he steps up he talks he has a good feel for his teammates heres what Coach Brown Ellis told us just does a terrific job all around of just being that steady role player for Clemson Nigel Russell is a nice player when you have three guys that are first team allconference talk to Pat scary before the game its nice to have a guy like him whos willing to play a role knock down shots and be a quality Defender Beetle from the corner circles it down Josh Beetle just made his first three of the season for Clemson the next Chase Hunter seeing the floor help side jumps to the ball and he puts the skip pass on a dime thats two assists in a row and two possessions Chase Hunter has really developed that aspect of his game were just going to keep trading triples not this time as Russell misfires from the corner oh quick hands weve seen that from Towson defensively early Thompson the deflection fourth Clemson turnover and last years division two national Player of the Year Seiko Sila transfer from Nova Southeastern the Sixth Man for this team instant offense Off the Bench well hes a rim attack guy thats certain but hes so strong physically hes able to get where he wants Josh Beetle wants another one oh goodness he was over seven from Deep coming into tonight and hes knocked down his first two from that right wing thats just extra opportunities Clemson using their size on the interior to crash the offensive glass and thats the best time to shoot threes Evan because it comes back out and youre able to step right into it those are four shots Thompson picking up where they left off in the second half against the Deeks on Friday cam holds another tough shot tigers in that second half were eight for 12 from Beyond The Arc so you add in the four for five star today 12 of their last 17 good from Beyond The Arc I think any coach in the country will take that but its all because of their ball movement thats the big parkour Runner wont go strong rebound from Thompson points in the paint right now Terence 100 in favor of the team in gold East Towson Tigers won 25 ball games last year regular season Champs in the CAA another tough shot Silla with a left hand puts it in and say kusilla he looks like he could play defensive and on Clemsons football team but thats how these Towson guys are built right theyre not overly tall but just so physical and silver fits that description Chase Hunter rising up too strong Russell the rebound I dont love that shot for Chase Hunter for one reason it was his first perimeter jumper of the game if hes able to settle step into one thats where hes going to be able to have some success as a shooter it was always important for me for my first shot to be a good one oh great defense inside middle Brooks with a rejection Hunter second shot is good but you see the difference first shot hes going away from the basket this time he sees the mismatch and they back up off of him he steps right into it thats a rhythm shot for Chase Hunter hes a guy who can knock down those but it needs to be the selection needs to be really good to where his feet are set Clemson hasnt made a twopointer yet but theyre five for seven from three Holden unable to respond and rebound for Hunter Tyson and the tigers turn it over in the backcourt and thats a long distance three for Mr Hunter he misses his first he comes back with his second and Clemson is battling to get back Warrior one Warrior Two instant jackpot okay downward dog upward dog tree pose

leading Clemson by three and tonights presentation of ACC basketball is presented by your local Ford dealer quickly get to our keys to the game brought to you again by your local Ford dealer what you got T well if youre Towson your big three your first team allconference in the preseason those guys have to be dudes right and everybody who watches basketball knows what dudes are they have to be really good for Clemson Size Matters youve seen them attack the offensive class here early its resulted in a threepoint opportunity for them they have a size mismatch at the four and five positions how theyre going to be able to take advantage of that is key and yet through the first eight minutes all of Clemsons success has come from the perimeter and most of towsons success has come in the paint well its all half court execution right Towson runs good stuff but and theyre not that tall but once you see them in person these are Big Wide grown men that Clemsons playing against theyre gonna have to bring the physicality on the defensive end as well Thompson starting five includes two grad students two seniors Ryan Conway is the youngster the Richard freshman from Baltimore Timberlake tough shot rebounded by Tyson thats good defense Alex Hemingway keeping a hand up Timberlake is one of the better Shooters in the CAA he gets loose he could get dangerous first minutes for Ian shefflin and the first points in the paint for Clemson and sheflins had some big games this season a little bit undersized at the ACC level but if he gets a mismatch he can make you pay Kim Holden a little slide of frame compared to shuffling shuffling able to make them pay shuffling now trying to defend Sila to the post for Thompson Thompson verse Tyson Applause poked away from behind but Middlebrooks with his hand caught in the cookie jar called for the foul and thats what makes cam Holden so difficult to guard he has this old man kind of game to where his shot fakes are elongated and it takes him a second to re he lets you react to his face do you mean that as a compliment as a supreme compliment he looks like he his games gonna last forever and some guys they rely on quickness because weve got separate stores got some old men who are watching who may take offense though this guy Im one of those old men now Christian May in the game for Towson this is a long three and cam Holden puts it in again from Deep yeah thats the one thing where its not very strong for him hes a playmaker he can score inside hes an excellent passer he hasnt shot the ball all that great but this game right here if hes able to knock some down its huge one of the great Shooters in the league is Alex Hemingway and thats his first of the night Clemsons on fire from the perimeter cant get much inside but just finding opportunities from outside Alex Hemingway you cant give him too much space six for eight from three houses three for eight which isnt bad especially by their standards the way they play Cilla acrobatic shot wouldnt go Middlebrook trips away the rebound Beetle to the bucket a little out of control Thompson has it Applause nine and a half to play here in the opening stanza and wave off the bucket if it goes it doesnt a legal screen called on Charles Thompson thats the first foul against the Towson Tigers ten and a half minutes into the game and that puts Thompson in a bad spot because hes trying to screen and roll and theyre going to go underneath the ball screens Wingard and cam Holden so if he rolls into the defense hes obviously going to get called to that he needs to be a little bit more patient when attacking the rim Clemson a 20point win over Wake Forest game is closer than the final score indicated Clemson score the final 10 points of the game Wake Forest led by seven at halftime Clemson with a dominant second half performance shot 70 percent in the final 20 minutes a quick hands great defense Nigel Russell Russell Coast to Coast it wont go down that scary screaming for bucking interference and it looked like a goaltend from where were sitting at Evan thats excellent transition defense I think Clemson got a little bit lucky what if a Defender hits the backboard when the ball is in the cylinder is that interference Tyson for three I forgot your question but what is that then they continue to shoot the ball well from the perimeter that seven threes already for Clemson patscarry said we have to defend the three its been a struggle so far Clemsons first lead of the night down five nothing and then 93 airball functions like a pass to cam Holden who misses it from points Blank Range battle for the loose ball and it will be a timeout yes it will be a timeout Thompson got on the floor called timeout I believe well take it as well Clemson on a quick 60 run theyre four of their last five from the field seven of nine from three five different Clemson Tigers have already hit from Deep theyre on top for the first time tonight this is the

first team allconference stars for the Towson Tigers and for the Clemson Tigers freshman Beetle had not made a threeall season it was over seven coming to tonight hes two for two this evening comes in aggressive another weapon for Brad Brownells Arsenal well he comes in aggressive hes a guy thats been in and out of the lineup as far as playing time is concerned he comes in and he gives you an offensive boost that only helps things but hes got that amount of athleticism to be a Difference Maker for the Tigers its just how much is his Focus going to be able to carry him to elongated minutes Music Brad Brownell thought his team played about as well as they could in the second half on Friday he knows theyre neat gonna need to play great tonight as well Holden to Thompson like Stockton to Malone you have to love it and Kim Holden comes off a ball screen this possession last possessions finding guys when operating in the post and then he goes back and guards the four man he just provides so much versatility for you offensively Chapman tumbles down since seventh turnover been sloppy with the basketball but heres kind of the counter to that if theyre not if they turn it if they dont turn it over theyre making a three yeah its basically just a story getting out scored 142 in the paint Kevin has done its work inside Boltons got seven including the three theres a Towson team that makes fewer than six threes per game theyve already got three though this evening battling the post the fouls going on shuffling Applause its interesting Clemson switching one through five PJ Hall getting stuck out on Camp Holden now hes not going to blow by you per se but at the same time that Herky jerk game you gotta have PJ Hall in for it for a long time for you to be effective are you going to be able to attack him consistently if youre able to get that switch just a second team foul called against Clemson Applause Russell puts his head down and pushes off that was a pretty clear call right there little too physical coming off goes right down you want some aggressiveness but the little pushoff doesnt help things offensive foul present Applause Angel Russell experience college basketball player 117 games in the Ohio Valley Conference for Southeast Missouri State Houston Texas native just does all the little things for Towson you need guys like that whenever you have three stars that can go get your bucket Chaplin inside for Hall the righty Hook is good thats just good Clemson basketball ball change the size of the floor you attack get down to the low post and PJ just so reliable when he gets in that area Five Points in six minutes for Hall coming off at 218 rebound game this past Friday night against Wake Forest Applause Music while getting stuck in Towson cam Holdens hands a little bit too much but hes still able to find ways to be effective they just called shefflin for a second foul Brad Brownell does not like it you see a little screen of roll nice pitch back and excellent injury by Ian shefflin PJ doesnt miss many of those chaplain matched his season high with three assists on Friday picked up his first assist of the night there Applause but now hes on the bench with two quick fouls ball finds Timberlake who attacks the rack scores and one Ill give you this Nicholas Timberlake is a problem offensively whenever hes being aggressive its terrific hes more of a shooter but he gets a lane drives through the bucket hes a good athlete Mr Lefler and thats a tough finish my 25 its the story of this house team experienced toughness this is the 99th career game for Timberlake he had 15 against Liu on Friday and a road win for the Towson Tigers they trailed at halftime much like Clemson did but Rock performance in the second half to win on the road and what do you not want to do with a big time shooter you dont want to put him on the line to get a clean look at it right Hemingways done a nice job contesting so far but if hes able to get a couple of clean looks that could get dangerous first Fallon Hemingway threepoint play for Timberlake Music Applause Towson back up by one Hall great position chance for three and thats continuous Movement by the Clemson offense Towson showing a little bit of a 32 matchup Zone and PJ just staying active in the middle of the floor Chase Hunter excellent Vision able to go through the contact biggest part of this play Terence thats the second foul in Charles Thompson and thats big because hes a beast on the boards that almost eight a game and hes a doubledouble machine hes a guy that can compete physically with Clemson in the low post PJ had two offseason surgeries Applause slowly his way back in the lineup he played 22 minutes on Friday the way you plan on Friday when he was on the floor if you didnt know that he was coming off offseason surgery you think this is PJ Hall at his best well his skill level is the big thing like is he playing his way back into shape sure but coach Brownell trying to do a couple of things to help him out as far as his fatigue level is concerned Crookston going to a little bit of a match up 23 Zone see the Xs and Os of two coaches defensively Towson in a 23 then Clemson in the 23 youre going to see a lot of back and forth as far as thats concerned thats coach scary before the game he said Im stubborn I want to play man I want our guys to compete but you have to throw different lineups or not different lineups excuse me but different looks defensively to get guys out of rhythm take us in the mindset of a player youre playing against the mantoman defense for 1415 minutes and then theres a sudden possession of Zone how does that change how how quickly can you adapt well if nothing else it puts you on your heels because you feel like you have to figure it out and thats really what you want more than anything Hunter Tysons three wont go and the three thousand Tigers there combined for the rebound Customs had a nice job swarming the bank thats what they do thats what Pat scary said was a key to the game he said I know Clemson has size but thats what we do were out rebounding our opponents by about seven boards per game for the season 11 a shoot for Timberlake grad student from Braintree Massachusetts hes got some Hunter Tyson hops doesnt it Holden back door Russell lays it in thats just ball changing size of the floor how about Timber Lakes aggressiveness I dont love that hes jumping to pass of him but hes still finding the right play but thats Cam Holden doing what cam Holden does best attacks the defense sees the floor and gets the open guy some shots PJ Hall to the rim high level offense both sides I mean when the ball changes sides of the floor that helps side shifts a little bit and then guys can get lost and PJ slipping the screen and getting there for an easy two the seventh time this season Timberlake deep three is good just a pure shooting stroke does Timberlake have and like I said Towson going back into a it looks like a one two two but Timberlake you cant give him easy looks early in the game Revan Galloway Tyson the rebound for Hemingway got it its a horse competition Evan its a horse competition three for three both teams are four of their last five from the floor Clemson now eight for 12 from Beyond The Arc Applause so the ball sticking a little bit for Towson Conway a little teardrop no Holden was fouled going for the rebound by Chase Hunter and the ball continues to move for Clemson and shots are going up and shots are falling himenway joining the party a

Clemson leading Towson with 332 to play in the half our hearties star to watch tonight as Chase Hunter prior to this season Terence he had never averaged more than two assists in a game sturdy got four assists tonight well he just developed into that point guard role Clemson had a mass Exodus a point guards last season Nick honored departed for Missouri and alamir Dawes decided to go to Seton Hall to go back home to Seton Hall rather and Chase Hunter had to slide over one position and he has thrived yeah because of it and I think it has a lot to do with just having the ball in his hands and able to generate a rhythm that way eighth time in 10 games this year hes had at least four assists in a game Chase Parr is the biggest man in this Towson team at 610 only plays only played 15 minutes all year but he gets a couple first half minutes tonight he draws a foul inside just the sixth team foul on Clemson so Towson inbounds from the Baseline Chase Parr is interesting because a tough shot Chase Parr pays it off immediately and hes interesting because if George Washington is prior to previous school he was a starter started 30 out of 34 games his final year there and his head trouble cracking his rotation for Towson just because this team plays a little bit faster so hes just that big body that can compete with the high majors wow they are blowing the whistles and having a tight call today we didnt have a foul for the first 10 and a half minutes of the game but uh the last six seven minutes have been a little bit more tightly whistled who changed their mind Chase Parr picks up his first BJ Hall picked up his first on the previous possession RJ Godfrey into the game for Clemson first minutes for the Freshman from Suwanee Georgia Applause Godfrey looking for his offense right off the bench and hell get to the freethrow line the foul oncilla RJ Godfrey is a strong young man only a freshman his father played for the Dallas Cowboys for a long time and you can see it in his physique ahead of his years Hunter Tyson giving him an earful because he messed up the inbound but that being said I like RJ Godfrey from Suwanee Georgia big strong body has some skill can put it on the deck you have to like the way hes competing early and now a quick message from Works Nitro meatworks Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by powershare batteries to give you the power to outperform Godfrey hes now four for seven from the line collegiate career its early Applause one point game Applause holding bad pass but Timberlake collects it trying to get around Hemingway who plays him well defensively Brownell was talking about Hemingways improved defense earlier today Music step out of bounds yeah sure did going back to Hemingway you know he takes really long steps and when he defends other players hes got long arms and does a nice job keeping Timberlakes airspace away he doesnt give him any room to get a shot off closing in on two minutes to play in the half towsons only loss all season was a post Thanksgiving match up with Fairfield in Savannah Georgia pretty good Fairfield team by the way in the land Cilla cant finish in a strong rebound inside for PJ Hall a lot of contacts under Tyson kind of getting stuck both coaches were upset with the officials there and Chase Hunter comes in and Nails another three but whats the difference between his two made threes and the one he missed hes stepping right into it his body balance is straight up and down Chase hunter that thats an easy thats an easiest shot as hes gonna get good hands by Chase Hunter hes got Tyson newest right and he bounces it past him which one you have to have yes it is its one you have to have to to extend a lead on a Towson team thats really really good coach Brownell not pleased theyre shooting 54 but nine first half turnovers and a lot of them are sloppy handing them right to the other team and then giving Towson a chance now that being said dead ball turnovers dont hurt you as much because you can get back and set your defense turnovers in a threeonone situation when you should have a layup exactly Applause both teams the ball starting to stick a little bit hold into the corner Russell for three rebound Hunter Tyson again looking to push Applause Chase Hunter steps into another Holden Corrals the rebound Music thats one youre okay with Chase Hunters already hit two right in a row steps into it Rhythm shot Camp Holden what a move thats where hes so dangerous and keep in mind thats a point guard posting up Hunter Tyson he operates in the pick and roll he operates in the post thats what makes him so dangerous a little bit like bickett from Penn State two games ago for Clemson kind of operates in the same manner Tigers prevailing in double OT last week against Penn State the ACC Big Ten challenge Applause strong and the rebound for Timberlake final seconds of the half Timberlake gets away with a little push off missed a shot Tyson the rebound three court Lily traveled didnt get it off anyway and thatll do it for the opening 28th that was like four steps into the threequarters court shot he had to gather his momentum but this is a high level basketball game both sides really competing well a lot in the Pips 20 minutes of basketball been a terrific ball game and Pat scary told us before the game we really need to guard the three and he just came up to us and said well thats working great so much regarding the tree and he asked us if that play was a goaltend and we said we didnt get a replay but we think it was and its a one possession game Thompson picked up two fouls hes back in there Holden Cross Court Conway Bullseye wow what a pass from cam Holden but Conway The Seton Hall transfer hes a guy who can knock down shots I mean top 100 kid coming out of high school somebody that can get hot in a hurry Conway seven of his last four teams from three PJ Hall not this time Thompson with another rebound his sixth yourself Music Brad Brownell said something interesting before the game about this Towson team he just said their pieces fit together theyre a different team but it works I think youre seeing that tonight theyre chemistry their cohesion in their unique skill sets from one player to the next makes them a tough guard well theyve been together really well but cam Holden if hes able to operate in the post Hunter Tyson a little too handsy but he comes downhill he sees the opposite corner and Conway is able to knock it down but youre right they fit each other really well and Ive heard Coach Brown Ill say that before when he talked about his sweet 16 team with Dante Grantham Gabe Devoe Shelton Mitchell they all fit together really well Towson kind of operates in that same way good start to the second half for the Towson Tigers they score four straight back in front Applause take your pardon five in a row for Towson you see what the emphasis is right away get that ball to PJ Hall and let that man work using his size advantage on the interior also knowing that Charles Thompson picked up two quick ones in the first half and a third early in the second could be a game changer Tyson Holden battle for the board won by Thompson shot clock didnt reset four to shoot in the corner step back Conway got it oh man Big Time shot a little bit out of sorts but big time players can make some big time plays Holden step back in the corner 82 start to begin the second half for the Towson Tigers and theres the third foul on Charles Thompson about in the corner step back away from three Ryan Conway knocking it down nice player fight for Team Takeover in the Nike eybl had a solid peach jam they really like his longterm potential in the Kelowna thousands counting on Chase Parr to give them some key minutes here some size Off the Bench with Thompson and foul trouble Music Applause handoff for Tyson to the corner Hunter rebound rip down by Timberlake Applause Timberlake a guy who loose quickly but always seems like hes in control arm bounce pass up and under and a foul on Middlebrooks will send hold him to the line and thats on Mid middle Brooks if youre going to go for a steal you better get it because youre putting your teammates in a bad position Chase Parr at 610 able to make some decisions nice Patience by cam Holden as well you have to be solid against this Towson team who thrives when attacking the painted area second Fallon Middlebrooks Holden misses a free throw for the first time for Towson tonight I remind you to stick around for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer it is coming up so later on here in the second half Olden missed them both 67 freethrow shooter zero percent back trip four point game really the only hole in his game I mean hes unorthodox and how he handles the rock if he shoots the ball well hes making that defense get out and guard Hunter Tyson Fade Away nope over the back caught on Middlebrooks theres his third Chase Parr is giving Towson good minutes hes the only guy with any significant size that can match up with Ben Meadow Brooks doing a nice job on the interior doing a good job defending the three over this is stretch and I was just going to ask you about PJ Hall Thompson picked up his third foul all left the game as well got a little bit of a blow now hes back in there after about 90 seconds on the bench we also have to be careful with his minutes right coming off of injury during the off season hes going to be around that 25 minute per game Mark at least in the early going Russell evidence maintained the dribble there tumbling down Timberlake acrobatic shot he was fouled thats lower body strength than a good athlete Timberlake Goes left and extends up and he was able to do so so quickly on balance that Hemingway never really was able to catch up you see comes up plants straight up oh not a whole lot of contact Applause the fans of Little John come lets see it at RC and the replay a lot of people on that far sideline or at least the students behind that poor sideline asking for a flop call Timberlake scored 20 or more in three straight games midnovember his scoring has dropped off a little bit since then but hes still averaging 15 a game for the season and hes got 10 tonight well hes very much the lightning rod for this team if hes able to go for 20 or 25 points you know what youre getting from cam Holden you know what youre getting from Charles Thompson if hes able to give you good minutes and shot making it adds a whole different element Hunter Horizon long two he knew he missed it battle for the Board Hunter in there Paul comes up with it and lays it in thats just an effort play right there thats Gary looking at Chase par saying you got to come down with that one big fella but PJ Hall just putting in the extra effort and is rewarded 14 for PJ Counting Music outside of that foul Alex Hemingways done a nice job on Nicholas Timberlake I mean staying in his shooting pocket not able to get anything and youre willing to live with this cam Holden knocks down the three only 25 from three on the season but that was a huge shot there and the Towson Tigers have their largest lead of the night here at Little John that changes the game for Coach pascara oh my goodness a thunderous slam from PJ Hall and a quick timeout from Brad Brownell how are you feeling PJ all hes feeling good comes down the middle forget about it up and a serious flush sending a message for the Tigers Music Music thank you bow time put

begin the second half more of the same for Towson doing work on the interior and Clemson Tigers well theyve only attempted one three in the first four and a half minutes of the second half and they are over one I have to make it nine triples in the first one well cam Holdens been a big reason why theyve been able to take all five points here in the second half so far hes just such a tough cover but Towson doing a much better job defensively of getting out and contesting shooters just had an interesting confused look toward his bench as he dribbled the ball up the floor its like what play would we or I dribble on Hunter Tyson and then missed the shot and thats what coaches love Evan when you come out of a timeout and dont know the play good move everything but the Finish there for

passer and if hes knocking down shots he changes the way that you have to guard that team and in transition there has to be better communication for Clemson well the CAA preseason first team was threefifths Towson Tigers Holden Thompson and Timberlake all honored College of Charleston is going to be one of towsons feisty contenders at the top of the CAA a couple of fantastic Pats leading those teams Pat scary and Pat Kelsey they play on New Years Eve thats going to be one heck of a basketball game in Maryland Music Applause can Clemson come up with an answer Hunter Tyson yes wow what an excellent set coming out of the timeout Hunter Tyson just coming off getting his feet set terrific work out of the timeout Brett Brownell throwing that one up 103 of the night Timberlake comes up short 103 for Clemson as a team 18 tries second chance this trip for Towson 40 in True Road games this year dating back to last year theyve won their last seven true Road games in a row you dont see that very often in college basketball this would be a big one tonight Tyson stepped closer this time rebound shefflin kick out Chase Hunter got it he is money whenever he walks right into it whenever hes going sideways its really difficult but hes hit three today to head on offensive rebounds Evan thats whenever youre able to get that kind of look 60 run in 44 seconds Applause Music Hall at The Rim rule Towson bald Paul cant believe it but a heck of a defensive stand by the big man and its hard to argue great defensive possession poor that was off his shoulder PJ has good right to be upset but on the inbound its Timberlake his Defender Hemingway got clipped by a screen running to stay with him and fell down and Timberlake knocks down the short 12foot Baseline Jay Timberlake hes been patient I think thats a big credit to him theyve guarded him hard Hemingways done a nice job limiting catches but when hes gotten the opportunity hes been good Music perimeter all right so Russell picks up the second he immediately looks over to his coaches but yeah I got were good I got him no no worries let me play all the things that they work on and shoot around the opposing teams plays wow Towson bench is calling him out right now I mean they called out everything they were going to do to achieve excellent scouting job tough Fade Away by Hall cant connect rebound Holden who else then cam holder six rebounds five assists now to go with 16 points cats Gary said they needed him to have a big game and hes having one will it be 11 a shoot for Towson Timberlake being aggressive hit a couple of shots a little over eager spin Middlebrooks comes into the game I like the substitution a little TV timeout for PJ Hall gave him a little extra breather theyre going to need him for the duration of this game he might go over 25 minutes today PJs at 19 right now Russell for Timberlake long two who touched it last Towson did its Clemson ball Music Applause they dont love that call but

Security protecting the paint Towson maybe the shorter team but they have been really tough to penetrate on in the post well active hands theyre doing it by committee thats the big thing as soon as that ball goes in a painted area they swarm to it and theyre doing it without fouling Clemson only three freethrow attempts so far in the game just well coached defensively guys are jumping to help and doing a terrific job I think youre absolutely right when you say theyre doing it by committee and I think theres often a negative connotation to that like oh they dont have anybody that can do it by themselves its a good thing that theyre defending by committee tonight defensively especially right because when youre playing against teams that have one guy that can really tear you apart youre guarding him with the entire five right theyre doing a nice job anytime Clemson gets in there theyre seeing two or three bodies at a time and that makes things difficult it makes decision making difficult it makes shot making different theyre doing it without falling thats a big thing yeah its like only three freethrow attempts for Clemson we came in thinking Clemson was going to be physical and a little bit have that size Advantage but Towson is doing it in different ways theres the eighth and believe its on Nigel Russell no theyre gonna give it to Charles Thompson thats his fourth thats his fourth you have to love the move a little up a little under a lot of contact Chase Hunter not typically a postup threat but inverting the offense a little bit Charles Thompson gets that foul called on him if he doesnt bring his arm down at the last minute take one more look at this Terence let me see 32 coming down to try to help and its on the way up I mean its hard to really argue Holden go straight up Russell just got beat Thompson needs to know better in that on that occasion stay up gorger guy youre so important to your Tigers team Towson Tigers Applause Chris PQ Jr from Montreal Quebec Canada replaces Thompson who picks up his fourth with 11 42 to play the first Canadian to play for Pat scare opening up recruiting lines everywhere Applause in Montreal I have not its a great great place to visit we need to get up there Josh Beadles coming back in from Clemson replacing Chase Hunter and Hunter Tysons back as well Hunter Tysons defensive versatility has been important because he can guard Camp Holden on the perimeter and hes also big enough to give him problems in the pose hes gonna have to turn it up here in the second half to close out this game Applause Timberlake fakes him kicks it Russell nope Tyson another rebound is 10th of the game typically came out wide open and he lost the handle of the ball smart play I would have shot it anyway I know you would have 100 Tyson one point shy of another double double Applause his fourth career double double on Friday against Wake Forest 1510 BQ a little too handsy out on the perimeter sometimes your bigs arent used to guarding out there as often in Middle Brooks Im a little shocked he put it on the floor looking to attack thats not typically his game but hes really improved I mean Ben Bruno Brooks from Florida was highly recruited came a year early sister played tennis at Clemson the family atmosphere is real there is especially with the hunter family then you have Hunter Tyson going to work on Holden around and out Middlebrook showing his skill on the offensive boards Ill reward the big man with that post up there give him that extra effort I like this so get Josh Beal to his left hand had an angle didnt take advantage now middle Brooks gets a chance to go to work hes wondering where the whistle was Timberlake to the rack no battle for the board bodies crashed to the ground who is the foul gonna be on everybody it should have been on everybody middle Brooks and thats his fourth and its going to be interesting to see is this a hook and hold type of situation even so BQ if you dont get that foul call heads up play to throw it up Middlebrooks he was already laying out of bounds PJ Hall back in Applause active stint on the floor for Pat Middlebrooks he does exactly what you need as a backup five but BJ just brings you so much more offensively using all of his fouls tonight PJs only got one foul along with 16 points hes back in there defending holds into the corner with five to shoot holding on the dribble holding on the drive and score for Towson its so unorthodox and you can never tell if hes going full speed he dribbles that ball up around his shoulder at 65 youre thinking hes about to go up with it and he just keeps you so off balance what a tough cover exactly right oh theres the steal Holden ruled that hes dipped out of bounds Pat scary is in disbelief that was very close pets Gary does not agree youre gonna be able to take another look at it gets out in the passing Lanes that ones not out that ones not out that one was it was on the path yes I think it was you know were singing his Praises a lot Applause hes saying there might be a little home court advantage there oh three for Tyson Cleves him within one Applause pascari always has equipped for his audience we ought to give him a microphone yeah youd have to put it on a 10 second delay thats right Timberlake wow Mr Timber Lake it is so difficult not a lot of guys can do this come off a down screen set your feet going away from the basket knock down shots Timberlake can do just that Hall somehow maintains possession hits him and away Applause him and way on the cut but its all the extra effort PJ Hall getting the loose ball excellent pass an athletic finish for Mr Hemingway third foul on Nigel Russell that kids fired up Alex Hemingway 31 minutes tonight has barely he may he actually I think hes played the entire game well hes done a terrific job defensively and basically whatever he gives you on offense is just a bonus but hes just so efficient trading trades new school and old school back and forth we go Tigers versus tigers I was thinking it might make sense tonight you just call Towson like the Baltimore Bengals or something it would be easier foul call here and towsons going to get free throws PJ Hall just picked up his second the Conway he hit a couple of shots earlier in the game gets the guy off his feet good aggressive play trying to set a tone as PJ Hall but too much body on it Ryan Conway has not had many free throws this year but he has not missed hes been good tonight hes been very good Frank Conway I mean hes gaining confidence by the game and Towson has a couple of guys injured Captain Jason Gibson out with a back injury the deer Hicks with an ankle and as a result guys like Conway Seymour floor time and then you get those guys confident as you go into conference play Conway who averages Five Points a game is in double figures for just a second time this year hes got 11 Towson by three looking inside for BJ Hall and Chase Parr called for the hold and if your Chase Parr you have good position and youre forcing that catch further away from the basket dont get greedy at the last moment go for that steel plate position defense thats where Towson has thrived so far needles gonna stay in its Hunter Tyson thats going to get a breather around the eight minute timeout for what its worth Evan I have thoroughly enjoyed watching oh the song that came out of nowhere great pass Big Time finish an athletic finish I was about to say I enjoyed Pat scary on the sidelines and then we have an absolute flush everything about this night has been fun Timberlake cashing in impressive hanging in the air too thats a big time shot coming off the bounce Applause oh Timberlake its six four six five he looks bigger than 64 plays bigger because he leaps on his passes and his shots so explosive so athletic Galloway good ball movement Chase Hunter yes and hes been good tonight he hasnt disappeared per se but hes just been solid the entire evening four for seven from three Hunters got 13 points we are tied at 61 Timberlake almost got the roll on the offensive glass may can hit it a third chance no Beetle has it for Clemson and thats one you have to have Christian May the Freshman not able to knock it in Clemson trying to take the lead for the first time what seems like a while how will Christian may as a freshman maintain his composure here on the defensive end he gets beat by Galloway beautiful pass Hemingway yes forget about it great move to get downhill with the pick and roll and they seize the extra pass in the corner and Alex Hemingway hes played a lot of defense today Big Boy execution from the Clemson Tigers to take the lead 6 39 to go its time for tonights fast break presented by your local Ford dealer and I got my man Terence Ogle to be spotting up for the transition three in terms of ACC news and notes to you well now only two ACC teams ranked in the top 25 North Carolina falling off that boat a little bit four losses in a row this team isnt passed into ball like weve become accustomed to seeing guitar heels playing turquoivion Smith though the other team in North Carolina this guy is electric hes been terrific all season a big time scorer 337 and five are you kidding me and then pair him up with darkell Joyner an Ole Miss transfer NC State is really really good this season Smith and Joyner combined for 62 last night about the Tar Heels do you think they can turn it around whats the key for them getting back to Tarheel ball I think the bottom line is Evan they need to play harder this is a team that isnt bringing intensity every day theyre not passing the ball well theyre close to the bottom in the country and assist thats an issue moving forward Im used to Ty Lawson and Wayne Ellington and some of those guys and how they move the ball and played fast and in transition this North Carolina team its a lot of isolation ball that needs to change in a hurry for them to compete well its first time in a long time that a top ranked team in the preseason has fallen out of the pole see if the Tar Heels can turn it around that is tonights Ford fast break okay in America the future belongs to everyone so we built the new Ford Bronco sport for everyone with seven available goat modes and a camera with offroad views its built for America Music Saturday to be the best you gotta beat the best the wolf pack are hungrier than ever or is this season NC State Miami Saturday on Valley Sports South presented by your local Ford dealer kicking with us late night here in Clemson South Carolina six nothing Run for the Tigers over the last minute and they have retaken the lead with some beautiful ball movement and Brevin Galloway if youre playing defense right here you need to make him use the screen Chase Parr gets on the wrong side you need to protect the paint big fella what happens is it forces the help and theres Alex hemenway he doesnt miss many of those with his feet set the 14th three of the game for Clemson its a new season High surpassing the 13 they made against Bellarmine you know Hemingways just stayed in his Lane 12 points played really good defense been on Noah Timberlake for the majority of this game because Clemson shows a little bit of Zone coming out of a timeout interesting Applause Holden with seven to shoot gets a screen from Thompson whos back in there with four holding no Thompson hits the rebound to himself Corrals it and has a chance to tie it back up at the line and thats why he needs to stay out of foul trouble for the last six minutes of this game so big so strong So Physical and he doesnt want just two points hell take an extra one as well Music fourth foul on Ian shefflin shefflin and Middlebrooks the two backup bigs each have four DJ Hall with two foulses back in and Thompson at the line critical for Towson on the defensive end he just gives them that extra element of toughness because now theyre going to sub him out protect him a little bit gets the bounce off the back bracket falls through tied for the sixth time weve had seven lead changes games played an 11 Point window towsons largest lead with seven Clemsons largest lead was four Applause Music hopefully both these teams are dancing in March because they both deserve to be circling clubs yeah certainly talented enough and well coached Hunter Tyson inside Applause thats good to get discipline he cant hold him not fouling staying straight up dont give them free looks at the round s and six for its last six from the floor meanwhile Timberlake has had the hot hand for the Towson Tigers Applause cam Holden is so Shifty with the basketball thats a lot of body by PJ Hall and thats what makes him so difficult because you think you could switch 45 with him but hes a point guard and he keeps you off balance with this High dribble PJ Hall just leaning a little too much forward Kim Holden able to take advantage you were talking to me before the game about that high dribble its hard to go on because its such a change of pace to what you typically accustomed to playing against at Miss on the front end of the one and one that was the ninth Clemson team foul rest of the way Towson was shooting two six team fouls for Towson next foul will be one and one and thats a bad pass and you know Clemson had nine turnovers at halftime thats only their second turnover here in the first 15 minutes of the second half well theyve done a better job in a second but then again defensively theyre able to get their defense back in front live ball turnovers kill you this one doesnt necessarily do that in a low scoring contest Applause 6664 under five to play Timberlake rising up cash he just elevates he is so strong in his lower body to be able to stop and pop at that level such a good athlete Nifty stuff from Timberlake hes got 19 PJ Hall yes indeed for PJ Hall too what he does when he catches the ball their quick moves he doesnt stop and let the defense react decisive move from PJ hes got 20 points its 20 plus three straight games now certainly coming into his own Thompson to the corner Holden thought about it Holden doing what he does Tyson with rebound number 11 good defense Hunter Tyson now PJ looked like he was hurting a little bit left elbow Hunter Tyson shows you a defensive versatility weve talked about multiple position guy on that end of the floor Applause Tyson Galloway Hemingway Hall and Hunter to Tyson inside chance for three wow Im not sure about that call but regardless good ball movement Hunter Tyson able to gather and go up strong they keep moving I dont think he was expecting it but it doesnt matter Big Time finish and Clemsons up four Music thank you no matter who you root for we can all identify with the best in Smart Home

fireworks Nitro available at works nitrocom and by The Fresh Market voted number one best supermarket in America first clash between Towson and Clemson in more than 35 years 35 years and five days ago Clemson won by 10 we got a fourpoint game heading down the stretch here little John no Evan I did not plan that game no I didnt didnt wasnt trying to imply that you were there if you would have told me before the game that Clemson with about three minutes three and a half minutes to play was 14 of 22 for three I would have thought it would have been a 15point game but Towson has just kind of hung around been solid for the most part but because of the way they play defense theyre pretty help heavy right whenever Clemsons been able to get into the paint theyve collapsed and its resulted in some easy shots thats why Clemson shot the ball so well Tyson at the line makes it a fivepoint game of the largest lead of the entire night says something about how well Towson has played now along with the 143s Clemson also has 20 assists on their 26 buckets Holden and Timberlake and Thompson have kept Towson in the game the dive Thompson lays it in what a pass by Timberlake comes off hes knocked down a couple of shots with that exact set and what happens two guys come towards him and Charles Thompson wide open for an easy finish high level execution from both teams and theres a fumble Paul lost it numbers for the Towson Tigers they call it offensive foul on Ryan Conway and that cannot happen one possession basketball game thats a freshman making a freshman mistake the chase Hunter hustling back Conway needs to give that ball up earlier to a wide open Timberlake put your body on the line take a lick is what my high school coach used to say good position gets his feet set outside of the charge Circle bunch of basketball Music just the first foul on Conway but that one stings with a chance to get within one or maybe tie it up with a kick out three Hunter was looking for PJ Hemingway finds him PJ scores sometimes its just as easy as that find PJ on the Block and let that man work 1016 yeah Clemson has made its last nine field goal attempts Applause Timberlake around the curl again Conway for three Tyson with another rebound is 12 but a good offensive possession you run your set defense comes in from the strong side Conway gets that opportunity Clemson their last two second halves Friday against wake today against Towson theyre 28 for 43 from the floor Chase Hunter looking to add to it nope battle for the board and a foul on I believe Hunter Tyson I think it might be on PJ youre right and thats his fourth and thats tough now both Charles Thompson and PJ Hall have four fouls a little too physical on the box out problem is now Towson shooting two free throws on every foul call Towson Tigers eight of eleven from the line tonight 70 free throw shooting as a team this season theyre 81 trying to get to nine and one with an ACC Road win Charles Thompson 60 on the year coming in and really its a pretty unique section hes been limited today by some foul trouble Towson fans are still wondering what might have happened if he didnt get hurt in the quarterfinals of the CAA tournament last year he got dinged up he played in the semis but he wasnt the same in that loss to Delaware and they got upset winningest division one season and Taos in history a program that did not experience a lot of winning before Pat scary showed up 15 straight losing Seasons before Pat scary showed up and he won one game in Year One PJ Hall going to the bucket no tip Tyson is good thats tough you have to finish possessions you get a good defensive stand you have to close it out Hunter Tyson just remaining active 75 seconds left critical possession for Towson down five Timberlake wants it no great block out by hemenway and the foul called on Tysons Kim a thousands cam Holden between thousands and Tysons and Hunters has been a tiger filled night good aggressive Miss PJ hes kind of in the Bell cow for Hunter Tyson he just does all the right stuff it has 19 to boot hes been really really good 13 boards four assists hes turning to the leader of this team quick passing in a hurry after a terrific performance against Wake Forest 24 of 25 from the freethrow line against the Deeks Applause Alex Hemingway another double figure scoring night for the Indiana native hes got 13 three straight games and double figures for Hemingway three possession game Midway just a prime example 14 points not that many shots just doing his job and letting the ball find him Conway clearly looking to pass Timberlake tough shot yeah foul called on middle Brooks Thompson was trying to save the ball and he threw it off Middlebrooks his chest little Brooks kind of looked around like hes allowed to do that but it was a basketball play right as the whistle was blown what a shot attempt a little bit of hero ball down seven you got to get something quick but you saw the Jersey tug hes trying to save it Middleburg just fouled out of the game 31 middlebrooks got his money worth moneys worth on every one of those fouls again he doesnt present the offensive ability but he comes in hes ready to mix it up Clemson fans getting replays of this trying to save it there was nothing malicious or intentional enough no points two rebounds five fouls in 10 minutes for Middlebrooks and we are told in our headsets that they are reviewing this sequence Id be shocked if they assessed anything beyond what happened that would be crazy looks like a solid basketball play hes trying to save trying to save the ball in bounds and throw it off the other team and he and he was contrite right away hey while theyre reviewing this I want to ask you something the net rankings came out on Monday and I dont want to ask you to make sense of these rankings but I was about to say you might be asking the wrong guy Ill give it a shot Towson was 82 in the first net rankings Clemson was 87 and then today for whatever reason they dropped to 91 you look at the Ken Palm rankings which we both respect Clemson is about 50 spots higher than Towson in the Ken pump wow were gonna have a flagrant one on Ben Middlebrooks for the intentional hold they did a three possession basketball game thats pretty significant as you were saying as you were saying well I was saying Clemson is 50 spots higher than Towson and Ken Palm but towsons the higher ranked team in the net can you make sense of that for me nope you want the short answer or the long answer you want the short answer or the long answer I dont know how any of this works until about Midway through conference play yeah thats huge with 55 seconds to go possessions are limited important free throws for Charles Thompson Middlebrook still fouls out are you surprised by that determination from this veteran officiating crew well its a nonbasketball related play right reaches up grabs a shirt I guess by definition it is a flagrant one and Im not going to argue with my man Raymond Thompson Music but I mean middle Brooks he thats thats where he brings value right with his physicality cant do that no two big misses the first one was short and the second was very long Applause one more look at what was determined to be a flagrant on Middlebrooks and you see the foul just a nice move to attack the offensive boards middlebrooks just grabbing Jersey Id argue thats a basketball play its a foul but its a basketball play you get your jersey tug all the time and well Towson fought online both online so they get no points out of it Applause and then they turn the basketball over now Towson going to extend out into full court 53 and a half seconds to go imagine a foul game begins thats tough you have to hit free throws there and you have to get a shot off yep especially when you have time to organize yourself sure the Baseline out of bounds Im thinking they scored four or five points that trip its a one possession game instead score three possession game Pats Gary calling for a foul and set it to steal Holden the steal he missed the dunk oh wow Hemingway The Rebound and hes fouled with 415 left and thats just not it if youre Camp only theyre trying to foul he ends up getting a steal thats a point you have to have I appreciate the aggressiveness but Chase Hunter goes up to contest that and doesnt even touch him he just couldnt get up high enough Russell you need those points yeah lets you know you know its two for you know you missed two free throws you turn the ball over on a baseline out of bounds and then you miss a layup I mean yeah exactly right lost opportunities on the road then you fouled Clemsons best free throw shooter Clemson extends its lead with Hemingway at the line this does not feel like its been an eightpoint game it has been close all the way through up until these last oh a minute and a half Applause interesting lineup now shuffling in the game instead of PJ Hall look for Clemson theyre going to switch one through five here at the end to protect against potential three points eight point game Timberlake takes it rebound for Tyson his 14th and that should just about do it and the Clemson Tigers are 26 seconds away from their 10th consecutive win here at Little John Coliseum Applause this was a toughness win at the end of the day I mean Towson really brought the physicality in the first half Clemson didnt shoot it quite as well in the second but it was PJ Hall being really efficient it was Hunter Tyson having a big night career high 14 rebounds closing in on his career high in points hes got 20 now and 24 in the double overtime Victory against Penn State last week by the end of the year if he stays healthy hell end up being the alltime leader in games played in Clemson basketball history one for two nine point game instructions theyre going to get a shot off its Russell who missed it Timberlake on the glass puts it in makes it a seven point game and scary takes the time out with 144 remaining I like it make it last as long as possible for a nine oclock tip that was Cornells game plan against Miami earlier tonight and they got it they had a look at the buzzer to win against the Hurricanes at the Wasco Center 212 Point basketball game how about that wormy and GMan had a wild one tonight weve had a fantastic contest as well tremendous doubleheader this evening grateful to be courtside at Little John with Terence Oglesby I mean even this game a lot of points yeah for uh have a lot of different guys performing really well 100 Tyson has been terrific we all know what PJ Hall is but you know you want us weve talked a lot about towsons guys and they have certain they certainly have talent but this Clemson team could be the biggest surprise in the Atlantic Coast Conference because of how well theyre playing together and then you have Chase Hunter stepping up to a different level and Hunter Tyson stepping up to a different level that is a monster night 20 and 14 I dont know where Hunter Tyson is going to end up after this season but hes going to be able to play Timberlake went for the steal called for the foul Clemson gets no points from rev Galloway tonight its only taken two shots its played 25 minutes very quiet out there and uh yeah Brad brownells team looks like theyre going to win again only one of their next six games are here at Little John Coliseum Loyola Chicago and Atlanta and they play Richmond and Greenville which is a good facto home game at Georgia Tech and their home for NC State December 30th before they go on the road to start the new year in Blacksburg and Pittsburgh of course after they play five of their next six away from Little John they have four to five after that at home so it all balances out it eventually does its just a matter of if youre able to get off to a hot start and ACC play obviously against Lake Forest they were able to do that another impressive win final score is not going to be as close as this battle really was for about 39 38 minutes Conway at the buzzer puts it in with half a second ago makes a little more respectable in the final tote board but a 8075 win for the Clemson Tigers Brad brownells team survives this tiger tussle tonight at Littlejohn Coliseum two teams really competed hard towsons going to be a handful for anybody they play in the CAA and Clemson just so efficient
