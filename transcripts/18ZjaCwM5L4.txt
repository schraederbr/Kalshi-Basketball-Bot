double header continues right down the road in Raleigh Debbie Antonelli Jay alter with you the red hot NC State wolf pack taking on Florida State this NC State team 61 in the month of January and the calendar might have flipped to February Debbie but this is one of the best teams of the conference right now Smith is hot hes already hit two triples going for a third short but there clean up the spills Greg Gantt cant finish it Lauren dispossessed by DJ Burns hes doing everything right now for the wolf pack PJ just looking at us over here giving us uh uh hes like no way good hands inside DJ Burns doing a great job theyre trying to isolate him on the Block obviously defensively they want to try to attack him you want to try to put him in ball screen action Im telling you hes done a good job staying out of foul trouble everybody talking about the scoring is for good reason coming off at careerhigh 31 but he impacts the game in so many different ways this is a very talented NC State team theyve won six out of seven whats been the biggest key during that stretch I think the guard play has been outstanding but the Improvement and the emergence of DJ burns look what hes done in the last three games 21 points and five courts 31 in his last outing at wake 23 of those in the second half Applause makes the Seminoles pay its a 12nothing run for the wolf pack thats three triples in that 12nothing run scoop to the hoop Matthew Cleveland he has all four for four heres the full court pressure and this is where I think NC States not just trying to beat the press and not turn it over and NC State doesnt turn the ball over very often theyre looking to attack this pressure foreign Music ER through traffic plus the foul well Florida state is going to switch one through five and when the guards for the wolf pack get a big on them like corn right here thats just a foot speed matchup that is hard for Cameron Corin to stay with hes 610 darkell Joyner 61 and explosive with that first step Applause and this right here Jay is why I think this is going to be a high scoring game because the Courts going to open up both teams like to press both teams like the Up Tempo the Florida States coming off a game against Clemson in which they made 13 threes couldnt come up with the win but if they can bring that shooting form on the road theyve got a shot tonight and this is exactly a replica for Leonard Hamilton with the way the game started Saturday night Clemson got off to a big lead hit a bunch of Threes And then Florida State chips away and is leading at halftime against the Clemson Tigers on Saturday should have won that game they had a chance to win it thats for sure Music Cleveland contested shot too much on it ll be NC State when we come back with the basketball Kevin Keats team shot out of a cannon here at home where theyve played so well 111 in this building on the season and theyre up I mean you look at terquavion Smith against the Seminoles in the last two meetings averaging 26 and a half points a game shooting 50 percent hes right on schedule made his first two shots and they were both from three I think jarkel Joyner is a oneman trust breaker he doesnt need a screen he doesnt need any help theres burns after a career high 31 at the win against Wake Forest over the weekend hes a fan favorite and you can see why I mean hes taking the Freshman down to the block and he just spins so quickly Applause Florida State theyve dug themselves at early hole down by 13 heres Boba Miller into the game he cant connect Baba Miller is a player to keep your eye on number 11 for Florida State 611 very talented Birds wants it Cleveland fronting him and now gets it back in Cleveland down to the spin cycle comes off empty but theres a foul for a shove at the back on the ensuing rebound Applause theres Kevin Keats head coach of the wolf pack six and one in January hes put his team in a terrific position to make their way back to the NCAA tournament this season I mean hes done hes done how NC States receiving votes in the AP poll they only won 11 games last year 17 wins right now 111 at home Music TJ just says clear it out hes got no one else on that side of the floor with him getting to the corner great pump fake 73 jarkel Joyner drills it see right now NC States getting whatever they want offensively the great Gantt doesnt get enough credit Jay but hes a perfect compliment to DJ on the Block he doesnt need the ball hes a great offensive rebounder Applause Florida state in the danger zone right now the wolf pack on a 202 run over the last five minutes right back to Burns thats three straight possessions hes been the initiator and he drives right in and draws the foul Applause Wake Forest did not bring a double DJ Burns had 31 and he gets to the Middle look at how many Florida State jerseys are sucked into the paint on DJ Burns Barkley Barkley Barkley which is backing down back down back it down they all get sucked to the paint and he has such a high IQ with the ball in his hands time out Florida Music you know whats funny and a little bit surprising about the starts of this game is you look at Florida State and their last two ACC Road games they went on the road and won at Notre Dame and at Pittsburgh and thats a really good Pittsburgh team that Leonard Hamilton Squad beat and theyve looked like theyve improved so much since the poor starts of the season and yet down by 17 now early it was 21 years at Florida State but its a 50year career coaching young men in our game and you cant count Leonard Hamiltons team out because they can get hot in a hurry they can shoot the three they made 13 as you mentioned earlier in that Clemson game what adjustments do they have to make here well you gotta you gotta get some stops defensively first of all and then you got to be able to score on the other end they have struggled to find good shots against NC States defense which has been equally as intense as their offense early on suffocating right now Leonard Hamilton received that pass and he didnt want to Applause Applause coach Hamilton looking svelte over there hes on a fasting diet looks fantastic doesnt feel so good doesnt feel good right now but he looks good shot clock on eight Joyner splits the double right to the rim DJ Burns tipped it in and NC State leads by 20 does DJ look a little more Nimble tonight like light on his feet hes very active on both ends Applause everybody locking down one pass away Applause Cleveland another contested shot Off the Mark Florida state has missed their last five maybe they can get something in transition Cleveland had numbers Worleys there swatted away to birds and now turkwavion Smith has it that time really nice job by the Seminoles to get in and double Burns before he could pass it Applause just because you have a 20point lead doesnt mean you start becoming loose with a basketball look at this drive and DJ with the follow Applause Music Burns checks out wolf pack right now on a 242 run over the last seven minutes Applause Tom house into the game Lost His footing an excellent threepoint shooter thats what they need right now down 20 cell called for the foul NC State shooting 57 from the floor 80 percent from the threepoint line Music of 11 looking for something anything to ignite those offense and they turn it over another steal Joyner with great explosion backs up jarkel Joyner and its a 23point lead for the wolf pack wow get the time out before the five second count Florida State scoreless for the last five minutes and its allowed the wolf pack to blow this game wide open NC State flying all over the court dark hell Joyner puts pressure on the D then steps back behind the three Jay alter Debbie Antonelli with you so Florida state scored the first basket of the game and since then NC State proceeded to go on a 272 run you dont see that very often well Matthew Cleveland is the only player that has made a basket Florida state has not been to the freethrow line those four turnovers have resulted in 11 NC State points if you turn it over against the Wolfpack their team speeds going the other way its going to be really tough to catch them Applause two of 12 from the floor you know were talking all about NC State making five threes tonight and scoring shooting the ball so well the defense equally impressive Four Points in nine minutes theyve given up two baskets offensive rebound Smith keeps it alive hes tripped up I mean whats more impressive the 27 points are holding Florida State Jay come on now weve worked together long enough you know youre going into an offense no Im going on all the way oh I see the game through an offensive lens man seven points in nine minutes yeah is equally as impressive as holding a team to only two baskets should shoot its the type of night its been for NC State Applause wolf pack now shooting six of seven from three Smith just made his third Applause tough take and thats exactly what Florida State needed ends a six minute scoring drought Deontay green high off the glass against NC States Tawanna Applause Music Applause Smith Applause eyes on the timer five seconds to shoot pulls up for deep back to threes his fourth in this first half to quavion you go ahead and shoot till your arm falls off wow you talk about hot Music could he be the ACC player of the year he could be yes hes certainly in the conversation you lead this league in scoring you make the kind of improvement that hes made along with the team definitely in the conversation the defense too heading but the Finish Ernest Ross trying to rip the rim off Applause all smiles after the new stop I mean hes going from the ground to the rim it even dribble Applause thats how athletic he is Applause Music anyways this NC State team reminds Leonard Hamilton of what his Florida State teams are are usually Elite athleticism depth theyre going to press you theyre gonna play a 40 minutes Kevin keeps using the Leonard Hamilton blueprint well Leonard Hamilton has been playing this way for 10 years I asked him how long hes been switching one through five he said he always wanted to play this way and now he has the athletes to do it now he has four guys playing 30 plus minutes a game that never happens usually they have more depth but they dont have the same kind of depth theyve had in years past and they dont have a lot of Veteran guys that understand the culture the work ethic the system how hard you have to compete every day in practice and you have a bunch of young guys and you dont have any older guys to set that level its hard to explain it this is a playerled program for Leonard Hamilton has always been that way Applause Thursday night tomorrow night womens basketball double header right here on acc Network it starts with Pittsburgh against number 16 Duke and then NC State and Georgia Tech your night cap at eight Burns great feed Ernest Ross the Finish I mean this is as comfortable as Ive seen DJ hes telling corn to bring it in hes giving him this playing with so much confidence right now oh Coast to Coast Corners again hes everywhere hes just messing with him right hes doing a little talking hes doing a little Applause antics Applause birds I mean Jay look at this this is how comfortable it is for DJ grape find inside and then hes saying come on bring It bring it freshman now then from a pure entertainment standpoint even on social media DJ Burns hyping up the home crowd pack Nation invite your cousin son his best friend then says kids tell your favorite teacher well today before the game he decided to get Grandma involved did you remind to tell Granny and all her friends at the bingo hall to come out oh I love it its fun to watch on and off the court hes just a great personality and hes having fun playing college basketball I think hes supposed to be doing super high 31 points against Wake Forest over the weekend has enough points tonight and has done so much what about a triple double watch for DJ one of these days right I mean hes got eight points three boards three assists heads up no turnovers such an underrated passer oh I think hes well respected as a passer I think thats part of the reason why Steve Forbes at Wake Forest decided not to play him with a double team he had enough size he thought itd stand him up oneonone Leonard Hamilton said he passes like a point though he sees the floor like that Applause Music Applause ice and ball screens trying to keep the ball in the same side of the tour Mills does a great job of setting up Worley in the corner thats a really good play by Caleb Mills ice but you cant let them split they only counted it as a two but might have been on the line Im sure theyll take a look at it Music Freon pass into the game for the wolf pack step Back Off the Mark see just because you got a big on the switch doesnt mean you should be taking that shot Cleveland right sends off Smith hey bounces out to Joyner he pulls the trigger cant connect another offensive rebound maybe third times the charm here oh he is scorching Smith buries his fifth three of this first half Applause Music Applause 14 minutes of game action and a 30point lead for the wolf pack foreign Mills Music another offensive rebound and Florida State not organized and really no sense of urgency right there coach Hamilton is not going to like that Applause six days from now our Tuesday night college basketball doubleheader right here on acc Network starts in Pittsburgh where Jeff capels team is red hot three in a row included tonight in Chapel Hill and then NC State Virginia that is going to be a big time matchup at nine Eastern great double header Tuesday every night it is so hard to win in this league Music Joe Bernardi has seven teams projected into the NCAA tournament and I think it could easily be eight I think so theres so much basketball left to play in February shot clock down to three Smith fouled with the shot clock under two after quavion Smith will get three at the line understand yo Debbie great point about how difficult it is to win in this league the good news on that is great opportunity to get resume wins a lot of quad ones a lot of quad twos in this league all right take a look right here this is what NC state has coming up and these numbers can change but right now Georgia Tech is in the four they got a great opportunity with Virginia and a lot of twos oh your last five games are all two or one and plus you already have a win over Duke and North Carolinas got to come in here we have a win over Wake Forest they have to come here Music Applause Florida state yet to find their Rhythm Hills draws the foul leaned into Burns thats DJ second still smiling though Applause every Thursday right after our double header nothing but that will break down everything you need to know and ACC womens Hoops highlights analysis of every single womens game and look ahead at the best games coming up over the weekend at work Thursday night all about womens hoops team on the womens side in the AC well right now Jay Duke and Notre Dame are tied for first in the league NC State is playing well and North Carolina has won seven in a row there are like the men there are a lot of good teams on the womens side productive eight teams in the NCAA tournament right now thing but the bottom of the neck Craig cant and hes not a threepoint shooter NC state has made nine threes of this first half shooting 75 lets just get second triple of the season and once again Caleb Mills I think thats four consecutive plays that he has made up the floor for Florida State so hes still balling Im gonna go back after we take the another look at the Mills and one again NC State icing the ball screen and the screeners defender has given up way too much space they dont want to stay attached but you got to be able to keep him on one side of the floor thats why youre racing the ball spring NC State nine of 12 from three 75 percent Ive never seen that in a first half of basketball hits it again back to back buckets for him Applause the last five games Greg Gantt coming into this one and had 14 points and 42 rebounds thats his job and 13 of those were on the offensive end and now look its the second time hes got into deflection at Mid Court to get the ball back to the wolf pack I mean he is really starring in his role and if he scores thats a bonus for NC State whats incredible is NC State is up by 29 and theyre playing like its tight well you dont look at the scoreboard now you know youre still trying to play and maximum effort and certainly Florida state is trying just to chip away right its a daunting task right now hold on the gas Smith from NBA range Off the Mark foreign Applause the fans will forgive him though five of six from three before that Miss Gantt looks like he banged his elbow but pops up off team and hes at every single championship this guy he lives on the road he gets around to see every coach hes been here in the Triangle for a couple of days and then this today is National girls and women in sports day and while were talking about the commissioner his daughter is a soccer player at Yale and so hes very supportive of womens Athletics and I know the coaches in the ACC really appreciate that I wonder if Jim Phillips while he was over at Chapel Hill met with UNC field hockeys brand new head coach the 22 year old Aaron Manson how about that incredible interesting well Im sure Bubba Cunningham the athletic director vetted it out pretty well and its 22 can she rent a car when shes recruiting on the road she might need to call an Uber that was great chatting with Jim Phillips though pregame and he made a point to us I want to get out and talk to as many coaches as possible so from Florida States in town great opportunity for him he said he spent some time with Leonard Hamilton spent time with Jeff capable before the Carolina game you know if youre a student athlete in this league I gotta believe that his door is open I certainly know thats the way boo Corrigan operates at NC State hes the athletic director here its great to talk with him yes well have to visit with him as well with fun sitting over here well youre the mayor 180 people come up to you we need security detail for Debbie Antonelli in Raleigh and security underneath the basket with a nice block theres been a wins are few and far between for Florida State tonight that rims out from Green but great follow for Camp Corin and corens tugging on his jersey which is the universal symbol for get me out Im tired or Ive gone as hard as I can go give me a break which I think its the latter with Leonard Leonard Hamiltons players foreign Applause didnt get it Mills he has kept attacking stays down after the Miss Applause Wolfpack had numbers couldnt finish cant say an active this is the kind of up and down I expected up top cam Corin Kevin Keats calls a timeout hes not happy with the transition defense diversity the injuries and youre not winning and then you got a chance like this with this group you better keep your focus for 40 minutes where it needs to be and not worry about what the scoreboard says even knows what it takes one championships before Hargrove Military Academy twice hes been coach of the year in the colonial hes taking UNC Wilmington to the tournament hes taking NC State to the tournament very well be back in the tournament this season well on their way to 18 and five and eight and four in League Play Jay we dont know whats in the net we dont know how they calculate efficiency but use your eyes this is a tournament yes and and when you look at the score we dont know if the margin of Victory matters I think it does well this is now four possessions in a row where NC state has gone scoreless theyve missed their last five shots in a scoring crowd of three minutes and I think thats whats irritating Kevin Keats sure youre up by 23 but you want to see that consistency Music did you see the comeback the other night in the Iowa State game that was incredible no game is over full court pass warley picks it up puts it in and thats a good call by Leonard Hamilton throw over the top when you know that Kevin case just called a timeout to get into his guys about not getting back so you know theyre going to be over aggressive over playing and you try to find something over the top or back door well dont look now Florida State on an eightnothing run Joyner trying to end it and Applause Cleveland just gives it away up ahead chased down by Thomas lays it up and in plus a foul Applause I mean really good d by Casey morsel almost a gift Music LJ Thomas at the line freshman out of Florida Music big part of this depth that Kevin Keats is so proud of with this team this season and you know I was at practice this morning with Kevin keakes when they were going through their Scout and getting ready for this game I mean they were locked in the guys were locked in coach Keats and his staff were locked in Applause everywhere Jay time after a terrific January where the wolf pack went six and one couldnt ask for a better month and now trying to keep it going as the calendar flips to February they certainly have in this first half shot clock down to five Chandler Jackson has to hurry into a double team Cleveland cant connect from three Applause Florida state will get one last chance with under two seconds left in the half foreign Music by Florida State but they end it on a 102 run Music NC State shot out of a Canada start this game DJ Burns in company well I thought when you hold a team like Florida state that has the kind of athleticism that they have to four field goals and nine minutes or two field goals in nine minutes of play thats impressive I thought their intensity was equal on both ends until the very end when Kevin Keats called the timeout and told him they need to get back in transition in a very matteroffact way now Florida state did end the first half on a 102 run and they picked up where they left off still a big mountain to climb down 20 but down but not out see great script to play coming out of the locker room by Leonard Hamilton exactly what we were talking about in the first half Jay do you know NC State is going to push up and be aggressive theyre going to bring the heat and keep the pressure on the ball its a perfect time to ball fake and go back door Burns backing his man down off the window and in its not just that hes skilled with that half hook its that he knows where he is on the floor its so important for post players to understand the real estate that theyre playing in thats why you can use the glass so well theres now on the defensive end up ahead Joyner the Rost Miss timed him thank you give and go Cleveland right into Burns and they call Burns for the foul Burns thought he was straight up so its the lob and the missed twopoint opportunity and now youre playing in transition now look right here birds off the glass guard that no you cannot call DJ permits unguardable and in many ways he is if you let him catch the ball Florida States plan tonight was to front him as much as possible hes bigger than anyone else that Florida state has and he knows how to use for leverage looks like an offensive lineman but to be confused as a quarterback hes so Nimble at times but a great passer too I think you have to have IQ I mean he definitely has it I mean he sees the game like that Burns lays it up and in well Kevin keeps his trusting him right here because theres nobody at the scores table to come in for him with those three fouls and theyre driving right at him Florida state is for the drive float or too much on it burns trying to track it down and he does how about the hustle from Burns thats why hes a fan favorite plays like that now could the wolf pack cash in to Burns Cross Court pass Marcel got a great look you know when he passes out of that double or he skips it across the floor he gives his Shooters confidence he wants to check that assist box Florida State fell down in that first half but they are playing motivated right now they have not given up on this game and theyre basically doing this without their one of their better offensive players Darren Green whos over two and has not scored in the game yet hes going to get high making this run is what I mean Applause or sell through contact offensive foul going the other way green that time doing it on defense they go two side right here Mills gets to the inside and scores and then this play right here is the two side Applause Quincy States largest lead was 30 Florida state has chopped it down to an 18point lead Ford lost the handle stays with the Seminoles theyre going right at the beginning corn is trying DJs been talking to him all game Music Applause miscommunication between Worley and Mills thats a turnover Applause NC State leaves the ACC in turnover margin plus four that would be 10 turnovers for Florida State so far Joe theyre plus six tonight and theyve turn turnovers into 16 points off of those Turtles thats the style of play that Kevin Keith Price this program on spent the delay thats a tough take and he gets it to go thats where Kirkland has got so much better hes so bouncy hes got great spring hes shown that he can score oneonone Cleveland went right at Burns again thats been the game plan this entire second half well coach Keats is mad not a DJ but at the guards for not keeping the ball in front hes gonna come out all you do is put that kind of pressure on DJ on the back row right he just looked at a replay at the video board Music I I think its a foul DJs acting surprised but he he gets him on the arm clearly gets him on the arm right there thats an easy fall so in comes Ebenezer Luana Burns is gonna have to sit for a long time but the point is is that the guards have to keep the ball in front and not allow that kind of penetration to the rim putting DJ in that situation especially with three fouls look all the time Applause rejected at The Rim up ahead Cleveland out of balance foreign State ball Chandler Jackson called for the shove as Cleveland shaken up underneath his own hoop well Florida States DoubleDouble machine Matthew Cleveland going back to the locker room during the break this is what happened in transition comes down awkwardly on that right leg Music immediately grabs the right knee but during the break he went back got checked out and has immediately come back onto the bench so thats encouraging yeah I mean Matthew Cleveland is a competitor right he planned 36 minutes a game in Leonard Hamiltons system last year was the ACC Sixth Man of the Year and hes had 15 consecutive double figure games for Florida State hes definitely been their leader teams not used to playing with him off the floor gets that second gear we took quavion on so good sneaking behind that ball screen engaging the second lever level that acceleration too he slows you down and then immediately hits the gas change of speed its incredible quickness in the back court for Kevin Keats tomorrow night right here on acc Network a terrific womens basketball doubleheader it starts with Pittsburgh and Duke at six Eastern and then NC State number 15 team in the country taking on Georgia Tech Wes Moore in NC State two wins over top 10 teams including the Sunday night victory at home over Notre Dame I asked you earlier who whos the best team in the ACC on the womens side and you said its wide open much like the mens side its wide open I mean its a battle on the mens side and one inside for the top four seeds in the ACC tournament to give that double die its going to matter Darren Greene just hit a three I think it bounced off the head of Cam Corin and it bounced perfectly for Florida State triplets Music I said earlier Darren Green we need to get going it really fill it up Applause five minutes into this second half the tempo has certainly increased heres green he can get hot in a hurry Applause the block oh thats a goal time Music so take another look at this full court pass cam Corin like a safety whose Beat Just flings his hands up and then green hits the three thats a unique play like a DB right is that what you said like you gotta turn and look for the ball though you think youve seen everything in basketball Ive never seen something like hey its a 17point game it is how about the fight in Florida State it was a 30point game with six minutes left in the first half everybody thinks NC States just going to walk their way to a victory and Florida States making them earnest Music probably for the clear out at the mismatch working on Baba Miller The Freshman Jackson comes in it is called for a foul Leonard Hamilton cant believe it Chandler Jackson cant believe on his shaking off that left wrist thats already taped so did he get wrister ball I think Jackson was looking for a jump ball there I think its the right call got him on the wrist first youre saying yes Music Music Marcel puts Miller on the court and lays it up and in for two thank you Applause great dump down low cam foreign Jay he has played well now that DJ Burns isnt out there to push him around Smith pull up pop the immediate answer and DJ Burns pushes everybody around so its not just Camp Corinth boy Jackson drives right into the chest and Ross or dewana excuse me Florida States game plan in this second half Debbie has just been getting right to the rim everythings inside well they only shot five free throws in the first half and they need to get to the line as part of chipping away when youre trailing by so many theyre not turning the ball over theyre getting to the free throw line Applause deep sight to see Matthew Cleveland checking back into the game for Florida State after he went down a few minutes ago its great to see Matthew back on the floor this young man Chandler Jackson the first 13 games 21 points the last six coming into this one 31 points so hes starting to come on adding to that depth that Leonard Hamilton desperately is looking for with his team can you play a careerhigh 19 minutes against Clemson in the last game Applause wow that is what you call the blowby Applause Music E I mean goodbye to the rim hard to stay in front of NC States guards thank you NC state has made their last four shots the last two belong to turquavion Smith and with that made free throw hes got 25 Applause Applause look at Greg Vance puts his hips around quick release from Green Off the Mark though Applause foreign Applause ER just has to keep Joyner in front give him a cushion hes bringing that screen you expect that switch Applause ER beats the freshman I mean thats just really good offense Burns is loving it on the bench full court pass green skying and scoring what a pass I bet Darren Greens sister dalen is loving that shes at home watching Music heres Cleveland Florida States been successful when they can get in transition green step back hes made two in a row now one of their leading scorers at 14 points a game on Smiths saying just get out of the way Im going oneonone here Applause used that mismatch in the second half Smith already had 25 to lead the wolf pack on tonight well you can see Baba Miller going come on from NC State all night are you kidding me Joyner and Smith green perfect schedule in February but heres where Joe has the ACC today now this is a very fluid situation it changes quite a bit we usually get three emails a day from Joe Joes all over what stands out is you look at the ECC page well it stands up Clemson is leading the league the league is really good Virginia has some really good wins in early November of course Duke is getting better so they are definitely trending in the right direction Pittsburgh all the way at the bottom last four in with a huge resume win tonight on the road to Chapel Hill two wins over North Carolina this year and actually heres a youre my man this might be the best win Virginia well that was a fabulous we did that that was fantastic how about this NC State is 111 in this building the one lost Pittsburgh thats a good one that was early too thats before everybody knew how good it was all right so youve combined sweeping UNC a great win against Virginia and a win on the road here how do you leave them I dont know whats in the net its one piece of the criteria nobody does nobody does I think it drives the coaches crazy too nacho linardi though he lives in Im old I like the eye test I like turning on the tape tape doesnt lie but it has not lied tonight NC State and turquavion Smith shot out of a cannon they built a 30point lead credit Florida State theyve battled but this has been all wolf pack for the majority foreign Music Hamiltons teams with a bunch of seven Footers over there and they dont they just dont have them I mean he was glad his home sick he did not make the trip Cameron Fletcher and Jalen Gainey out for the mirror with injury its been a tough go for Leonard Hamilton certainly not the team he thought he was going to have foreign guys last year like Malik Osborne he was one guy I thought he was going to have Anthony polite John Butler raquan Evans Applause both of these teams Love full court pressure they play very similar Styles just that one has the Personnel this year and Florida State just doesnt have the the roster makeup especially when you factor all those injuries we were just talking about the play the style Leonard Hamiltons accustomed to play all right trying to get the hands free he does Applause Music Applause shot clock down to five Thomas spinning left it short good defensive possession by Florida State really locked in there theyve got a smaller lineup on the floor rolls off the rim no good jump ball possession arrow with the wolf pack are you surprised Florida States not taking more threes and only attempted five on the night I think NC States defense is better really good I dont think theyve been able to get free they cant get anything easy in transition theyve had one over the top dunk by Greene Applause now Leonard Hamilton went small one possession got a stop now he countered back with bringing a couple of bigs back in Smith off the floor right now for Kevin Keiths team three seconds to shoot Joyner hoist it too much on it Applause NC state has not made a field goal in the last three minutes it built a pretty comfortable cushion and here comes Smith to give the offensive jolt Smith has 26 on the night seven shy of the Season High 33 is going to be a player in this system for Leonard Hamilton 610 hes a freshman his dad played basketball at Georgia for Hugh Durham hes already been rookie of the week one time in the ACC 187 of his Notre Dame hes aggressive Applause and his off season work and his faceup game is going to get better theres already a very good athlete Applause you mentioned his fathers two uncles played power five football as well Brian corn and Georgia Tech and Ray corn for Auburn under legendary coach Pat died so that thats a good bloodline I mean I know coach Hamilton loves coaching him because he wants to be coached just a freshman through so much potential whats the really young Florida State team I mean hes communicating almost switches and he gets stuck on its way Beyond Smith oh its his night not many can guard him Im watching Corin defensively and when you get to the end of the shot clock and you got Smith its like oh man come on hes so quick and crafty clever and creative all of it together now up to 29 four shy of the Season high five shy of his career high Applause Applause well right back to Corin and he answers with an N1 opportunity of his own you see how low in the hips and shoulder game Baba Miller got turned in the corner look at this is a 611 guy he looks like a 68 guy dropping it off inside to 610 I mean you got to play the game low to high and you do that Jay is going to be Bobby Miller is going to be special Miller comes from Spain played in The Real Madrid Academy for the age 14 onwards Music he said he overlapped one year with Luca Smith step back three too much on it Second Chance opportunity though for the wolf pack Smith the basketball make somebody else score Applause Jay Thomas somebody else did score Applause Cleveland lost his footing and a foul called brings us to our break NC State up by 22 Music oh its a Sonic Blockbuster and college game day will be a camera at indoor as well Debbie Antonelli was there last night you left a note for Dan Schulman and Jay Billings I left those guys a note for their great broadcasting team and I know theyre both going to have a lot of fun and Cameron and Cameron is was fun last night its always fun its going to be fun in there on Saturday and look at the Rivalry last 100 meetings squared to 50 a piece he wrote it on the Note Jay Villas says it all the time that game always delivers yes Reese Davis let everybody know that Jay was the first to coin that phrase which I do agree with Applause you it does deliver you did the last meeting at Cameron Indoor it was coach Ks last home game and it was the second viewing on the ACC Network so we were up in the corner with Packer and Durham it was a lot of fun Here Comes DJ Burns gets an ovation from the home crowd hes such a fan favorite and for good reason hes been playing so well for this team Applause playing with four fouls thats limited his minutes tonight coming off that 31point careerhigh performance and you got to play through him while hes on the floor with those four fouls right hes only fouled out of one basketball during the season this communication Tapped Out of Bounds so stays with that she stayed underneath their own hoop on DJ Burns this guy plays seven instruments including the saxophone pictured there saxophone the alto sax not so much the two bucks he said he gave up on the tuba how do you have the time as a divisional an athlete to learn seven instruments you know what theres you in junior high in high school where they make you decide right yeah band or youre an athlete well whos going to make him decide right whatever he wants hes doing it all on and off the floor its factor for this team I would say Applause vibrant in his personality hes essentially infected this crowd with fun right of course cam foreign into turning it over there almost great body control from Smith to turn that in we have missed layups going back and forth Applause Music these two teams High Tempo theyve been running all night long Applause transition defense seems optional at the moment well you know NC state has scored at such a high clip they can set their gear right and they take care of the basketball and we were looking at possessions during the break while the DJ goes to the freethrow line NC States only missed 30 shots and theyve offensive rebounded 15 of them thats an excellent offensive rebounding percentage Applause six days from tonight Tuesday double header right here on acc Network it starts with Louisville and Pittsburgh and then at nine Eastern Time awesome matchup number six Virginia against a red hot wolf pack team its state closing in on 18 and 5 84 in League Play and a quad one opportunity against Virginia well Tony Bennetts team has won six in a row theyre the hottest team in the league right now and the favorites to win it I would say right now I think theyre playing their best basketball I think every team goes through some adversity just dont want to go through your adversity at the end of February Virginia Techs already had some with injury NC State have some to come out of January 61 with Kevin reconfigure his roster a little bit based on injury plus the foul its with great anticipation by this crowd it is they just cleared out Applause and thats the fifth foul on cam corn The Freshman actually had a terrific night yes he did 16 points too shy of his career high Applause when theyre chanting your name thats pretty cool completes the and one Applause foreign Applause had a really good day I mean its not easy to keep DJ Burns in front and all the switching you get stuck on these NC State guards it is tough to keep them in front thats a double ice pack so Im going against DJ Burns you dont need one I expect you got that too his benefits have been limited hes only been on the court for 18 minutes tonight but he has 15 points four rebounds three assists theyre just clearing out trying to play twoman game right here six on the shot Joyner step back three thats the type of night its been for NC State Applause foreign Applause ER Off the Mark that time Smith is sitting on 29 Points one of the touch on that possession didnt get one deep three from Green Miller keeps it in but it goes to the wolf pack Applause paddles in six threes 32 points for turkuevion Smith six threes ties the season High Applause what a night its been for turquavion Smith well show you the highlights as hes getting high fives and he gets into the rhythm of his Jumper in multiple ways hes creative and practically off the bounce he can create separation this is where his game has really improved getting to the rim hes not pulling up for the midrange hes getting all the way to the cup he also leads NC State in assists you can see what he has done in his career against Florida State he likes that switch in mantoman tour the Seminoles apart tonight ties the season high for six made threes in the game twopoint shy of his career high 34 this night is done Music Applause I think he just continues to build his case for ACC player of the year foreign places Smith and he knocks down a deep two I think youve got to look at what Armando bacon has done at North Carolina as well oh no doubt about it those will likely be the two names though as green knocks down at least a list Dark Horse for me would be tomorrow is Burton at Pitt hes had a great season finished the biggest reason why this pit team went for preseason number 14 to likely top five in the league with the potential to finish in the top four or three theyve got a favorable schedule down the stretch yeah and NC State respect to finish 10th in the league right and theyre sitting in a good position right now should they move to eight and four our next all ACC the ACC life is a very special one and it premieres on Monday night you dont want to miss this an emotional Journey with ACC student athletes and administrators from all 15 ACC schools who travel to Montgomery and Selma Alabama a lot of experience and learn more about the Civil Rights Movement down cup hosts the coverage seven Eastern right here on acc Network of course February 1st kicks off Black History Month the fitting ACC unites on Monday night Applause well Greens finally getting his hands free and thats what hes capable of hasnt had many chances tonight dangerous hardworking transfer from UCF averages three threepoint makes a game I dont know the net stayed up by 30 and that three significant to some Applause just a ThreePoint Shootout right now well you nailed it with this was going to be a high scoring high Tempo game but I doubt you thought the wolf pack would get to 92 I was thinking it was going to be 8583 something like that Applause whats the ceiling for this NC State team well I I love the schedule and you got to love the schedule they have coming up because theyre definitely going to be tested thickness in the backboard depth King Applause on the horizon to return as well as Jack Clark Applause thank you Applause thats the scary part before those two went out You could argue those were the two best Pigmen friends who stay in their absence DJ Burns has now established himself Ernest Ross has stepped up those guys come back healthy the depth is just incredible all right number 41 for Florida State RJ Morris watch for him to get a look he will made every shot today and shoot around which reminded me of Justin Linder he was a walkon for Leonard Hamilton who never missed in practice they call themselves The Green Team and Coach Hamilton puts a lot of stock in them helping develop his program and the team there he is the deepest back court oh thats fine now yeah that was that wasnt Morris the deepest scout team in all of college basketball Leonard Hamiltons current team Applause lets see if they give Morris a shot here hes in the corner if they green didnt see him Applause Music Applause the NC State goes wire to wire a 272 run put them in comfortable position and now the wolf pack improves to 185 and 84 in League Play what a finish for NC State quickness in the backcourt depth Off the Bench DJ Burns in the mix the fun team to watch 94 points is a big number
