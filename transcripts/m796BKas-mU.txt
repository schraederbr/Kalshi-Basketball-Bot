March begins and the race to Washington DC in the ACC tournament and Beyond these teams hope time for the record Ive never called it regalia Ive been on his campus but I like it I like it thats the purple yeah often referred to as such this is Hall lining up a three and knocking it down and and Js going to have to learn to respect that get up and at least put a hand in the face cuzz is fully in the bag for the big fellow PJ Hall 102 career threes now for PJ Hall can hit that shot hes made 43 this season this is Burton trying to answer fight on the glass knocked around and Wiggins able to come up with it Jack Clark whos been an impact player for the Tigers un available tonight Jordan hes out with illness that matters best defender real glue guy who can rebound and knock down some open sh shots no miss him Wiggins gets the start in his place double team on sheflin got it to Wiggins inside over the front rim for two so now what Wiggins possesses in place of Jack Clark Jack Clark yes has length at 68 but insert Wiggins at 610 and this group becomes decidedly even more bigger and longer even bigger and longer excuse me and Wiggins has certainly seen action this season hes played it every single game Marcus Burton continues the production and he gets the Irish on the board so where Burtons at his best settled for the threepoint look early on 30 shooter from there best getting in the rim or utilizing the float game leading freshman score in the ACC Marcus Burton just over 17 points per game Gerard Miss fires and the rebound from boo so the Irish on Tuesday with a home Victory against Wake Forest 7065 overcame a night with a shot just 38 as a team Gerard deflects that one into his own bench and out of bounds and it will stay with the Fighting Irish tail T Davis bailed out on that Baseline Drive left his feet were with nowhere to go with the basketball Gerard caught it late should have been a turnover going the other way noted aim overcoming a fivepoint deficit at home against W Applause Forest Burton turns it over I think Burton was caught off guard that Hall was in his face when he looked up and the head fake got sped up Shuffle the feet right called by an elite crew we have this evening Ted Valentine Lee Cassell Jeff Pon our officiating crew by the way game one of our CW Courtside Saturday 8776 a win at home for Virginia Tech against wake this is Paul again shefflin fighting for it Burton comes away with it Gerard Cuts him off for the moment head Burton lays it up an in over the bigger players inside thats a freshman with the patience and cerebral approach approach to keep the pivot be patient let the defender be aggressive and use that to his advantage to get it off the rim L coming off that career high of 31 points in the win against wake on Tuesday shefflin over the top to flex it back out to Wiggins Hall all of the points in the win against Wake Forest came from the starting five no bench points in that Victory Burton he had 31 cant get that one to go thats a win defensively every time in the half court setting for the Tigers when you force Burt to settle for three Gerard inside the hall fouled and hes going to the free throw line the decided Advantage for the Tigers resign hides inside with PJ Hall does a great job of wering in that interior space Joe Gerard not known for beting guys off the bounce does so but the seal from Hall where its just a catch and in seamless manner a finish at The Rim so Hall to the free throw line Kev ji picks up his first personal what a career in Clemson South Carolina its been for PJ Hall 80 for the free throw L this season 18 1 12 points per game third in the ACC and thats an old school threepoint play for the senior from sparenberg South Carolina and Tom Im going tell you right now if RJ Davis wasnt playing at the level he has all year wed be talking about PJ hallford player of the year but were certainly talking about him as a first team All Conference performer RJ Davis and his teammates have already posted a victory this afternoon in ACC Play Shock loock is down to 10 for the Irish and Burton tigerss doing a Sublime job running Shrewsberry off the threepoint line Burton hits the three hes got all seven so far for Notre name I mean hes as high a usage guy as youll find in the conference he is the main artery through which everything flows shefin kicks it out to Hall straight away hes got three he Giants just staying at home hes going to have to get out and defend that threepoint shot this is why PJ Hall is so Dynamic Physical down low but can force the pig to dance outside if theyre not going to dance hell move to the beat of his own music out there Pauls got nine points Burton has seven he got bumped Dylan Hunter fing Burton tell you right now PJ can perform its not PJ Hall it is you know whats coming frej Hall Tigers 117 early it was Penn State coached by michah Shrewsbury against the Clemson Tigers and Brad brell how about this game Jordan double overtime a 10194 win for Clemson tell you what if we have that here tonight I wont mind in it Im not going to determine a winner but if we get double overtime basketball I aint complaining as a broadcaster but so far it hasnt been Brunell verse Shrewsberry its been Hall vers Burton as these two have really lived up to the start billing this evening a rare Miss from the free throw line for Marcus Burton 83 of the season and that is eighth in the conference Brad Brownell has done an amazing job with the Clemson program in his 13th season in Clemson South Carolina he has the most wins in school history with 261 just a heck of a basketball coach and a great representation of Cl and an Indiana native thats Wiggins inside Wiggins buried rer at that point you lost the battle before the ball even enters the hands of Wiggins good job pre catch to determine he was going to go chase two Brad Brown Ellis from Evansville Indiana dep basketball player right play Yes 91 grad DePaul University started his career playing at Purdue didnt get the kind bounce for ji trying to save it on the Baseline able to do so that was T Davis tipto in the line and Burton had it knocked Away by Gerard what Gerard lacks at foot speed cracking with the hands being active he slips down loses control Burton trying to win the race he got bumped in midair by PJ Hall sent to the court and to the free throw line youre finding that competitive nature show glimpses from Marcus bur of course hes been productive offensively but he turns the basketball over and the resiliency to stay dogged on the basketball with Gerard to eventually take it away from him to get it going the other way and not afraid to play into the contact and draw the Applause whistle one more coming now for Burton freshman from Mishawaka Indiana Penn High School 102 from the line scored over 2200 points in his high school career average 30 points per game as a senior thats a distant memory now latter stages of his freshman season and hes been so impressive Gerard Off the Mark diving for the loose basketball Applause Music ims Davis working around the perimeter Davis trying to shake Godfrey hes Defender and around his hip and travel and back to Applause cson so Davis will exit the ball game for Coach shury Tigers come in with a 20 and8 record they are a 10 and seven at conference play theyve been impressive on the road in the ACC theyre five in pre Jordan and theyve won three in a row on the road in conference that speaks to a dangerous team we can go on the road and get those dubs traveling shefin just an absolute load a mismatch truth be told they should really explore going to sheflin the bodies on the floor even Zona uh thats Advantage number four in Tiger Jersey shefflin vastly improved this season just about averaging a double double right in front of that Clemson benett booth and youll live with those truthfully if youre in the Tigers defense theres no good Shooters on the Flor when Shrewsberry leaves thats a 27 threepoint shooter in booth and the 26 M three of the season for booth as Dylan Hunter comes up short with his jumper younger brother of Chase for the Tigers if Im the Tigers Im playing a drop coverage Im really packing it in and say hey show me you can beat us from three trying to work off of that Zona screen Burton once Burton gets past the first line of defense and he gets to that second stage his midrange his floater his ability to finish around the rim he is devastatingly good double figures for the 22nd straight game for the freshman Marcus Burton Gerard cannot find the range struggling early here in the first half Burton will spin it the kick eyeses couldnt connect and again its its good offense but its ending up at a 23 threepoint shooter hands HS has only made 7 threes this season onepoint tiger lead and a foul on the play Burton has picked up his first personal the Irish defensively have been so good this year top 30 defense in the country they dont turn you over theyre not really getting up in you but they contest everything they guard without fouling and position wise theyre always properly placed that can get frustrating for an offense in a game that moves slow with Amplified possessions because the games played at a slow pace second best of the ACC in scoring defense Sona trying to defend shefin rer over the top of the board and heres Applause eyes shury for three its a first good look that Shrewsberry has got he was still hurt Chase Hunter pulls up this is where the Irish will look to slow this game down manage this game understanding that if it becomes a back and four tons of possessions its Advantage Applause Club foul coming up against a Tigers itll be on beetle is first Marcus Burton hes announced himself is a freshman here at Notre Dame with plays like that the midrange and Theon youre watching ACC basketball on the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve lets take a look at whats going on around the ACC presented by TMobile keeping in mind that North Carolina and Duke have already clinched double buys at the tournament in a couple weeks in DC yeah UNC is one of those teams nationally everyones looking at and saying could this be their year scoring sticks out to me and a lot of people obviously as we talk bubble time Wake Forest losing to Virginia Tech that one hurts the resume massively for Wake Forest team its still trying to recover from that loss to the Irish just the game PRI by the way North Carolina has just one loss at home this season and it was against the Clemson Tigers just the second time in school history they went to Chapel Hill and won defending the Irish late in the shot clock for rer Applause long rebound run down by Dylan Hunter does not have the numerical advantage that is a Supreme Team rebounding everybody locates a blockout ball hits the floor and nobody but Tigers able to go chase it down job well done defensive rebound Hunter dribbling through a maze and laying it in challenged every single Irish Defender incredibly Shifty there patient Dylan Hunter hes a driver thats where hes at his best with his game certainly not a threepoint shooter keep in mind that Hunter averages just 27 points per game oh with Jack Clark out everybody has to elevate for the Tigers on the road here rer try to back it down around Hunter the kick out for three and its money for Music Applause boo two three attempts and hes knocked them down tied at 17 what a kind bounce out of the corner for Wiggins and thats a three ball corner pocket and the Irish will give Wiggins that look they almost dared him to make it and the rim did all the work to deliver for Wiggins there chess match being played with these teams and what theyre allowing the other one to lookwise to get offens IMS into the teeth of that Clemson defense shot clock is at 10 50 shooting so far for the Irish in the first half roer becoming the facilitator for the Irish hes got to take it himself over top of the backboard and to the Tigers and Tom what youre seeing is when Marcus Burton is out of the game for Notre game they are without an identity there is nobody to play through its Burton Shrewsberry its truly the offense with some booth in times occasionally J down low but this group needs Burton on the floor as much as possible thats why his usage is tops in the ACC Notre Dame now three of eight on threepoint tries Clemson is three of seven from Beyond The Arc Paul has two of those made threes entry Wiggins against the double team lost it on the way up and foul was called Lee cassella on top of the call felt like a late whistle hits the booze how about bger Phelps the legend throwing the basketball back right there and he knows how to find the camera coach FS with the thumbs up its the second foul on ji just a little reach in there from J perhaps with the reach in I think all eyes were looking at Booth Boo and violate the foul came to Jive for the D free throw is good or is Po from the new movie Kung Fu Panda 4 might say scoo dont miss Kung Fu Panda 4 only in theaters this Friday got to take the little one to see Panda for sold it to me only one for Wiggins there tight ball game in the first half 920 and rolling Tom wormy Jordan cornette the former Notre Dame standown still the schools alltime leading shot blocker and our outstanding production crew on CW Courtside Saturday boo a little bit of a heat check for boo yeah but that was a good looking Miss Booth is clearly focused and dialed in and theyre going at some point have to really start respecting him from three Applause tonight Chase Hunters been a significant contributor this season his teammate PJ Hall to the rim and hes got 11 double digits Halls been Unstoppable and they havent gone to him enough here in the first 12 minutes of the game Id sit 24 on that low block feed him every time beg gluttonous and say stop me prove to me I can be stopped 27 times this season double digits for Hall ims the missing the long rebound Applause Hunter trying to challenge Davis who held his ground I swear Hall needs to give it up and go duck down into the paint hes got to get on that low block theres not a defender on the floor big enough strong enough to defend him Beetle these are empty possessions for Clemson theres not one guy on the floor for the Irish who can defend an all conference first team performer in PJ Hall you must go down low to 24 trying to work it inside to Davis couldnt calculate that angle fighting with Hall that goes off of the Tigers and it will be Irish basketball when we come back its a sixpoint first half lead for the visiting Clemson Tigers on CW Courtside Saturday why do powerful people submit themselves to in conference at 40 Plus in conference at Bron Shrewsberry havent even really given him looks hes 0 for one from there uh thats how the Irish can really punish you is when that twoman game of Burton Shrewsberry gets going it has not 12 points in the paint for the Tigers should hover towards the 20 spot if they are gluttonous in going down lad to PJ Hall which I believe could be the decided differentiator for the Tigers to take true control here in the first hands Irish with the basketball theyve missed seven of their last eight shots and each of their last five three attempts and their percentage down to 38 as a team in the first half at one point it was 50 shot clock inside a 10 for Bert Zone look here Burton just graay the front of the Applause rim Hall demanding the basketball against Zona just put the shoulder into Zona created contact and the foul against the Notre Dame senior I like the mentality for PJ Hall he is known to Trail the play and become the threepoint shooter there he didnt settle he had a good look from three but said no Im going to see if Zona can defend the close out move his feet well enough to stay with me and that is attacking the close out PJ Hall going right to the rim and drawing a whistle 11 points right now for Hall leading score for the Tigers Burton has 11 for the Irish will haul at the free throw line CW Courtside Saturday concludes next week with a pivotal double header first Boston College takes on Louisville then in Prime Time two teams with tournament aspirations square off as NC State visits pit CW Courtside Saturday next week 530 Eastern 230 Pacific only on the CW and we thank everyone watching and staying with us all season long through our football season into to college basketball we started on December 2nd with Georgia Techs upset win against Duke will conclude next week with our CW Courtside Saturday double header Burton over two Defenders so good was stopping rising and staying focused on the target good trajectory for for a little guy to be able to finish over tall Defenders hes mastered that midrange floting last five games he has averaged 22 points per game including 28 at Syracuse and a careerhigh 31 against wake on this floor on Tuesday and a misfire from Hunter Zona gobbles it up the ability to change Paces He hell set you up hell stand you up and that that quick first step and hes a blur and hes gone couple of players got tangled up there Wiggins and Sony dra a lot of length defensively and shuberry the Sharpshooter so as he tries to come off these screens Defenders like Wiggins with length have been disruptors and have deterred the the pass of the distributor from going to Shrewsberry because hes covered up pretty good here in this first half leading threepoint shooter for the Irish is shury as Burton dribbles all over the court finds shrewbury tough Runner got the angle for the Irish thats a big time play from shb run him off the line become a cutter and finish at the rip heck of an adjustment from the Sharpshooter his first basket of the game he averages 10 per game Paul misses Zona the board Jr konesni is also in the lineup right now for the Irish hes got the basketball he fires hes got it first points from the bench in two games remember they did not have a bench point and the win at home this week against wake interesting cuz Jared kesn looked at coach Shrewsberry and they shared a smile kesn pointed at his head coach when he made the shot clearly trying to instill confidence in his bench guys that is coaching KES did not see action in the game against wake that is the spin from Beetle and he got fouled by Davis so Josh Beetle red shirt sophomore from Columbia South Carolina will go to the free throw line 64 of the Season trying to untie Music Applause us its finally here the highly anticipated new season of the CWs number one show allamerican premieres Monday April 1st from the sidelines to the streets theyre leaving it all on the field Monday April 1st 87 Central only on the CW guaranteed that these teams will leave it all on the court tonight senior night for the Irish and Jordan you know all about the emotion of senior night from this very location some years ago back in 05 dont do that Tom you know how that game ended for me against the pit Panthers where we jumped out to like an early 18point lead on a Sunday afternoon needed to get the tournament and we lost by like eight points and I fouled out but thanks for bringing back that memory from 20 years ago its appreciate I was thinking more of the celebratory nature of Burton trying to give him something to chear about and celebrate I said the Tigers had to try and contain Marcus Burton off the bouns I can say that very comfortably from the sidelines its a tough task tigers have not be able to do so Burton with 15 points now that leads all scorers so far Hall hes trying the threepoint range and hes missed his last few hes a capable threepoint shooter its entirely too much volume for three for Hall Joe Gerard has not scored tonight he has over fored three from the floor this is Chase Hunter Catch and Release angular rebound to Shrewsbury Im surprised how many possessions consecutively have now happened where PJ hall or sheflin havt tried to dive into the paint and play in the post third tie of the night Irish looking for their first lead on this possession Burton had to give it up Gerard on shury shot clock is at Music six Sona he puts the Irish in front for the first time tonight with a three the crowd comes alive its all Marcus Burton put Tyson in a blender put Hunter excuse me in a blender off the bounce once he gets past Hunter defensively defense collap say defense sags off Zona Zona delivers on his senior night take a look PJ Hall got the three ball going early and hes capable he shoots about 33 from there hes been mightily productive but his last three attemps from three havent caught any stuck back inside meanwhile Marcus bur hes even had the three ball go once but off the bounce he is a magician 15 points his ability cre off that bounce getting past the defense setting up guys a couple times this young man is primming with confidence as we now entered March in the late stages where freshman Tom really become sophomores at this point this is Hall the senior over top of Sona there it is it can Im telling you it cannot be stopped nobody on Notre Dames team is built to stop him oneonone in isolation with that baby hook over the left or right shoulder that time over the left Applause Burton back out to Zona mes misses and now Wiggins in transition shefflin running the floor and hes got the layup forget about the threepoint line think about shefflin and Hall down low and then you will watch a tiger team build a lead tigers Three of 11 on threepointers and prior to those last two baskets for Clemson it was a 122 Irish Applause runne against Wiggins its a good move from KES drove it hard tried to find an angle didnt have it played off two tried to use the rim to protect just couldnt punct it this is what Brad brell identified the response against the runs by the home team thats how you win on the road in the ACCC kesn hit the deck and its going to be Tiger basketball I dont care if Im Im harping on a point too much here PJ Halls taking six threes he he should not be a double figure threepoint shooter I dont care if he has the ability there these are bailouts on offensive possessions in a game where possessions are Amplified PJ Hall should not take another three in the first half certainly but unless its just undeniable truly for the rest of the game hes taking 132 three attempts of the Season get its part of the game I understand it but you settle now its a different story for Joe Gerard he has not scored tonight he shoots 43 from Beyond The Arc Gerard so far 0 for three on threepoint attempts and you know what coach berell does not care about it airball from Joe Gerard hes telling him take that next one the next time the time after that and the time after that 85 made threes on the season for Gerard thats tied for third in the conference at the other end its Sona might have lost it on the way up and Hall grabbed it good defense from Hall to recover and defend make him score over the top Gerard with the kick Hall thought about a three drove it and lost it fight for the loose ball and a foul against the Tigers looked like Booth was in there for the Irish as Applause Music Applause well so shefflin assessed that foul his first PJ Hall on a catch from three right there there he thought about the three tried to drive it that needs to just be a catch move the basketball move it within the confines of the offense to find something you dont have to be the cre buron a wicked Spin and layup for the Freshman young man is special special T lightning quick off the bounce and now Gerard and Hall have trouble collaborating Hall saves it to sheflin Hunter bounces off of Burton a couple of times back on his way in and an offensive foul CR Marcus Burke just staying there making Hunter meet the chest Teddy Valentine is Will to let it go once maybe twice but the third time twoo egregious in front of the whistle for tending not to use it there comes the first one there comes a second one but he powers in that third one its just enough for Teddy B to say no so the ball back to the Irish it was a foul on Hunter his first might have been a travel involved in the contact as well this is shury up top shefin for the board did look like Shrewsberry caught it clean enough maybe surprised he was that open but had to reload and in that awkward exchange not a good look for him hes missed both of his three attempts so far in the game shefflin againsts the double and he spins it on in thats what the Tigers need to bottle up and deliver every possession high low basketball between two high level interior performers hold it down low to shefin six points now for shefflin one of the top rebounders in the ACC in fact n and a half boards is the best in the conference and hes got another Applause one shefflin Hall its its laughable how easy is if the Tigers cannot get bored with dominating in the painted area Applause 16 points in the first half for PJ Hall and the tigers by three theyve led by as many as seven in this first half toor aame had a threepoint lead after Zona gave him their first lead of the game earlier in this half all right coming up on the Subaru halftime report from purel Pavilion at the joy Center Notre Dame Indiana CW court side Saturday well have the recap of Blake forest and Virginia Tech a win at for the Hokies well talk live GF the Jenner recap in highlights and stats with our first 20 minutes for the Irish and the Tigers and theyre only meeting during the regular season they met last year they played in Clemson South Carolina and that was a dominating victory for Clemson against the visiting Applause Irish last win for Clemson here at Notre Dame came back in 2009 19 in fact theyre only win in the five beatings between the teams here on this floor as expected two teams Tom playing their best basketball right now not necessarily in this first half but two teams entering this game we knew it was going to be a close contest Clemson tilting towards a pretty sizable favorite but with How the Irish play here and how they played their last five games for and a half If you eliminate that Syracuse first half its a group thats figured it out to play and backs out on their limitations under coach shrewbury either way the Irish have exceeded the win total in conference for a year ago they won just three conference games a Miss from Burton deep in the shot clock and theres only 11 seconds on the game clock Tigers trying to win their sixth ACC Road game of the year it would be a School record Burton the steel trying to beat the clock locks it up and hits the back iron which was most just unkind and the Tigers close the half on an 82 run and Irish with the basketball to start the second half in trailing Music 3431 that pass ends up with the Irish bench miscommunication there that was supposed to be BR Shrewsberry fading flaring out on that screen not cutting towards the rim clearly is set to get their shooter going Shrewsberry not locked in there out of first play to start the second half not how you want to begin a second stance Tigers one on Tuesday at home against pit thats shefin and a feed from Gerard to start the second half on the flip side exactly how you want to start a second half for these Tigers ducking in chefin such a good presence sealing down low playing before the catch and gets an early two a place where theyve been dominant 22 points in the pain for Clemson Notre Dame has won four of its last five games have to overcome the early second half deficit and that will help shoy On Target so subtle but such an impressive basketball move you got whole defending outside jab at him get him on his heels get a clean look from three his first three of The Game and his 70th made of the year to lead the club shoy again let the defender fly on by launces the three Davis offensive glass the cutter is Burton it was Chase Hunter who got a piece of the Burton attempt nice cut for Burton Elite job for Hunter not giving up on the play deflecting from behind got beat didnt give up on the play timed it playing without Applause foul shb in a congested area and that one swatted away by Hall out of bounds and it will stay with the Irish theres 10 on the shot clock love what the tigers have done defensively they are running Shrewsberry off that threepoint line making him a dribble Drive guy or a cutter and then contesting anything he does at The Rim making him uncomfortable has been key and Hall is the third Best Shot Blocker in the conference thats a Miss from ji and Hall pulled it in Wiggins again the Tigers without Jack Clark the transfer from NC State out with illness this is Hunter regaining his footing cant convert shef over the top Burton comes out of The Applause Fray shovels it to Booth lines up the three and knocks it down Marcus bird makes that happen by applying pressure on the initial thrust he gets into the paint where it look like he had a path or not he does makes the defense Shifty and vulnerable finds Carrie boo who gives him a pristine look from Beyond the yard Boos third threepointer makes it a onepoint game wiggin that one bounces Applause out stolen by sheff tigers can take the lead right back driving past ji lays it in and then hits the deck flirting with danger kept a ji on those plays either foul or you give it away you dont kind of do one or the other lucky for ji no whistle tigers by one an offensive foul is called its right call Kevin J moving on the screen trying to open up a look for his shooter in shrewbury Tiger switching on it so they were positioned regardless but j a couple miscues took the three on one possession following sequence moving screen two empty possessions for the Irish third foul on ji only player in our game so far in foul trouble early second half now you got to go down the hall and try and get him his fourth quick double from Davis Around the perimeter Miss from Hunter its good offense take the double kick it out move it get a clean look simply cant puncture it 17 points for Burton to lead the W ji right into Hall offensive foul kevi kevs got understand like thats not his game you got to move the basketball now youre saddled for a while because thats four just going to lower the boom basic move Supreme defensive anticipation for PJ Hall to take that charge and now its becomes his Zona show on his senior night heck of an opportunity for the big fell and thats the fourth Notre Dame turnover of the half they had three all of the first half and ji has not scored and hell sit on the bench with the four personal fouls zonas in for J Clemson has the basketball Gerard unable to find some daylight entry to shefflin thats a tough catch Davis was behind him and Davis picked up the foul CU shein being that seal guy that he is so talented there as the duck in he won the position battle and Tay Davis had no choice but to foul this is a heck of a matchup for Tay Davis gives up a lot in a physicality category defending thats Gerard ripping the ropes for the Tigers right in front of his own bench and what a reaction by his teammates cuz his teammates understand for them to go where they need to go here and get a w on the road theyre going to need the veteran and Sharpshooter and high level scorer in Joe Gerard first points of the night for Gerard Burton rising and firing halfway down and out Zona fights for it and Hall has the save Applause shoy trying to stay with Gerard back out shefflin boo the rebound good high low basketball would love to see sheff give it right back on the repost to Hall cheffin shoots over 50 from Beyond The Arc as you mentioned Jordan one of the most improved players in all of the ACC Ian sheff no question does everything checks so many boxes defensively really works at it best offensive rebound on a team it can score it to Booth again thats a two just inside the line who having himself a game incredibly efficient as well four threes now for the Freshman part of the future and Foundation of this Irish program so 11 points for booth after that jumper other end Hall series of moves against Sona cant convert and a foul coming up against the Tigers three ball has entered the chat here in the second half we called for Joe Gerard and Joe Gerard answers on the out of bounds comes off the curl quick release buckets Shrewsberry everyone expected the three there oh its Carrie boo dialing down I spent a lot of time at that gr saying prayers for my three balls to fall on the nights we played gr won the game the threepoint shot wasnt necessarily kind to me but the grot was always a great place to gather my thoughts and one of the special places on this Notre campus always great to be back as a graduate in 2005 yeah wonderful to be inside for forel Pavilion of the choice Center home of Irish basketball since 1968 wonderful renovation back in 09 back in 2013 that five overtime game and a win against Louisville 104 4 101 one of the amazing contests in this facility Davis on the drive atos where coach Shrewsberry makes his money good little set draw up to get Tate Davison easy tied at Applause 41 everybody reaching at that one hit ball against the Irish a tough entry there to PJ Hall Imes will come in shrewbury goes out hes got five points and has a three to his Music Applause credit Wiggins Paul quick decision long rebound Wiggins preserving The Possession that one kicks straight up in the air can I like the IDE idea PJ always trying to go down low via the bounce pass to shefflin on the low low block that high low game is there for the Tigers high level Awareness on a kick ball to prevent an easy one tigers have won six their last seven games only loss was at home a couple of weeks ago against NC State DJ horn had the gamewinner for the pack which lost this afternoon to North Carolina in Chapel hille shein turn around a tough one front rim Irish have won four their last five including home wins against wake Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech and the only loss was on the road at the Dome where they Trail by 29 in the first half on Jim beheim day and almost came back and won it yeah I mean it just speaks to the culture that coach Shrewsberry is building here that team dors blown off him in the first half but did not give up had a chance at the end on the road and in this five game stretch except being the lone loss this groups really finding out who they are and they are tough out as the tigers are finding out this Saturday evening Booth again rattles the rim its now seven rebounds for shefflin at the other Applause end second three of the game for Applause Gerard he was shut out in the first half in the box score this one is Burton saving it t on the shot clock Davis swooping in Tate Davis spectacular Baseline move Gerard let the defender fly on by and he misses chance for the Irish to regain the lead as we cross the 13minute threshold of the second half Applause shock clock at eight for Applause Burton booth on the handle and the spin everything but the basket for booth Hunter at the other end I like what the tigers are trying to do though theyre trying to speed this game up get those stops then try to run give this game a little bit more of a rhythm because the Irish like to take the air out of the basketball and make this game one of patience and and real discipline Burton driving got tripped up Beetle was defending and he picks up the foul for the Tigers second on Josh beetle shrewbury is going to come back in for Davis Music these are the challenging moments for the Irish when Burton checks out can they keep their head above water as kesn enters the lineup too your primary Handler becomes Logan I Burton out of the game with his 17 points to lead the way for the Irish Booth is also in double digits with 11 IMS from the corner right into the hands of Chase Hunter Hunter Gerard and sheffy combined for 45 wins in the home win against pit on Tuesday 6962 Godfrey Hunter Zona elevates for the Applause rebound 39 of the team shooting for the Irish Zona with the handoff kesn shot clock whittles down to 10 trying to work on Godfrey shury over Beetle tigers have it with Jordan theyre one of their last eight from the floor theyre going to try and play they going to try and play through shein but heres kades hes going to try and H it a lay in on to break Big Time basket not only the Irish keep their head above water they regain the lead defensively in the crowd has come alive here P herself pavil Gerard the chumper from the elbow we to come it Al alive Here Comes Joe Gerard in his second half confident after he got that early three on the out of bounds under now hes really hunting his shot eight points now for Gerard good not not score in the first half was given the Tigers the lead by one closing in on the halfway mark of the second half that pass somehow got to Booth trying to convert Folly ball around to sheflin leading rebounder in the ACC and you see why always around the basketball Gerard dribbling Clinic Beetle down the lane Boo the initial contact and this is exactly what the Irish would hope for shy sheflin runs it down and I dont think I bra Shrewsberry is a sharpshooter but I cant imagine coach wanted a quick shot there theyre trying to save time with Burton on the bench they dont want to take quick ones especially if theyre contested shury now just one of five on threepoint attempts he had been 46 from Beyond The

presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Joe Gerard was shut out in the first half eight points in the second half yeah Joe Gerards really to get going I this guy can score in bunches so its the danger zone for the Irish as we get late game here for both teams uh what hes capable of doing but take DAV his best athlete on the floor him getting downhill is a big part of his game and hes found some success its going to have to be about the elers PJ Hall and Marcus Burt will been great but one of their counterparts colleagues on their side going to do to position them to try and steal one and whats going to be a fun final seven in a Applause hook Davis the sophomore from Indianapolis Indiana with the rim rocker double fisted talked about his athleticism his ability to get downhill coming with momentum and two hand jelly Davis is steel eyes for the rim Paul trying to defend and picking up the foul for Clemson great on Q once again I mean an to Andre Crawford our producer telling a story about Tate Davis and then here he comes again gets to the passing Lane and not scared tries to power up and go right at PJ Hall to earn the whistle Fresh Off The dunk in the pre prior Applause sequence scou Tay Davis really channeling his inner dragon warrior and for more excitement see Kung fua four only in theaters this Applause Friday Davis deserves another scad for his effort in the last couple of minutes check that off the box of things I wouldnt expect to here in a close game double digits now 10 points for Davis all in the second half after he had 11 in the win at home against wake this week on Tuesday Gerard HT in the board Applause and the Irish going to slow it down not not necessarily play not to lose but theyre going to use some clock here and if they find an opportunity to pursue it but this is who theyve been all year burn a lot of clock amplify those possessions Davis again little mismatch with Gerard so Davis at 69 Joe Gerard at 6 two going to assess the foul to Ian shein but Davis back at the free throw line 69 of the year just made a couple moments ago those were her his first two attempts of the Music Applause evening Davis the transfer from Sean Hall 32 games in his lone year with the pirate program he has basically singlehandedly given the Irish the sixpoint lead closing in on 6 minutes to go in regulation this is Hall around J to the rim and a foul call hul to the free throw line and frustration for Ji Applause when PJ Hall makes up his mind that Im going to go get it down low theres no antidote right here Kevin ji relatively physical but just overpowered by The Brute Force of PJ Hall PJ Hall kick it himself he wanted the oldfashioned threepoint play opportunity I like the ruged nature which hes back to attacking at the ri Kevin ji with his Fifth and final foul and its funny how it ends up coming to this Matt Zona whos been through a lot this time here coaching change stayed the course on his senior night with a chance here these final six minutes to have an impact 72nd career game in an Irish uniform Persona with Hall at the three go Applause line sonas got six points in this game on senior night one more free throw for PJ Hall all 80 from the strike of the Season theyre going to extend this defense Clemson try to burn this clock up and speed this game up because they need more possessions Five Points very small deficit but feels bigger in a game where the Irish have the capability of using a lot of clock and operating a little bit slower than most both teams with just seven turnovers in the game shot clock is at seven eyeses against Music Hunter trying to get the shot away this should be high low basketball with sheflin and hall or at least a low post touch from one of the two if not Gerard coming off a threepoint look but I expect Hall to get a touch here good defense from Zona to prevent it got him pushed off the block they wanted to go there they could not shefin double team trying to spin out of it lost the handle out of bounds that should have been off the foot of sheff I believe theyre going to take a look here and discuss they saying Club some basketball we get the luxury of the replay and its going to be yeah thats the right call Tate Davis stuck his foot in the basketball Tate Daviss foot from our angle look like shefflin but Teddy be in the through got that call right shefin by the way has a double double tonight trying to feed Hall shefin and IM and they wrestle their way to the floor hell ball situation and the arrow favors the Irish excessive contact afterwards from shefin surprised theyre not going to take another look bodies hit the floor but watch the extra jab there from shefflin Ill tell you what thats worth another look surprise the crew does not take another look was he protecting himself going down to the floor was he going for a swing I a second thought maybe I got ahead of myself I do believe that right hand was trying to protect himself from the fall it looked aggressive coming at us but sheff was just bracing himself from a fall I mean either way Jordan you can see the intensity of these two team oh no question and sheffers got a motor unlike any other thats why hes a special player why hes had the year he has so I pushed back on that one hes bracing himself from the far 10 points and 11 rebounds for shefflin hes got his eighth double double of the season this is Burton Laing for three to match the jersey Applause number and the biggest lead of the half for either team is eight for the Irish after the threee ball from Burton bra Shrewsberry swings it over to the Freshman Phenom Mr Marcus Burton threepiece Applause nugget he delivers in a massive moment what Ive also noticed Marcus Burton is hes been more animated out there performing today thly comfortable in being the man for the Irish Wiggins backs down and scores Off The Square big bucket for the Tigers sixpoint game Burtons got 20 points leads everybody at that number and the eighth time this season hes gone for 20 or more in this freshman campaign Music Applause buron shot clock at five Burton creating got the shot away over Gerard did not get the bounce and shefflin another rebound Wiggins who scored on the previous possession double team safety valve is Hunter Hunter almost lost the handle in the corner shot clock down to five for Hall takes a quick glance over Zona Hall got the roll what a talented young man composure understanding the clock knew he had to get to a spot made Zoda become a perimeter defender in the touch to give that thing nice little gentle roll off the rim and in 21 points for Hall 11th time this year hes gone for 20 or more he and Burton put on a show Music tonight inside of 3 minutes in regulation hes a lot of dribbling late in the shot clock shrewbury big possession here from the Clemson Applause titles youve gotten buckets from and Hall in their last two trips Gerard misses but thats part of the Irish defensively never give up on to play Im still contest to make the degree of difficulty high on the offering from beond the AR from jard just five of 25 as a team on threepointers in the game for the Tigers Irish double in the post they play without fouling they contest everything Burton cross it over gives it off to D Davis Davis got it to go over the defensive Hall acrobatics here it B on Senor and I T Davis deliver and now two minutes to go in regulation the turn around is Good from Chase Hunter Clemson has to be thinking stops and its going to start with trying to keep Marcus Burton in front 20 for Burton 14 for Davis 11 for Booth with three players in double figures for the Irish five on the shot clock for Shrewsbury for three and it cans it Paul shefin deflected into the corner Gerard got there thatll be Tiger basketball they are going to take a look at that inside a 2 minutes to go in regulation long time ago felt like the pi of the Season bra Shrewsberry couldnt buy a bucket now hes become one of the best Shooters in all of the ACC and delivers a big time one for distance one of the recognizable and signature spots on campus first cell Pavilion tonight not too either Jord cornette yeah this place is is rocking right now because this Notre Dame team one that weve covered all year long has hit their groove and are on the precipice of winning five of six if they can get it done here in these final 73 seconds theyve been locked in defensively theyve gotten efforts from a few guys Tate gavis has been strong but this a Tigers team that will not give up buckle up for the final 70 seconds Gerard and now Hall over Sona rolls off and Sona rips it down one minute to go hunter reaches in second on Music Applause Hunter five team fouls for each team at the moment thats going to be the six team foul against the Tigers on the hunter reaching they get it to Davis and shefflin and Wiggins Converge on Applause Davis fourth on shein dont forget our final CW courtside Saturday coming up next week as we wrap up the regular season of the ACC Irish eight dat at home this season four and five in conference play if they win tonight its going to be their seventh ACC win of the Year much improved from a season ago considering he didnt have a roster when he took the job lost 99 of his scoring from the year prior and he entered this game what coach Shrewsberry has done to this point is nothing short of masterful and people could call me crazy but this guy should be garnering votes in the coach the year conversation for the uphill climb of what hes had to do here should he get the award no should he Garner attention for it without question lost their top seven scorers from a season ago Hunter misses shein grabs it trying to keep hope alive for the Tigers and thats Gerard fouled in the corner Davis was the closest Defender Big Time mistake overzealous activity if T Davis there of course you want to contested a sharpshooter Gerard but its imperative he played Without fouling at this Junction throw three guys come in you made the space you got to allow the shooter to land not only that there was contact as he was elevating and coming down first free throw of the game for Joe Gerard prior to that free throw he was 95 of one 100 from the free throw line not surprisingly top free throw shooter in the ACC by percentage and one of the best in the history of the confence after four years in Syracuse and the transfer coms from this year one more for Gerard its Music automatic he makes this one and its a twopossession game Jordan with 39 seconds to go and a whole lot of time left time a whole lot of time youre absolutely right thats what he does 6660 after the free throws from Gerard and Beetle will come in Gerard with 11 second half points Davis with 16 second half points for the Irish pressure from the Tigers Hunter and Wiggins on the double timeout called by eyes the position Is caught the basketball not the most confident of handlers right move to call the timeout these final 36 seconds you want Marcus bur with basketball the blur he is its a challenge to foul a guy like that hes a running back with the basketball absolute blur so the set drawn out here for the Irish will without question be give the ball to the Freshman Fen out Marcus B both teams have two timeouts remaining as we take a look at our player of the game its brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home more motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom Tom its got to be the everling motor of the Freshman super star Marcus Burton he got the three ball going at one point couple of times hes been able to get downhill defense is struggle to keep in front hes got that painted area hes distributed a couple times four assists but the rebounds even battled on the backboard getting six rebounds but its been timely play after timely play look when you come in here as an opponent you understand the head of the state is Marcus Burton youre throwing a catchen in sink at the young man hes only a freshman and yet he is driving every time out there on the floor its remarkable its very fun to watch probably should have known reminds me a lot of Chris Thomas yeah should have known when he scored 29 in his first ever game against Niagara School record for a debut by a freshman its a great Point Tom but then you go for 31 vers W can you turn around and do this its its incredible foul finally committed by by Wiggins against Davis third on Music Wiggins with Davis at the free throw line Burton 2831 and 20 points tonight in his last three games and how about the second half for Tay Davis and he still hasnt missed the free throw seven for seven Ira shot it well from the stripe in the win Tuesday against wake they were 19 of 22 from the free throw line another one for Davis the lead is eight time running out of the Tigers Hall feads the three does not get it shuby comes flying in and saves it to Davis up ahead Burton 15 seconds to go Gerard fouls Burton Standing Ovation from the assembled crowd at purcel Pavilion for the Irish and especially for their senior group really cool for a young man like Matt Zona stay the course here trust that there be a home for him to come play it was going to be an uphill climb here in the year of the portal where he can go find an opportunity somewhere Matt Zona likes to stay and its for a moment like this for that senior thats pretty cool fellow senior Tony Sanders Jr also into the game number 12 in white Burton at the free throw line 21 points for Burton Zona to the bench and a lot of congratulations from his teammates and coaching Applause staff final 10 seconds Wiggins races to the rim for the dunk 69 62 83 seconds to Applause go and that will do it final seconds take away and its an Irish win on senior night 69 62 incredible performance this Irish team at
