good opportunity to win on the road Etsy state in white Pit in the road blue we are underway here in Raleigh Wednesday night in the ACC and its the wolf pack that start with the basketball Michael O Connell on the top of the floor number 12 and white getting his third consecutive start running the offense for Kevin Keats since the wolf pack have moved to the four guards and DJ Burns starting lineup theyve won two straight trying to make it three and a and its Burns who opens the scoring its a tough match up for anybody on DJ Burns in a oneonone into the era of fifth and sixth year seniors in transfer portal Jeff cable has two freshman in his starting lineups both in the back court lob to feder Rico Off the Mark like most teams in the ACCC they try to put DJ Burns in multiple combination ball screen offense here is is going to score it first Oh I thought he was going to score first it rolled around but did not drop he has to be aggressive on the offensive end to make up for the drop coverage that hes going to play in on the defensive end offensive rebound Hinson Second Chance Hinson hes not shy to let it fly and thats why this is the best threepoint shooter in the ACC in terms of makes he is fifth in the league in percentage morcel trying to answer with a triple cant connect transition defense for both teams would be really important and theres Hinson again oh that rolled around but it was halfway down but didnt fall hes feeling it early hes always looking to score that guy is their top scorer one of the best scorers in the ACC at 18 points a game Im talking about Blake Hinson horn another hot hand bar is his first attempt to the Ball Game 623 third most in the ACC DJ horn is the reigning player of the week in the conference his confidence on the offensive end just keeps growing for NC State heres jayen low the floater falls for the freshman hes come on really strong 11 points per game in ACC play to join Carrington as the two freshman in the back court for pit theres this Iverson cut and then goes into a ball screen fto Rico jumping out on a hedge good recovery though by Carrington n seconds to shoot heres Jaden Taylor in attack mod pull up pop left it short this is a pit team that rebounds the ball really well 75 on the defensive end which means its not its not an up the line over playing cover theyre in the gaps their ball screen coverage is underneath and they do a good job of rebounding Henson into traffic draws the foul both of these teams Debbie play with such great Tempo that transition defense is such a key tonight I think thats the most important key for both teams you got to find number two if youre NC State Blake Hinson going to the free throw line weve already seen him knocked down a contested triple and hes got incredible range and whats incredible as you take a look at his made threes this year and hes a catch and shoot guy everybody knows it and you still cant stop him with range I watched every one of his three point makes on Synergy and hes got 57 catch and shoot and 17 dribbles to score those 74 and we already saw one catch and shoot three hes quick to get into his rhythm and you got to find him early in transition hes at the top of every single scouting report and yet he continues to deliver much like Burns kick out o Connell he cant connect from Deep if you can double and make DJ Burns keep the ball on the same side of the floor your defense is already loaded up to that side its playing their best basketball the season theyve won four of their last five Carrington making it look easy really nice 45 cut is what that is from the weak side its the 45° angle and its a great cut in good timing Burns trying to bully his way in and he does hes so skilled when he can get to that right shoulder with that strong left finish Music low usually a master of the mid game missed that one heres burns the crossover DJ Burns hes been super aggressive tonight draws the foul there hell be at the line when we come back as were just getting started here in Raleigh ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by kard go and if they have strong februaries are on the bubble right now bolster that resume and get in again absolutely I mean these are two teams that have plenty of quad one opportunities in front of them pit has proven to be a very good road team because their guard play has been outstanding when you look at what the bracket would look like at the ACC tournament today NC State getting that double bu which every coach in the league will tell you is so critical to having an opportunity to win you think about that the wolf pack sitting seven and4 in conference play the number four team if the tournament started today theyd get that double bu and yet Kevin Keats is worried about Bracketology and the bubble you got to take care of business right pit comes in here 4 two in True Road games Kevin Keat knows how important winning at home is and theyve played well here theyve won the last two games at home they beat Miami they beat Georgia Tech great press break Carrington way too easy hammers it home thats how you break the Press huh yeah and poor execution like you cant let the ball get behind you a pit team playing with a lot of confidence theyve won four of their last five playing their best basketball here in February they show some Zone they can keep stringing them together particularly on the road they will go back to the NCAA tournament backto back years NC State trying to do the same great hustle Debbie almost had it here oconnell swiped it right to our broadcast location Debbie I thought you were going to take the charge well I was getting ready to shoot it Ill be honest with you but this is Carrington who Gets behind the NC State Defense and thats not just breaking a pressure thats attacking it so lets see when NC State will come back with the situational press its just a onetime press both these coaches are very prepared to weak change and dig a little deeper into their offensive bag Hinson lines up a three and drills it Blake hon hes already got two triples I mean hes 42 outside the arc hes a tremendous catch and shoot hes getting those threes out of the quarter Court offense he has eight of pitch 14 Applause Music early Morel before he got the shot up bble this is excellent ball movement Carrington gets a piece of the paint Hinson just spots up Carrington collapses the NC State Defense and swings it because carington is so good at get making those plays with his 66 frame dont you watch pit and you just see a team playing with a lot of confidence right now absolutely I mean theyve got rib protection theyre very good defensively they understand their roles they got a goto guy in Hinson who can make shots and theyve got two guards in the back court that are really starting to play theyve opened up an eightpoint lead here seven nothing run theyve made three straight and remember this is a pit team that went into Cameron and beat Duke very confident Road team middle Brooks count it plus the foul Ben middle Brooks this is a nice pick and roll right here middle of the floor wide open Shooters on the weak side and pit maybe a little hugged up on the weak side allowing Middlebrooks a wide open Lane to the rim and he converts the and one here comes a press off of free throws usually it gives teams trouble particularly in this building but pit has been breaking in with ease so far tonight and the Panthers shooting six of 10 to start the game Henson lost his footing got it off to G mod Diaz Graham first who draws the Music foul Kevin Keats so good in this building take a look at the last two seasons was 26 and four at home one of those four losses though a year ago to this pit team so Blake hon knows what its like to win in this building was part of that NCAA tournament team a year ago for the Music Panthers G Mo playing without his brother who is his twin whos out with an ankle injury hes done for for the rest of the year so the front line is a little bit smaller or or I should say not smaller theyre seven Footers out there theres a little less depth in the front line heres Dennis Parker into the Applause game Taylor recovers it 10 seconds to shoot poach from behind this time pick comes up with it got to stop the ball l oh takes it himself and hits it jayen Low Time Out Kevin Keats pit a ninepoint lead on the road here in Music Raleigh hit Panther resume so far here in 2024 Debbie Antonelli J alter with you you almost have to separate November and December and now January and February cuz he has such a young team lost so much talent off the team that went to the tournament a year ago they are playing as good basketball as anybody particularly on the road here in February yeah theres no question about it I mean coach cable coach of the year last year in this league and this is a team those guards I saw him practice in September the big question mark he had was what kind of pace can we play how quickly will they adjust well Carrington and low have done a fantastic job of adjusting to Pace in the ACC horn triggers the three Off the Mark battle for the offensive board foul called against is legged so itll stay with the wol Applause p is Leed a player that has given Jeff cable double figures Off the Bench the last or in 16 games last five hes been uh almost 15 points a game off the Music bench oh heres horn gives it up for Mid Brooks an NC State team thats still trying to find their Rhythm tonight offensively just four of 10 to start middle Brooks has done well getting inside though doing a really good job of getting into the chest of guo Diaz Graham and using the rim so that he cant block a Music shot a really good shot blocking team good Rim Presence by Music pit Lows been calling his own number a lot tonight that doesnt fall though Jeff does a really good job of finding DJ horn in transition early midd Brooks again missed it bounces out to leet here leg spinning his way to the rim great move in transition really quick pit has done a nice job of pushing the ball setting the pace because they are tremendous defensive rebounding Music Music team theres Parker pull up pop missed it it seems really dialed in defensively right now yeah and theyre really good defensively on the glass you see NC States not even sending anybody to the old boards theyre getting back in Music transition Carrington nobody picked him up Bub Carrington and the Panthers up 11 now on the road just a lack of awareness on the weak Side by NC States defense and a really good take by carington NC State needing something go back to Middle Brooks and hes delivered he has seven of the wolf pack 15 really good Vision by oconnell as well they go twom man naked side Shooters on the opposite side right now pits doing a really good job on DJ horn theyre not really letting him get a catch hes going to have to catch fire here for NC State back door open Jeffers runs through it everything but the Finish back to Middle Brooks wi not hes had the hot hand and he draws the Music foul Ben midd Brooks at the line when we come back but right now it is all Pittsburgh the Panthers leading by nine on the Music road speaking with Wolfpack head coach Kevin Keats before the game he said in wins this year weve done it with defense third in the AC see its scoring defense theyve held 16 teams this season below their scoring average well tonight here at home Pittsburg shooting 60 from the floor theyve already scored 24 points 10 minutes into this contest yeah I mean pit is running their stuff theyre accelerating through their sets when theyre in the quarter Court theyre getting some buckets in transition and Blake Hinson has already got two triples in the game and for NC State I was that practice yesterday they havent followed the defensive Scout yet that Kevin Keats laid out for them they got a no personnel theyve got to help on the weak side and they got to be locked in in the gaps theyre not getting back in transition and theyve only turned the ball over two times but Pits been able to push off those twoos two turnovers so NC States got to get locked in on the defensive end right here and the Wolf Pack theyve yet to force a turnover 10 minutes into this game its been relatively easy for pit Music offensively see State going with a bigger lineup on the floor with middle Brooks and diara and theyre switching one through five low lobs it up Diaz Graham couldnt finish Music it stays with the Music Music Panthers Applause some teams switch to contain NC State is switching to Steel right now theyre trying to get out on the passing Lan carington missfires Applause NC State we just talked about the defense they get a stop there now can they string a couple together and get some makes on the offensive Music end diara right into Hinson kicks it out Taylor S seconds to shoot DJ horn grimacing a little bit Taylor has to hoist it shot clock was winding down and youre right about horn hes trying to shake something off here at the top of the threepoint line middle of the Court zero in white Hinson meanwhile going into a double team and he travels now what a terrific slate this Saturday on ESPN and its highlighted by a Sonic Blockbuster in the Big 12 Baylor and Kansas that Saturday 6 Eastern Time on ESPN always a fun environment fog Allen and uh let me just say this about Blake Hinson as good of a threepoint shooter as he is Jay he has 14 total assists on the season in 22 games okay hes got two assists in the game right now hes looking to be more balanced in distributing the basketball usually he goes to the paint to score and thats the way people defend him Burns back into the game spinning through a triple team and he beats them all to put it up and in hes got such quick footwork so you got to mix up when you bring the health when you bring the double the points in the paint the name of the game right now for NC State and kenin Keats is rotating through we going back to the big lineup again rotating through that Five Spot trying to get some consistency there theyre going to call foul right here on Taylor the first on the transfer from Butler sends Bob Carrington to the line Carrington swipes it through low not sure hes got him on the elbow Carrington up to seven points tonight he Sports the number seven and when you take a look at freshman in the ACC my vote right now would go to bub Carrington for freshman of the Year well hes been fantastic and he also provides on the right side of the stat sheet of the box score rebounds assist steals hes got the full floor game hes already had a triple double for Jeff Music C he really does it all for this pit team and his leadership just a freshman you can see the energy and the respect that his teammates have for him you got a cut off the entry to DJ burns look how everyone reacts to him you got to go swing swing off that pass offensive rebound diara keeps it alive kicked out horn a three and he buries It DJ horn one of the hottest hands in the ACC well hinsons made the most threes in the ACC horns made the third Applause most leg it kept the dribble alive doesnt Applause Music fall diara lines it up and it rims out it was halfway down probably not the first option on the first pass though Jay you got to move the ball you got to make the defense work would you say that if it dropped well if it goes in I but I I dont think its a a good habit on the offensive Music end Ive never heard you say not shoot it youre always about shooting not on the first pass thats true lagin trying to muscle through morcel lost the handle up ahead horn he has a mismatch here decides to shoot and drills It DJ horn backto back triples cuts the lead in half well hes earned the right to shoot it whenever he wants it to shoot Applause it horn doing a good job of playing off the switch knocking down the backto back threes and NC States got a little little momentum a pit led by as many as 11ed this first half ncate has shrunk the lead to three Debbie antelli how the wolf pack on it how about a little dj horn with some threes is whats done it hes made three out of four and he looks good shooting them and hes getting into Rhythm which is not a good sign for pit and pit has gone cold offensively theyve missed five in a row here theres Hinson step back Blake Hinson nothing but the bottom of the net hes so good Jeff C can put him anywhere on the floor and he could be successful and that was a long two so at least diara ran him off the threepoint line first made field goal in nearly five minutes for Pittsburgh Burns trying to answer and he does TJ burns up to nine points so a really good set that Kevin Keats hadnt run yet a little ghost action up on top and then you get Burns in the short Corner hes terrific behind the defense when he operates out of that short Music Corner Carrington in attack mode leaves it for feder Rico feder Rico puts it up and in you have to stay home on the shooters for pit so a little Twan game where they clear it out thats a great delivery by Carrington he can get to the paint anytime he wants hes so good off the Music bounce morcel perals it leaves it for diara he puts it in really nice Cut working without the basketball andc stay pulling bringing more pressure I think theyve changed the rhythm of their offense because theyve also been able to pick up their Tempo on the defensive end sometimes thats how you can stimulate your offense hon for three missed it that time usually hes Music automatic hor and a transition triple too much on it this could turn into a ThreePoint Shootout between those two guys thats all right with me theyre so good fun to Music watch Music 5 Seconds to shoot the Freshman low in trouble and he Music traveled weve got a terrific womens basketball match up for you Thursday 6 Eastern Time on ESPN number 12 do dame taking on 15th ranked Louisville how good is the ACC and womens hoops this year well theres nine teams seated did not on the bubble on the womens side no other league has that and theres a big game here in Raleigh tomorrow night as well Virginia Tech comes back into town and NC State and Virginia Tech both on the top of the standings with Louisville on the womens side horn buries it and ties it at 30 and thats where Burns is so dangerous on the skip crosscourt when you dont mix up how you bring the double to him he sees the floor so well what a great Target too four triple for DJ horn NC state has a erased in 11o Applause deficit foul called on Casey Morel close competitive game NC state has thrown a counter punch here if you bring that double and make him a passer you cant let him see to the other side of the floor DJ horn knocking down his for triple nobodys happier than burds DJ horn well it helps from one of the best threepoint Shooters in the ACC starts to get hot he shoots 42 outside the ark hes got four triples he is hunting his own shot all first half and it has paid off for NC State its helped them dig back in this game to tie it up at 30 and look at the last 15 games shooting 46 out of the timeout kinson thats exactly what pit needed he had the hot hand early but only two points in the last seven minutes before that triple you have to absolutely run him off the threepoint line hes going to make some tough ones and you can live with it but coming off a dead ball timeout atto and a sideline out of bound or Baseline out of bounds and you let him get that look heres Burns 5 Seconds to shoot DJ Birds missed it bounces to leg it and Horn commits the foul in transition thats his Music second Baseline out of bounds off a Music timeout Casey morels got to have better discipline than that cant take that shot fake and he dribbled so usually hes a catch and shoot guy like we told you earlier that Three Fires hit back in front hon leads the Panthers with 13 thats the catch and shoot didnt have the angle but trailer did a great job on him or was Taylor excuse me he was on his hip blocking Trail off the screen and was right there to Music contest so this time no double from pit feder Rico trying to stand him up Burns couldnt quite spin his way free there thats why Jeff cable mixes it up on them you got to keep DJ Burns off balance low a transition three nothing but the bottom of the net backto back threes for pit when you come across the three the midcourt line transition defense you have to match up you cant run to the paint you got to L Shooters Beyond The Music Arc usually in transition Jay you sprint back to the paint and then you find a matchup well not when youre playing pit wide open and transition the Lefty does a nice job sticking it from outside the three it lows up to nine The Freshman averaging 11 in ACC play hes really emerged over the course of this season Music hit who started this game shooting nine from 13 from the floor built an 11point lead then went cold starting to find their offensive rhythm again Carrington slides called for the travel that is backto back brilliant defensive efforts by Jaylen Taylor because feder Rico sets the high ball screen and rolls hes only going to roll and Taylor gives him a bump and then he gets back back out to his matchup he does a terrific job of playing his position really well on Music Music defense diara right into Hinson and then got caught between a shot and a Music Applause pass maybe Dr trying to do a little too much much Kevin keth showing a lot of patience over there since his team tied this game at 30 theyre on a three minute scoring drought thats allowed pit to regain the lead Federico Federico into the double team diara swaps it away stays pit ball feder Rico for pit does his job really well and at The Rim hes got a finish this right there hes a rim roll Rim roller a rim Runner they put back in a drop drop off guy hes not going to make a post move but when he catches it on the move he can finish those shots Music typically low has a step on middle Brook so crafty gets to the rim well diara on the strong side cant come off and help so the helps got to come from the other side of the floor and thats great spacing by Music Applause pit pit trying to end his first half on an eight nothing run since the wolf pack tied to to 30 got to go down to 5 Seconds oconnell dispossessed by low heres the Freshman beating the buzzer it was good as it went jayen low terrific first half what a doo is going to have to be better yeah these were two tournament teams a year ago February all about bolstering that NCAA tournament resume two teams very much on the bubble this would be a critical Conference win for either one of these teams both teams tonight came in riding two game win streaks so pit trying to make it three in a row and get a vital Road win jayen low had a terrific first half and he picks up where he left off jayen low this freshman coming on strong hes got 13 points tonight I mean pit does such a good job of spacing accelerating changing their space and Pace moving the ball they ended the half not bringing a double to DJ Burns and feder Rico Federico is whyde blocks it there he has stood tall low and one he just floated it up there and the Freshman gets it to fall plus the foul in transition thats called a Euro what balance to be able to finish incredible first half and he starts the second half off on fire he is now pits leading scorer tonight this is the largest lead of the game for either team at 13 so the last two times the balls gone to the block hit has not brought a double to DJ Burns that let him keep going to work in that match up if I was Kevin ke you know he can score on that they go right back to Burns and he delivers right on Q Deb well they got a switch and DJ Burns do a good job of coming away from the Block and then diving back down good assist by the wolf pth Burns has 11 all of them in the paint edsy state has half of their scoring in the paint a lot of that middle Brooks and burns when they were building momentum in the first half it was because they were pounding it inside working through Burns and middle Brooks they had kind of went away from that well and pit on this end right here in for NC State you cant just guard the action you got to guard the ball okay just just because you see the screen coming trying to jump on top of it oconnell that time gave Carrington a direct line drive to the Music Applause rim our NBA Saturday Prime Time match up on ABC and the ESPN app is Devin Booker and the Suns taking off Steph Curry and the Warriors coverage tips off with NBA Countdown 8 Eastern time five Pacific how about this freshman back court for pits giving Pittsburgh the largest lead in the Music game to to start two freshman guards in the ACC is a tough task and yet Jeff Capel has coached them up they have come through for him just like DJ Burns continues to deliver for NC State he has 13 to lead the pack well NC State down double digits in the first half this is part of the way they got back in it see again oconnell got to guard the ball not the action keep the ball in Music Applause front Burns rips it away from Carrington who commits the foul I tell you what Taylor is blowing up stuff on the defensive end for NC State this is a nice Rim roll and delivery by oconnell and then look at Taylor right in the mix on all that burms like a defensive tackle going for the fumble hes not afraid to put his body on the line no hes not hes not afraid to hit the deck for a loose Music ball okell all the way to the rim missed it okell calling for a go that was a really good read by oconnell that time you just got to finish that play did he get a piece of that Above the Rim the ball was on the way up its good no call by the officials that drops in plus the foul for DJ horn hes been the king of the threepointer tonight now he can get one the oldfashioned Music way Music Music cant Music convert so the lead stays at nine for pit has been on the back of these two freshman guards Carrington and low Micks in a little Blake Hinson as well heres Hinson see more so you got to go over the top of that screening action and you got to really work to close the space on Henson jayid low Applause misfired trying to squeeze it through the back door to no avail there to Taylor Applause NC States going to have to pick up their body language their energy all of that right now to get back in this right it feel like theres a a little dip in the game not for pit though well usually in this building you can count on a ton of energy a ton of defensive pressure from Kevin keatss team and it has felt a little flat part of that is is the way Pitt has really controlled this game Panthers have led by as many as 13 in the drivers seat here on the road Hinson eyes on the timer 5 Seconds to shoot squeezes it to Carrington for an open three missed Applause it up ahead o Connell maybe the wolf tack can get something in transition and they do Michael ell first bucket of the Night for Michael oconnell and I think one of the first transition buckets for NC Music State NC States defense has been much more disruptive the last couple of possessions just more aggressive on this end of the floor Carrington wave off the basket called for an offensive foul Jeff cable not happy we watch the transition game when you defensive rebound and your guards get on the glass you can push a lot faster good Advanced pass by horn good finish by okell theres the push off see NC States defense made Carrington dribble that entire possession and thats the third foul on bub Carrington so he has to come out of the Music game its fallen into scoring drought for the last 2 minutes and 30 seconds its allowed the wolf pack to go on a mini 6 nothing run horn looking for more how did he do it you know what he is so good Jay off that Iverson action into a ball screen where he can get enough separation off the bounce with his quick bounce off and his quick dribble hes so explosive the body control to get that up and in Kevin Keats wanted a 10sec violation called see pit is late getting into their stuff right here into the three missed it offensive rebound second chance Zack Austin lines it up and drills it thats a big bucket for Zack Aus the North Carolina native with his first made basket of the night and its a huge Applause Music three that three ended an 8 nothing NC State run W pack in a much better Rhythm offensively horn misses the Music three DJ horn moves so well without the ball Applause foul called on middle Brooks jayen Low in control hit leads by eight Jaylen low controlling the ground and so is DJ horn with a little contact he handles and finishes and then off the offensive rebound Zach Austin sticks it eightpoint pit lead Monday night here in Raleigh was the 19th annual play for k game celebrating the life of

fight now here at PNC Arena two nights later NC State trailing by 10 Pittsburgh on the back of their two talented freshman jayen low and Bob Carrington in control DJ horn hes got something to say about it his fifth triple of the night hes got 19 DJ horn you shoot to your arm falls off young man you are hot from outside the yard 66 threes made on the season third most in the ACC five of those coming tonight foul called on midd Brooks so going to break we talked about how low controls the ground thats an example of it right there he attacks the Hedge and the outside hip deflection by pit and his fifth trip pulled by horn and look at DJ Burns he loves Music Applause Music it heres low a game high 18 look how low he plays the game now this time he turns it over leot gets it right back is Leed how about the Hustle but he couldnt finish it Middlebrooks swiped it well Ben Middlebrooks has done a good job with his minutes tonight Off the Bench hes drawn some fouls on the front line hes done a nice job of playing his role then here Le it with a steel and look look at the Hustle by Middlebrook to get back and allow NC State to set their defense and Blake Hinson lost the handle hes only attempted one shot in this second half usually he is not shy to let it fly but hes letting the guards operate right now hes passed the ball more than he usually passes thats all right we got plenty of time left for him to let some get some shots up heres horn hes got the hot hand maybe the hottest hand in all of the Music ACC middle Brooks had seven points of the first tap thats his first bucket of the second when you go against DJ Burns every day in practice you learn learn how to score around the Applause Music rim in the oneonone against the sevenfooter you got to get into his body because hes a shot blocker its exactly what Ben Middlebrooks does its a great finish with his off hand who was it off of last they say it stay pits way home fans dont like it neither does Kevin Keats 26 seconds 6 seconds to get the ball over the Applause Music timeline Taylor did get a touch on it low squeezes it in Diaz Graham rocks the rim the acceleration the eyes to the rim Diaz Graham Gets behind the NC State Defense Music Bill Brooks cross the foul hell Ben Middlebrooks DJ Burns and DJ horn those three have combined for 41 of the wolf packs 45 its really just been those three producing on the offensive end tonight and middle Brooks has drawn four fouls on the Pittsburgh defense Carrington still is back in the line up with with those three fouls DJ horn is playing with three fouls diara rejected from behind Carrington risky to go for that with three fouls but he pulled it off cleanly that was Blake hson really did a good job of welling up hes done a lot of other things tonight besides score and not just a shooter the extra pass finds Le cant hit it diara wins the ball back but uncomfortably what does the wolf pack need to do here down seven I think you keep running stuff for DJ horn until he gets tired I mean honestly hes been so Music good has it here keep putting him in ball screen action Music calls for a back lines it up is fired that Music time Diaz Graham finds leg it hes had two really good looks from there missed him both fancy handling from oconnell Casey morels been quiet tonight yet to score fade away that falls Casey Morel first bucket of the night and its a big one NC state has shaved eight points off pits 13point lead the wolf pack right back in it when youre great in NC State this has all the makings of another fun finish in the ACC everybody wants to talk Bracketology here in February I I I would be shocked if the ACC gets less than five I think this is a six bid league if not more Debbie what do you think I mean I agree with you North Carolina fell off the one line with their lost to Clemson last night I think these two teams were tournament teams last year theres a lot of games left to be played Wake Forest I still say is going to to determine who wins this league Ive been saying it all season because I think that much about Steve Forbes team and getting deari Monsanto back whos an incredible three Point threat so theres 11 teams that are on the quote unquote bubble in the ACC and that makes it competitive each and every night two of these teams are both on it battling here in what is a critical conference contest DJ horn explodes to the rim draws the foul everything working through horn right now this is why when you get a stop and you run the floor hard you create matchup issues in transition and NC States keeping the pressure on right now I thought the NC States defense has been disruptive theyve forced pit late into the shot clock in their possessions thats how theyre coming back in the game Pits got to do a better job of moving the ball against the pressure outstanding slate of games this Saturday on ESPN it all starts with college game day at 1100 am eastern time and it are featured Sonic Blockbuster Kansas and Baylor thats six eastern time you dont want to miss whatll be another terrific Saturday here on ESPN third straight game for DJ horn with 20 points or more and he has pulled the wolf pack back within three they trailed by as many as 13 Kevin Keat has played with two big a good portion of the game tonight hes going back to the four guard lineup Henson when pit needs a bucket they usually Look to Him missed it that Applause Music time forel off balance Miss H they say it bounced off moreell last so pit basketball you know NC State needs to just keep hitting singles right here not try to go for the home run right just move the ball cut pass get pit in rotation theyve got it to a one possession game now Pits got to show some maturity right here on the road remember they are a 42 team on the road including a big win right down the road at Cameron indor against Duke a couple of weeks Music ago Music comes the legate ball screen he can hit that three missed it though got a good look Diaz gr middle Brooks right into traffic no call Carrington pull up pop cant hit it pits getting some good looks but theyve missed five in a row a scoring drought of more than 3 minutes here way when you have a tendency when you get deep into the shot clock to look to take a quicker shot so you dont have to go against the pressure of NC State you got to find that balance for the tie horn cant connect and a foul called on the floor Diaz Graham pulling down middle Brooks and pit has fallen ice cold at the wrong time theyve made two of their just two of their last 10 missed five in a row its allowed NC State to make this a one possession game and the one thing about pit is they have a goto guy when adversity hits when theyre under duress its Blake Hinson so hes got to look for the ball a little bit more and they got to find him into Burns great defense feder Rico feder Rico his second block on burds tonight and burds commits the frustration foul right after this is great de this is this is a one of the best shot blockers in the ACC pit leads the league in Block shots he stands DJ burns up and does a great job of not fouling and burns picks up his second foul J two fouls for DJ Burns hes not going to play the rest of the N9 minutes hes got to stay aggressive on the floor with his minutes Parker bumped leg it the foul starting to pile up here pit enters the bonus and will be shooting one and one the rest of the way thats a long time 924 remaining on the clock to be shooting on every Applause foul Applause legot makes the front end pit is a perfect 12 for 12 from the foul line Music tonight Le it knocks them both down thats going to be a weapon for pit in the bonus the rest of the way in a good foul shooting team well NC state has been really good at applying pressure and trying to get pit off balance and pit just keeps responding got to keep cutting on the weak side bird spinning his way free that time he got the better of feder Rico he gets to that right shoulder forget about it I me he is going to score pit is not bringing a double and they havent brought the double all second half they did bring the double team some in the Music first legot trying to back his way down dumps it to feder Rico back up top Carrington pull up pop caring 10 Off the Mark no good Freon pass doing a good job with his minutes on the defensive Applause end right back to Birds everything going through DJ Burns right now and next wide too easy so lets see what Jeff cable does next time because Kevin Keats is going to throw it right back in there Carrington draws contact and a foul called see this is not dj Burnss fault Brion pass has got to keep the ball in front of him you cant keep getting to the second level burns with the off hand just buries him DJ burns with the home fans dont like the call Applause Carrington with a chorus of booze knocks down to First unfaced playing with his three fouls you see the trust that Jeff capable has put in his hands to run the Applause team car it buries them both pit now shooting a perfect 15 for 15 from the line and they regain their threepoint lead still a one possession game under eight minutes to play into Applause Burns here comes a double this time passes out of it Hees up morcel for a three and he drills it to tie it at 56 smart play by DJ Burns hes too good of a passer he knew the double was coming he knew pit had to change what they were doing low trying to find something 5 seconds on the shot clock leg it hoists the three cant connect and a foul called again against the Panthers all the momentum with NC State right now Debbie you play DJ Burns in single coverage he punishes You by backing you in the paint when you bring the double he sees you go Swing Swing bucket wolfb we got a Music game okay so Dominos Perfect combo includes two medium one topping pizzas 16 Parmesan bread bites eight the ACC tied at 56 with 706 seven left to play Dennis Parker Jr at the line and he missed it NC state has erased a double digit deficit twice tonight pit has led by 11 NC State rally back tied it at 30 then pit built the lead back to 13 NC State rallied once more to tie it at Music 56 offensive rebound feder Rico shoved both teams in the bonus so we are shooting the rest of the way on fou well be ready to rebound cuz feder Rico is only a 41 free throw shooter and NC State is four of nine from the free throw line well pit has made all of theirs 15 for Applause 15 and he misses the front end so even though NC State we just mentioned is Rally to tie it their last lead was all the way back when it was 5 to three so they have trailed the majority of this game and they get the lead Music Applause here burds into double coverage and fires the wolf pack in front hes got 19 I think Kevin keatss lineup here with the four guards has been part of the reason why theyve been able to come back because DJ Burns is getting hot on the Block and DJ horn is stayed hot the pass is getting his minutes right now low way over the head of Blake Hinson low went too high there turnover isolated oneonone he just backs feder Rico into the paint what do you figure Burns has got 50 lbs on feder Rico easily maybe 75 Music the way its listed hes got 50 but it does look like more spinning his way in everything but the finish for Applause Music Birds DJ burns with 19 jayen Mo has it here for pit he has 18 to lead the Panthers too shy of a career high poked out of bounds stay pit ball underneath their own hoop yeah DJ Burns is asking for a sub and you know it Kevin Keats has done a really good job of managing DJ Burnss minutes especially here on a defensive possession take them out let him sit get them back in on offense when you can hson hes been quiet in the second half goes r right in and muscles that home to tie at Music Applause 58 mid Brook straight cut fou called and hell go to the line for two you know this is where Blake Hinson is smart right here hes not giving up Bay up thats his first foul now make middle Brooks earn it its a smart Applause play midd Brooks missed it stays tied at 58 on Saturday you dont want to miss the wol pack at Wake Forest that is a great game on acc Network for Eastern time and then Georgia Tech at Boston College to follow thats Saturday on the ACC midd Brooks missed them both the foul shooting struggles continue for the wolf pack four of 11 from the foul line where pit is 15 of 16 thats the difference in this Applause Music game low somehow keeps it together leg it through two lays it up and in pit back Music up Applause Music horn always a threat to let it fly goes in and hits it to tie it at 60 thats a tough two right there 23 points tonight for DJ horn Applause Dennis Parkers got his hands full right here chasing Blake Hinson hes got to deny him on a Applause catch Federico Federico takes it in the middle Brooks swiped away tied at 60 in a critical conference game in the ACC a fun finish coming at PNC Arena animated Kevin Keats huddle during the TV time out his team has erased a 13point deficit in this second half tied at 60 and youd argue Debbie theyve got the momentum here in the final four minutes of Regulation yeah but that man right there Blake Hinson has only taken four shots in the second half and I believe hes going to help pit finish off this game here on the road if theyre going to win hes going to have to be able to be more assertive they get it into hson fires rattled in and out no good a second effort missed it again third times the charm is legged in perfect position to grab it put it up and in hit back in Music Applause Music front fto Rico jumps way out on that screen and they dont tag the roller fast enough but NC State is able to move the ball its a good decision by middle Brooks he had nothing going there oconnell lost the handle kicks it out Parker a three cant connect but it bounces off of Leed so itll stay Wolfpack ball a fresh shot clock at 20 and DJ Burns checking back into the game for NC Music State officials got something on the floor here Music trying to get some gum off the floor G somebody Debbie was that you at halftime they lost their gum out there are you kidding were going to be here all night if theyre trying to get it off Applause Applause Burns back into the game going back to the big lineup Kevin Keats the last two games theyve primarily played Four guards but playing with two bigs down the stretch horn misses it short Applause and heres Hinson he want the ball in his hands in crunch time 10 seconds to shoot is lean in attack mode Oh I thought he carried it 3 seconds on the shot clock leg it denied by great defense Casey morcel all over him there Casey hasnt had the best offensive night but hes been aggressive diara had a layup and missed it especially with a small on him that was a great opportunity to tie it at 62 and now back to try and dial in some more defense and get another stop here pit clinging to a twopoint lead with two minutes to play and a foul call to gets DJ horn that is his fourth and hell send Blake Hinson to the foul line I mean Im just telling you Blake Hinson is the goto guy hes doing a tremendous job right here working off the ball hes been patient all half hes only taken four shots in the second half and pit in the double bonus so Hinson gets two makes the Music first at some point when its time to foul if VCC State cant get a stop and a score feder Rico is not a good free throw shooter Im sure coach cap will get him off the line off the Court stays a one possession game Kevin Keats takes a timeout he had three to work with so still two remaining in the final two minutes here a fun finish one possession game in the ACC stretch tied at 56 tied at 58 tied at 60 and now pit is nosed in front one possession game Panthers lead 6360 Debbie Antonelli Jay alter with you whats going to be the difference down the stretch well execution no game slippage not tur the ball over right players taking shots can you get a Applause Music stop the two DJs have been the two Goos for NC State all season but particularly tonight we were just talking about this very set in the break about how feder Rico has been jumping out hard on those Hedges and NC State hasnt punished it this is the first time that I can remember NC State and DJ horn coming off that hard hedge that feder Rico is showing and attacking it to get to the line this is good for NC State with the stop stop but they got to make free throws and Horn rattles it home he has a game high 24 tonight here comes the DJ burn screen watch feder Rico jumps out on it and he picks up a foul because DJ horn goes right at that Music hip now DJ Burns goes out for a defensive possession its offense defense in late game situations with Kevin PS hits him both hes averaging 25 points a game over the last three games and he has 25 tonight onepoint game hit ball theyve got the lead I like Blake Hinson here coming off a pin down Applause Music action 10 seconds to shoot jayen low hes not even looking at Hinson wants to take it himself the floater no good good defense by NC State they have really forced pit to dribble a lot in this second half in their offense where in the first half I thought Jeff Cables team did a good job in transition and playing off the pass we got a onepoint Ball Game Time Out NC State when youre great in close games this year Kevin Keats has gone offense defense with DJ Burns and he does a nice job stacking his timeouts he had three remaining in the final two minutes here so he can take timeouts to get Burns back onto the court on the offensive end and tonight Burns has been terrific a season High 19 points you have to imagine number 30 in white is getting the touch here trailing by one with one minute to play in regulation into burds spins his way free cant finish bouncing around Blake Hinson has it got to play good defense here if youre Inc State and P you got to move the ball you want to take it down to 10 seconds if you can Jeff capable wants to call timeout and make sure its Crystal Clear whos getting this next shot plus he may want to get feder Rico Music out Burns right here spins Blake Henson comes over and helps block to Music block just enough interference to force DJ burs to miss now weve said it a few times tonight that these two teams are NCAA tournament teams a year ago both looking to bolster their tournament resume here in February both teams sitting on that bubble fine margins can determine your season the last 43 seconds will likely determine one of these two team Seasons the winner of this game maintains what would be a three game winning streak both teams came in winning backto back a critical final 43 seconds here cant get beat Over the Top If Youre NC State right here diara on Hinson Carrington calls his own number and imperfect position feder Rico there to put it home Carrington explodes by NC State doesnt keep him in front it forces rotation and the weak Side Glass is open you dont need a three here under 20 seconds remaining a lot of clock coming off for the wolf pack morcel missed it diara the offensive rebound cleans up the glass its a onepoint game with 96 remaining Kevin Keats uses his final timeout well nows when I take feder Rico out because I know NC State would choose him first to foul Carrington gets by NC State and its feder Rico on the week side the guards for pit have gotten in the paint all night and Yara with a great offensive rebound Casey morcel whos had an off night who has not made a three excuse me he did make one three had a decent look at it two offensive rebounds on backto back possessions here in crunch time so Pittsburgh basketball the Panthers have two timeouts where NC state has zero remaining and pit will be able to run that Baseline clinging to a onepoint lead wellc States going to have to get a foul here and you can try to get a Tipp or deflection very quickly you can tell the officials that hey were trying to get a a quick steal a quick trap see if you can force Pit make it tough for them to get the ball in bounds do not get beat over the Music top je k is going to put Diaz Graham on the floor a better free throw shooter not much a 59 free throw shooter hes the person to foul if he does catch it better than feder Rico whos 41 on the season I I wouldnt let Carl Carrington catch it Carrington at 81 the best on the floor andc say switch on everything in to Carrington a ton of clock coming off 4 seconds expire finally the foul comes in with 57 and its the Freshman Jaylen low who hits the line to shoot two so iny State without any timeouts Kevin Keats already put the play in here you got to know time and score if youre iny State low a perfect three for three tonight from the line got it okay so its a twopoint game now everybody needs to be aware if he makes this NC States going to need a Music three the wolf pack with no Music timeouts DJ horn is all the way down here on this end of the floor he has five made thre tonight I want to get the ball in his hand as fast as I can low The Freshman steps up and knocks them both down Jeff cable takes some time out how about Jaylen low a career high 20 points tonight on the road here in Raleigh with the weight of the game on the freshwood shoulders shooting into the student section buries them both and that gives pit a cushion here threepoint lead you know NC States drawing up a threepoint shot so this is this is one of the conversations we had with Jeff capable today about putting someone on the ball inbounding NC State can run the Baseline lets see if they put some size on the inbounder right and you asked them what do you do up three with 5 seconds left and he said we would foul once they get across midcourt less than 8 seconds is what he said so we had this conversation with Jeff cable today at shoo around you always ask the right questions well I got lucky but you know what what I what we did know Jay is that every game in the ACC is like this right comes down to the last play and if Im pit I want to make NC State come back to the Music ball into middle Brooks and now oconnell and the foul comes in thats exactly what Jeff Cel told us they would do 3 seconds remaining NC State no timeouts and oconnell at the line ideally make the first Miss the second I think so I think thats what you have to do lets see if coach capable is going to leave you know his four five guards on the floor you got to make sure you box out OK conell misses it so now you need a Miss p get it out you miss him tap it back now diara checks in so diara at 6 10 middle Brooks at 6 10 going against Zack Austin whos 6 7 and Blake Hinson whos 68 so theyve got a height Advantage oconnell misses it theara bounces it out morcel Hees it no good and pit holds on what a win for Jeff cable and the Panthers
