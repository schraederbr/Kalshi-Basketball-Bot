as the Eagles and the seminal get set to tip it away here at the tuck Lee Cassell Jeff Pond Clarence Armstrong are officiating crew here today and we are underway in Floridas Capital City the nlls controlling the opening tip their starting point guard Jaylen warley bringing across into the half court for the Music nolles heres Baba Applause Music Miller they are double teamed and called for the TR by Clarence Armstrong so Florida state turns it over on their first possession that double team there is something that youre going to see from winr tonight they want their guys to be big inside force you to get out and have Shooters on the outside so youre going to see that a lot from Baba Miller and the other players and so heres winr with their first possession of the ball game well take a look at their starting five Chase Claxton one of the front Court players sending it in the remainder of that starting five Nick Johnson K Harrison Kelton tolford KJ ducet and others waiting in the Applause wings Watkins the transfer from BCU second effort had it rejected and that is out of play last Touch by a seminal Claxton coming in for the big Music rejection and see how many guys are underneath that post there Sean they want it download there theyre going to be really really physical Music Applause Music there ni Johnson pushing the pay pushing it into the front court against the seminal juet trying to thread the needle got it through tford double team knocked away Deontay green now pushes it up ahead and Florida state is struggling to maintain possession and theres another turnover Applause Nick Johnson one of several transfers for the Eagles knocks down the midrange hook shot and win leads it for Applause Music Applause nothing inside to deont green back out Applause top Watkins trying to turn the corner lobs it up and Bowen couldnt crash it through juet on the Run frantic Tempo both ways early on here in the first couple of minutes of Play Between the Eagles and the Applause seminal logo three Darren Green foul on the floor on the screen itll go against Florida Music State No Lack of energy here Sean Nick Johnson gets up and through the Defenders hes got a great eye for the ball guy who a year ago was part of the America East All Conference third team at New Hampshire hes earned a breather as he makes his way back to the bench a senior out of the Bronx who has been a perfect pickup for winr early on heres sincere McMahon bringing it across McMahon a guy who played for head coach Mark prer at Western Carolina then came to winr when prer took the job a few years ago prer crer says hes got a PhD in this program McMahon is just so good at knowing what this coaching staff needs and also being a leader for this team theres eight seniors and grad students hes one of them Florida State comes away no look past warley to Watkins Watkins hesitates on the wing good decision win pad numbers Darren Green Rising firing that is too strong Darren Green a shooter thats going to shoot in volume though hes not afraid to shoot the three cuz hes so talented at doing so six against North Florida just a couple of days ago in fact heres Watkins On The Run double team that is short stick back though is good and the nlls are on the board surprised thats their first so far they have played allout energy really both these teams here Sean a lot of defensive pressure both ways between the Eagles and the seals McMahon lost the handle for a second got it back now its Meli on the wing Music Applause tford one of the co captains up top melie off the shot Bank driving by Bow and Nifty move all the way to the rack and he lays it in its another player that plays So Physical you see him get right through the Defenders there its easy for him to take it to the rim foul on the floor thatll lead us to our first media break here in Tallahassee win through leading it 5 well we mentioned him earlier well go ahead and introduce you to them more formally this is Mark prer the thirdyear head coach at winr a familiar face for winr fans and Alexander also a familiar face for Florida State fans absolutely you see he was former Western Carolina head coach eight from 18 to 21 so he faced him as while he was head coaching there and he also got to face him when he was here with win 16 17 years so hes looking forward to the opportunity it is to face Florida State tonight yeah this be the third time that broser has faced the seals between the two clubs his winr team picked to finish third in the Big South this season off a down year one of their first losing season one of their only losing Seasons frankly since 2000 just a couple really in fact theyve routinely been one of the most consistent mid major programs in the country theyve made several NCAA tournament trips in The Last 5 Years as the lab attempt is Off the Mark almost went in in fact and Deontay green lays out on the floor to try to keep that with the Gos in fact though it does go back to the Applause Eagles three turnovers for Florida State in the first four minutes theres a third turnover by winth Primo Spears checking in one of several point guards for the nlls in fact he and Chandler Jackson split time at the point theyre both on the floor for Leonard Hamilton Bowen inside nice move got back his own Miss and on third effort gets it to go hes a player that coach ham has talked about has already shown tremendous Improvement here through eight games of the season in fact when we talked to him during shoot around this morning said quite simply and effectively when you got a Hall of Famer saying this about you hes got a chance to be special I mean you watch he goes up for the floater misses misses again and hes competing through three Defenders there just a young guy here in Tallahassee reclassified to this year decided to take a prep year in between the end of his high school career and coming to Florida State thought it would make him a little bit more battle tested and ready and so here he is and as you mentioned Alexander took a big step forward against North Florida set career highs although early on in his first season as a seminal in points and rebounds alike Music heres Nick Johnson fresh off the Breather trying to pick his way through traffic and that ball is stolen away its going to be a shot clock violation windr nearly reestablished possession in fact they tried to get a shot up but the clock hit zero nice defense by the Applause Music NES slow rolling early on here on the scoreboard at least both teams have pushed Tempo back and forth just hasnt translated to much on the board as of yet 64 win through 13 to work with for Primo Spears now Chandler Jackson in the noes Jackson Driving hard into the paint like the effort Rim just did not like that shot you can tell this win through team did their homework on Florida State their defending them really well Applause here that ball knocked Away by Spears it remains win through basketball duet got by one Defender Bowen clears the board now heres Jackson looking for Spears Spears spin move pull up yes score count it and one the crowd is erupting here tonight obviously for that but also because Primo Spears is on the court theyre so excited to finally be able to watch him and watch him perform well thats an excellent shot he put down and so thatll send spear creates the space for himself and hes been really calm at the line so far in his three games as a matter of fact he hasnt missed a free throw and of course because I said it there you have it Music tied up at six inside Timberman with the right hand thats Applause short Spears to Bow and push off offensive foul against the Applause Freshman Mar down by 10 Taylor R first second line for the number 11 got to admire bu bow big Drive in there hes all Music Force couple of fouls each way here in the first seven minutes of Regulation between the nles and the Eagles juet brings it across K Harrison Harrison looking for a screen got it it runner in the lane is short off the offensive rebound a three from the wing that foul is thats an offensive foul number Applause Music 11 replacing Cham Jackson in the line number two Shamir Watkins Shamir Watkins checking in for Florida State its an FSU team this year that theyre not a finished product theyre not as healthy as they want to be but they are deeper than they were last year certainly Spears adding to the equation as of recently that shot though Off the Mark and out of Applause Music play Music Applause heres set the yearo is playing D2 basketball was an all conference guy at Grand Valley State now lighting it up with win kimman inside last year he was at Bucknell and this year hes taken an early lead over the seminal both these guys being a really good addition for the Eagles especially KJ duet I mean hes leading the team in points coming from the D2 level thats a huge accomplishment early on in the season Spears lets it fly from the corner had the space it was a good look for Spears and thats a guy who has spent time working in the gym and just needs to adjust a guy who needs no adjustment though do set with the three from the wing and wiri leads by five Applause Watkins back out to Miller Miller in and Applause Music Applause out two set around by Spears Spears tripped up in the lane thatll be a foul on the floor and thatll send us to yet another media timeout here in Tallahassee nolles are without a bucket in the last 227 but Premo Spears will certainly want more of that nice in Tallahassee on the ACC Network extra and ESPN plus as we take a look at KJ duet Alexander we talked a bit about him in his journey to winr and he certainly made an impact already this season absolutely I mean hes the only player on this team that started every single game now there are some that have started you know 12 and 13 coming into tonight but hes been on the court every single start hes just been fantastic to come in and be leading a team in points per game when you came from a completely different division its a huge Music accomplishment three points here for ducet early on knock down a three to extend the lead to five something to keep track of though already two foul against him so he might be sitting on that bench for a bit inside to Deontay green spin move through contact hell go to the free throw line to shoot a couple Florida State also passing the ball more in that possession getting the ball down so that theyre able to make smarter shots you see they have 0 and six in those threepoint attempts thats cuz theyre not passing the ball as much so at least theyre getting down and under now hes able to get to the line for two green the sophomore forward out of Asheville North Carolina and I mentioned the injury issues that Florida state is still continuing to weather theyve been dealing with them for about two years now frankly and so green is actually playing a little bit out of position theres a number of guys that have moved about in the rotation so hes getting his sea legs in different positions on the court doing whats needed and he just made a couple of really nice free throws for Florida State trim the lead to three a lot of guys are playing out of position but when you have a Hall of Fame level coach hes able to work with it youve seen him overcome a lot of the adversities in these injuries coach Hamilton so this teams really coming Music together theres a decided feel that they are taking steps closer theyre getting ever closer that North Florida wi being a sign of that as coach Hamilton looks on from the home sideline year 22 for Coach ham here here in Tallahasse he looks like hes no further in than year two he looks great threetime ACC Coach of the Year fifth alltime winning as coach in ACC history with 409 next up is Gary Williams if he can get to that Mark some 20 or so ahead of him but all he cares about day in Day Out game in game out is finding a way to win the next Music one its a nice looking shot from the corner sincere McMahon the train transfer from Western Carolina the proud Catamount who has been with prer since day one makes Florida state pay from Deep second three ball of the game for winr they lead it by six winr a team that will shoot the three fairly often theyve done so largely over the years to decent success inside Deontay green took an extra step thats a traveling violation now look at McMahon he finds a way to get open drains the three Sean we saw him in shoot around today he made 12 straight threes we told Coach prer he said oh thats great I didnt know because he went home last night he wasnt feeling well so hes so happy to hear that he was out shooting well today and now hes doing well already in this game yeah stroke was good right there that pass though did not I think Florida state for a second thought that it was last Touched By An Eagle but its going to remain win through basketball and theres some subs coming in and out for Florida State thats something that they can do a little bit more liberally now thats difficult in sports though Sean you get a call you dont like and then you kind of mix up on the back side of it one mistake leads to the next so Florida States got fresh legs in hopefully theyre going to have a reset back to a sixpoint lead for winr and that is out of Play It Still Remains winr back Music basketball knocked out of play by Florida State now 17 left on the shot clock B Miller back in for the NS pressuring the inbounds Applause play jir Watkins working on McMahon mcah in looking for a screen well contested by the VCU transfer Florida State comes away with the Music turnover Baba Miller into contact hell make a trip to the free throw Music line that was a nice block by jir Watkins thats something coach proster said you cannot count out from this Florida State team size and length PR Watkins showing it yoro Dio called for the foul on Baba Miller on his way up this will be a couple of free throws from Miller first one looks good sophomore from Music mayorca represented Spain in the 9 world champions uh World Championship over the summer and they were in fact the 9 world champions was an invaluable experience for Baba Miller a big confidence boost especially considering he only got to play half the season last year in Tallahassee so it was much needed reps and thats an offensive foul against kelon tford tripping up jir Watkins right at the midcourt strike TOA State energy happy with that each one of these team members fired up communicating with Applause themselves the fouls continue to pile up here on winr Florida State creeping ever closer to being in the bonus I believe theyll be shooting free throws next foul Darren Green working Applause Baseline inside 10 Watkins pull up Jay in the lane too strong t for double Applause team tford on the roll to the rack tker the player with that illegal screen call didnt like that had that fuel his fire in get him all the way to the rim for that Applause one back to a sixpoint lead here for winre with 842 left in the first half Watkins dishing it to warley warley driving Baseline yes and that is something Florida State fans will certainly like to see Jaylen warley has all the capabilities in the world to do just that and hes done it a few times this year against Colorado and against North Florida and looked awfully good in the process if you can get one downhill good things will happen for the NES when your point guard is able to facilitate and also score its obviously going to make a massive difference when Jaylen Worley has over 10 this season the NS of one orley in there on defense and that is quality defensive work it remains with wiri albe it only with five left on the shot Music clock its into Timberman and thats a live ball turnover Florida state was looking to run the floor in transition but because there was only five left on the clock they went ahead and blew that possession dead due to it being a shot clock violation the folks here in the tuck none too happy because warley had a clear path to the basket and threw it down as the play was being called Applause Music off fourpoint lead for the Eagles Applause Music thats an offensive Applause foul foul 22 itll go against Darren Green Jr and thatll take us to yet another media timeout hulford the heart and soul of this team with a big exclamation point here with less than eight to go in the first Music half back here in Tallahassee where win leads it by four its a half that they have largely been out in front in save for when Florida State knotted it up momentarily at six and as we take a look at the numbers here to this point in the first half Alexander just not a whole lot going on for the NOS especially well Florida States playing hard theyre just not getting shots theyre not creating good looks for themselves theyve got to pass the ball better theyve got to just be a little bit more calm and in sync an offensive foul by the nolles in their half court gave it back to winr at the under eight media timeout so its the Eagles operating left to right and inside 20 now on the shot clock its Harrison top of the key guarded by Darren Green Jr looking for a screen Florida state does well to hedge quality defense by the nolles there here comes warley after intercepting that pass Nifty move all the way to the rim but Off the Mark nonetheless and theres another ball stolen away by Darren Green Jr up top gaining underneath and through a little messy but thats that coach ham style basketball let the defense turn into offense play fast and confident three turnovers in the last last minute and 48 seconds by The Eagles four turnovers in the last 3 and 12 minutes in fact it looks like they might get Baba Miller here with a foul on the floor Ali you have something theyve worked on in all practices this season love to work on that miss it a little bit but Jaylen gayy so athletic able to find the ball again and put it down jayen gy a guy whos from the old headquarters of the ACC in Greensboro nor North Carolina grew up as an NC State fan but didnt really come to basketball until he was in the eighth grade he said until that point he said I was just a tall kid hanging out with my mom well now hes doing a pretty good job in the college basketball World whether it be at brown or now here at Florida State on the backside of an injury just trying to get back up to speed thats number 22 for the nlls excuse me that is number 33 for the nlls now hes coming off an injury only his third game back and you can tell that hes really trying to find his footing trying to get his wind under him trying to make sure hes back in shape and ready for it hes hurting a little bit there but hes playing awfully Music hard hell shoot a couple of free throws here a chance for Florida State to knock this one up at 16 first one up and good and so I mentioned Jaylen gaining a little bit about his story we go ahead and take a look at some more of it transferred in from Brown he was a twotime ivy league Defensive Player of the Year and was highly sought after around the country roughly half the schools in the ACC alone were competing for his services that should remain with the Music Applause nolles Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music FSU now with a chance to perhaps Take the Lead theyre first of this Applause game looking for room Darren Green Jr inside five Jackson from Deep its short and cleared by Applause Timberman Applause Timberman second effort rejected by the NOS Here Comes green back the other way pull up from the low go you can see frustration from Darren Green there not too often that he shot this many and Music missed foul called on the floor if thats on Baba Miller thats his second in the last couple of Music minutes gy certainly happy to have some relief there against the recovering from that leg and still trying to get in basketball shape its one thing to practice its completely another to be on the court playing in live competition especially against a team like this whos playing all out defense here and you mention the injury for Jaylen gy going back to his time in the ivy league the ivy league did not choose to play on the backside of Co so when everybody else came back the ivy league did not so really in the last three seasons hes played maybe a season of basketball and thats just a lot of inactivity to try to work your way back from as winthrip calls time out their lead by one with 532 left at the Music tuck one point lead for the Eagles here at the Tucker Center As Nice crowd is here students are out for their holiday break so thats a chunk of the Arena thats left open here over this week or so between Christmas Hanukkah the New Years all of Applause that nice sequence of passing by winre really good ball movement there and the beneficiary was Yaro Music Dio they did a really nice job of staying patient in that possession Florida State playing clean defense all over but win just able to find a way and I mentioned Florida state is now in the bonus so that bump on Jaylen warley will send him to the free throw line to shoot the one and one Orly coming into today shooting roughly 64 from the charity strip got the Applause Music bounce Junior from Philadelphia Pennsylvania his family has a rich history in basketball in Phil Philadelphia which is also one of the most basketball rich cities in this country good looking free throws there from warley so far Florida State for the most part has been effective there and thats been good news for them considering not much else has fallen to this Applause point onepoint lead still for winr nearly lost the handle it gets deflected out of play off of Deontay green it remains with winr 22 left on the shot clock Music and thats knocked out of play by Bow so Florida State turning up the pressure Music here Applause L comes out to work on Harrison Harrison with the spin move double team Chandler Jackson comes in its a held Applause ball Florida State happy with that call playing really close effective defense Chandler Jacksons one of those players thats going to get right up in there hes got a lot of heart and intensity in the way he plays Paul goes his way it remains with winthrip but they dont have a whole lot of time to do much with the basketball here Florida state has had a strong defensive showing here on this possession by The Eagles as Tom house checks in Tom house a decorated swimmer in high school who chose to specialize in basketball the sister actually the assistant coach on the FSU volleyball team here with one on the clock that is hoisted up what a move to get that back into play and an even better block by the nolles heres Spears running the floor and a foul caught underneath the basket an awesome effort from BB in there hes one of those players hes young hes inexperienced but hes come through and hes learned so well thus far look at him he gets that block hes able to turn that possession for Florida State there its a 72 wingspan for a guy who stands at 610 already two points and a block for Bowen it allowed his teammates to run the floor and now Spears goes to the free throw line he missed a free throw earlier in this game and that is the only one he has missed to this point this season only playing in his third game now as a seminal but has a chance here at the charity stripe to put them out front for the first time here in the first half its been that kind of night tied up at 18 three from the wing in transition win pushing off of that Miss free throw now here comes Florida State to house good look its short green on the weak side fighting for space fighting through contact in the NOS lead he is another player that plays with so much intensity hes been so good under the net be able to pull that rebound down and turn it into offense at nine rebounds against Georgia a few weeks ago seven of them on the offensive glass big offensive rebound and stick back for green there now a tie up underneath the basket it looks like a foul will be called against the nolles it will go against Bowen the freshman and so for the first time here in the first half the NOS lead courtesy of Deontay green hanging in top down low hitting the stick back for a 2018 in well they preach depth here at Florida State particularly with their basketball program and it applies to their mascots simmeron got the first gift of this holiday season and its mini simmeron they came out here and distributed tshirts for all the fans Double the Trouble double the tshirts Sean theyre having fun Ill tell you what the most impressive thing to me is when they wield the gift out you called it what else could fit in that box it was so big it was not totally wrapped it seemed like it was right you were thinking outside the box regarding what is in the Box what a night here at the tuck as win through on the back side of whatever that was is looking to execute on the one and one they do not but I think we got a lane violation here and Nick Johnson will get bailed out on missing the front end of that free throw Applause Lan and so he does earn a second one off the second attempt FSU taking its first lead on a Deontay green stick back right before the last mediate timeout its been Winthrop in front for most of this first half Johnson looking for his fourth point in it hes got it were Applause Music Applause tied Applause estate rotating it to the wing and Primo Spears now up top to Jackson Spears tripped up on his way into the lane everybody hitting the floor and that should go back to Florida state theyre going to call it a held ball basketball its got to be the 10th player thats hit the duck so far in this first half every player all out fighting I was just about to say you can say what you want about the execution but the effort certainly not in question both teams laying out with regularity fighting for every point every possession here on the floor in the first 17 or so minutes of this game I believe Leonard Hamilton has called timeout in fact he has 30 time itll be a 30 second timeout for the nolles well take that break right with them here on acc Network extra and ESPN plus well be back in just a Music few 20 all with 326 left in the half Florida States got eight left on the shot clock their first lead of the game erased at the free throw line now Tom house gets it in to Primo Spears the transfer from Georgetown pullup jumper Spears got it only a matter of time before Florida State shot one of those Downs first three of the game for the NES and its Spears in game number three as a seminol putting them ahead with their biggest lead at any point here Music tonight K Harrison looking for some room Chandler Jackson now Jaylen gy Florida State switching well pressuring the man on the ball for the Eagles well take another look at the pullup j a little contested there no problem for Primos spear its a perfectly online shot six points two of five from the floor and he very candidly told me before the game very much the same way we talked about with Jaylen gy hes been practicing with the team hes been running the scout team while he was waiting on his waiver to go through didnt even end up needing the waiver to go through the NCAA deciding to Grant the twotime transfers immediate eligibility um but so hes back on the floor found out right before the SMU game that he could play and so now its just shaking off that competitive rust playing against guys that arent the ones youve been practicing against in the gym all the time exactly they said he practiced every single day as if he was going to play that night because you didnt know when the NCAA ruling was going to come out it could have come out right before a game it could have came out in the middle of a game so Primos been waiting all season patiently but intentionally for his moment take a look at his story I mentioned that he transferred in from Georgetown led the team in points per game and of course an assist per game and in fact I mentioned he was a twotime transfer not only did he lead Georgetown in points per game last year he led duaine in points per game as a freshman and so yeah you think of a point guard as a distributor but hes also a talented scorer and hes showing signs of that here early in this game with six points on the board already meanwhile his fellow transfer jir Watkins out of VCU a tough contested rebound he got tied up with Kelton tford of wiri hords heading back to the bench with a personal foul now in his pocket and because Florida States in the double bonus its two free throws for the Junior from Trenton New Music Jersey boy Florida state has generally done a nice job here tonight so far of knocking those down and the lead swells to Applause Music Applause five pass was stolen away by Jaylen warley now here comes Florida State trying to run in transition that pass too hot for Watkins as it skips through the Baseline you can tell theyre starting to play in sync right I mean thats a half a second Miss there Florida State really starting to try to run in transition off those turnovers theyve been doing it win thrifts had numbers though for a good bit of this first half FSU starting to get some matchups that they like on the fast break just could not connect the passes there two minutes left here in the first half Nolls lead by Music five a nice move on the roll but no good on the lane attempts that was Xavier mckel left all alone underneath the basket now an offensive foul against the nolles wave off the bucket second on Deontay green Music Applause went through one of their last 10 from the floor defense such a calling card for Leonard Hamilton in Florida State its held strong here early Timberman though the floater in the lane is good from right around the free throw line that looked pretty darn good for the Eagles and that snaps a scoreless draft of 2 minutes thats a shot Timberman is really good at he loves the floater there really consistent with it heavy pressure by Jaylen warley on Timberman knocks it away and cant save it in time last Touch by warley himself great effort though by Music Jaylen Music Applause Music lead is three its into Timberman Florida State really showing more of that full cord pressure and we might have an issue with the shot clock here I wasnt looking at it here to start it looks like they might be looking for a couple more ticks on it I saw our ACCC crew pointing up at the shot clock now theyre over at the scorers Music table so with 114 left and 19 on the shot clock its back in and the Eagles will try to trim into this lead perhaps not it up at 25 Harrison trying to turn the corner and Florida State will be called for a reach thatll go against Primo Spears aggressive on ball defense so far in this first half theyre starting to get frustrated with those calls but you got to keep the effort up Music right Florida State team thats held one through to one of its last seven from the floor and after the the Eagles were shooting roughly 40 in the first handful of minutes brought that down into the low 30s qu credit to Florida States aggressive brand of Defense couple of substitutions here for the Eagles Melby on his way out and on his way in is Chase Claxton who got the Start The Graduate forward from Greenville South Carolina still only in the bonus so thats a one and one they cat in on the front Music end Harrison one of a handful of transfers he previously played at Lamar University and he connects on both free throws to trim the lead down Applause one one minute left in the half here between the seals and the Eagles the NOS leading at 2524 gainy up to set the screen Spears mid range no definitely wanted that one getting the call call against you and then to go out uncontested shot there he wanted that jumper yeah he had some space he crashes the floor Harrison keeps it up Spears knocks it out off of timman great defensive work by Primo Spears basketball goes to the Music noes that on Bal defense were talking about hes so focused Applause Music there 5sec differential between the shot and the game clock Applause Music here Spears spin move step back midrange two strong it comes out to Johnson 5 seconds left Johnson looking for some room looking for some help three at the buzzer in and out K Harrison takes a lap around the rim and Florida State takes a onepoint lead to the locker room over winth the five and five seminal lead it 2524 sha a fight on defense in tough times on offense its a onepoint game and you can see exactly why both these teams are going to go to the lock room try to figure out what to adjust here would be a big win for either of these teams Florida State looking to build some momentum off of their win over North Florida and of course if youre winr on the road power five team absolutely both have a chance and theyll talk about it at the half well have plenty to talk about as well well be back at a Music moment this is just game three and so youve got a chance to really stream together momentum if you can on your home floor if youre the olds both teams are going to have a holiday break here after this game tonight and so well see itll be a hard earn break for sure thats what weve learned in the first first half Florida State won the opening tip so win begins with the basketball teams are now operating in the opposite direction the Eagles will move from right to left on your Applause screen to set sets the screen keeps the basketball now feeds it down to tford tford guarded by Deontay green triple teed and lays it in with the left hand Here Comes FL to Music State now trailing by a point nice feed down low Up and Under Deonte Green in the NOS lead once again those are the passings throughout the possession we talk about stay passing stay up stay patient good things happen Music tord at 195 lbs of plays like hes much bigger than that hes so physical under there hes got three Defenders hes trying to get through gets to the hoop preseason All Conference first team Kelton tolford started in all but one game this season number four in Black Florida State nearly stole the basketball away but Darren Green Jr stepped on the sideline so it goes back to the Eagles and do set knocked Away by Florida State we like to see it though both teams pointing towards their way wanting The Possession all out defense were still seeing it here early in the second half looking to connect on the back cut there got knocked out of play 10 left on the clock gles going to get called for the shove right in front of the win for Music bench Music Jayy warley coming in off his seventh career game where hes recorded 10 or more points hes got four in the first half for Florida State now going back to work on defense green nearly stole that ball away Harrison inside too strong knocked around contested rebound tford rejected on the way up but theyll call Darren Green Jr for the foul green Jor all over the ball in that possession there towards the top of the key going for it chasing it down on the other side then ultimately getting the foul against him but it the effort is absolutely there going up looking to get that block successful but tford gets a trip to the line yeah got the ball and got some of tford too so thats 11 fouls each way early on here in the second half first free throw up in good were noted up at Music Applause 27 Kon offord now with seven points to this PO in this game and winr takes the lead this just the third meeting between Florida State and winr they met in 2016 met again in 2019 and in neither of the previous two contests did Florida State necessarily run away with it in fact in 2019 they had a 16point lead in the half and winr came roaring out of the locker room Trimm the lead to two with 10 minutes left Florida state would hang on though nice interior passing by the nolles to find Jaylen warley who again Drive the basket good things tend to happen when number one is going downhill exactly you watch this team starting to jel to Green waited for Jaylen warley knew where he was going to be delivers a perfect bounce pass to him and warley to go up get the foul something that coach Hamilton told us in Florida States pregame shoot around its been a bit of a mystery to the coaching staff you know warley is certainly capable hes gifted hes a staunch Defender he does a lot of things right he said but hes so unselfish he is so teammate oriented that there are times that his best option is to call his own number and he doesnt do it and theyre trying to get him to be a little bit more assertive and he was there and earn a trip to the free throw Music Applause line no good on the first free throw attempt but as we take a look at his assist numbers averaging 33 a season ago and then the assist to turnover ratio 21 for warley so takes good care of the basketball for the most part makes the right decisions in terms of facilitating and spreading things out to his teammates tough defensively just try to get him a little bit more offensive Music too nice action there on the roll to the basket and that be tford who was fouled on his way Applause Music in teams definitely starting to get frustrated with these calls green just reaching in there wanting it its another foul called against him got his hands in there got his hands on the basketball think he might have been lobbying for a jump ball possession ER pointing to Florida State so instead of it going through the NOS a couple of free throws for tford another personal foul against Deontay green that is his third in the game and so he promptly is hauled back over to the bench and hell be sitting there for a little Applause bit we mentioned in the first half Florida State deeper but not as deep as they would like to be so still have to be careful when the fouls start to mount nice action on the pick and roll Baba Miller fouled underneath the basket Music Johnson everybody being physical in the paint there but its back to back and now another trip to the line from fouls in the paint really nice back cut by more than anything thats a nice looking free throw stroke free throw is something that Baba has had to work on throughout this season got to get that clip more efficient and hes done so in the last couple games Florida state has a team 12 of 16 to this point in this game and that is a perfect trip to the charity strike for Bob on Miller tied up at 30 it goes to sincere McMahon McMahon trying to work on jir Watkins nearly lost the handle got to get it across he Applause didnt thats why you full court press on defense Florida State really happy with that call great defense by jir Watkins there watch the way he stays with them mcmah starts to get frustrated double dribble there saw that ball bounce Music Applause twice theyre going to get Florida stayed for a moving screen theyre going to call Jam gy for the offensive foul trying to get Darren Green Jr open and he was open on the wing but the screen was the Music Applause Music problem 8 and five went through five and five Florida State Johnson Working on Darren Green Music J Harrison tried to dish it out to the corner Watkins picked it off here comes warley winr gets two Defenders back and warley goes straight to the back Nifty footwork nice looking shot for the Florida state point guard play Fast defense turning into offense and Jaylen warley just what you need be confident be physical get to the Music hoop Jamir Watkins fantastic on defense so far in this game a huge steal great for Music momentum in the movement from jayen warley there one foot to the next foot and hes in and Florida State came right back and turned winthrip over once again Watkins wanteded to run it got knocked out of play though so everybody gets set Florida state will go right back to the half court and see if they cant try to stretch that lead again Watkins pull up three short front iron what an athletic rebound by Jaylen warley heres green yes green know what I say to that its about time Darren Green Jr loves those threepoint shots first one of the night hes feeling good that was a clean look Second Chance opportunity now winr having trouble getting it into the front Court they do manage to get it across as Florida States lead has swollen to five Johnson driving down the lane and gainy will be called for the foul 11 its a 70 run for FL for to State over the last minute and 47 seconds and while certainly winre will benefit from having a chance to pick up a couple of points at the charity stripe I think also just in terms of being able to catch your breath this is Applause Music valuable first free throw is good for Nick Johnson who as we mentioned was an all conference third teamer for New Hampshire in the America East conference a year ago was also the America East Rookie of the Year a few years prior has gelled well with this winthrip team has five points and is perfect from the free throw line and remains so Florida state line number 10 Taylor Taylor ball Bowen checking in for Florida State Applause Music Applause green air ball there Sola adabi checking in for Florida State heres warley floater is short its knocked Away by Johnson seven on the clock for the NS on the and with that dead ball that takes us to our first media timeout of the second half Darren Green Jr on a second chance opportunity credited to Jaylen warley splashes it through in the NOS so far 12 points from those turnovers talking about the turnovers for winr they had three in the span of about a minute Florida State recording two steals in that sequence and thats where FSU really started to stretch the lead out theres been a couple of free throws for winr since to trim it back down to three fsus led by five a couple of times winr was led by roughly the same amount at various points in the first half as Timberman lost the handle out of Play It Was last touch though by Darren Green Jr it remains with the eagles with 15 left on the shot clock simman slightly outside of his comfort zone there Sean hes usually most effective in the paint not a big dribbler you put two Defenders on him Music L substitution here for windr is case Harrison comes on to leave Nick Johnson KJ do set to send it Applause in kelvi Nifty footwork and blocked out of play Florida state says well have none of that everyone crashes to the hoop there too many trees winther not able to do anything there as the Freshman Taylor B Bowen slotting that one out of play there he is Applause again Bo that Wings span the intensity the athleticism obviously as it goes around the country theres a learning curve for youngsters and certainly so for Bowen as Tio splashes the three through and were tied at Applause 35 kicked out of Blade you set thought it should go to the Eagles instead it remains with Florida State just fighting for it off the inbounds play Dio over Darren Green Jr only Dios second made field goal of the night but it feels like he scores it just the right time when he does it feels like hes got a lot more than five on the board bolans going to let it fly from the wing its short winded up well Watkins crashes in to try to afford forward State a second opportunity jettin stripped of the basketball by Darren Green Jr Watkins thought about pulling it up in transition and get called for the offensive foul a charge against number two in white the Tucker Center erupting with noise on that one not happy with that call at Music Applause all a thinks about taking the three but decides to take it to the hoop thinks itll be a safer move gets the call against him for the charge yeah those feet arent set the Kel he brings it across nearly dribble it off his foot that ones knocked away heres Watkins look what I found as hes fouled on the way up Melby says you are not going to throw this down right in front of me Im going to make you earn it at the free throw line at the very least Watkins forcing so much tonight hes been so good on the defense he wants that ball so bad he deserves that opportunity hes close but he earns a trip to the line instead 10th steal on the night for Florida State Watkins who can shoot it who can Rebound with the best of them has also been on a tear defensively stealing away a couple balls hes been averaging over the last handful of games a couple of steals per game so hes getting in on the ACT on the glass he can make some shots now hes also turning teams over there are some bright spots there are some positive signs here in Tallahasse theyre just trying to get everybody else healthy at this point as we take a look at his numbers on the season one of Florida States leading scores at 128 per game over six rebounds per game hes also dishing out a handful of assists per game actually leads the team in assist per game so I mean digging deep into his bag stuff in the stat sheet and proven that he has been a positive pickup for the nolles here in Tallahassee onepoint lead for Florida Music Applause State K Harrison brings it across for the Applause Eagles Harrison working on Spears Bowen rejected it off the glass Jackson up ahead to Spears Florida States got numbers up top to nickelberry and Florida State missed the connection on the lob itll remain with the NOS though Music its a big block from bulbo and he plays so physical and hes played clean as well through this game here tonight he has injected a lot of energy into this gym as Spears three catches the back iron and bounces off still onepoint lead for Florida State duet working on the Freshman bow behind the back dribble trying to lose the youngster working down the lane and we get fou on the way up I think itll go against Chandler Jackson who came over on help side nope its going to go against Music B so as I was mentioning a little earlier when winthrip knocked in a three midpoint still some learning to do for Bowen but the the signs are there that he is going to be something special coach Hamilton also talked about the fact that hes put on 15 pounds since this season has started he knows that hes got to get more physical be able to compete with the big players that are upcoming in conference play a game that has been airtight it only makes sense that we are tied again this time at 36 Eagles splitting the free throws there now Florida state looks to operate green work down low trying to get around Timberman with the right hand in and out 13 and 1 half left to Applause go from the wing to strong Harrison got the Miss now from the corner Nick Applause Music Johnson nickelberry off the shot B finger roll oh its good nickelberry typically a player that wants to shoot from the perimeter but a smart move to take it to the rim onepoint lead Johnson stripped to the basketball lost the handle out of Play It goes to the Music nolles defense all over the place there Nick Johnson an open man in the back corner and then nickelberry taking it up and Music in one more made field goal for winre Florida state has done a lot of work at the free throw line theyve made a handful of shots as Music well so as it stands the Eagles are clinging to a onepoint lead the NS LED it by one at the half each team is led by roughly as many as five or six as that Baseline pass skips away and into the hands of Nick Johnson turnovers have been a bit of a problem for both at times here in this game particularly for winth nice high low look Bowen with another block three blocks for the Freshman Spears on the shot F kicks it back out to Deontay green green driving in the paint thatll be a blocking foul called I believe against Applause tford watch buo and get up make that block and then drive all the way down put a good pass up for his teammate green seven blocks for Florida State as a team compared to two for winth three for Bowen alone they get it into the youngster Spears too strong Bowen how about that an offensive rebound for Taylor B Bowen Second Chance opportunity and the runner is good Chandler Jackson and the nolles take a 4039 lead bbone really doing so much for his team there pulling that offensive rebound down he reaches out grabs it puts a good pass up for Chandler Jackson floaters good and that takes us to the Under 12 media timeout off a big offensive rebound by The Freshman Chandler Jackson splashes it through and the nlls lead by one once Music more tight game here in Tallahassee as we take a look at what winp has been up to leading into this matchup over the last six games they won four and since then theyve dropped their last two Alexander yeah and what you dont see there too is that theyve spent their last four games on the road this is the fourth game of that stretch coach proster told us it sounded like a good idea at the time when you go to schedule it you think its going to be good your guys are going to be battle tested in reality theyre tired its theyre ready for holiday break but theyve learned a lot about their team in this stretch here yeah the four game stretch on the road started at Arkansas Little Rock on December 10th theyve played at Xavier in South Carolina since and now of course playing Florida State here tonight when you look at the five losses for winr as a mid major team you know you always want to believe in your team but you also know when you go on the road to a power five team or a or a major Conference Team youre going to have your work cut out for you and so when you look at wins losses theyre the teams that arent necessarily youre going to go back to Rock Hill and say theyre bad losses and they were in every single game and thats one of the things that theyre particularly proud of you know you find the silver lining around some of those tough results and know we were in every game and had chances and here they are again with yet another one theyre also a team thats averaging 77 points a game so they know how to put offense up this game isnt necessarily a good showing of what this team is capable of for either one Music on and at the end of the day which one of these two will find a way to win a chance for winr to take the lead back weve had seven lead changes in this game now make it eight a lot of those have come here in the second half back and forth we go with 1140 left in regulation nickelberry in the Applause corner Spears to Deontay green working down low double team Chandler Jackson ran out of his shoe winr had numbers but the pass flies out of bounds and that is a missed opportunity for the Eagles you said kicking himself for that toss there just a little bit too high when its too high for your six seven teammate you know you might have toss it up there a little bit too high both these teams are really just feeling so excitable every every Play Feels huge because youre so close in the game but youve got to just calm down and play basketball skip pass to nickelberry nickelberry rise is fires and misses on front end the twoear point momentum certainly huge in this one and each team not really lighting it up on the floor Florida State for their part two of their last 11 from the floor still though within one of the Music Eagles McMahon nice feed tolford fouled on the way Applause Music up Music now watch him thread the needle with that pass be able to create some potential offense for tford once again another shooting foul and that is the fourth personal foul on Taylor B Bowen and so with 1038 he is going to make his way back to the Applause Music bench line Florida State sends three new white jerseys out to the floor Bob Al Miller jir Watkins Darren Green Music J meanwhile for winre juet will take a breather looks like Timberman wants to come Applause in Eagles split the pair of free throws and now the lead is Applause two Watkins down low foul called on the floor against sincere McMahon they got him for the Music bump and Timberman will come in to allow tford to check back out for a little Music Applause bit Spears nearly lost the handle keeps it double team through contact he go to the free throw Applause line one thing you can tell about Primos spe is he will not give up on the ball he is plays with so much effort you see him get in trouble while hes trying to dribble multiple times throughout this game throughout the past few he keeps that effort there the intensity the whole time and hes good on the free throw line let Florida State in scoring against SMU that was his debut as a seminal he was actually in double figures both in that game and against North Florida just a few days ago if this free throw goes through hell be standing at eight points in the game it does he is and we are tied once Applause more sincere McMahon brings it across and theres Florida State another steal for the NOS back and forth and go Watkins throws it down and they lead 4442 that is the most ins system youve seen this offense be McMahons looking back thinking about Watkins covering him Spears comes in steals the ball three passes all the way to the hoop thats a big play for Florida State and their momentum 33 now look at Green Giving that ball back to Jamir Watkins and Jamir Watkins deserved it he created that offense for the team as hes done multiple times here tonight about time that he gets to do one of those seven points now for Watkins strong offensive rebound for winther creating a second chance opportunity Clon fouled on the way up for free throw is good and now hes got a chance to tie it up no good caught the front iron Here Comes Spears Spears pull up jumper from the elbow high bounce Music Applause no inside 10 minutes left Harrison does everything but Applause drop Applause Watkins lost the basketball Here Comes Harrison dishing it up ahead Darren Green Jr lays off of Nick Johnson thats the right decision Johnson lays it in and winr leads 4544 Watkins loses that ball there because not enough movement on the offensive end for Florida State all the players staying stagnant in their spots jir Watkins had nowhere to go tried to power through is a little bit loose on the dribble loses The Possession jobs we call him for the reach on Music bab a great boun pass up and in for win texbook basketball fast break Points 11 points for Nick Johnson hes had a good day three for seven from the floor hes four for four from the free throw line but he now has three personal Music fouls sends Baba Miller back to the charity Music strike and the front end is no good Florida state in the bonus that was a one inone opportunity that goes by the wayside Timeout Winthrop as they bring it across into the half court with 8 35 remaining here in regulation well take a timeout with these teams here in Tallahassee winther bads by Music one with 835 left in regulation winra bads by one theyre seeking their first victory over an ACC opponent since November 17th 2014 when they knocked off the Clemson Tigers theyre 5 and 40 all time against the Atlantic Coast Conference and theyre looking to improve it to 6 and 40 today they certainly have a great shot thank you so much for joining us here taking some time out of your holiday festivities to take in this basketball game at the Donald L Tucker Civic Center in Floridas capital city of Tallahassee sha Davidson Alexander decapua our entire accnx and ESPN plus crew on hand where Florida state looks to increase their series lead over winthrip and Lead at 3 nothing and thats a quality defensive effort there by the nolles heavy pressure on the Baseline they Trail by one Watkins penetrating off the wing kicks it back out Deontay green now driving inside and thatll be a blocking foul against the Applause Eagles Deontay green can really find some success essing getting those blocking fouls called because he dribbles as if hes going to go up and shoot but then he continues to hes very physical boxes out with his body and he gets those calls for him and that is a big fourth foul on tford with 820 left so Kelton tford the allconference player as you mentioned getting called for the blocking foul and now he will have to sit a spell as the free throw attempt falls out of play Music Applause one Applause Music one still a one and one for Florida State at the front end of it were tied at 45 Music seven points for Deontay Green in this basketball game looking to make it eight hes got it in the nlls lead Applause again and both these teams are playing so physical its critical to make your free throw shots Deontay green doing a nice job Applause there jir Watkins applying the pressure Florida State extending it out the full length of the Court Watkins got a hand on there and knocked it away from Nick Johnson I believe it got kicked by Watkins after he got his hand in there it remains with the Applause Eagles You Trail by one duet gets it into Applause Music Johnson Johnson Timberman good ball movement Dio swings it out duet from the wing straight money for KJ duet that is a play that we saw in shoot around that they said worked so well in the 201819 game you pull the defender out to the Corner leave the three shooter out wide and of course youre going to give it to KJ duet your leading scorer on the team leading scorer stepping up in a big way win bleading at 4846 Watkins has been the hot hand here for Florida State driving all the way oh man here we Applause Music go tman setting the screen for Johnson he brings it across into the half court Johnson looking to get the corner on Darren Green huge block Timberman though keeps it alive 10 left for Timberman with the jump hook Baba Miller clears the Music board Miller bounce pass down low Florida State generated a tremendous look and the underneath Layin attempt by Darren Green junor was just short boy got your breath everybody a decided uptick in Tempo and intensity its still a onepoint game at the Music tck a back and forth second half winr has cashed in a number of opportunities here and Nick Johnson has been a guy that has been heating up in the second half for the Alexandra he sure has this is a kid that spent three seasons on the American East all defensive team but hes able to do it as well on offense coach prer said hes just been such a fantastic addition to this team he knows what to do with the ball and he knows when to do it 11 points in this game seven of them have come here in this second half theres a collision on the Baseline Deontay green got rocked by Harrison number 11 for the Eagles so green goes to the free throw line to shoot the front end of the one and one and that is a massive free throw for Deontay green green a guy coming into this game only shooting 62 from the charity stripe Florida State as a team not doing particularly great there coming into tonight but so far so good and theres another good looking free throw for Applause Greening Music twopoint lead for Florida State inside the final seven minutes of Applause Music Regulation its K Harrison bringing it into the half court for Music winter Johnson on the wing guarded by Watkins inside 10 now trying to feed Timberman down low gainy got it up there deflected it rejected it Watkins comes away with it green to the corner Spears on the dribble Drive lays it up and well go to the free throw Applause Music line hes a kid that does not give up on the dribble hes going to do anything he can to try to take that one to the hoop another shooting foul whats this his fourth trip to the line tonight and that is also the fourth foul on yoro Galo a handful of players for both teams with three or four fouls and as he goes to the bench theyre going to bring in their All Conference forward and Kelton tford who also has four Music fouls Ill correct myself still in there they swapped out Timberman for tord so two players on the floor for winr have four Music fouls M Johnson fighting his way through traffic Florida States on a 60 run over the last minute and 7 Seconds a 60 run in a minute and 7 seconds is something really fantastic for Florida State now for wind thrip and foul trouble tonight theyve committed a lot of fouls against this Florida State team both teams in fact now in the double bonus and so this is something that on the flip side win likes to see they like to make these trips to the free throw line Nick Johnson gets the roll on the first both teams will be shooting two from here on out in the double Music bonus well some of those names on that list are heavy names indeed that lri been ill afford to Applause lose six minutes left to go and Florida State leads by three Music Watkins working on Dio put him on skates and a foul called on the Applause Music floor thats a foul on Xavier Meli 22 fouls for winter P team L state has committed 20 of their own excuse me thats on duet he has Music four a lot of fouls are something you can expect when you see these teams playing so physical hitting the deck left and right theyve played so hard and the foul numbers have a show for it they certainly have big free throw here for Baba Miller to make it a twoscore game in and Applause out Harrison knifing inside duet from the perimeter tford tried to Sky for the weak side rebound warley contested it knocked it out of play should go back to the Eagles indeed it will Harrison will send it in win is a team over for the last four here in this game and thats picked off Watkins got a couple of hands on it but it ends up caring back to doe set Applause Music with the shot fake now its out to Harrison Harrison thatll be on Baba Music Miller Music with Miller just let his body get him away from him a little bit there called for the reach that is number four on Baba Music Applause Music Miller Chase Claxton will come in in place of KJ duett Harrison does not get the roll gy clears it twopoint lead for the Applause no miller thought about it for a second hesitation now drives dishing it now to warley hard strong drive on the Baseline got back his own Miss and will now go to the free throw line to shoot a couple and thatll be the fifth foul on Dio so yoro Dios day is done as he fouls warley on the way up Music Timeout on the floor each of the teams heading to their respective huddles and as I mentioned yo Dio fouling out and so again both of these teams riding that tight Music rope trying to get their best Playmakers on the floor trying to keep them from fouling out of the game still with four five minutes left Dio a red shirt freshman getting his footing here in college basketball a guy who came to basketball late actually played a lot of soccer in high school heres warley good looking free throw Sean thats the 23rd Point Florida state has scored tonight off of these free throws theres been a lot of foul trouble on both sides of the ball in Florida State and winter both doing a good job knocking these points down we seen 52 now make it 53 total shot and that one is missed threepoint game still one possession between the NES and the Eagles Johnson Working on gaining back it back out now down low tford hes got four tford looking for room swatted Away by Chandler Jackson green keeps his feet inbounds Florida State comes away with another turnover green to warley Chandler Jackson Green from the free throw line kicks it back out top to warley 10 left and thatll be a bump on on du Applause set and if thats on duet which it should be that is five coach Brer really unhappy with that call you do not want to see your leading scorer leave the game when you are three points down with 4 and a half minutes to go the transfer from Fort Valley State who has asserted himself oh so well in the D1 ranks this season and had nine points and four boards in this game gets called for a bump on jayen warley and just like that Alexander his day is done everybody playing as tough as they can its been an allout effort if your KJ duet fing out of the game here you can only be happy with your Music performance so wys got a couple of opportunities here to stretch the lead first one is Applause good theres Mark Brer looking on you mentioned he was frustrated with the call you hate to see your leading scorer go out on a fifth foul that looked like that but thats certainly what took place and warley steps up big time from the free throw line Florida state has a fivepoint lead and for this winth team thats looking for their signature when you do not want to see your big players fouling Music Applause out cord called for the travel move that pivot foot and thats to travel all Applause Music day 21 turnovers by the Eagles that hurts certainly does floa state that number flipped only 12 theyre happy with that I mean more than coach ham would like to see you know that but being able to limit it to 12 they havent had one in a while thats a good sign Jackson left hand denied blackton strong on the defensive effort now here comes Harrison still just a twoscore game driving hard to the basket and will earn a trip to the free throw line thatll go on Jaylen warley thatll be just his second of the game the nolles are trying to cling on to a fivepoint lead stretched it out a bit a lot of Florida State scoring has come from the free throw line in fact 25 of 55 points coming from the charity Applause Music stri Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music Watkins strong take to the basket but Off the Applause Mark Applause Spears Big Time turnover stole that one away heres green for the Applause trailer largest lead of the game for Florida State with an eightpoint edge over winr Harrison trying to erase it and learn a trip to the free throw line hell shoot a couple thats a foul on Jaylen gainy you cannot leave Darren Green Jr open like that uncontested its going to go in nearly every single time theyre starting to find their way and Primo Spears as well really jelling with this team Big Time dish Big Time bucket Darren Green Jr averaging nearly three threepointers per game thats fourth best in the ACC Harrison good on the first free Applause Music throw and he makes them both Le trim down to six inside the final three minutes here in Tallahassee Applause Music State tried to connect a few passes they were moving the ball pretty well they were looking to find Darren Green Jr in the corner found their own Music bench Timeout on the floor winthrip called a 32nd time out here with 245 left every possession especially for winr down six so incredibly important absolutely again thats the signature win that win thri needs if theyre able to pull through it the tonight and for Florida State youve got to win this one right youre in a seven game home stand here game three of that home stand youre trying to find your momentum you had a fantastic game just a few nights ago youve got to be able to continue that momentum and get ready to contend in the ACC and certainly Florida state would like to build off the crowd who they just brought to their feet off that last three absolutely the crowd is good tonight but guys let me tell you I have been here for 4 years I graduated 2 and a half years ago I have some of the best memories of my life as a fan in these stands Im surprised that more students have not been out here these last couple Seasons if you are listening and you are a student guys youve got to come out and support this team coach Hamilton 75 years old a legend in this game a Hall of Fame coach hes on the sidelines they need you in the stands yeah this is a Florida State team trying to build that momentum trying to build that energy trying to find a way even with a couple of players injured off the floor they look like they could be closing in but there is a lot of work still to do with 240 left in regulation Nick Johnson bringing it across winr has trimmed the lead to six theyre looking to eat into it a little further Applause Music Harrison nearly traveled got it back out L the state got the double team but what a shot by Kelton Applause tolford timeout Florida State 62 time out Music look at wi through contested tford plays again so physical Sean hes only 195 lbs standing at 67 hes able to get through three Defenders put that ball up he leads by example this coach says crer is so happy with the way that he Alexander un and I mentioned theyre on a seven game home stand its the second longest home stand that this program has enjoyed in its history so some par some symmetry some opportunities here for Florida State that they would love to take advantage of four more games until January 9th and theyll finally start going on the road again three of those games are going to be getting into the heart of ACC play youll want to be here in the Donell Tucker civer Center FSU picked 11th in the ACC preseason po a legitimate chance here if you can string together some momentum to pick up a couple of big ACC wins at the start of the traditional portion of ACC play Spears over a Defender and tford comes down with the rebound you got fouled I Believe by Watkins going over the Music Applause Music back 24 fouls each way in this game tford has a chance here to trim it back down to a one possession Applause game in and Applause out Crosser started this game standing up in arms on the sideline really the whole half and now here in the second half I dont think Ive seen him stand up once hes absolutely locked in and tford does just that turns it into a one possession game threepoint lead for Florida State and how big is this possession here what can you do who can you find how can you cash this in the game is slowed down a little bit coming off the free throws so you got to do what theyre doing now youve got to move and youve got to pass and youve got to create space and find a Shoto Spears working with it on the wing warley top of the key hesitates spins left left hand good youve talked about it time and time again good things happen when Jaylen warley gets down in the post thats a perfect shot there a great possession by Florida State nlls brought the double team on toall for he gets out of it final minute here in Tallahassee Harrison driving Baseline knocked away stolen away Darren Green Jr to the house theyve played great defense all night you only get those opportunities by playing good defense Darren Green Jr takes it all the way to the house and is jir Watkins do Nick Johnson fouling jir Watkins saying were not going to have part two of those fireworks Florida state two huge Steals and a huge Slam in transition a smooth move and a big time dunk right when you need it Applause most sevenpoint lead for the nlls Darren Green Jr eight points tonight stepped up in so many other ways for his teammates here in Tallahassee huge moment for the nolles right there and Watkins trying to pad that lead a little bit further misses the front end of his two free throws Music FL State averaging 138 per game tonight theyve made 25 winr right at their Music Applause average Timberman with it up top wins got to go Johnson pull up three over Deontay green got the Applause roll its a big time score there going into a itll be warly to send it in for Florida State and you have to imagine there will be plenty of pressure on this inbounds Music Applause Music Applause pass Music he gets it in nickelberry nickelberry is fouled itll be Chase Claxton coming in with the Music reach and so heres Josh Music nickelberry his division one career began at Louisville never really got going for a couple of reasons he had some injury issues and also as he was starting his career it was during that that weird funky stop start period with Co and so never really got the wheels off the ground if you will he ended up transferring to L did a nice job at Lal he was one of the a10s leading Shooters and last year was the A10 Sixth Man of the Year its a good pick up for Florida State especially considering the depth that coach Hamilton wants to have now 109 points per game 40 from the free throw there it is that Sixth Man of the Year hes definitely been an impact transfer hasnt played as much as you might think he would but thats cuz that coam style as soon as he continues to get in system nickelberry will see the court a little bit more now a big time three another huge three for Harrison he splashes it through this time here comes the pressure on Primo Applause Spears down Music first Spears head to the Music Music line hes made a bunch of free throws already in his three game long Florida State Career these ones particularly important that makes it twoscore game this for a little extra padding and its good Primo Spears into double figures once again for the Music nolles Timberman gets it into Johnson Johnson pull it blocked Watkins brings it down hes fouled and hell make a trip to the charity strike Jamir Watkins really the impact player of this game for Florida State hes been phenomenal on defense blocks turnovers Big Time scores good earned trips to the charity strike hes been all around tonight for Florida State now hes going to get two more Watkins the ACC coplayer of the week back on November 27th after scoring 37 points recording 15 rebounds and 12 assists in the sunshine Slam Tournament in Daytona Beach wins over UNLV and an upset win over number 18 Colorado part of that tournament Ed the slam MVP one of the leaders in a variety of statistical categories for the nolles and of course it just makes sense he comes away with a big block and earns a trip to the free throw line in these waning Applause seconds Music Applause sixpoint lead for the Applause NOS Harrison looking for space step back three its short Millers got it and the NS have won it 67 61 an allout fight from both of these teams if youre either one of them you cant disappointed Florida State finding a way their second straight win theyve got four more at home before they hit the road big momentum I think you said it finding a way to win there is incredible value in that and the nolles are going to be flying home for their holiday break
