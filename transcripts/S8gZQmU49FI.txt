performance off their game like that Starling and the orange coming off a 7765 win that we mentioned against NC State of the dome in which they led by as many as 21 away we go from Connie Forum Eagles in the white control with Jaden Zachary part of that starting group with post we showed you they averaged 30 a game they were both scoreless its an early turnover from Quinton post after those seven of 22 BC had against Syracuse I think he needs to get inside hes just so much bigger than Malik Brown on the inside when hes on the perimeter these turnovers are coming on the perimeter and thats where Malik is so active with his hands quick hands quick feet hes just one of the more athletic guys hes giving Quint and close trouble in the perimeter saw the Syracuse starters Malik Browns been great since stepping in as a starter and he played a big part against Quinton post So speaking of Syracuse forcing turnovers as they did for red atre on Saturday he was overjoyed with their defensive effort in the first half against the wolf back he has and he should be its not often for a program to play zone for 47 years and you get into man principles and these guys adapt to it and buy into it so quickly Jaden Zachary starts the scoring the senior point guard and third leading scorer who is Big down the stretch in the win Saturday for BC at Notre Dame Zachary is a big strong on guard hes 62 hes over 200 lb and physically he can get wherever he wants so its a good time for him to knock down his first jump shot here is Starling sophomore Notre Dame transfer finds Judah Mintz the oranges top scorer and number three in the Applause ACC heres Chaz Kelly d zero getting another start his third straight with claudell Harris the second leading scorer for Boston College again coming off the bench Ben Zachary and Alay couldnt connect and its the second Eagles turnover you got to do a better job of taking care of the basketball two turnovers in your first three possessions there andag Bay was able to get his hands on he had a direct line to the basketall min needs somewhere to go with post matched up on him and now Justin Taylor gives it back to Judah minz knocked down 14 free throws in the win against NC State tried one for d K is doing a great job of giving him space and fting him to take the jump shot really trying to keep him out of the paint Prince Al draws a foul underneath well Earl grants Boston College team coming off a sweep of Notre Dame three and six in the ACC 128 overall he said they got over the hump with that win against the Irish Saturday sometimes just getting a road win like that just does a lot for your confidence and it was great because they were in foul trouble posting play as much because he got in early foul trouble and you saw your his scores are starting to figure it out and come around I think he feels comfortable with this BC unit at their best basketball is still yet to come Zone here from Syracuse as theyll often do on Baseline out of bounds yes T to shoot for Zachary who moved it for Prince Alig Bay only knocked out four triples All Season you still want to get a paint touch if you can you dont mind a three but you want to get it inside before you take threes against that zone Chris Bell wanted a foul from Elite Bay didnt get it Elite Bay goes up and it was contested by Bell here comes the orange plays it the fastest tempo of any team in the ACC according to kenpong mince off the bouns and mince BR can follow three three great job there not filing on mens penetration dein mlon been surging how do you do that against Jud avoid fouling when hes so crafty and so Shifty he is but you just cant go for a SP just sit back and when he elevation you just stay there hold the ground you cant buy in any of his F hes really Shifty Starling short and thats a lot easier said than done obviously with the amount of free throw attempt that hes gotten but when he gets down heel he just attacks angles and he forces contact in the orange 0 for six shooting from the floor and a slow start for both sides offensively Quinton Post told us today hes got to get more post touches has to get early positioning the CR caused a lot of problems three weeks ago and doing so again here today third turnover there just great defense there by Malik Brown mens telegraphed it and now Zachary post power move to the C when he gets it in the post instead of trying to back Malik Brown down I think hes realizing how much stronger in The Leverage that he has its not always easy posting up a smaller guy but what he can do turn and face and use his length he told us I got sped up thats frustrated in the first meeting sometimes you get frustrated because you just feel like the guyss have your number great drive there by Taylor to get Syracuse on the board but what he can do is in the post get in the post turn it fakes you dont have to back him down and so watch him top left of your screen Brown now fronting League Bay was looking for the high low so youre saying face up here yes turn and face and just shoot over there you go thows a foul instead on Malik Brown slow start offensively BC up by two 5 minutes in and what kind of impact will Quinton post have today for the Eagles and the rematch against the oranges as a small business owner I knows youre posting up smaller guys they have leverage on you and its difficult to get positioned and get deeper against him and guards are coming in there digging if he turns in face he can see the help and he can just turn face and drive it I think thats his advantage over Malik Brown back in a minute will be difficult Brown had four Steals and four blocks against Post in the first meeting and red Entre said to his pregame on the floor tonight he thinks Browns a good match up because of the quickness because of the hands really good hands its difficult for any big he matches up well on the perimeter so but when youre posting him theyre digging in off help and sometimes theyll even double so again when he get to the inside just turn in face sometimes just Elevate over you got a couple inches on well this and Syracuse is started out one of seven from the floor with a couple of turnovers heres bell with a third Syracuse turnover and Jaden Zachary pushes all the way to the basket Syracuse defense forced 22 turnovers in the first match up you see BC coming out now defensive end of the floor theyre creating turnovers and turning them into fast break points Earl Grant wants this program to be defined by its Applause defense Vince gives it up for brown only his third career three you can tell thats a Scouting Report there he doesnt take many coach of Staff will probably say hey the first two were on me theyll force him to knock down a couple before they come out and try to guard him thats what you do as a coach youre allowed to yeah yeah you say two the third one then you got to go as Manson in Off the Bench 46 from three shoveled it back for Quinton post around it out and Taylor with the Applause rebound heres men scoreless so far the first 6 minutes and you knew that wasnt going to last long no not at all not getting to that right hand so crafty getting in the paint getting down heill and great job out there by Quinton post not fouling again he fouled out in the first meeting and he fouled out in the win over Notre Dame on the road in South Ben Saturday spins on Brown and got it back and scored you see he didnt see the double team coming Baseline there and nearly lost it thats what I mean when I say sometimes just turning fa and got to know theyre going to offer help either digging or coming in traps 50y year senior who was preseason second team ACC Bell on the Baseline draws a Zachary Applause foul hes trying to post Brown does a great job getting him off his spot and when he gets to that second dribble theyre coming he didnt see teror coming Baseline side now hes got to make a mental note of that knowing the help is coming from the Baseline side and his teammates got to help him too they got to do a really good job of diving from a weak side so he could skip it across court and read where the hells coming from this end of the floor what have you seen from Syracuse so far offensively cuse just moving the ball I mean they they theyre trying to figure out how they want to attack this team off the bounce theyre going to take threes when theyre there but they want to get in the paint they control the game by not just their intensity on the defensive end on the offensive End by pressuring you and they doing that because all four or five of their guys on the off always on the court can attack you off the bouns first meeting they won by 10 and led by as many as 19 points although BC came back to grab a lead inside of 8 minutes to go in the second half of that game without the two best players scoring which is unbelievable youre able to do something like that even late on the road at the Dome 99 hour score 7 Minutes in vence caring out some space on Zachary Starling popped free on a reverse quader Copeland Starling left alone knocks it down continuing his hot streak from behind the line great job by Copley coming in getting the offensive rebound and kicking it out thats the best time to get a three is after an offensive rebound this there been a lot of talk about JJ Starling and the improved shooting and the mechanics red arrey said to us earlier today it is as simple as Mechanics for the difference in Starling shot and its just confidence as well you know when you put the work in sometimes you just trust to work its a nice sh no hits no hesitation feed is Music ready see what hes done the last four games three of them have been excellent including the career high 26 Saturday at the dome for JJ Starling Syracuse on a 102 run shot clock winding down mton got it from Madson banging with Benny Williams no great defensive there by the orange Starling he said its confidence as well he runs down his own Miss finds minz no dice and cleared by Armani Mighty you can see theyre sagging off mints a little bit theyre conceding that shot for him is youre more afraid of him just getting in the paint Mighty had it on his knees and its a held ball in the arrow points to Syracuse when we come back well JJ stylings getting involved for Syracuse now up by three on the road knocking down a corner three there after a great offensive rebound Warren coming out knocking down threes from behind the line its coming Saturday and for the 49th time its a top 10 matchup between both these teams in the previous 48 theyve each one 24 and the points in those top 10 meetings about as close as it gets throw the rankings out no one cares thats just going to be a blood bath out there and I do care about the rankings though theyre both top 10 no no they are theyre both top 10 but it doesnt matter those kids just play for that its the best robry in college athletics and everyone she tuned in should be fun to watch Malik Brown adds to the Syracuse spurt here its 70 over the last couple of minutes we seen now down by five Quinton post on the bench for Earl Grant getting ready to come back in heres claudell Harris averaging 14 a game coming off the bench the last few games like we said a league b backs down Starling Alik Bay finishes without Post in there Alik Bay can go inside and he has a physical advantage over most Wings there gets the angle and finishes sophomore from Minneapolis at 67 225 Copeland comes up to get it brown slipped it moved it to the corner and now Starling off the shot F finishes that is good look at offense the play was made by Brown there catching that pocket pass there on the move and then skipping it to the corner and this is what AR told us about he Brown does so many things and where you got to be careful here is is mighty handling the ball in the perimeter against him his active hands you see him reaching he can wreck a game plan like this one creating opportunities so kader copelan who got bumped by claudell Harris you said it all started on this possession with brown just coming off the screen see the pocket pass there and now when he fires that thing in the weak side corner there its two on one its a great drve Drive in the and here Copeland just gets in the parket lane got fouled earlier I think haris fou twice in one possession didnt get called for the first one but they they called the second one turnovers like we said big issue season High 22 of them for B see in the first meeting is quader Copeland continues to politic for that to be a shooting foul most teams arent used to a center being able to pressure when a guy like Quinton post is on the perimeter hes hes usually a press releaser and against this team Malik Brown hands his active hands and quick feet presses the ball so much ooh that was very close called the back court violation on Benny Williams right down the line from our view he tried to keep keep his foot there yeah he slip well broke the plane a little bit yeah I like definitely better than mine R children Mike Bodo our entire crew with you Jaden Zachary into a pullup it doesnt drop and the rebound to Brown who stuck the stashing in the first meeting 19 points eight rebounds four assists and we mentioned the four Steals and four blocks man hangs in the air for his second bucket you got to stop the ball with a ball screen with Mitch he cant Retreat he has what we call a never ending dribble he continues to press the defense getting the paint thats the last place you want to see juditz post on a face up found Zachary on the dribble drive and Copeland down with a rebound orange by seven Williams in transition attacking follow not there for brown as post went straight up on Benny Williams great verticality there not trying to block the shot and draw the foul and offensive foul here though on Quinton post trying to get positioning on Malik Brown this is where Quinton post has to settle now gets his first foul he dont want to pick up a second one Applause and cant get frustrated there with the extra physicality hes going to receive yeah they actually called it on Post in the post and Brian oconnell just walked by to confirm with us yeah Brown got away with the first bump and Quint and post tried to retaliate and got called for the second one man s the hand off from Brown timeout Earl Grant Judah mitz has entered the chat for the orange surging in this first half of the final on the Music road its bow time hey sweetie hey Mom I land at three any ideas for your first me bra did a whole lot of everything in the first meeting for Syracuse against Boston College and more of the same today well hes doing everything I mean hes so athletic and there he gets the hand off he gives it the mince and hes catching the pocket pass hes skipping hes affecting the game on the defensive end of the floor pressuring centers and most centers arent expecting that and then any offense he gives you is just a bonus and Audrey told us he think that theres more within his offensive page that he can give us and this was the stat line from the first meeting only player in the country who has put together a line but those numbers are better in a game this year yeah see hes getting frustrated post is using his arms and then Harris RS a foul hey coming up next here on acc Network part two of our double header at Little John Louisville and Clemson a Clemson team smarting from the trip to Cameron on Saturday yeah that was a great game all the way down to the end and Clemsons glad to be back home they had Florida State and Duke went one went one and one on that road trip Malik Brown to the bench with two fouls and Donald H Jr stops the 60 qes run he spent quite a bit of time in warmups and after shoot around the day working on that shot its got to be happy the first one went in for him red shirt freshman out of Virginia Beach Copelands a foul Music underneath great job with the movement on offense by the orange and DC got a little too spread out giving a lane to drive got to be cant give up driving Lanes you got to be connected and pulled in and knowing the orange Mitch all of them want to drive and get downhill including quader copelan sophomore spark plug goes to the line after Whats called the second foul on Jaden Zachary and called the shooting foul as well Errol Grants got a decision to make here with Zachary and want his experienced guard in on the floor but probably got to take him out it looks like there might be some confusion on the BC sideline of who the foul was called on there were two Eagles Defenders right by Copeland on the drive when he came to his jump stop but it is on Zachary it is his second and the decision made to yank out the senior point guard Now look for BC to did Jud to mention some ball screens with the wings and try to get him to switch on her biger body and get a mismatch in the post and get him inside fouls called on the perimeter here its on Kei carry who after squaring off with DJ burns on Saturday gets some more run back in his home state and lets look for Quinton post as well Malik Browns out getting the blow Currys in try to get him some touches while Brown not guarding him right now with his active hands Brown on the bench with his two fouls so its the young big man tasked right now in the middle of the zone for the orange for Kelly cant pass around the perimeter the balls got to get inside Harris trying to disprove that notion yeah well give to him at 39 let him shoot it that always works that always works 14 a game for the Charleston Southern transfer copelan another foul Syracuse ahead by four on the road at BC trying to knock down some triples get back in this for Syracuse on Baseline and sideline out of bounds yeah when youre attack you usually see ham with the ball there and theyre trying to theyre running them through they want to overload the weak side there and you can see JJ Starling had to stop the ball didnt try to get to the shooter and couldnt get there but ideally with that shot you want Harris Jr taking it but if you cant you got to see you want to see BC trying to get the ball in the paint a little bit more first points for claudell Harris who had nine Saturday against Notre Dame all in the second half including a couple of big threes that Earl Grant said afterward were huge and separated us from the Irish he did he got it going there in the second half and starting to get comfortable and I think the biggest adjustment for him is figuring out how teams are scheming him he isnt just a guy on The Scouting Report now its just a name now youre figuring out how you got to give him special attention and hes adjusting with that fouls on Applause Kelly spacing of VC is just off and there they got to get Cutters they got to get better movement that time you got three guys on one side it allows the defense to help and recover and not able to punish him Applause so you dont you need space playing against Syracuse with the active hands and the turnovers that they force they force 7 BC turnovers carry on a lot from Copeland now six career points for the sophomore Pete carry the orange just got so many guys that just theyre all they all do so many different things you know theyre not going to just Hopeland takes the best perimeter guy you see him now chasing Harris he Prides himself in that active hands pressuring the ball hes not a guy you think of as a as a ball screen option Kelly tough shot on the Baseline over carry CH Kelly put in a lot of work as well and game starting to slow down for him hes picking it up on a defensive end really well and starting to knock down midrange shots until his three ball gets consistent he had nine on Saturday as well hes only had one game this year with more points than that carry from the elbow with a face up on Kelly couldnt finish it and a foul goes against Syracuse Applause underneath well talked about how active is defensively they play at a fast tempo and they force a ton of steals and they score off those turnovers they create they do they just really active and theyre really disruptive what theyre trying to do and offensively they just want to space and driveing create opportunities to either finish in the rim draw fouls and drive Closeouts they want to get you in Music rotation post pops loves this spot but he walked with it thats turnover number four for Quinton post I think sometimes again he can roll on some of these hes popping quite a bit either take this shot there should be no hesitation there its a great job here by Copeland throwing the lob there by Curry getting in the pain of his size and thats what I mean when I roll sometimes as a big thats the pressure you put on a rim and post is popping and hes allowing the defense to recover Benny Williams no Harris blows by men to the basket that may be the worst defensive possession by the orange there no one stopped the ball and great job by Harris identifying that he hit the gas men finds carrye for the Stop we talked about it in the open and thats been the biggest adjustment due to mens games just is playmaking ability he doesnt just draw fouls and put pressure on you finding teammates like that strong finish there by har Harrys come off the bench and in 3 minutes with four points has matched his previous career point total post scores and trims it to two again catching it on the move I dont think they can guard him on the move he has too much is too skilled and has too much in his bag sagged off the Min again yeah there was there was just confusion on the ball screen coverage where they switching or were they hedging and recovering that time they didnt do either and and the men picks up his second foul getting aggressive and hes pleading with red atrey to stay in just a great drop driving there forcing rotation then post comes back again turning facing and just powering through carry I think he can do that against anybody getting angles in hes such a skilled passer he can see where the help is coming from if he just tries to post up help is going to come and sit in his lap and I dont think he should settle and he was jawing as well well with Benny Williams who picks it from Deon mcglockton here post never one to shy away from fiery Chatterton got pushed down by his own teammate Jaz Kelly and JJ Starling made them both pay youre taught to do that and youre told to do that sometimes push a guy when it when you cant hear him and I think he pushed that time a little too hard mton saw the opening and had it blocked by moner hea thats it H thats what you want to do drive it even if you dont get the shot block getting off his rebound teams are scrambling around always a good thing to find Manson when his speed are set knocked down three threes and had 11 points in the first meeting between these Applause teams Bell had 20 in that game including four triples shut off by Matson toss back out for Williams shot clock winding down Bell pulls up offt Target well defended by mson great defense there by BC you got to run Bell off the line Harris on the crossover finds the cutter and its Applause mlon time out Applause Syracuse great job there by BC attacking the paint finding Cutters just a great move here by Harris with the EUR own finish got a ball game here in Chesnut Hill you and auto owners help make it possible its the best thing thats ever happened to me womens basketball double header for you right here on acc Network and the ESPN app this week two great rivalry matchups number 17 Virginia Tech host Virginia at 6 Eastern and then number 24 North Carolina takes on Fifth ranked NC States weve got some foul trouble on both Sid for BC point guard Jaden Zachary has two and for Syracuse Alik Brown has had two and Jud Min as a couple as well I think Brown getting two was a big reason why BC got back in the game he was so disruptive he was giving Quinton post some trouble on the perimeter and active hands and actually doing a great job of moving the basketball and the things that he can do on the offensive end is a big part of the orange Bell officer screen comes up short but it belongs to Boston College so 302 to go in this first half in a twopoint game second meeting between these two with Syracuse at 5 and four in the ACC tied for six winners of nine of their last 12 Kelly straight on for three great job there by Chaz Kelly coming out under that middle ball screen JJ Starling went under stop right behind the screen got his feet under him and knock down a three Kelly had been 28 from three this year KY cup a little bit out of control Kelly pushes the Eagles run Matson shot fake oh and JJ Starling went down hard lets hope JJ Starling is okay Applause Madson got him in the air with the shot fake in the corner and Starling went somersaulting over Applause him Starling turns onto his back as red As head coach comes out to check on yeah its unfortunately hit head first Applause and good sign to see him up Walkins back to the bench sophomore from Baldwinsville New York second Le leading score for the orange of course the transfer from Notre Dame really finding his stride over the last couple of weeks the best for him I dont know if youve ever had that happen to you but its pretty scary because when they take your legs under you you just spinning so fast and not just landing on your head its just uh its its scary I think it scares you more than actually sometimes just hitting the ground and I got to imagine its rather unavoidable as a player I mean you youre going all out trying to defend a 46 threepoint shooter course youre going to go in the air yeah and its you know youve seen so many different things happen for thats a good thing he seems to be okay and you know just getting back to his bench you know theyll do the test and make sure but youre just glad hes able to walk away well Matson puts BC up by three for these last couple of possessions the Eagles hadnt LED since it was 98 here in this first half Taylor against post who went straight up by blocked in the ring rebound and he drew a foul what a terrible Applause shot well coming up at the half Justin Walters and Luke Hancock are in the studio well have a lot to talk about with this being the first game of our double header here on ACCC network with Louisville Clemson to follow and on the flats in midtown Atlanta number three team in the country is that Georgia Tech Carolinas got the Applause lead how good is Carolina I I I think their record is is shows how good they are in the third ranked team in the country its not by accident that team is so connected and playing so well and more importantly theyre defending at such a high level so it doesnt matter where theyre playing now home on the road defense is traveling and theres not a better guard in the country right now playing better than RJ Davis and what hes doing and let me ask you this is there a player in the country playing better than RJ Davis right now well outside of Purdue I dont know there is I I I think Zach Zach Ed is this dominant player in college I think hell be a twotime player of the year National player of the year but RJ Davis deserves a seat at the table need to be invited to the banquet for that one because hes I think hes a definitely runaway first half ACC Player of the Year Bell had a contested by mlon and the foul and now BCs got it again up by five now inside of 2 minutes to go until halftime really been in a run without Malik Brown in the game Applause and mlon on the block with the left hand makes it a 14 zip run no pic J no pic thats the ball Al just trying to hold the time and hope he can finish out this half and theyre really missing Malik Brown right now and then losing JJ Starling yeah they had to put Brown back into the game and he just missed the triple playing with the two fouls here in the first half and matched up with post he hged on Kelly and now Manson cant hang on to it and DCs 10th turnover just a great job there and just finding mlon hes really good at catching the ball and the move himself and posting up and I think hes a matchup nightmare for anyone qu Post told his Deon mls been such a force inside and always plays within himself he knows what he is and thats a great thing Harris tipped it and it does stay with the orange I think mlin does a great job of ball screening and if you switch a smaller guard on him look for him to get in the post and take advantage of it I often say you can tell a player knows what he is by his field goal percentage you youre shooting 63 in the ACC you know where your shots are coming from and you got to Corral the ball here you cant leave Post oneonone men walks with it second Jud turnover and its back to BC up seven great job by post moving his feet you get the assignment SP you keep him on one side you go straight up what are you doing doesnt try to swipe down thats what post needs to do when not pick up foul trouble in any game which is what he did in the first match up with the two teams and Jud minut after attempting 18 free throws in the wi Saturday has not been to the free throw line here today Harris no and then a foul comes on the floor against Syracuse on the rebounding action first out Chris Bell so had Jude dein who gets to the free throw line as much as pretty much anyone in the country the only Power conference player in the entire nation to make more free throws and attempt more then Jude dein is the national Player of the Year you mentioned Zach eeve and at his size its an amazing thing you know to be able to endure that kind of punishment every game and still come out and line up every game and go after it again that way and it shows you the mental toughness that he plays the game with Syracuse would love to trim this sevenpoint deficit headed to halftime then got bumped by Kelly n drives lost it and it belongs to BC frustration setting in for Jud here late in the first half well hes driving into you when he gets the angle he forces the officials to blow his whistle but post does a great job moving his feet showing his hands and Min not getting the calls hes accustomed to getting when he forces contact like like that and great job there by BC nson needed somewhere to go turned it over to Copeland who got it off and comes up short so we head to Half Time with Boston College on a surge to finish out that first half and ahead of Syracuse 37 30 first halfs been a good one to start this double header on accn lets get you to the studio with Luke Hancock heres Justin Walters when Malik Brown picked up his second foul in the first half Syracuse was up 201 so until he came in late in the first half Syracuse got out scored 22 to1 and its his impact on the defensive end that we know about but its his impact offensively that just goes unnoticed because sometimes he gets the hockey assist he sacrifices he screens hes he just makes winning plays well starters are out there on both sides to begin the second half and thats great to see for JJ Starling and the orange Jaden Zachary scores after he dealt with a couple of fouls in the first half as well yeah he hit his first shot of the game and got those two quick ones and its good to see him get downhill use his physical body and knock down his first shot of the second half lets monitor the foul trouble with these guys to see who picks up if anyone picks up that third foul quick the second half here Syracuse 5 and four in the ACC with the chance for a quad two win today as brown turns over looking for Judah minz Syracuse trying to sweep AC trying to make it backto back ACC wins right now Joe Lenards got them in what he calls consider 89th overall he says for the 68 team field Kelly turned the corner to the cup mix up there on the orangan in they coverage and Kelly making it known that he he might not want he might not give up that starting spot hes really starting to play well averages for a game at nine Saturdays we told you against Notre Dame and is up to seven now again starting for claudell Harris he seems more comfortable coming off the bench well I think hes just comfortable accepting the road I think his adjustment its just the schematic schematic things that teams were doing against him you know when you struggle when youre focal of teams defense and now hes starting to figure that out Starling right down the lane and it rolled off this is as large as the lead has been on either side tonight DC by 11 Zachary hiding behind the post screen for three and a quick timeout from Syracuse backto back buckets by Zachary here to pull up in the Paint This Time Grump drag screen with Quinton post you go under cant do that against me Music BCs on a 21 zip run going back to the first half and these two guys that we spotlighted off the top Quinton post and Jaden Zachary been a lot better tonight yeah theyre combin seven to 10 from the floor tonight just a great start you can see theyre more assertive more aggressive this team was very competitive and took the lead late in the first game without either of those guys scoring and tonight theyre leading the charge on the offensive end of the floor big reason why they were up 14 here early in the second half heres Judah minz driving dish to Taylor first two minutes second half and a 14point deficit for the orange Crow gave it up fell off the shot pick lost the handle and it belongs to BC so think about this Syracuse with the JJ styling jumper went up 30 to 23 with 424 to go in the first half and then BC closed on a 14 run and theyve got all seven points out of halftime as well and theyre doing it on the know the defensive end to the floor you see there the its an unforced turnover there but theyre really getting out the defensive end and theyre making shots the Syracuse has not stopped these guys the only thing that stopped him is just turning the ball over like that 12 for the team five for post and Copeland cannot stop the run you Boston College got to get a shot up you can ill afford to continue to turn the basketball over post spinning on Brown and he turns it over again they dont get the shot up there and that ones on Quinton post there you saw earlier in the first half double teams coming from the Baseline there and thats what you got to be conscious of you cant turn it over and give the team to come back Syracuse Orange Is Lost right now on the offens been to the floor dont want to get turned turn over to get them in transition to get them going a league May got free on a total breakdown from the orange Applause defensively back to a 14point margin for BC Brown moves it off the block Starling Rises and connects JJ Starling second three and hes got 10 the deficit down to Applause 11 you got to find Starling and you got to get to its the other guys turning down shots to find those guys and its one of the reasons why the Orange is so good M glockton left alone at 37 from three let the ball find the open guy no need to force anything just take care of the basketball mens got to his spot hes got 13 both teams are starting to heat up I should say the orange are starting to join the offensive party Austin has had the their way scoring plenty of time inside a 16 to go second half got to be careful with the basketball against Malik Brown who forces a tie up and gets it back on the Arrow as post and brown swap some pleasantries afterward JJ Starling just knocking down at Wing three good to see him back on the speed recover from that game but Deon mlock knocks it down let them up next right here on acc Network we take you to Little John for Clemson hosting Louisville after the Tigers almost pulled off and upset at Cameron falling 7271 PJ Hall and old Syracuse friend Joe Gerard whos connecting on 41 from three star for the Tigers thats a big one for Clemson trying to get back on track well just to be back home I mean I know they disappointed in the D game but not many teams are going to go on a road at Florida State and at Duke and get two wins lucky to get one and they did they got to get home and defend home court Copeland with a drop off for Malik Brown who gets it to go plus a foul we talked about it with Malik Brown just what he does and here just sets the screen and youre talk when they get that deep you got to s post gets over and difficult to crack down on the weak side as a guard and try to get that y outside and great job by Brown just catching it high and finishing High hes a much improved free throw shooter this year but couldnt stamp a threepoint Play mlon Just bullies Benny Williams its a grown man move there by mton and again I I I call him a matchup nightmare because it doesnt matter the size you put on him he just figures it out he punishes smaller Defenders brown with the size advantage on Kelly and hes got another chance for a threepoint play talk about punishing switches and thats what we talk about with with bigs that time it was a lot but if you dont get it you either get it off the glass so hopefully your teammate find you there great job by Copeland throwing it over the top its impossible anybody to be on the backside just not much you can do fik brown the sophomore from Co Pepper for Ina again cant knock down the free throw Brown making a seven straight start since nem mcclouds put injury thatll keep him out of the year and necessitated surgery Kelly with a push off and an offensive foul and now Syracuse is fired up and has snatched back some momentum here well youre always going to be in a game when your identity is on the defensive end and great job by judan getting over that screen pressuring the right hand and Jaz Kelly used that left arm to push off the offensive end of the floor the Orange is starting to pick it up here so whats changed where they get Malik Malik Brown has changed I mean we talked about his impact hes scoring and here he is again after a pretty feed from Copeland and then Brown threw one at the feet of JJ Starling I think hes too unselfish there he had to layup if he wanted it he scored the last few times I think there for a reason and that time he tried to force it weak side skip and I think the layup was there if he wanted it DC by 10 a long way to go in this second half Bell Harris is in for Kelly mton short rebound Applause Brown just get brown in the ball screen and let him react to whats going on really good pass on the perimeter and he also Rose well here he is setting a screen for Starling short roll now he pops out cutting Williams feeds Copeland underneath gets the roll its a great offensive possession there body orange everyone touched it everyone moving it one more turning down a shot for a better shot or better opportunity and great finish there first points for Benny Williams who had 11 and5 on Saturday in the win against NC State and now Syracuse with it down just eight and on the Move Copeland feathers one to Brown oh thats pretty great job by the orange running it took a quick shot to get out and transition all these guys going attack you off the bounce they cut they move so well Brown and post are banging and this crowd is charged up oeland went High stepping down the floor Al League Bay muscles it in for two and an answer great job by League Bay catching it again finish him on this end look at the ball movement here back door cut reverse L to get back in it and League Bay just really getting into the chest of Benny Williams there and moving him just a physical Wing a league Bay threw it down after quader Copeland delivered a gorgeous feed to Malik Brown what Jud mens tell us last week he said I think the other team knows that when quader Copeland comes in now the game really starts well you love when a guy decides hes going to take the opposite teams best player and and again orange lineup they just un the ball moves and Goin was navigating and now brown sends it up top for Judah midz trying to cross up Harris on a step through its a foul on the floor drawn by Mintz against Harris got to show your hands on Judah Mintz hes just going to come right at you for contact theyre going to get the foul instead on armanii Mighty they say its his Music first they burned Boston College on the Baseline out of bounds a couple of times here and they did it again there a big emphasis of the BC team was the Baseline out of bounds plays when you know youre going to be in tight game sometimes coaches really focus on that the orange do a great job scoring on his sideline and Baseline out of bound plays sometimes that could be the difference in the game and they burn BC the first game Zachary Force One up mighty the offensive rebound a kick out for Harris who walks with it not enough ball movement on the offensive end of the floor for Boston College there Applause and got a move fortunate enough for Mighty to pick up that offensive rebound there and got to Harris on the Travel Syracuse with it down a half dozen Brown to the basket its down to four difficult match up there from Mighty I think Browns just too quick for him on the perimeter hes going to have to cushion him heidy the backup big who only averages 6 minutes a game has the back down Brown drop step cant finish with the left hand B it around and Zachary secures it Zachary knifes to the basket for two great job by Mighty just sticking with it missed his shot got his hand on it knocked it in the air and Copeland hangs in hits and has something to say to Mason Matson guys are chirping the intensitys picking up the orangs are fought back closed at the Applause four without posting the game now you can sense the orange of pressing the issue Syracuse has hit its last 10 shots from the floor and we go back and forth at Connie Borum Jaden Zachary dealt with foul trouble in the first half has stepped up in second and all the energy packed into quader copelin on the scene willing this group here in the second half back in this game and again remember they were up big with him in the first half and leading this game on a verge of running away in the first half and he got hurt and then it totally flipped BC goes on his BCT 24 20 210 run you know leading into the second half and now hes back out in the court and he has really been dominating this matchup Quint post I mean hes created 14 turnovers in two games and we still got 11 minutes to go in this one and hes the primary reason why his activity is hands and what hes done to post is frustrating tell you what too how fun did this building get just in the last few minutes of game action it did Syracuse fans showed up and showing showing out a little bit here its a lot of orange here there was a loud lets go orange chant that broke out during the break 11 to go second half shot clock winding down Harris too strong offensive rebound a leag May left it short Hopeland without numbers for Syracuse no whistle there Zachary tried to dry a foul Starling back ir and a league Bay the clear out on Williams good execution on both ends of the floor neither team finished it but and now Zachary draws a foul here on the drive hey Fridays ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tanom will come to you from Chapel Hill as they prep for Duke Carolina the show starts at 4 Eastern then the game Saturday at 630 over on ESPN and the app Zachary there did did his best du imense interpretation of just driving in hard and the pain forcing Conta bait the officials blow the whistle third foul on quader Copeland Al League Bay moved it for Madson BC up by four El Bay cuts into traffic and a turnover the 17th for the Eagles you got to avoid the Temptation there of just continue you see when the ball hits the paint theyre coming three players there the right read was to throw it out the post in the corner and wherever the ball is theyre going to have at least three Defenders there chasing it Copeland a hand off for brown those two have been in Rhythm here in the second half with Taylor and Bell on the bench for red arrey Copeland thought about it a couple of times through the legs on a drive with a reverse that he couldnt finish Williams saved it oh Brown from Copeland that is the second possession this half weve seen just unbelievable unselfishness moveing the basketball George doesnt care who scores it theyre just going to find the open guy you wont find a better basketball play on the offensive end of the floor than that all season long fouls on the floor on Jud to MZ quader Copeland has seven assists two of them this half have been spectacular hey look at this ball movement offensive rebound there wow just unselfish play and brown has been up for the challenge putting his team on a his back Music wow Manson oh round it out post the offensive rebound nearly lost it finds Zachary who hoists cant hit and Copeland to rebound as he is doing everything for the orange out of half time and a dangerous part for Boston College is earlier in the game when they was really scoring the basketball well it just kept turning it over now theyre gr cold and the orange are back in the game copelan Brown spins one out Copeland I think would rather pass not looking at his Target right now yeah he doesnt really want to score post cant finish and a lead Bay gets fouled on the follow but his unselfishness is contagious Im saying I think he would rather throw a no pass than actually face you up and look at you get some more satisfaction out of finding teammates and is what coach arrey talked about with him I mean hes hes some people are surprised with this offensive output and arrey said he has more to give us and were starting to see that I mean hes comfortable now hes not taking more threes and but catching it on the move and moving the basketball I think is just something that you know this league were fortunate in EAC to see I mean Quin post hasnt shown you much of that tonight but hes an elite ball mover and passer for a big guy and were watching these two guys go at it and quite honestly Malik Brown has had the upper hand last game and he so far has the upper hand in this one as well in the headtohead battles hes got 15 and five as you saw with post at seven points nine rebounds but those seven turnovers Prince elag Bay was good on the first 65 from the strike lead it just three after he split inside of nine to go second half with Randolph Childers Mike Monaco our entire crew with Applause you Copelands got six rebounds seven assists to go along with Five Points Min around the corner backs it out with 10 to shoot and triggers short offensive rebound Taylor now Starling and connect and post runs it down there someone else besides post got to get him M glassy BC with this line up skip for Harris Baseline Drive tipped Away by Brown Zachary feathered one in its last Touch by Al leag Bay and yet another Boston College turnover up to 18 of them I like The Look by Zachary I saw I saw what he saw and but you got three guys standing within 10 ft of one another theres no spacing you dont have to be a great shooter but you still need to space the floor on the drive Brown tries a foul mixed up on a defensive end right here with VC theyre not matched up I guess thats why hes trying to sell the foul those two have been banging now for three weeks but thats part of what brown has been doing little subtle bumps and post was trying to sell one there and the officials just didnt call it let me ask you this how do you think post has handled the mental and emotional side of it cuz he told us today that he needed to stay calm has he been less no I think hes frustrated more because I think its this was not what he wanted he had seven turnovers the first game and he already has that again Harris strs the three Harris Big Time bucket for BC to go up by six and then a league Bay commits the foul on quader Copeland oh this has been fun here in the second half VC led by as many as 14 Syracuse whittel it down but its VC thanks to claudell Harris up a half dozen down the stretch at Connie Music Forum its bow time get fired up tonight because bojang J minut told this youre always know whater Copeland is thinking youre always going to see what hes doing too because he makes his impact felt in so many ways he is and hes the emotional leader of this group I mean hes the guy that does all the vocalizing and communication with everybody and you can see here hes stuffing his stash sheet and his play rubs off on everybody and as they say the game that starts or he getting the game so you can see why when you put up numbers like this and youre in impacting the game in so many ways red atres been riding him in the second half same with Benny Williams too we have not seen much of Justin Taylor who is in there now at Chris Bell only played a couple of minutes since halftime as Syracuse has fought back youre just joining us BC closed the first half on a 140 run started the second half on a 70 run but after enduring that 21 zip stretch Syracuse has inch closer Starling misfires DC pushes Alig B attacks post couldnt handle it got it back on the second effort tosses it out for Kelly hes got to guard on him hes got to take advantage of this on the repost on Starling feeds Harris knocks it down its always a great idea to find a shooter and just that quick oand comes back and respond what a game hes having sevenpoint BC lead with seven to go and a match up between old Big East foes Syracuse has won the last 11 meetings Harris lost the shoe hes carrying it around trying to put it back on his right foot great job there by post but they got to go to him quick brown switched off and then he switch back on and gets his Ste celan and brown forced it Copeland got stets got it back Deli nearly fouled him Taylor moves it to Starling and now Syracuse will set things up with Mintz got a Corral the ball now with Jud mince has he Coral Applause it great job it away yeah great job there backing up on Jud Min KN one he wants to attack its a great job there in the post expect you see the help coming Baseline Applause there kicks it out haris sprays it knocks it down for three and just great effort there on the defensive end of the floor CH Kelly with an impact on both ends of the floor this game and numbers wont overwhelm you but hes been really solid play 24 minutes heavy load for the sophomore Harris shot fake to the elbow and all the way to the basket great move with the shot fake gets the defender in the air and he puts him on his hip we call that putting him in jail keeps him there and dont let him out and now Harris fouls mince hes going to the free throw line for the first time all game 34 minutes in yeah he shot fakes get shwed up in the air there and then he puts him on his hip never lets him get back in front of the ball and Judah Mitch comes back and reminds him Im the Im the best at that and actually draws the fouls and gets some free throws on the other end so just great jobs playing at a high level understanding get your defender in the air where you come off a b screen keep them on your hip dont let him get back in front and continue to get in the paint until you make a play well Syracuse is three of nine at the free throw line theyll look back at this and and know that in the game at this this tight this magnitude can afford to miss free throws like this and be three of Nine the 185th free throw attempt of the season for mint and that comes up short ninepoint margin haris is feeling it and its kick on Williams well because Boston College has punished the switching now the Orange is trying not to switch and now youre going to see the guards tring to bend out bend the corner on those screens and try to get downhill what is that make available for BC well it allows you to bigs now you can get some dump off passes some slips to do big youre not allow Harris knocks down another so that guy gets hot now hes picking it up hes got 16 Brown couldnt finish Brown saves it for Copeland on a Euro reaching around he draws the foul out of post is second how about Claude Dell Harris punishes his Zone again and with that kind of range standing there near the coachs box found himself a rhythm there and I thought yeah you can see post jumps to the side goes vertical but he jumps up got to go straight up and down there so Copeland to the line and for claudell Harris how about the turnar around for him went through two games the first Notre Dame meeting and then North Carolina where combined he was two for 24 from the floor yeah so they brought him off the bench against Virginia Tech he had 14 at Notre Dame brought him off the bench nine in the second half and then today not starting again 16 I think you just want him aggressive he knows hes going to finish the game whether he starts or whether he comes off the bench coming up on five to go Zachary tough shot look at the strength there hanging in the air knocking down that midrange jumping Benny Williams got bumped got it to go anyway I think Vinnie can do that whenever he wants with his size and I legibility get to his midrange shot timeout with 447 to go and in this second half we step aside for 30 and right back to Chestnut Music Hills this is just spectacular the stars have never been brighter thats our move womens college hoops on ESPN and a hey every Thursday well have a womens basketball double header for you right here on acc Network and the ESPN app number 17 Virginia Tech against Virginia starts us off at 6 Eastern then number 24 North Carolina takes on Fifth ranked NC States well here starting off our mens double header on accn got a good one between Syracuse on the road and Boston College hey coming up still to come here part two of our twin bill is louisv at Little John against Clemson who lardi right now has as a 6 hes got Syracuse under consideration but trailing by 10 on the road at Connie Forum DC gets it in the orange now extending their defensive Applause pressure and a foul is called on Syracuse pressuring Zachary looking for a trap and the orangs has to extend their defense now to down 10 here approaching four minutes in this game you cant you got to start chipping away here theyre going to gamble a little bit on the perimeter you got to watch them Malik Brown got quick hands just like that you got to watch his hands he knocked it off the leg of Chaz Kelly first so its an over and back and turnover number 20 and right on Q those hands of brown I you know its coming you got to put him away you got to have him off the ball and he just has unbelievable timing and youre just not accustomed to that with bigs theyre going to flip this call here where go stri go Ramy Steins comes over with an explanation for us and says that thats a rule change from just a couple of years ago where if the defender deflect it off the leg of the offensive player it is not a backt violation its great call great job by the officiating crew but you got to Applause know Harris wants another hes got another his fifth three tonight Harris just said get on my back Im taking you Applause home leads at 13 Brown risky pass finds starl Ling coming up on four to go in the hands of men around the screen to the elbow to Starling contested Applause three a great find there by Judah minz saw him out the corner of his eye didnt have to have a three there but great job finding his teammate well take a Timeout on the floor with 349 to go in BC at home up by CL yeah they lost him here and he made him play earlier in transition and its not one not two not three not four but five threes and hes mixed it up get to the rim as well and he has put the BC Eagles on his back and hes attempting to take him home here and close this thing out last 3 minutes and 49 seconds he averages 14 points he just ripped off 14 in 3 minutes and 30 7 Seconds hes starting to become comfortable within his offense as well his teammates are looking for him theyre finding him he doesnt have to figure it out and force some shots sometimes I think hes just getting comfortable he moves it to Chaz Kelly as BC soaked some seconds up by 10 coming up on three and 1 half to go against Syracuse Brown commits a foul of Zachary sixth team foul on the orange great job by Zachary there knowing Brown with his quick hands hes just went in attack mode and you cant Retreat because hes going to take up the spacing great job by the veteran point guard to force the call on Brown his fourth by the way in the hands of claudell Harris the Charleston Southern transfer finding his flow within this offense lot for mclock who finishes from Quinton post brace slip with the ball screen there he catches on the move and just seeing a skill set of post and what he do as a sevenfooter mans tough shot and an answer hes got Applause 15 BC dont rush got to get the ball in bounds be strong with the Trap what makes BC so dangerous to press too is that you can use Quinton post even though hes a sevenfooter you can use him as a press releaser with his ball handling skills could have defensive team full quau as the orange R fouls on Benny Williams and thats his third and now the one inone coming for BC Syracuse grabbed the lead early on in this game but then Boston College closed the first half and started the second half in convincing fashion and built a lead as large as 14 Le Brown was in foul trouble in the first half quader Copeland has helped spur the orange back for red atrey but every time the Syracuse has had a punch and they had a haym maker at points in this second half BCs had answers theyve cut it to a twopoint lead and Fredy Bost college for not panicking and take started taking care of the basketball again I mean the only thing to stop them tonight is just a turnover their own momentum and theyve been scoring at a high clip all game shooting 60 from the field and 52 from three Min for three straight on just got to take care of the basketball there if you can just take care of the basketball long Applause possessions in the hands of Kelly round to shake Starling backs it out for Zachary with 210 to go and make yourself available here Applause and four corners Zachary splits lobs too strong and its turnover for BC a ninepoint game Buck 56 to go Earl Grants team trying to get to the Finish Line got to get a shot got to get a shot youre orang you dont need a three you just got to get a quick attack here and thought about it Corner Copeland kick Min back iron Starling was fouled on the rebounding action if youre the orange just continue to drive the basketball you dont have to have a three that was a good look off penetration there and if your Boston College Eagles you dont want the clock to stop the only good thing about your last offensive possession was you ran a clock down but you got to turnover trying to throw a lob and then you come down here and commit a foul one1 for JJ Starling its 68 good on the first Applause finishing games like this are not easy youre trying to be conservative but you need to be aggressive I think even right now if you can get a layup you take it you want a long possession I dont know if youre watching you see where Brown and poster going at there little settled Jabs things that theyre doing trying to get the other one to commit a foul weve had two games of this over the last 3 weeks so the lead at seven for BC Zachary ran to the sideline line now a couple of seconds and BC gets it over in time Harris underneath for mlac who finishes just like that pun it get across and score they got too tentative and not trying to score and was turning it over not getting good shot attempt so the opportunity presented itself you take care knock it down get the layup Williams hits a three hes got it down to six and red ay takes a time out and now its a two possession game with still 114 to go thats why it was so important to get get that last basket there and youre not expecting Benny Williams to rise up and knock that three down but he does and when a team is desperate you just got to play him square and now you got to eliminate threepoint shots of your BC you got to defend that line and foruse the drive and try to play two for two Mal brown with four fouls and then mint Copeland and Williams all with three speaking of Williams only his seventh made three of the Season he been 6 for 30 and as you said much needed but also unexpected and now youre sitting here only down by six now you got to guard it all if youre BC it doesnt matter who it is you can ill afford anyone knocking down Breeze make it a twopoint game if they score two they got a foul they dont create a turnover on the inbound and then you just go tick for attack but what you cannot do is give up threes and then youre giving them twos and they chew into this lead and got to get a shot here Syracuse is going to gamble early theyre going to try you got to take care of the basketball be strong strong in the tribe more importantly you got to come and make yourself available cant be afraid to get to the free throw line usually teams will put in small guards if they can four to five guards if they could to get their better free throw shooters on the court as well and their better ball handlers and decision makers a reminder still to come we will get you the little John at Clemson but the Tigers playing host to Louisville ah yes royalty in the building he we should bow the Harvard of Central New York is playing at Boston College sh m in the building Sixpoint game 114 to go Jaden Zachary will key it in hes out there with mlon Kelly post and Harris for Earl Grant Kelly is trapped Williams tried to save it and then it goes out of bounds on the sideline and it belongs still to be SE whoo got to make yourself available there post went deep you see the traps coming you see that Rotation by Judah Min and the other thing Chaz Kelly has to turn it face the defense you cant turn your back you cant see the court youre going to see Earl Grant call a time out and throw something up while the officials head to the monitor to check on this with 109 to go in the second half and Boston College up by six its a big decision here it is but you got to turn and face and I you heard me say this about bigs and the post I think you got to do that even as a guard you cant turn your back against a trap as difficult as it is with all the pressure you got to turn and face and be strong with the ball Chaz Kelly that time had his back to most most of the Court you couldnt see anybody in you dont get fouls that way either because youre youre in such a passive posture ER Grants trying to get on top of this and make sure his guyss got the ball this game totally flips if its its the orange I thought it might have been out there and well so its for sure out on Syracuse and what the officials want to know is if Syracuse had enough possession to reset the shot clock all the way to 30 or if it is good where it is at I think its going to be Baseline yeah and that too whether its Baseline theyre trying to see if its baseline or sideline whether he possessed it enough where are you going to mark it out Joe Lindsay and Brian oconnell discussing and now it looks like Earl Grant is perhaps taking a timeout here as well have another look at Music it hey uh reminder Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but neet crew will break down the night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game the look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week right here on accn in the app all right what you learn as Ramy SS came over before they were debating on what the shot clock was going to be but with the timeout now thats the Gated you dont have to worry about that now with the timeout by BC so okay Keys now for Boston College getting it in knowing youre staring down all sorts of pressure from Syracuse so much time on the clock right now you know theyre going to be a trapped so whoever gets the ball has to be strong with it and the most important thing is you got to make make yourself available you cant run long and expect to catch a hilm touchdown pass after the balls in bounds and you can throw it if you set up that way early but theyre going to try to trap this soon as the ball comes in bounds Zachary and post are the best free throw shooters for the Eagles Kelly trying to evade a trap he does and lobs ahead for Harris great job there by ch Kelly he had teammates running down the court and he had to be strong with that ball and find somebody thats a heck of a play Harris looking for a dagger in and out 45 seconds to go for Syracuse down by six here is Mintz off the bounce met by Harris men fires cant connect and its BC basketball didnt have to have a three there but he picked his dribble up couldnt take advantage of Harris jumping in the air and once he picks his dribble up here he had angles he watching hes red arrey is arguing that it was deflected judging by mins reaction Im not sure it was no I think he just was after the shot B never gathered his feet and was never on balance nope so it will be BC basketball with 361 to go Syracuse boy had an opportunity there didnt have to have that three I thought had Harris not come over and surprise Jud the Min and made a pick up his dribble I think he attacks the paint tries to draw a foul to stop the clock even if he gets twoo and cut it the four still would have been plenty of time left so now expect it to be a trap immed immedately and then a foul again well get you a little John as soon as were done here at Connie Forum with Louisville and Clemson led by PJ Hall and Joe Gerard on Deck Jaden Zachary to put it in bounces in a difficult spot for Quinton post who got fouled by Benny Williams four on Williams and the one in one coming for Quinton post whos good on 83 this year at the line I thought he gave it up too quick the previous possession when he caught it on the sideline out of bounds play there difficult to trap for sevenfooter yeah Ill say you know when youre pressing so hes able to throw it over the top front end a ball comes out of his hands great great form he really good offensive player shooting the basketball hes had some trouble with the on in particular Malik Brown but hes Talent no less he makes it an 8point BC lead 35 seconds for mince and the orange CET off the bounce attacks cant finish around post Harris ahead for Zachary Syracuse andits a foul on Kelly how about BC weathered a big swing from Syracuse in this second half and BC is trying to make it backto back ACC wins and trying to win for the first time in six years against the orange its a great job by BC the streak is over theyve got that monkey off their back and sometimes psychologically that bothers you team having that much success you were down early you had to have confidence you were down early the first game you couldnt have played worse with your two best players going scoreless in that game and they even started out a little shaky here tonight they this teams responded taking care of taking care of business at home great great win by BC Starling in the final 10 seconds hits one to trim it to five and 68 remaining Syracuse out of timeouts DC has two if it needs one and they will foul post with 52 to four on M Boston College fans are booing Judah M hes like what do you expect me to Applause do tell you what its been a rockers atmosphere in this second half it has it has student section has shown up the orange men showed up and showed out theyve been pretty loud behind us here the student section have been letting us know yeah you got tenius or what po misses the first I know that popcorn smell good and that pizza look behind us as well so much as you E I know you were watching it oh yeah thats post game post misses both wow Starling waiting seconds nearly significant to some Boston College gets the win 8075 over Syracuse and their first win against the orange in
