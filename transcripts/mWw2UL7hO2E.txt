Ina they will meet again in just a couple of games two teams that are searching for resume boost on a Tuesday night late here in the steel city we tip it up with North Carolina winning possession Ted Valentine Tony Henderson and Brian oconnell are officials on this Tuesday evening Carolina with the ball atar heel team led by RJ Davis the ACC preseason player yearing off a 10296 overtime win over BC and they get the first Bucket from Elliot Kad theres sophomore guard starters for pit Damen dun is back in there graduate transfer from Houston whos been dealing with a thumb injury low and leg of the Guard Zach Austin and Cameron Coran The Bigs immediately worked to done on a postup game has size against Kad holds up well knock it out of bounds with called to shoot boy you love that by Damen Dunn obviously missed seven games a guy who played at Temple also played for Kelvin Samson over at Houston understands how to play and they run a ton of stuff to get him on the post and if they keep switching thats going to be a great match up to watch between him and Elliot cadoo on the Block jayen low turns it over for pit on the sideline here is the North Carolina starting five same starting five as last game Seth Trimble returned to the lineup having missed some games with a head injury V Allen Luben starts again at the five in part because jayen Washington is out for Carolina tonight a big loss coming off a career high tyeing 18 points and Luben immediately turns it over a lower body injury officially we saw Jaylen come down on his knee in overtime in the BC game he said he felt all good after the game Hubert Davis told us Jaylen is feeling good Tess came back positive he say not cleared to play tonight but he should not be out for long they hope yeah played extremely well in that second half against Boston College and had 18 points six rebounds they need that type of performance from their bigs especially for a team thats known in North Carolina basketball to have dominant bigs who get a ton of offensive rebounds so this has been an atypical team in that respect and theyre down a big tonight off the wild shot by leg Kad is going to float it in you know what I like about Elliot K first play of the game he didnt settle for a jumper he used those broad shoulders he knocked the smaller Defender low off got to the rim and then thats a simple midrange pull up little floater hes going to get that shot a ton he just keeps his eyes up and focused on his Target Carolina coming off a season high 58 points in the paint in the BC win Hubert Davis like what they did offensively the struggles defensively been well documented only two and three against pits and the two wins as you mentioned in the open J came last year Jeff capable 4 and3 against Carolina in his time at pit so pretty even rivalry the last few years alltime Carolina lead 178 how about this Jeff Cable One and seven vers North Carolina as a player so you think this means a little a little extra to him where were you on that stat waiting for you to deliver you have all these notes in front of you Austin bricks a three knocked up in the air and grabbed by Davis oh nice pass he and Jackson in transition lefthanded finish for the freshman and the first six for the you know Kudos the Davis probing slowing down a little bit and then finding Jackson whos just an absolute blur in transition low with a crossover hes been a scoring machine of late hell open the scoring for pit as the pieces of newspaper fly through the air if youre North Carolina are you going to strong hedge and get back or you going to put the screen got to make a decision Jackson lost it somehow recollected for Davis good help a three for Kad rebound Jaylen low low will pull up as the heels get back in transition and then Kad gets called for his first foul Carolina Second and this is what were talking about North Carolina over 40 of their possessions are in transition in which they score RJ Davis is having his head up and that goes to show you the dexterity of Ian Jackson you think hes going to go up with his right hand he can switch at the last second a little bit of English off the glass and just lays it in second highest scoring fast break team in the ACC Carolina they play some of the fastest tempos in the Applause country dun trying to work on the Freshman Jackson thats going to be hard for him to post up Ian Jackson forand leaves it short well Ian Jackson just a freshman does well against the sixe dun then Jackson takes it at Dunn and finishes over the top think about dun who was 5 going against the likes of Ian Jackson they say down 65 hes really 63 it feels like Ian Jackson feels more like 66 on the court L for three Zack Austin flies out of nowhere for the pack and a knocked out of bounds by Applause dun blackout night in the Oakland Zoo today the U versus the zoo tshirts Jeff cable first four years at pit losing seasons was on the hot seat really turned it around two years ago almost backtoback tournament appearances Luben fumbled pass Luben still recovers Carolina five for seven from the field to Applause start its got guo Diaz gram of the game 25 for the first time placing a big Florida State corad low on the drive Carolina has had their ground on the glass so far against a much taller pit team Davis off of Luben screen didnt take it and then threw it Applause away out of sck moment between Davis and Kone not many of those in the first few minutes for UNC leading by six that might not mean much down the stretch is actually back to defending so far in the four four first four minutes of this first half where the pits best looks usually come from round one fall like that on the ground crossed up sing withs did you speak that into existence well it was good analysis by you waiting till somebody fell on the deck its called a two for Leed 10 to6 Carolina its what is one of the better offensive teams in the nation statistically these Panthers theyll get Kad room to shoot not a great threepoint shooter but he rolls in home love the confidence by Elliot gadoo not a great shooter only shooting 29 from the threepoint line but the last two shots hes taken have been with absolute confidence hasnt second guess it at all the withers again this time wither stays on his feet lean still scores over him backto back buckets for ish lean Applause so gadoo with seven Jackson with four Davis yet to score for Carolina Jaylen Withers who has barely contributed the last few games with an early two theyll need more from him with Jaylen Washington injured it out was great for Withers and Company when CAD delivers the ball on the platter Diaz gr bricks the three down the FL Withers could get to it but Withers Just didnt see it coming but that was a great exit pass if Withers had just been a little bit more aware low one man fast break tipped in by Diaz gr Diaz Applause Applause Z off ravy thank you great game down in Knoxville and a great atmosphere here in Pittsburgh Pennsylvania critical bubble game between UNC and pit both teams shooting it brilliantly so far Zack Austin just did a three for pit Jaylen Withers answers for UNC Kevin Brown J Williams 7 minutes in Jay tar Hills eight of 11 and a fivepoint lead yeah Elliot Kau has been having his way already knocked down a threepoint shot but getting into the gaps and into that blue area in the paint at will whenever he wants this is is leg spinning and scoring what a move we talk about one of the most lethal scores not only in the ACC but in the nation already with a couple of knockdown Jays and just able to give you a little bit of The Wiggles to get into the paint easily into the Freshman Drake Powell who scores through traffic Carolina has hit six of its last seven T doing this all without a single shot from RJ Davis as guo Diaz Graham is called for offensive Music foul so if youre just joining us North Carolina and pit two teams as we take a look at the offensive foul against Diaz gra yeah not sure about that seems like a little bit more acting by kadoo but once again does a good job of drawing the foul two teams that are desperately looking for a win the resumes is lacking high quality victories two teams that right now are in the bubble picture a long long way to go of course these are the kind of games that can make or break who gets a late bubble spot in the ACC ta claw has it knocked away and that Balls headed the other way Tony Hendersons got a foul against Carolina and flaw theres no time like the present for the tar Hills which they embark on a season defining four game stretch were to get a huge three quad one opportunities and one quad two opportunity so you know look when you give up 96 points to Boston College and you allow them to shoot 55 from the field 58 from the threepoint line youre able to get a win like that then following that game up to build some momentum on the road against a pit team that can score were going to get a chance in real time to find the character of this North Carolina team and how they handle aers they Leed with an early nine with that three Carolina leading shooting 9 for 13 RJ Davis yet to attempt a shot he has a couple of assists Powell that shot rejected by Austin a high flyer back to Powell Trimble into the shot clock he got fouled on the way up with 21 to shoot three free throws coming for Trimble well one of those defining games for North Carolina will be in lovely Durham North Carolina youll be there with Jay Seth Rees Andrea college game day live from Durham 10 am eastern and those are the two standout games UNC Duke first Carolina Duke game for Cooper flag and then John caliper going back to rup for the first time as a visitor Arkansas and Kentucky you think Big Blue Nation is going to let John caliper hear it what do you think what that reaction going to be I I would think there would be a lot of Cheers yeah I I think Big Blue Nation will be classy I think they will support John calip Perry at first I think they will applaud him for his time he put in at Kentucky and once the game gets started then Im sure they will let him hear every ounce of it public enime number one very quickly you cant transfer to another school in conference and think its going to be easy you come back home its not going to be Ed coming back to providors but its not going to be all sunshine to rainbows Kentucky with a big win tonight by the way on the road to Tennessee right before us Mark pulps wild cats having a tremendous year so the free throws all good for Trimble his first three of the game Carolina by five 9 Minutes in Diaz Graham sets up Austin a slow start for low as well L been doing a great job battling Corin down low every possession this time Corin wins the battle maybe the first time all game that hes taken Luben and Another Second Chance bucket for pit Davis defended by lean a step back three wont go Luben fighting for it with Diaz Graham who wins Applause possession good move wow righthanded finish by jayen low and a chance to tie it coming at the line Jaylen low is so tricky with the basketballs seeing him in transition look at the push dribble and then the wrap over the top of Luben and thats what you love about the guard look how he puts the ball into his right hand away from the defender most players in that left side then try to go back up with the left hand but low recognizing where Luben was extends the ball and gets the n one opportunity its a young man whos gone from 96 to 176 points per game of an all ACC type Year and that is a rarity 89 free throw shooter rims it out he actually gets 40 plus more free throws than anybody else on the team in attempts does a great job of getting to the free throw line and drawing contact Jackson into traffic on the drive Trimble keeps it in bounds with eight to shoot Davis getting his first breather Jackson Leed was ready for that that was a point of emphasis at shootter out today dont let Jackson and Davis get those clean looks for three also Kev if Elliot is if Elliot is more aware youre going to see the great hands here by legot to get the ball out of bounds kadoo has a midrange jumper every time he comes off the high pick and roll inbound with two to shoot its Trimble Austin Smothers it and a shot clock violation on Zack Austins second rejection talk about Zach Austin using all of that 67 frame and athletic ability on a fadeaway shot by tremble what great defense and thats the type of mentality that Jeff cable wants to see from this team on a defensive end in the cor and pit has its first lead an early sevenpoint lead for Carolina has been erased trible from K well short for three and clanks into the pit bench again going to see from Pittsburgh here a back cut SE trible tries to check him but lets him go Luben cant get back in enough time by the way youre able to make that pass when you dont have great on the ball pressure if you allow the guy to see over the top of the defense he can make a pass over the top Corin again into Luben out for low six nothing spurt by pit and an offensive foul will terminate this possession big mans Applause Music first so cable shows you what he thinks leading with Brian oconnell part of our crew with Tony Henderson and Ted Valentine tonight Leed is making life extremely different ult for RJ Davis he is denying him everywhere on the court and pushing him off his Applause Mark its not ideal when three straight possessions the ball ends up in one of the assisted coaches hands well the thing that a lot of people dont recognize for a guy like RJ Davis whos 6 feet 180 lbs when youre being guarded by a guy who 63 and a half 190 PBS who digs into you its hard for him to see over the top of the defenses and also you know there theres no low post presence for him to throw the ball to and work off of the offense stimulates right from him from the beginning Luben cuts off Lows Lane into guo Diaz grah his brother Jorge 31 is in the game right now twins from the Canary Islands in Applause Spain Davis guarded by lean P will take his third three and Powell tips it out for Davis RJ Kad theyre going to give him all the space in the world Davis will drain one and finally RJ Davis nearly 12 minutes in gets on the score sheet great Poise and Patience by North Carolina RJ just working the dribble Drive scenario so utilizing a head get the guy off the ground and knock down the three Austin shot fake Diaz Graham lob for legot line drive for low Pittsburgh leads Applause again into Luben from kadoo just a terrific find by kadoo bouncing it in midair we have quite the Seesaw Affair in our Applause hands already five assists to go with seven points for Elliot kdo Applause L has a switch with Luben here low will step back over with it Applause out 7 minutes to play in what has been an entertaining first half about as entertaining as we expected two teams desperate for a resume boosting win Davis in the switch with Diaz Grant crossover dribble its pure Davis rattles it home well thats the iso that RJ Davis wants against Diaz Graham on the perimeter Diaz Graham with not great beat laterally allows him to be Shifty take it from side to side and get that shot off at will right quick ones for the ACC sixth leading scorer now you got Diaz Graham for a moment he was passed up on kadoo hell take it into Powell and and GMO has some free throws coming well we talked a lot about RJ Davis being one of the top scorers in the ACC a primary thing for Pittsburgh not letting him get off offensively and look at the extra ball movement and get the ball out of his hands but one week ago Kad either scored or assisted on 18 of the 26 Carolina Baskets at wake farest tonight he scored or assisted on 8 of 12 and all that talk happened around the conference and nationally can Ellie CAU and RJ Davis play together because of their size and being a smaller back court you know you do think that they need to step up their level of defense and thats been there for most of the Season even though it wasnt there last game but still their ability to play off of each other especially if Kau starts knocking down midrange jumpers that gets them back to the old prolific scoring North Carolina that you used to see Diaz Graham splits a pair cam corin will replace him Kad with a freshman Powell Davis Trimble and Luben four starters out there for Carolina the switch with Corin on kadoo who lost the dribble he wants it back try to take the big man kadoo spinning around him very difficult lefthanded finish just nothing but a big smile on on the face of kadoo he had that left drive from the beginning but just an acrobatic finish at the P nine and five for the sophomore from West Orange New Jersey not far from the season averages already Wyatt start for Dunn midrange two theres the first basket for Damen Dunn every time you see dun play reminds you of that older guy at the park Drake P did a great job getting on the high side of that screen forcing him down into the actual screen but it just got to the spot another assist for Kad out of the screen and roll Carolinas hit its last five and that was a three from Applause pow sixth time of the first half as Kad disrupts defensively were going to see kadoo has Corin on him and you just see it once he goes right you know that spins going to come coming thats the English off the glass how difficult that was and then once again cadeo again off the high pick and roll and and thats great point guard Vision looking opposite for a great skip pass Drake pal PO with his hands ready to knock it down Corner three done Carolina so quick to get the ball down the floor Jackson from Kad pit settles in they let to no on the show again now at Davis Luben screen and roll cant go under not against that guy dud is so lethal man like you got to fight over the top of the screen and force him into the defender who was in drop coverage and that was corn hey if somebodys hit more threepointers than Jay Williams you can not go under a screen against them I knew you were going to get that sted Im just happy I you going to get it in I got it in before you did a Thursday night a terrific womens basketball double header starts on ESPN 2 L Johnson and LSU who were defeated for the first time this year against South Carolina look to get back to winning ways against a really good Oklahoma team then Iowa State at number 11 Kansas State in the little apple thats on ESPN at 830 Eastern both those games Thursday on the ESPN app last foul was the second on too so hes out of the game The Freshman James Brown is in to play the five and he just got called for his first so two fouls on kdo 406 to go and a half that he has dominated is this an automatic sit for the rest of the half with two fouls you know look it its I think if youre Jeff capable at this stage let them play through it you got to trust me youre going to be at the under four timeout in about 6 seconds one of one C cor and hits the front Music end Jeff capable and Hubert Davis played really tough schedule so far their resumes look pretty good in terms of metrics such as the net ranking because the quality competition they face but they each have only one quad one win Carolinas was UCLA the garden pitch was at Ohio State buzzler beating three by Zach Austin Davis into Leed shoves it off the glass and a foul will go the other way on Carolina sixpoint lead for the heels some foul trouble for Elliot Kad will e get ready for our full court up contest hosted by the United States go Association tonights lucky isord who attempt beond to sing and win tickets to the 12 US Open Country Club lets on Jord Music cour one more sh Applause Court well Seth Ill tell Ill tell you one thing you cant go under pick rolls and I I think youve seen it multiple times now with the Scouting Report they had with Ellie Kad Ellie kadoo has found himself in the gaps constantly making plays and then even on the last possession with RJ Davis ishma legot had his left leg up he was getting over the top Davis hit him with a little bit of shimi he went under but the defender actually rolled right into him and he knocked down the three so like they have to find a different way in how the guard this guard action in High pnrs what Would You Do differently I would Blitz it I would try to get the ball out of RJ Daviss hands are out of Elliot kaus hands and then try to recover the the problem is Drake pal and Ian Jackson are so good off the defensive rotating they can make plays off the dribble as well but you still want the youth to try to make plays and the ball be in the hands of the veteran F do off the floor right now hes got two fouls nine points six assists in the first half and Carolina leads by four after the can pour in free throws heels are shooting at 60 and 5 of 11 from three and and theyve really struggled from three this year theyre 261st in division one Jackson Another threepointer and Carolina is now 6 for 12 from Deep Im going to tell you something Jason cable whos the assistant coach on the pit staff the brother of Jeff cable played his career at North Carolina Ian Jackson just had some pretty big time words for Jason Cable in the Sol you think those words were hey I loved watching you play probably not made the shot right in front of Jason cable Jackson his possess gets it back flings it to his freshman counterpart Powell who drives and draws a foul two free throws coming for Drake Powell well we talked about Ian Jackson averaging 173 points in ACC play and right there just poor communication on what they were doing on that pin down and the one thing you love about Jackson even though hes Young he just has a an NBA like feel towards him so many young players dont have their hands ready to be a receiver for a catch and suit situation but he knew exactly where his feet were going to be and his hands were ready right in the slot to catch that Music pass second foul against cam Corin with his eight points Hubert Davis loves to talk about Ian Jackson and his character he says every day hell get a text that says coach Davis and hell respond player Jackson and then he respond how can I get better today he said sometimes those text will come at about 1230 in the morning Ill tell you one thing our ESPNs most recent 25 NBA Mock Draft has him projected the 22nd pick in the draft I will challenge them to say I think they are wrong I think he is a lottery pick Leed back GMS a three its TI to Luben Carolina by eight really balanced scoring for the heels Kad with nine Davis with eight Jackson seven Powell six into ven Allen Luben gets to the right hand and he scores it Luben three for three and this is the biggest tar heill lead but great recognition there by RJ Davis RJ Davis recognizing that a smaller player was on lubben and forced Luben by communication i h people to say RJ Davis does not communicate vocally telling him no you post up and you get this bucket low bullies his way into the lane hes got nine to lead pit tied with legot for the team lead should say Davis got the switch again but he lost his footing low running with Trimble bounces off him and hits a three Music its not every day on a two on two fast break you pull up for a three but when low is feeling it he has the free reign to let it fly again the switch with Diaz Graham on Davis who tries to thread the needle Leed picks the Applause pocket low hits another and this lead has gone from 10 to two in three pit possessions final 45 of the half Jackson against leg step back two Trimble tracks it down and charges for the basket Austin may have helped disrupt that from behind and dud emerges from the frame each team does have a timeout to use Jeff cable is trying to call it he almost got to the logo and pit will take it for 30 seconds will come back to end this to the block seven turnovers for Carolina which is kept pit in the game despite the great Tar Hill shooting 6 for 12 and three 59 in the field pit 5 for 12 and three 53 5 seconds or so between shot and game clock low thats what he does Diaz Graham too deep rebound to Trimble Carolina does have a timeout it wont use it Trimble down the floor bumped and fouled its only the fifth of the half on pit so still one to give I think now Hubert Davis would like the timeout and hell take it with 28 to go another 30 second break before the end of the first half Music down Music 28 to go in this first half pit down two you have a foul to give if youre pit do you give it well as long as youre not giving it an act of a shot right I mean so you have to trust in your players to give that I probably dont uh I just I tell my team hey look defensively stay disciplined do not go for any ball fakes and lets remember our scouting report and the probability of the ball being in the hands of either Jackson or Davis are pretty high for this last second shot its going to be Jackson a very deep three is very short and thats the end of the first half want to catch your breath for a few minutes it would be nice oh my God its an enormous game on this Tuesday night lets go to our three man weave Kev Sean and Seth back in the studio for Pittsburgh whos ever able to draw a line in the sand and execute the detail Scouting Report will find a way defensively to win this game in the second half pit ball to start the half end of the first half on an 80 run all the points scored by this man Jaylen low who is stripped on the first possession Kad Davis good control at the rim and RJ Davis is the first tar heeling double figures in the first half pit with 12 points off of North Carolinas seven turnovers you know if youre pit you you cannot allow North Carolina to get out into transition not to where they find their Rhythm offensively their first points off a turnover tonight done over Davis couldnt finish Kad whips one down the floor to Jackson just tell you something K real quick the thing that makes Elliot K so special is the hockey assist we watch how North Carolina plays when RJs in the game and its not saying its better or worse but he pounds the ball down the floor OT kadoo rarely does that he always kicks the ball ahead which allows guys like Drake pow or Ian Jackson to attack and transition to get easier buckets Kos sets up tremble here who got mauled by Austin first foul on Zack Austin this will not be an assist but it will set up a chance for two at the line Seth trimbles only points have come from the line today three of them after being fouled shooting in three at 18 and 12 in 42 minutes the overtime went Saturday the tough two that forc the game into overtime and thats who Seth Trimble is hes a guy that can score can slash can get to the rim lost a little bit of confidence in that threepoint shot but still has that stronger upper body frame to finish through contact and absorb that same contact as well especially for a smaller team they need physicality out of him and if youre just joining us Jaylen Washington not available tonight a lower body injury came down favoring his d overtime Saturday not believed to be a major injury he is good he did go through warmups but he is not available for tonights game for UNC low trying to get around Kad scoop shot short rebound Luben and kadoo again just a downfield pusher immediately to Davis theres always the threat of something exciting with Elliot Kad just a back cut here was sealed off by low Daviss pass knocked out of bounds with 10 to shoot you know North Carolinas going to continue to pressure RJ Davis they need to push up on him and choose force him to choose one side Trimble slashing gets to the rim and finishes just a dereliction of defensive Duty there and a really early timeout out by Jeff capable well we talked a lot about North Carolina who was going to set the tone thus far Music Applause North Carolina up 4942 on Pittsburgh what youre going to see here is a little sideline handoff theyre going to see him pop out here to this corner and youre going to see RJ Davis wrap around get into this gap which is going to force him right here defensively to come over help and watch the way the ball rotates lets play the tape sideline handoff comes off he gets into the Gap help and then this is what you love by Seth Trimble right off as the ball is rotating the guy who comes in help the other guy do come from the weak side you hit that Gap they worked on that a ton today for Jeff capable on pit about getting over that leg it slips the defense has to recalibrate and thats where you get a drible drive situation with SE TR maybe so frustrated because they worked on it so much led to a timeout and Carolinas halftime lead of two is up to seven low Corin catch recover and the first pit bucket of the half cam Coran with 10 tarel are plus six on the glass even without Jaylen Washington hey just execution and atto is really good like and thats what you want if your Pittsburgh just getting back to the details and defensively now is where they really have to dig into the likes of the Wings and keeping North Carolina out of transition and in the gaps Jackson low Bouncer and an offensive foul called against Ian Jackson a charge at Jackson second else by Damen Dunn stepping in from the weak side by the way thats what having a veteran on your team does a guy that played significant time at Temple played for Calvin Samson at Houston and you know if he didnt break his thumb he missed seven games it was a huge Miss for Jeff Cap and Company because of his experience on the floor he made a lot of Big Time plays against Syracuse I called them winning impactful plays getting defensive rebounds and making the right reads still not 100 you can see the tape on the right hand Austin drives it into of the shot clock low and the rebound oyed down by Davis give him the dragon Go set a screen Luben will do it and then they roll it into Luben against dun and Luben leaves it short low pushing Tempo low fouled by Davis free throws Applause coming no doubt low is so Dynamic and fast with the ball but he had his head down if he had his head up he had leg it for an easy Layin but still this young man is super talented as a sophomore has more shot attempts than anybody on the team can score at will its a matter of shot selection and also pace of play him learning how to change speeds and make the right reads and continue to be more vocal as a leader as the next step for him jayen Lo 22 or more three of the last four games double figures every game but three this season and you see the numbers over the last four 21 and five hes been mainly a second half scorer this year and not of late but 15 points in the first half and he has not sat for a second of tonights game under Miss free throw low has struggled from the line the last two games he 89 hes now missed five free throws the last two games kdo switched on to Corin point guard against B great defense by dun again multiple possessions multiple possessions of great defense by Damen Damen Dunn has been in the gaps defensively hes been talking on the Baseline and as youre going to see here CAD tries to go Baseline but you missed the first play but still just the 5050 ball getting down on the floor for the 5050 ball but like those are the winning plays the impactful plays I keep talking about as he relates to Damen dun and Jeff cable told us if he didnt get hurt he might have been our best perimeter Defender at the beginning of the year after a year in the Kelvin Samson system that is Houston that meat grinder defense Le it very deep three and Corin tips it up and in not sure he even left the floor Carolinas lead down to two a dozen for cam Corin low picks up Davis on the switch wow once again look at dun just everywhere on the floor tribles three grabbed by Jackson and then lows on the deck to take it away and push it to Corin Damien done for the lead sometimes a little old man game is good for the Applause soul I keep trying to tell you that Damen Dunn his presence has been missed on this court he doesnt only do it on the defensive end but Jeff Cap did tell us today he was their best 262nd Carolina Duke game this Saturday what do you expect well you can throw our records out the window and the only analogy I can give you you is it reminds me of Michigan Ohio State and Ohio State obviously was by far the better team this season winning a national championship but Michigan won that game and a lot of that game comes down to experience and how to deal with that atmosphere and with the stakes that are on the line and North Carolina has more players that are familiar with that experience than Duke does and its going to make for one hell of a game and as J billis always says it always delivers out of the timeout Davis swirls out a three plus Kevin We Got Game Day coming to town Ill be there I might be giving away 100000 what I said that really I might be giving away 100000 you have any here tonight not on me not cash for you Trimble from the corner and rebound to is leet hits on an eight nothing Applause run leet steps inside Luben long legged layup a great job by Luben right there to Contin you to stay vertical Lego was trying everything in his power to create more contact and Luben just stayed straight up well another Carolina Duke historical comparison for you RJ Davis passed Christian lner tonight obviously lot of the RJ numbers you have to say hes played a fifth year but he does jump ahead of Christian ler on the alltime ACC scoring list I think thats a real thing man I I thought to a lot of guys you know all these records that are being breaking and its no shot to the the players that are breaking them but obviously the more years you play the more points that youre able to hum yeah just context is good exactly still anytime interal look with Christian lner if you have a threepoint record in three years you know that should there should be an AST just hypothetical right just saying yeah you dont know little things like that go you dont know anybody you know threepoint record in three years would you low nearly picked that pass off pass tar Hills can make him pay for it they cannot Austin with another block shot Powell will lay it in off the block and that snaps an 80 pit run one thing you have to give Ian Jackson and Drake pal a lot of credit for is their sense of urgency and their first step to all these 5050 balls theyre so active and they they both have catlike refle like catlike abilities to get into the play and make things happen the Luben stuff Carolina by one Davis Around Damen dun hard guarding and then a foul on the way up as cam Corin stepped in D is going to be hit for his first foul Davis still on the floor that was a physical finish RJ Davis will be helped up you see Damen Dunn just trying to do anything in his power to get into the Gap they hit the ball Applause up not sure where the contact was Ravis RJ Davis the best free throw shooter in North Carolina history 86 first attempts of the game Saturday mens Hoops triple header on the ACC Network Florida State BC at two Eastern Commonwealth clash between the hookies and Cavaliers and then two of the ACC newcomers we starting to Make Some Noise Stanford and SMU trying to play their way on the bubble thats an important game at 6 Eastern Stanford couple of weeks ago with a onepoint win at Carolina on a gamewinning shot by the former Duke Blue Devil Jaylen Blakes they also have the leading score in the AC see Maxim REO so if you havent seen Stanford play theyre a fun team out Applause west Diaz Graham will not shoot it Leed hasnt scored since early in the game he had nine quick ones done and Leed and Trimble are entangled Arrow to UNC you know with d he has that right hand taped considering he broke his thumb and you can still tell there there sometimes when he catches the ball ready to shoot it doesnt come off as smooth and a lot that a lot of that going to be cured over time with reps I broke my third metaco my left hand not my shooting hand and it took me a good month and a half just to feel comfortable dribbling the ball shooting the ball and also you know when you wear a brace like that it kind of gives a sign for people to R down on the ball too so you have to learn how to absorb that contact and feel comfortable with it Jeff cable told us he literally could not move it for 6 weeks Austin Kad back on the floor here with three fouls he gets tripped up I mean six weeks where it was in a splint or a cast and then when it came out of the cast he he didnt have the full range of motion the full flexibility right away but Jeff cable said its pretty clear we need Dame to be Dame it felt like in that Syracuse game he took a step forward with 10 points five rebounds and as you said a lot of winning impactful plays in just 18 Applause minutes wow wow just a m time L with power dont know why Seth Trimble will try to save that Austin a stone cold stunner Kad lot of dribbling he lost it no theres a foul or no theres going to be 20 seconds on the shot clock its out of bounds off pit that was the signal for Brian okell well were going to see the play here it gets tipped he tries to save it on the back end and once again Zach awesome just with super freaky athletic ability in this game man young man from Winston Salem North Carolina began his career at High Point ending in here at pit TR to take down one of his hometown or his home state signature teams trimo short Im trying to tell you Kevin Brown Damen done his everywhere on the floor there was a mismatch with a smaller player on Luben he ran over got him off and then had low switch to the corner and then once again came from the weak side to help one the drive he is everywhere on the floor Diaz gram rainbow three for a pit panther lead that was Applause GMO and were going to head to the Under 12 mediate timeout here here after there was some confusion about the inbound W what a fight we have on our hands late late in get in that Gap hustle back s of urgency still closing out to set Trimble thats the kind of effort that you need running the post sicking a Luben then diving on the floor for a 5050 loose ball and then offensively I told you he play like an old man in the park creating some separation now think about this his that line Five Points one rebound one assist one steal I know kids at home you hear that we only talk about guys who average 30 guys who get to 20 blocks the way he is impacting the game on the defensive end is everything for this pit panther team exactly what youd expect from a guy who spent a season at Houston one of the best defensive programs in the country Temple before that getting back to full health and this pit team feels like it is at full health as a result RJ Davis and car Carolina down by three set Trimble pull up two and Trimble burries it tough shot thats not the type of offense you want to see for North Carolina you want to see more out of pick and roll and getting the ball to rotate from side to side but still finding a way to get isolated Buck by set Trimble is imperative in this game trimbles up to eight great Balan scoring game for Carolina low driving and low is fouled it will be Van Allen Luben with his second thing if youre van Luben if youre guarding him and youre isolated at the top of the key against a guy like low sag off you dont have to pressure up sag off contest late you have the wingspan to contest late so many bigs try to get up and they try to be active with their feet and move side to side east to west just sag off and use your length thats why you have your length to deter the shot its been a struggle Ebert Davis talked about that at times this year pick and roll defense point of attack defense for Carolina look obviously theyre not a big team sizewise but what do you see in some of the defensive struggles for UNC well I think their best lineup is their small lineup I I really like when they have Seth Trimble Ian Jackson Drake pal likees to RJ Davis you know Ellie CAD with just maybe a big there I know I named a lot of players but I I like when they play smaller faster the problem is that if youre smaller you got to be disruptive defensively and I think thats the next step for guys like Elliot kadoo or Drake pal like you know you got to apply pressure and a lot of times we see pit able to make passes because theres really no pressure being applied on the perimeter Luben look at whos all over him Damen Dunn ties it up points the other way for a pit takeaway something that we ask our bigs all the time when I used to play is if youre going to post up that deep why put the ball on the ground why bring the ball directly to the likes of the area where Damen Dunn is at keep the ball high turn Face go straight up over the smaller opponent Carolina with a dozen turnovers hit is plus eight in that category Corin deflected by Trimble got it back for lean and Luben got a hand in there just the fifth Pittsburgh turnover cadoo 4 three too deep and the rebound off the hands of dun back to Trimble Jackson with tons of space too deep on that Applause try L will roll it out Midway through this second half with pit leading by three and to Corin Austin d Applause UNC has not hit a threepointer this half he has him sealed up Luben has a smaller player on him and legging him the block should demand the ball Davis instead will charge into lubben Davis gets toppled and still hits the layup low drives the other way over Luben knocks the rebound to Trimble here come the heels Davis for three its good first three in the half for Carolina by the way RJ Davis is Talking Heads Up play by Luben to hold his own man up in the air and not allow him to come crashing down I mean youre going to watch Davis Drive here on the side Luben trying to seal his man and Luben just catching him in Davis catching himself talk about great hand eye coordination by Davis and then once again in transition Davis a guy that needs to get going offensively those are the kind of plays that get him going RJ Davis has played all but 58 seconds of this game hes got 16 points 6 for9 three for five three and four assists Carolina back in front the eighth lead change of the game got him my hand check there first on Trimble this will be a quad one win for UNC they are one in seven in Quad One games this year theyve played five of the top 11 teams in this weeks rankings Auburn Bama Florida Michigan State Kansas lost to them all great great play by Claud there to grab that loose ball off the corn Miss Jackson from Trimble transition bucket for the heels and the lead is four when low gets that deep in penetration nobody from Pittsburgh got back Seth Trimble recognized that able to Counterattack Carolina wanted a double dribble there R conell said there was a deflection 7 nothing tarel run and and a real physical fight between Coran and Claude Ty Claude second and Carolina six to the Applause Music half and when you talk about the schedule season defining four game stretch for North Carolina tonight at pit at Duke verse pit again and then at Clemson is just an absolute bear of a schedule might get held without a field in the half that remains the case Shmo step through nowhere to go CAD bailed him out Austin by the way is back on the floor sat for the first 45 seconds he been out all game Davis denied by Corin in an off balance shot Austin whoa got tripped up if thats on kadoo its his fourth waiting for the official call from Tony Henderson and it is going to be the fourth foul on Elliot lead obviously its been a tough shooting year for RJ just 39 29 half 43 on the Year good signs the last three games 62 points in the last three great free throw shooting better from three right now hed be their leading scorer for a fourth consecutive game but Kevin what do great Shooters have see you w know an answer to this cuz you w a great shooter J no chill no no conscience right doesnt matter what happened yesterday or the day before I really thought you were going to blow my mind and answer the question there for a second I did answer the question you said no chill I had lots of chill Moss chill so Kad is out of the game with four fouls Carolina by two off the Austin free throws Powell will shoot a three well short rebound cam Corin North Carolina plus 10 on the glass pit plus 15 points off turnovers unusual Trends given how poly Carolina or how well Carolina usually hangs on to the ball oh missed him at The Rim he has gr three and thatll be a foul on cam Corin his third hits fifth dun came off that screen he had easy lob at the rim for corn offensively for North Carolina right now r J Davis cant play off the ball cuz Elliot CAU with four fouls it makes the offense different cuz he is the primary point of attack and I think youre going to see pit try to Blitz him a lot more off any kind of pick and roll option tle guarded now the 610 Corin dribble two points from a double double now into dun and there you go 10 and 10 for set triple in one career double double before Saturday hes got it and back to back games thats great defense by Dunn an even better shot by Trimble and Corin he is fouled one and one for a pitch so cam Coran whos four for four at the line today will shoot RJ Davis with his second foul Applause Music Applause near perfect shooting day for the Florida state transfer first Miss free throw to begin a one and one is that the jinx it was a near I said it was a near perfect day it remains near perfect just speaking truth spitting facts Jay will well thats what its all about Ive noticed Ive noticed late night facts only its nearly 1100 here feels like weve been up for 37 straight hours here in Pittsburgh Jackson step back high pointed by Zach Austin jayen Lows off the floor for the first time for pit trying to get a timeout that low back in the game and that will leave pit with one remaining 54 opponents in the league UNC pulled out the win against BC after losing backtoback onepoint games to Stanford and wake pit had lost four in a row before a fourpoint win up at the Dome against Syracuse blow and legged back on the floor and Leed fouled by Powell nowhere close to the basket that sets up a very good free throw shooter for a one and one its the ninth team foul of the half Applause Carina is Elliot and with 534 to go Elliot Kad will check back in with his four fouls replacing Drake Powell and if I were pit I would try to attack Elliot kadoo as much as possible on the defensive end their offense runs very differently when Kendo is on the court how how would you attack Elliot kis Gard year well I would if yep and Im watching Damen dun in the game I would try to get a switch because they end up doing a lot of guard to guard switch and if they do a guard to guard switch I would get Damen done on the Block and constantly post kadoo up and make him fight down low he throws good for leg it a 79 shooter its a twopoint Carolina lead pit without a field goal in the last 6 minutes plus Here Comes Davis forhead on the switch Davis gets rid of it to Kad quickly gets it back almost a double dribble there and low gets a hand in there Davis bailed out by Trimble for to shoot Lows on the deck again Trimble has to hoisted drew the iron rebound to low who was Music everywhere all right kados on leg right now in the Applause corner Austin for the lead got Applause it so many Big Time shots for Zack Austin in conference play 6463 pit just a lot of dribbling for North Carolina ball isnt really moving Davis right in the leg it who stuffs him Austin is on the floor right now Austin is in some pain dun will shoot one anyway and now play is stopped pit was going four on five as Zack Austin slaps the floor under the basket and every coach stand stand up on the sideline for Pittsburgh Jason cable Tim OU Jeff cable everybody talking to Damen Dunn why are you shooting the ball we have a player on the ground they are going to stop The Possession lets maintain The Applause Possession yeah I think that was more of a cramp than anything else what have you seen the last possessions on the court for North Carolina theres been a lot of dribbling theres been a lot of iso ball they havent forced the defense to rotate from side to side at all they need to get back to that continuity Applause offensively 14 assists now to 12 turnovers for UNC Luben driving it at Diaz gr lost his footing and travel the turnover is piling up for UNC hoping not to let the team thats able to execute get to the 5050 balls and actually play to The Scouting Report like remember those details come down to your ability to win and lose games down the stretch it leaves a three short its a tie up itll go to Carolina So based on what youve seen today based on what youve seen this season whos the more likely team to hit the details I I do not know I mean I I would if I had the force a bet I I probably would tell you one but this is a critical time for both teams when I think well get a chance to see their character revealed in these last 3 minutes and 39 seconds Zack Austin appeared to be a cramping is shoe back on the floor to a huge elvation Carolina scoreless for 3 minutes plus Kad B it out of the air by low right to Davis they telegraphed exactly where he was going to pass it kadoo driving into low and kadoo finishes his first points of the half and Carolina takes the lead on the 11th lead change of the game degree of difficulty 100 starting five out there for pit Corin got disrupted by kdo with the four fouls heres this Leed Damen dun shot fake three it wont go he took a side step he should have took a step inward for a midrange jumper thats a tough pass by K there no need for it just no need for that pass right there low the other way Austin hes hit one from here and he gives pit the lead again Zack Austin and awesome second half and Pittsburghs up Applause two Davis like it came out to Blitz that potential threepoint attempt leg it stays down again Davis spins around him luit in the lane no how did it not go down Applause a swirler that would not find a home 145 to go Jaylen low d low got to be low another one in and out a twopoint game here comes Jackson oneman fast break and Austin with another outrageous block is this guy 67 or 87 the myth the legend Zack Austin just everywhere freakish Zion Williamson athletic ability his fourth block of the night Corin he puts it in from the lane two possession lead the largest of the night for Pittsburgh timeout Tar Heels final as once again with 29 seconds left on the shot clock when youre up by two no need to put a pass by your big mans ankles in transition it led to a corner kick by Zack Austin whos made multiple threes to give them a lead its once again execution down the stretch and I know Carolina likes to play fast but you have to play fast and think slow and Zach Austin with his fourth block of the day just everywhere defensively this is the type of effort you need to defend home court in this place is rocking Zack Austin began his career at High Point Carolina kid transfers up to the ACC last year loses the two games to UNC last season and the two losses he scored just three points in 35 minutes as Carolina ended up beating pit here then ending their season in the ACC tournament so as you said Jay there is a little more to play for you here for pit not just a resume boosting win but a little revenge on the team that ended their tournament hopes last year but also KB execution of The Scouting Report Zack Austin shoots 41 from the threepoint line so I know that when Pittsburgh gets to dribble Drive situations you still cant afford to leave the best threepoint shooter in the corner slot where hes made multiple threes this afternoon tonight you got to stay at home and force pick to take tough twos I think for North Carolina now after a timeout getting some athletically just being everywhere I mean hustle plays locking the fadeaway by Seth Trimble and and once again like poor transition defense by North Carolina not looking for the shooter high flying acrobatic finishes and these Corner slops man that thats where hes been finding his Groove so fourpoint game Carolina needs a basket Davis off a Luben screen foran closed it out Davis will continue to dribble with 10 to shoot time dwindling kadell of course Austin blocked it off his head his fifth rejection great block by Zach Austin again but Im going to tell you RJ Davis had Gorn up in the air and did not jump into him to get a foul a major missed Opportunity by RJ Davis he had him and he didnt capitalize on him eight to shoot there is a really silly foul but its only the sixth on pit so they had one to give its leg its third 383 to go each team has a timeout remaining Austin now with five blocks you dont need a Applause three Koo back from Davis kdo is going to drive it trembo goes into Austin Trimble gets his own Miss balls up for grabs tie up pit possession that was a really good find by Elliot kadoo tell you Seth Trimble Im sure wishes he could have had that one back he jumped into the defender balanced himself off just missed it here Mo Diz gra checks in for Corin now this defensive pressure forces you to try to catch the ball into the corners you want to catch the ball in the middle of the floor more so so anything great recognition right there Austin at some point Carolina has to foul and that is the point Trimble fouls legged a 79 shooter and its two shots the rest of the way for pit what is going through Hubert Daviss mind right now well I can tell you what you want to go through North Carolinas players mind right now they are all fragmented on the court look at Pittsburgh Pittsburgh is huddling in the middle of the Court it always already looks as if with 249 seconds left to go North Carolina being down only four points that the game feels over none of them have huddled none of them have talked to each other and this is what Hubert Davis has been talking about Kevin about the lack of leadership on this team I I look I know theyre down five but youre never out of it until youre out of it but you need to have communication about what youre doing next and about what youre going to run offensively what you need to be in defensively and theres no quit in your voice one more fourlegged hes got a dozen today good allaround game two possession game if there threes do you need a three its need a quick Basket doesnt matter what it is Jackson Davis KS hoist thats not even close ball bounces out up in the air to Leed pumps his fist gets fouled slams The Ball and starts to celebrate like I said keev I thought the game was over the last possession I mean what a win for Pittsburgh the two unsung heroes I know leged low have scored a lot of points but Damen Dunn has been everywhere defensively in this game and also the effort and sense of urgency Zack Austin has made knocking down threes and block shots those details have won this game for the Panthers and leg it makes it a three possession game after the game the start of the games going to which it appears is going to be won by Pittsburgh Davis and the dying seconds Trimble 43 no good and the pit Panthers take down the tar Hills 7365 it would not be deterred
