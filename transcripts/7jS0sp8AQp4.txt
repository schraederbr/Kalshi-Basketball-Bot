in his first career game against the reigning ACC most improved player in a preseason all ACC selection Quinton post who wins the jump and we are off and going in the season opener here from kti Forum Jaden Zachary is out there along with Prince Le League Bay Quint post claudell Harris Jr whos the newcomer in from Charleston Southern as a transfer and dein mton a leag bay right to the 10 thats what he does best loves crashing into the paint always willing to sacrifice his body inside great score around the cup Jasper Floyd goes inside for Payton Smith Floyd got it right back and his threepointer is true Jasper Floyd the Junior from Tampa Florida who came in from Hillsboro Community College after starting his career with Northwest Florida State College so kind of similar to Jaylen Zachary comes in for the junior college ranks then Community College for Floyd and he knocks down the triple to get Fairfield a 32 lead early post tried to go inside good play by pton Smith and then post reaching for it collects and Boston College will be called for a shot clock violation no reset as no possession was established another look at that bucket by alag Bay they you see just a path opening through the middle of the lane there but you talked about Smith No Easy Task trying to both defend and score against Quinton post for Fairfield but you know they get him in early touch he set up that three for Floyd and some good defense on the other end Chris Casey spoke very highly of the freshman in our call with him early in the week heres Bryson good eye and that name may sound familiar he started his career in the ACC with Syracuse for his season before transferring to Providence for 2 years then last year played just four games prior to injury but theyre hoping that the senior from New Bedford Massachusetts might have an opportunity to really take on a big role for this Fairfield team absolutely he was you know a top 100 recruit coming out of St Andrews in Rhode Island Quinton post first chance no second effort good so Post in his grad year after starting his career at Mississippi State his third season with Boston College after he miss the first 133 games last year due to injury ended up playing 19 for the season and thats as big as anything as J Zachary off the turnover and is blocked Bryson goodine in good position but the follow from post well this is textbook Jaden Zachary here the Poke he catches goodine sleeping picks his pocket great recovery for the block by goodine but no quit on the play by mton Feats post crashing in and no choice but to give the foul and something quit and post I think learned along the way especially last year is especially when you get to the ACC you got to be able to finish through contact Quint post was an 86 free throw shooter last year kind of your classic modern big hes a good threepoint shooter hes good from the floor in fact last year post 50 from the floor 40 from three 80 from the line all above that and average 15 points he was the first player in 10 years in division one basketball to average over all four of those totals yeah was crazy to see that that has not happened in a decade you got to go back to douge mcbuckets in Katon thats right and that just sort of tells you the kind of the rarified capability that post brings to the game if he can consistently do that hell attract some scouting attention as well Odell Harris junr first opportunity not there all big South Second team selection last year theres a threepointer thats good Michael Rogan the red shirt freshman who red shirted last year came in from the South Kent school in Connecticut and Fairfield back within one something to keep an eye on early on Eric couple threes for Fairfield remember BC had some struggles defending the threepointer last year especially in their tournament loss against the Tarheels huge matchup Advantage here for Boston College post against Smith and post wins again thats just bully ball inside early seven for Quinton post Smith kind of gave him a shoulder coming back up the floor theyre already getting into it pton Smith was too long out of bounds it will go to Boston College and you could see post is in his head a little bit early on he hurried that shot barely had it on his fingertips before he let it go well Chris Casey talked about pton Smith and he said hes really grown the last few weeks worked hard getting up and down the floor but theres still the challenge of doing things faster at the speed of college basketball and a very difficult match up in game number one again against Quinton post ason Madson into the game for the first time for Boston College as well as Chaz Kelly the sophore ason Matson sporting a bit of a different look thats nearly turned over Bryson goodine aggressive also Armani Mighty with sophomore from Toronto is into the game a bunch of changes here for BC Lou bleach more the senior from Australia in for the first time for Fairfield Quinton post could not keep it in without stepping on the line so good pressure defense by Fairfield there making life difficult for Boston College to inbound yeah really tough spot you having inbound it from your own corner with only two seconds to get it over midcourt so basically all you could do there was sort a lob up to the big man and Obi could either catch it land in bounds or redirect it threepoint look again Bryson goodine is too strong and Quint post has the rebound he goes in transition Mason Madson Falling Away swings around post Waits back for Kelly threepointer is in and out and then a foul on the rebound try will stay here with Boston College good ball movement from BC something they talked about in the preseason was trying to expand their repertoire a little bit offensively you know they still want to be gritty but maybe a little bit more pretty especially on the offensive end they just really struggle to get any sort of consistency shooting the three ball last year outside of Quinton post here is post for three just a little strong Mason Madson with an offensive rebound well Grant told us earlier today he feels like his offense is actually a bit ahead of his defense which is a little bit different from what hes used to is such a defensive minded coach couple of offensive rebound tries for Boston College but then Fairfield grabs it and we step aside bc9 quit post s Fairfield 6 so Im at McDonalds if you got to try McDonalds Mambo sauce struggled a little bit down the stretch in the SE seon in the mag but really their best attribute was their ability to defend the three seventh best nationally held opponents at 29 that was really their calling card a year ago they also got to the line a lot and made a lot of free throws well thats going to be important right especially in the Metro Bryson good ey out front beat Madson and puts it in Nice Home Run pass their design off of the press coming out of the timeout by Boston College but to finish the point about fairfields threepoint defense and when we talked to Chris Casey he said this league is full of unbelievable guards and you have to be able to defend them adsons threepointer was way off but ended up a league Bay with a rebound and then Armani Mighty follows it up Michael Rogan little bit short on the three to answer now Armani Mighty is someone who really might have a chance to take a jump as we look at the inbound Bryson goodine with the opportunity IDU put on nearly 20 lbs of muscle this off season and Earl Grant said you know depending on the situation but theres a chance for a little bit of a jump there for the sophomore who played just about four minutes a game last year I mean theres going to be some opportunity for somebody in the front Court I mean obviously Quinton post isnt going to come off the floor a whole heck of a lot El leite Bay M glockton their spots in the rotation are pretty secure but theres going to be opportunity for you know an additional big its just going to be who whos going to win those minutes follow up good Devin mlon with his first points another one in the front Court really the season last year that we talked about it the guy who can take the leap he started 10 of the last 11 games six points per contest a season ago that went up as a starter though as the year went on I mean hes such a Difference Maker in the sense that he does the little things he really embodies that gritty not pretty mentality that El Grant wants to this team to have offensive rebound by Michael Rogen and inside Jack Brown whos a former walk on expected to get some minutes this year for Fairfield and he traveled I mean mlon you know hes never NE never really going to wow you on the score sheet you know outside of the occasional game here there but hes always going to crash the boards hes always going to defend hes always going to run up and down the floor and when you do those little things you know they always help a team win Donald Han Jr back from injury in just his second game last year when he tore his ACL theres Kelly sophomore for two played in 30 games last season averaged about 15 minutes for contest for Chaz Kelly someone whos going to be key in the back court along with Donald Han as they spelled Jaden Zachary yeah you want you talk about BC being in the conversation at the end the growth of those two players from year one to year two with hand being injured last year and theres Chaz Kelly out front creates the turnover and he is stripped Jasper Floyd stayed with him stride for stride right idea by Kelly here he takes it into the body of Floyd just exposes the ball a little bit nice little quick jump step to the left to set up the jumper away with a little grab of the arm there but knocked the ball loose adson passed it up inside for Mighty it was just a bit out of breach post Zachary and Harris all back in for Boston College Matt Curtis the freshman in for the first time for Fairfield yeah that was sort of an interesting five on the floor right you didnt know who was necess going to be responsible for initiating the offense it kind of fell onto Kellys shoulders but you didnt really have necessarily a true goto guy on the floor there for BC so halfcourt offense breaks down a little bit you get Zachary and quiton post back in the game pton Smith falling away bit short heres Quinton post going to work nice find for claudell Harris whos Applause fouled really good patience here by post you can see hes setting it up the whole way just Waits until Floyd really commits and Harris makes his cut finds him on a nice pass over the top again just you cant teach seven foot Ladell Harris we talked about it all big South Second team last year he was second in the conference with 17 and a half points a game its also a big Southall freshman team selection native of Louisiana one of two native Louisiana on the Boston College roster well the interesting thing when you talk about Harris is a lot of the questions that you sort of bring up with Quinton post about consistency are kind of the same things you talk about with clud Harris Jr just you know he can score you know he can score in the Big South can he score consistently in the ACC and thats sort of the question that well find the answer to during the year pull up in and out Donald ham with the defense and out on the Run leading the offense for mton four points for dein mlon and thats what Donald Han Jr can do back healthy after he had a knee injury just 27 seconds into his second game against Detroit last year Jasper Floyd and a travel its a onew on the jump step take a look at that fast break and the execution by Donald Dan really good patience here got Floyd to hesitate thought about giving up that ball early and then waited until mton was basically at The Rim to feed it to Applause him already five turnovers for Fairfield Elijah strong freshmans in there for the first time for Boston College theres Applause post he just took the Freshman to school there old school little quick pivot of the hips rising to the rim for the flush nine points early for Quinton post theres Rogans jumper for his Good Michael Rogan who knocked down a three earlier thats five early points for Michael Rogan the red shirt freshman playing for the first time after a red shirt here Jaden Zacharys got a lane Zachary got the friendly roll need a little more of that up from Jaden Zachary the drive but also the Finish is really the big part of it Smith finds Rogan may have been affected but its knocked down with Elijah strong in his face Michael Rogan off to an excellent start thats eight points on two triples heres shooter even with a hand in his face did not matter that Applause time haris travel tried to hold that pivot foot just slid on him a little bit 1101 to go in student body and theyve watched their team off to a good start 10point lead and Jaden Zachary will be called for the foul just the second foul called on Boston College what a start for Michael Rogan who has eight of fairfields 13 points so far two threes and one just inside the ark as well red shirt freshman the first action of his college career at Curtis working against Fred Payne whos in the game for the first time theres a triple try no good from Bryson good ey a couple of freshman in there for Boston College heres Quint post wide open Applause triple 12 for Quinton hes putting on his show here in the first half good answer at the other end from Matt Curtis out of Northwest Catholic High School three time all state selection in Connecticut the programs alltime leading scorer and thats saying something thats a program that has Bru a lot of good college players a couldnt quite control it underneath stays here well weve talked about Quinton post is the modern big its a 43 threepoint shooter a season ago and when hes able to catch and square up you can pretty much kiss it good night every Music time post inside is foul thats just the size advantage and the experience of Quint post against the Freshman pton Smith yeah he knows hes going to be able to kind of nudge him off the spot a little bit and then when he rises up especially if he goes into the body like he did there Smith just you know just doesnt have the height to match up and really bother his shot post does such a good job at keeping the ball high which is such a key attribute for a post Music player quinon who is the seventh leading returning scorer in the ACC this year so he said a preseason All Conference selection Applause and brings back the fourth best returning field goal percentage in the conference it tests the NBA draft Waters but decided to return to Boston College and there is an offensive foul on Applause Fairfield Curtis tried to sell a little bump against the moving Music pick Zachary backing down spins around good eye and hits boy for J Who averaged just under 11 a game last year one of the real success stories of Earl Grants tenure at Boston College found him at of Junior College hes arrived at BC and really been an important X Factor what a block from Applause post well Quinton post has certainly come to play here in the opener absolutely intensity right out of the gate for the big man says not in my house Anthony Davis Jr and told him to just stay on the floor there good ey inside finish at the rim and a fourth rebound for post haris in transition thats too strong on the three feels like hes still finding his way to the offense a little bit other end Michael Rogans trying not there a pardon that was Jack Brown on the threepointer fler does not get the friendly roll for Madson and out of bounds going the other way yeah post wanted the law but was sandwiched in Madson elected to call his own number there its a rare Miss for Boston College seven of their last nine from the floor and they know theyre going to be able to attack the paint pretty effectively with their size Advantage inside not just post but you know when mton in the game or a league Bay you know theyre able to score effectively in the middle as well Michael Rogan Fall Away no inside offensive rebound Davis and two tries not there and Prince Al has the re rebound for Boston College Harris out in front nice little handoff for post and Quint post has 15 points and a timeout Fairfield well he averaged 15 a season ago to lead Boston College and at this rate hes going to average a lot more than that 15 points still with 804 to go in the first half as much use out of the costume as possible if youre spending the dough Boston Colleges year last year nine ACC wins that was their most Inc conference play coming up from six in 20 2122 but those nine wins the most in 12 years so last season 16 and 17 following a 13 and 20 year in year one theyve won three ACC tournament games over the last two years three ranked wins last season and they bring back nine players from last years team which is only one of two players national teams nationally that can say that so you know we talked to Earl Grant about it and he said number one its just refreshing how many familiar faces there are so they can go on an overseas trip to Italy and Spain which well talk about just a lot of familiar guys they put some things in early thats why he said he felt like they actually put in a lot of offensive stuff early and the offensive stuff might actually be a little bit ahead where the defense is to start the season and if you can get in some offensive Rhythm early through some of these early games thatll obviously help your team as well but its interesting you go back and it feels like we were saying some of the same things last year especially about a lot of returning faces and consistency but you never know how a seasons going to play out the way the season played out last year for Boston College things kind of morphed a little bit where Quenton po kind of became the guy especially as he returned from injury and got hot into ACC play so hes off to a great start it looks like hes prying for another great season we dont ultimately know how the year is going to go injuries you know guys thats the most important thing right now for Boston College the fact that the only guy in a boot is Earl whos dealing with an Achilles injury on the sideline but everybody else good to go Quinton post is foul going up for a little alley lay it small lineup on the floor right now for Fairfield Smith is out of the game so you know its going to be a challenge for anybody on the floor trying to defend Quint post but especially if you dont really have a true post player in the ball game its going to be that much more difficult to keep him from where he wants to get to around the basket Airfield is in the penalty now is 733 remaining in the first eight Smith will indeed come back in here for brown and youre back in the game for Boston College Chris Casey went over to get him took the towel off his head gave a quick wipe sort of like up back into the mines we go again this Fairfield team under this roster construction this coaching staff has only had two weeks of practice two and a half weeks of practice or so there was so much change some new assistant coaches that have been added here in recent weeks since some of the coaching changes back in early October as that one goes down good look from Jasper Floyd he has five points in the first half Jon Mansons wide open triple for medson his first points of the season when he came in from Cincinnati that was sort of one of the books on him as he is a knockdown threepoint shooter Floyd no good follow from Rogan was a good opportunity but just couldnt finish at The Rim adson struggled a little bit on the outside shot last year just 30 from three so if he can get it going early could mean good signs for him over the course of the year and was looking for post instead it cycled through tip ball Donald Han finds it adson steps away threepointer little bit short bounced around a couple of times before pton Smith found the rebound nice and good eye against hand drives the foul and the buckets this is what Boston College has been doing all night quick push up the floor missed assignment as Fairfield is trying to switch defenses from a manto man into a Zone hson got lost in the shuffle and then this is the type of athleticism that may good ey a top 100 recruit coming out of high school just able to get to the rim strong take bends off the body and still puts it in so six points for Bryson goodine again just four games last year prior to injury after 37 games over his two seasons at Providence and for three strong Quinton post had a piece of the rebound but then Michael Rogan finds it its tipped away Jasper Floyd on the run that was affected by post and Chaz Kelly in there defensively as well and trying again again hes off the mark from three College just two for 10 from Beyond The Arc tonight has not mattered so far with the 3621 lead goodine Music aners already one shy of his season high from last year he knows hes going to have to play a big role tonight you mentioned early on a couple of the guys that are missing for Fairfield theres a three Bill Walton knocks it down new look for Madson this year ear Grant is the one who uh mentioned the look alike well if he keeps hitting threes he wont tell him to cut the hair thats right well said I might have to tell him to clean it up if it gets too long but its good for now goodine spinning through trying to get free slip play to Rogan Ah thats a pretty good find but just didnt finish at The Rim adson feeling it stead gives it off Prince El League Bay inside and a blocking foul go Smith against Fairfield well we mentioned the threepoint shot for Boston College they really did not take a ton of Threes last year really when they were taking fewer threes was when they were a little bit more successful in that offens right I mean you see the conversion rate around the rim I mean 60 close to 60 thats something you really expect mostly out of your sort of interior big men when youre shooting close to the rim so the fact that as a group they were able to hit close to that rate shows how effective they were at getting the ball around the basket scoring But ultimately in college basketball you have to be balanced if youre going to be successful so the threepoint shot is a weapon can be used as a weapon auson college has players who can hit it its just a matter of putting them in the right spots to do so pass was thrown away Rogan behind Applause Floyd Kevin mton back in for Boston College 3924 the Eagles lead wire to wire starts Boston College in the season opener Donald H third times a charm just good to see him back and healthy really highly thought of recruit last year who was injured just moments into his second game of the season after he played in 13 minutes in the opener against Cornell Grant thinks he has a real chance be a significant part of this team this year well well defended by good ey Floyd was there as well Jasper Floyd tried to Dish it off when Armani Mighty was there defensively and there was just nowhere to go with the basketball yeah Floyd got caught up in the air two big bodies flew at him he had no choice but to Dish It Off Donald hands ACC Alum his dad from UVA he shows the range a 42 to 24 lead led by Quint post 17 points in this first half we talked about the idea that maybe the offense a little bit ahead of the defense early in the season while its certainly been a solid offensive performance and thats considering the Eagles started two of 10 for down have hit two of their last three though good ey for three thats good so Bryson goodine ties his career high with that triple with 12 points he said a couple of years ago at Providence starting to take things over for Fairfield he knows he going to have to put this team on his back a little bit if theyre going to have a chance of getting back in this game a glockton inside six points for dein mton again it looks so simple but it it is very difficult in execution just crashing to the rim a good Strong finish from mlock well coming up during our halftime report well chat with both coach Grant and Coach Casey and look behind the scenes with an ACC season preview highlight stats thats all coming up during our halftime report Rogan finds the offensive rebound Falling Away what a first half from Michael Rogan hes up to 10 points showed a real good ability to shoot the ball from inside from outside its just a matter of know him sort of being able to find his openings you know he got a couple good looks early I think Boston College probably you know red shirt freshman you might not have him top of the scouting report but they learned about him quick Harris Fall Away jump first rolls off and then mightys going to be little battle for the rebound they actually get the foul on Bryce and goodine yeah theyre going to call him for the clear out Mighty was up in the air and again this is you know what weve seen a little bit more of the last years hes up in the air and after he leaves the ground thats when goodine clears him out and thats that verticality rule youre entitled to your space essentially within a cylinder and goodine deprived him of that Music three guys now with two fouls for Fairfield and he off the mark on the free throw so final two minutes of the first half 4429 lead for Boston Music College defense from Zachary against goodine goodine slips by and Zachary is called for the foul on the reach before the basket its been a fun battle to watch here in the first half those two guys really digging in defensively against one another second foul on Jaden Zachary just the sixth on Boston College Jasper Floyd will inbound underneath quickly to good ey nice set up on the inbounds play but Matt Curtis no good on the three Heidi got a size advantage against jack brownes it off to Mason Matson slipping his way through seven a shoot for Chaz Kelly lost the handle on it got it back looking inside for Mighty and its out of bounds off the Boston College nice job defending the pick and roll there was a double screen Mighty set it up one way and then Kelly allowed him to flip it and set it up on the other Fairfield did a good job just sort of dropping back staying at home and daring Kelly to shoot over the top but as he went to rise up he lost the handle Boston College is led by as much as 18 in this first half good eye got it in a foul a new career high 14 points for Bryson goodine stepping into a more significant role with Fairfield as we talked about down a bunch of ke pces and goodine is come to play tonight and this was the hope right saw a glimmer of it last year in the four games that he played but the pedigree is there and you can see the ability and maybe its just he sort of had to remind himself of who he is and thats what hes done over the the course of this first half so he talked about started his career at Syracuse played 23 games in the 2019 2020 season two seasons averaging seven minutes for Providence only over 37 games only four games last year prior to an injury Donald Han trying to find something right hand no good and the Eagles have got a touch cold from the floor here theyre scoreless for the last two plus minutes Jasper Floy down the other end Curtis an offensive rebound is fouled yeah things just looking a little disjointed the last few possessions for BC offensively and look its you know kind of obvious to say maybe but Quenton post com off the floor and theres sort of a little bit of a looking around like all right whose turn is it whos going to take over and thats going to be the the feeling out process early in the season is establishing that pecking order that natural pecking order that comes on offense DC still shooting 52 from the floor oh for two from the line from Applause Curtis shot clock is off so the Eagles can hold for a final look up 44 32 and a foul on Jasper Floyd will send Boston College to the line I think this is actually going to be on Rogan who is keeping Mighty from getting to help set the screen right it is Rogan its the 10 fou of the half on Fairfield so two free throws for Armani Mighty thats another guy with two fouls now for fairfields a a big roster play as you mentioned a bunch of guys out so hard to say how deep theyre really going to be able to go here on night one good ey back in for Davis ID whos played eight minutes in this first half two free throws final seconds for Fairfield and a foul on a reach in with 52 seconds remaining in the first I think thats the third on hand first game returning from injury after missing most of last season injury was early enough in the year that he was able to take a red shirt year and thats thats a young foul right you know late in the game you know Floyds not really going anywhere on that drive the help is available to him hand is just you know trying to be a little too aggressive and knock the ball away but thats something that you know sort of as he grows and he learns you wont make the those same kinds of errors in these situations Jasper Floyd makes the front end to the one and one Airfield brought in Luke Davidson the sophomore bunch of guys with two fouls so Davidson comes in for the final 52 chance to cut it to 12 those lad as we said as much as 18 as Kelly spinning through got taken away Fairfield a final chance and almost went from Jack feel better about itself on offense but I think a big part of that was quiton post was off the floor chance inside is blocked at The Rim from goodine that was post there Elite Bay was in there as well and then its turned over to Jasper Floyd Floyd on the Run good ey what a slam caught it with the left hand thats one way to keep your confidence High climb the ladder and Fairfield is within 10 they have not been this close in a while I know its college basketball season now football but that ball got mossed butell Harris little bit strong on the jumper still trying to find his stroke in his first game as an eagle transfer from Charleston Southern Jasper Floyd got tied up and a jump ball possession will go back the other way to Boston College nice stay at home defense here by Harris tough giveaway there by a league b just kind of got caught in the back court without any help no one came to help him gets caught to twoon one and that top 10 highlight from goodine Leech more got his foot in Kick the in bounce pass away leech more who was out for a good chunk of that first half was he picked up two fouls pretty early on hes another guy who can sort of fill the shoes a little bit no Fields no leech need some offense good put a little bit of pressure on Clinton post 17 of the Eagles 46 points so far Zachary right hand floater got his own rebound good read by Zachary to see that shot was going to miss and he finds the rebound that six points for Jaden Zachary yeah you got to attack the ball when youre rebounding you cant just expect it to fall to you assume that you have everybody boxed out thats what Zachary did he went after the basketball and he was rewarded for his efforts the nine slipping inside Rogan went a big first half continues it 13 points for Michael Rogen those are the two guys right now for fairfields goodine breaks down the defense collapses everybody inside everybody caught ball watching and Rogan sticks the three from the corner barefield with in nine Austin College is led by as much as 18 tonight post has the size advantage against smithfields starting to throw a double team that way though and a league base off the mark from three at the end of the timer so had to get it off just took too long to get into post hands that time and by that point leate in the shot clock know youre going to throw the double triple team at him heres the good look of the three from Rogan kind of just like early giving him clean looks so Fairfield has extended the little bit of momentum they gained to the end of the first half beginning in the second Michael Rogan again inside Payton Smith follow a missed and Rogan couldnt save it I have to imagine in that locker room fairfields telling themselves look we won the last 5 minutes of the first half lets go win the first 5 minutes of the second half and then see where were at HST got a lane Quinton post oh its in and out follow once no follow second time no before it comes down to Good Eye o reaches over the back and draes the foul second foul on post and a little Pleasant opening night chat hul with some words for Smith a little greedy there on the reach and that was the right call see post is trying to assert himself a little Music bit heres goodine inside against post couldnt finish and Zachary found the rebound and running in transition downhill Zachary excellent push and then got a piece it is out of bounds going to Boston College yeah good iron finger tipped it on the way out lets see as soon as he gets his rebound he turns up the floor sees hes got couple buddies with him so hes Off to the Races nice split of the double team there to get to the rim again love to see more of that from Jaden Zachary this year its not necessarily being selfish but just recognizing that when driving to the basket sometimes you are the best option Grant talked about he said everybody knows that you know Quinton post is the big guy but talk about the glue of the team guys like Jaden Zachary and its moments like that where he creates a defensive play goes in transition then causes another turnover and leavs the guys like quit post knocking down the shot nice job by Matson did a good job eyeballing the rim showing shot draw the defense in freeze up post inside and a foul goes against Boston Applause College its Devin mton right there called for the foul and th call goes through the body even though he does get a hand on the ball Smith wisely going up with that left hand credit Fairfield again you know they obviously think very highly of them theyre theyre trying to run some for him offensively there hes in good position its just uh certainly a tough matchup for him here on the on opening Applause night aen Smith a couple at the line 12point lead Boston Music College a league Bay open three Off the Mark so DC has still struggled to touch from behind the arc four of 14 from out there thats in and out from good ey Fairfield now six for 16 from three tie up underneath 5240 the BC lead theres you see Jaden Zachary is up to eight points on four of six shooting tonight his Eagles have a 12point lead of the season opener over the Stags of Fairfield Quon post skip pass for a league Bay keeps working around seven shoot for Boston College Madson inside nearly lost the handle but Falling Away wasnt a bad look for Madson rolled off and it stays here and the timer resets to 20 yeah hes looking really as confident as as maybe youve ever seen him in a BC uniform again you know the pedigree on him came in as sort of a knockdown shooter but he can sort of find his rhythm early again thats going to be a huge win for BC adsons pass was knocked away away Michael Rogan did a good job to find it still on the ground though nice and good comes away for Fairfield that is whistle behind the play it looked like I think there was an issue with the clock perhaps I dont know so mlon do for the ball and then when he went to get up he slipped on the floor so when the play went down the other end they were coming to mop up the floor you see the slip after the dive watch as he gets up oh right there yeah but they let the play continue for probably another 58 seconds I think they were looking at the shot clock though cuz the shot clock if you saw in that image did not reset to 30 so now theyve added 10 seconds to 23 it looked like it only reset to 20 instead of 30 so perhaps thats why I can still understand why Chris Casey might be upset because that whistle blue as as theyre getting a shot away right obviously it looked like a chance for Fairfield Tak it off heres Payton Smith its back for L bleaches to strong for three good offensive rebound though for Smith bu he stepped out of bounds lets just look one more time so look at the timer behind the play when it resets it only resetted to 20 on the change of possession rather than 30 so thats why that play gets flown dead yeah I can still sympathize with the coach though you know whistle blows as youre putting a shot in the air and now you have to go back and run half court offense even with 10 more seconds I think youd rather have an open look yeah a league Bay steps in pull up jumpers so prince who scored the first two points of this game and then adds his next bucket there not been quite as efficient a half offensively for both of these teams as the first half Eagles four of 11 Fairfield two of seven from the floor and another turnover nearly created he couldnt quite save it again the size of Quinton post coming into play there just the wings spin to get a piece of that ball but to your point Eric you know the the inefficiency early in the second half just both teams really digging in defensively Fairfield doing a good job denying post the basketball the six to shoot Jasper Floyd not quite there meanwhile Boston College just forcing Fairfield into ton of tough shots deep into the timer quit post got it you can see he set that up the whole way there he wanted to get a touch hadnt had a good touch in a while says theyre not going to defend me a Step Beyond three Ill show them I can hit it Lou bleach more straight on to answer no good and post fighting with his own man for the rebound want it over to leak Bay now eight rebounds for post to go along with 22 points and theres Jaden Zachary who moves into double fures and gives Boston College it largest lead of the night a quick spurt for BC a 7even nothing run led by the Quinton post triple 22 points to lead the Eagles Jaden Zachary talked about it coming out of Junior College a really impressive find was impactful as a freshman but then last year over 10 points a game nearly three assists was fourth in the ACC in steals per game kind of active all over the floor and no Grant talked about how hes kind of the glue piece of this group this year yeah for him it all starts on the defensive end right especially the ability to guard the other teams best ball handler best scorer sometimes you can guard all three guard position good find by claudell Harris Jr and the land couple good long Euro steps there but to finish the point on Zachary I I think the missing ingredient is maybe the confidence on the offensive end you know he has that Swagger on defense knowing that he can steal the ball from anybody at any time if he develop some more confidence and were seeing it tonight with the ability to take the ball to the basket and score with either hand this is a great job navigating into the body of Smith finishing with the right hand you know if he shows that confidence consistently hes a guy who can average 12 13 15 potentially points a game hes called for the block there is third foul back to back whistles here this one against Devin mton so its a 9 nothing run for Boston College over the last minute 56 seconds of Game Time Fairfield has not scored in more than three and a half minutes no but this is a crucial stretch here next few minutes Zachary off the floor with three fouls post getting a breather so who takes control for Applause BC Harris nearly got to it again eight to shoot pton Smith inside left hand good pton Smith with the first field goal of the night made a free throw earlier and the Freshman who really there are a lot of things to be excited about with him its just early and young and hes going up against Quinton po timeout was granted there on the tie up underneath with 1209 remaining in the second half 6142 Boston College leads on opening night what makes a life quarterback of the now eligible Boston College Eagles Thomas castalanos meeting a few fans here tonight theres Mason Manson who hits the three right in front of his bench is he going to throw his headband in the ready now Quinton pulls might just be literally the biggest man on campus hard to argue here it goes against Harris yeah its worth mentioning with natson last season 40 made threepointers which led the team but again it just seemed like something wasnt quite right and this offseason he was diagnosed with an autoimmune disease hes on medication now and he talked about it at media day and he just said you know I can finally see the light at the end of the tunnel it doesnt mean its perfect but I can take medicine for it it has allowed me to deal with it and I can just kind of be free and play and understand what and not have to worry about certain other things of what might hurt on what day just said its exed for him to be healthy for the first time since he was in freshman yeah I mean these guys know their bodies as well as anyone certainly I mean they go through an intense training regimen through the offseason through the preseason all during the season you know theyre theyre constantly sort of being assessed and proded at so you know if he senses somethings not right hell be able to tell you and there he is with a big block so a couple of good defensive plays on that sequence and off post got knocked out of his hands from behind but mlon found it post with a step back three 25 points for Quinton post well even when things dont go right they go right for Quinton post theres mton making another hustle play post with his eighth career 20po game tonight nice move at The Rim by pton Smith you can see some of the signs here for Smith yeah hes you know couple nice turns to the left hand there creating space whle on the floor before Matson on the drive maton show he can do more than just shoot the three a little bit on the offensive end again you know they dont have helmet stickers in basketball but if they give you you know I guess a little Eagle sticker on the back of the shorts de mlon would have just you know a whole slew of those they can take one of the hard hats from the students and go a hard hat sticker blell Harris nice move and a Applause Music foul Brown just lead to the party there real good sign I think from Harris kind of a slow start kind of looked like he was just sort of waiting to kind of take his turn go back to you know some of the Gody numbers he put up at Charleston Southern seems like he might be the kind of guy who sort of needs to be fed the ball have the ball in his hands a lot in order to create for himself and others and you know when you get into this atmosphere you got a guy like qu post you got a guy like Jaden Zachary sometimes you might not get quite as many touches so you got to make the most of your opportunities and find a way to fit in the rhythm of the offense take comes inside the find a bleach more and post again affects him at The Rim he tried to put post on a poster bleach more denied by the iron unpostable is that a new word CH Kelly bounced around it out that honestly sounds like a dick Vitalis Payton Smith step back got the three hes hot check it out hes got the what seven of the last nine points or so for Fairfield all eight of his points in the second half for Payton Smith another turnover Smith on the run and got another and Fairfield fing their way a little bit closer on a nice run back here by Payton Smith I think he just told the bench he needs a breather here hes certainly earning his minutes here in the second half haris step back triple little Off the Mark Donald Han though found a turnover off the mark from three and off to Rogan steps back Michael Rogen what a game in his real playing debut here as a red shirt last season so playing as a red shirt freshman he has 16 points tonight go along with 17 from good ey and a timeout taken by Boston College I mean always always tough to know what to expect from a team on opening night and certainly youre youre not necessarily going to have a guy whos playing his first career game at the top of the Scouting Report I guarantee see you the next team thats playing Fairfield Michael Rogans going to be near the top of the Scouting Report well Boston College this summer took part every four years you get an opportunity to take an international trip with the program in BC going to Italy and Spain this summer on a 10day trip just a wonderful experience got a little gladiator training played three games as well talked with Earl Grant about it first of all Jaden going Gladiator style against the trainer I think hes got an audition for Game of Thrones after the game tonight I mean I dont know what the process is to select who is going to go against the trainer but Im sure if there was a team vote Jaden Zachary would have won almost unanimously did he win is there a do you win well I know if Im thinking is a good option but uh you know as we mentioned Earl and you know hes hes been dealing with this Achilles injury and hes in a boot still right now but he had to basically he was on the scooter the whole trip so he said he was a little bit of a different experience for him and other people couldnt quite do as much as everyone else but said it actually caused him to notice a few different things triple again for Quinn post and he is now one point short of his career high thats 28 tonight for post white hot from the outside post blowing for steel a little bit awkwardly on the fall but thankfully able to get up and is okay Eric Ill be honest I dont know that Ive ever seen a sevenfooter fall gracefully so Im not going to hold it against them its a long way down post for a new career high got Applause it 31 points for Quinton post hes going to take a big bow here after opening night shooting Fairfield out of this Zone real quick Rogan for three to answer off the mark leore found the rebound between two Eagles and finishes at The Rim first points of the game for Louis bmore Post is open again but he bobbled the pass and its out of bounds going the other way 743 to go in the second its a new career high 31 points for the preseason all ACC selection theres DNA com from behind win earlier today against Holy Cross nice turn out from the students tonight the season opener for BC and Fairfield a new career high 31 points for Quinton post is the story tonight good with a career high of his own 17 though all of those came pretty early on Harris dip C do and is fouled as goodine comes crashing in from behind yeah I had that highlight real dunk early in the second half that was his last basket and again I thought he was going to be kind of key to Fairfield staying in this game ball has kind of gotten away from him in the second half now look theyve still found ways to score Rogan continues to shoot the ball extremely well Smith has gotten it going on the inside but I just think again a guy with Goods pedigree you know if you feed him consistently keep his confidence high he was going to be able to sort of try to go toe for toe with what BCs throwing out there its worth remembering what Chris Casey hopes this Fairfield team has we talked about good ey and how well hes played but remember Fairfield is down Caleb Fields today down Jaylen leech today down Alexis yenta today and down Marina SEC today all players that he feels like have the ability to make an impact as the year goes on yeah I mean two of those guys are on the the ma all preseason team Fields a second teamer Yeta who hasnt even played for Fairfield yet is a third teamer you know he was a a Player of the Year a rookie of the year when he started out at USF so hes definitely going to help out in post out of bounds to Boston College Music Madson back in for Boston College has knocked down a few threes heres Payne bit strong from three but an offensive Rebound mlon in the foul eight points for Devin mlon and this is what you love from mlon hes just hes not going to get out of his comfort zone he always going to crash the boards go goes over the top of the smaller Defender there always just plays with him himself Evin mclock in the red shirt sophomore who really took a jump last year for Boston College 172 minutes six points a game four rebounds a career high 20 against Nebraska and a double double effort was after Red shirting as a freshman another guy Grant was talking about mton and Zachary is kind of the glue guys of this group what a move by Lou bleach more the transfer from St Joes came off the bench last year started his career at harkham College in Pennsylvania before going to St Joes the Australian native into Fairfield for the first time this year mson passed it up and off mclock on the drop gave it up Zachary threepointer is short the foul goes against mton on the rebound try it might be a little bit of a ways for Fairfield to get back in this game but I tell you what theyll least have a couple of good good things to put on the Highlight Reel tonight yeah gine with that onehanded finish on the alleyoop and then bmore with that blow by just got post off balance and saw nothing but Rim out of Bal going the other Applause way so 535 remaining and an 81 58 Boston College lead here on opening night host already with a career high Applause 31 pay on the drive rolls around and off but pton Smith lost loost the rebound its out of bounds though off BC is the Applause Applause ruling their foul called underneath with 502 Music remaining so mton and Payne come out here Elijah strong is back in another one of these new freshman for Boston College strong strong from Myers Park High School where he helped that School win its first State title in 57 years Charlotte North Carolina Applause Music well we mentioned it was a little bit of a slower start to this second half theres Donald H Off the Mark in three but DC has shot the ball well enough as this game has gone on right back to 50 and a half 51 for the game Applause team that was certainly not known for its offense a season ago and fact they are three points away from tying last years season high in points adson couldnt finish inside good eye long two is no good that is out of balance going back the other way you said one of the talking points was the offense and just how you know in Rhythm and and sort of up to speed they were early on in the year I remember too going into last season they were a little bit banged up at some guys who were sort of on their way to being healthy Quon post was one of them who missed a bunch of games early in the year so having just about everybody available certainly makes a Music difference Music haris waited three ball its a little short kind of the next step for Claude El Harris quite find his shot tonight an accomplished score talked about trying to find that consistency averaged nearly 18 a game last year in the Big South for Charleston Southern leech Moore Falling Away chance at The Rim though on the follow by good ey is blocked by post strong to the bucket Elijah strong went to the left hand and couldnt quite finish both teams have gone a little bit cold from the floor here we have not had a point in the last three minutes of this game down to 307 remaining and an 8158 Boston College lead and getting close to the time where BC can start to take the air out of the ball a little bit leore got a piece nearly a takeaway a tie up will give possession to Fairfield zachar is out of bounds 8158 251 to go there are trucks tonight a new career high passing his 29 that he had last year against Notre Dame was also the day that Boston College scored their most points the season ago 84 they three away from that the final 245 goodine has had a strong day for Fairfield as has Rogan Michael Rogan certainly maybe not the guy you would have picked off the card but again with a number of different players injured for Fairfield you need somebody else to step up and Rogan has certainly done that yeah I mean thats the thing is you didnt know who was going to step up thats good from the corner for Donald Hans you know there were so many new faces in this Fairfield group a lot of them sort of getting their first Tas to college basketball Rogan was one of them armanii mightys in there for Boston College now as well final two minutes tonight this hand off the mark there good ey for three he has again came in with a career high of 12 he has blown that away 22 points on eight of 18 shooting for Bryson good ey say you look at a fully healthy Fairfield team theyre going to be good at the guard spot adding goodine with fields Jaylen leech Jasper Floyd as Casey talked about it the Mac has been a guard heavy League theres the first points of the career for Fred Payne The Freshman from Grambling Applause Louisiana Smith got it saw some signs from pton Smith in this second half absolutely I mean you know he was getting a tick in do in that first half by Quinton post and took the break it felt like to kind of assess maybe coaches kind of pump him back up a little bit say hey youre here to play for a reason Donald Han adding a couple of Threes here late thats nine points for hand and Chris Casey is going to use a time out with 452 seconds Music remaining oh what a day it was for Quint post as we talked about leading the way with the new career high 31 points he made five threepointers blocked three shots as well we talked about it off the beginning of the show the recipe for Boston College where theyre trying to go this year and a lot is going to ride on the back of number 12 he certainly proved that hes up for it so far so good good right you know all it is is you know a series of one game tests and on night one he certainly passed the test Beyond just the 31 points the threepoint shooting you know he can do all that I think you have to be really excited about 11 rebounds and four blocks I mean he only averaged about six boards a game last year if hes going to become sort of a guy who attacks the glass especially on the defensive end with his size hes going to be a factor and hes going to help you keep teams to just one and done on the possessions offensively so you know if he can again take that next step improve the rebounding improve the defense and keep the offensive game consistent youre looking at a special player and again and we kind of asked Ro Grant this but even just to do it night one like this to make that big a statement as Louis bleach more connects from three airfields hung in and down a lot of players interesting to see how how they pan out in the Mac this year you saw whats on the horizon for Boston College they will be on the road starting a home and home series with the Citadel and Earl grants native Charleston Jaz Kelly inside hand off was stripped away and then a foul committed by Kelly on the back Music end Fairfield will come back to New England on Thursday theyll take on Rhode Island before heading home into their brand new Arena just their second season as Fairfield will use the timeout here in 10 seconds remaining the Leo Mahoney Arena which was just built on fairfields campus open last year brand new facility and Boston College also with a new facility as well their new indoor practice facility which was was dedicated at the end of September the hog Pavilion it is stateoftheart throughout practice courts wait rooms video rooms and Lounge areas for both the mens teams and the womens Team new locker rooms really brings Boston College to where you need to be in in right now and Earl Grant talked about how important it is to have it with recruits bringing people in Joanna B be back to be the head coach of the Boston College womens team talked about it as well a Quinton post siiz couch thats right most important got got to have a couch of the seven Footers yeah I mean these are obviously just amazing amazing facilities for these student athletes and they are all very appreciative thats connected here to compy Forum if you havent been on campus recently so connected to the Old Entrance that looks out on the rest of canas on the Commonwealth abide you know one thing weve talked a lot about through the years with Boston College and I think its fair to say Earl Grant would talk about this is again what the quest may be in terms of being relevant and in the conversation at the end of the year you do have to take care of business in some of these nonconference games give Boston College credit they have done that tonight two at the line for Floyd its nine points for Jasper Music Floyd Fairfield putting the Press on with just 10 seconds remaining and bleach Moore commits the foul can remember I know the fans fairfields only had like 10 practices with this group so any minute is kind of important yeah thats why youre getting timeouts late down the stretch you know theyre theyre using this to to practice end of game situations I mean you know obviously this is not like a one possession game but you know theyre practicing you know how how would you defend in this situation if youre down two or down one out to pain and that will likely do 8970 is the final as BOS College wins the Music opener
