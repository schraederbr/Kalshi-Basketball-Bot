shot trying to follow it up with ranked Virginia at Booty Coliseum Virginia in orange SMU in white We are underway in Dallas Well they almost got the throw toss up They still havent perfected that after 50 years laughter Good to have the Hall of Famer Jim Beheim with us This is an early tip off here in Dallas as cheering the home team Mustangs open to scoring 1100 am local time So little brunch ball to start your college basketball Saturday So both of these teams highscoring SMU leads the ACC 88 points per game Virginia not far behind at 85 points per game Tester Ritter a big reason why follows his own miss It catches in for two These two guys are so good on the offensive glass and they just keep going at it and theyre playing at a high pace and theyre moving the ball as good as anybody and theyve got all new guys SMU starting five veteran backcourt Boopy Miller and BJ Edwards They dont come off the court much Both guys average more than 34 minutes per game Edwards has it here The floater drops The guards are really good in this game and youre not going to find much better guards than the two guys I mean I mean groupy Edwards theyre just really good players And Virginia you mentioned it coach a new look team but theyve won 10 of their last 11 The lone loss a triple overtime road loss to Virginia Tech Bruno misfires from three The two teams that have just been playing winning basketball Pierre transition three off the mark Offensive rebound kick out Edwards got it Thats where you get the best threes when you offensive rebound and dont try to get back Throw it out and get a wide open three Shooting percentage are very high on that shot Good start for the home team SMU looking for a ranked win against a redhot Virginia team cheering And thats a jump ball on the inside Possession arrow stays with UVA Thats a really good defensive save That was a dunk You mentioned the experience that SMU brings back to this team and Miller and Edwards Virginia this is a whole new roster They lost 99 12 of their scoring All but four points they had to replace for the Whos the SMU defense dialed in to start this one Both teams can block shots Thats a big factor in this game When both teams are around the rim you Its not easy to get there Heres Yigu at 72 He usually makes you pay from there Well they got the switch and he had the little guy on him Youre supposed to score when you get the little guy Don Hall veteran point guard kicks it to the corner Thomas knocks it down Malik Thomas he hit six threes in the road win midweek at Louisville Really good freshman Thomas is a good name Louisvilles got one too Hes The freshman this year in the country are playing a big role Uh transfer guys are important but there a lot of freshman in this country this year Is this the best class youve seen in recent memory Yeah I think so I think its going to be a good I think its going to be produce all pro players Iu this time gets it to go He was good last year You dont have to remember hes like 23 years old Hes a sophomore but you know a couple of these guys that are freshman and sophomore are 20 or 22 years old So theyve played in the European leagues They know what theyre doing Yeah Both of these teams have gone into the international pool and found a lot of success Yigolu from Turkey Virginias got the two from Europe Germany and Belgium And Grunlo and Derritter Heres Edwards Hes been in attack mode since tip off finds Yigu again COUNT IT PLUS THE FOUL Cement Yigu taking advantage of Bruno Yeah you know Bruno is not that physical down there Hes going to have a Hes obviously having a problem already with the Yugatu Hes really tough down the low post He gets the ball down there At least I had him last year at Notre Dame Hes just a good player down low He takes up a lot of space He uses both hands and really really good around the basket Theyre five or seven and he missed one layup So thats pretty good Well SMU the home team getting good looks This is a great resume opportunity with number 16 Virginia at Moody Coliseum You know both of these teams projected safely to be in the NCAA tournament but good quad one opportunity today for both teams Its a good thing for the ACC this year Its so much better that you have quad one opportunities the whole year Youre going to get lots of them Virginia just picked up a quad one win 7970 win against ranked Louisville Theyve won 10 of 11 And its tough to win on the road in conference Coach you know that better than anybody Yeah road wins are just goals You know you just cant get what gets you in the trim at the end of the year That committee looks at things One of the key things Ive always thought if you have a couple road wins like at Louisville or at Duke some place that can get you in the tournament if youre out of bubble Test to Ritter heads to the line Hes been a big part of this roster overhaul under firstear head coach Brian Odum came in and knew that he needed guys that could find fast chemistry And this coaching staff been very happy with how theyve blended this roster music particularly on the offensive end I mean look at that Just half a percent of your offensive production is back and yet youre scoring 85 points per game Yeah theyve just played well together and theyre getting better defensively Talking to the coaches before the game thats where they try to make the most improvement Their offense is really good Theyre getting better on the defensive end You know went into the portal and got a balanced group to add to the two freshman Europeans Burllo and Derritter A very balanced offense Virginia that they have been stifled early SMU they throw the first punch You know Virginia Tech has had three of those So whether it was all gone against all gone three Stanford made a long Cory made a long three made one I mean its theyve just been snaked it And its not just what Miller does scoring the ball averaging more than 20 points per game his assists Hes one of four players in the country with averaging more than 19 points and six assists per game He has it here Hes going to try to make something happen here He hasnt gotten much Yet to take a shot today Theyre going inside Theyre really making a concerted effort to get it in there Jaden Tombs who a breakout performance 23 points at Duke the other night has put him on the map The Mustangs two and two in ACC play but theyve had a gauntlet Theyve already had to play Duke UNCC Clemson Now theyve got Virginia Heres Chance Mallerie Shot clock down to four The freshman has to hurry Mallerie the blow by onehanded slam Oh Nenzo flew in and hammered it home Hes got good size good reaction to the ball but Mallerie made the play getting to the basket with no shot clock Both of these teams terrific on the glass Virginia leads the ACC in rebounding Oden Enzo a big reason why Heres Boopy Miller backing down Mallerie step back hits it plus the foul Poopy Miller He really does a good job of backing the little guard down Give him a little push there and get space and he gets the foul I dont know about the foul but he Well Chance Malleries been thrown into the fire here Freshman from Charlottesville Virginia And you have to guard Boopy Miller one of the most dynamic guards in the country Hes been really good for SMU and Virginia fans know what his late game hero can be Last year he hit the gamewinner under a second left at UVA to beat the Whos and right now hes got SMU up by six early Boopy also is playing defense Hes hes doing a very good job on ball Good three Jakari White cuts the SMU lead in half Thats a tough three Its like a Oh you know Yes We like it laughter We like it Both of these teams no problem scoring the basketball averaging more than 85 points per game Edwards good turnaround knocks it down Hes really a good player I mean he makes a lot of plays He does a lot of things Really good back court cheering Virginia still looking to get into their offensive rhythm Theyve hit some difficult shots on the road Nothings coming easy right now Only down five Shot clock down to five White trying to make something happen Lost the handle and turns it over Yeah I mean defense has been very good down here Very very good Busy college basketball Saturday just getting started here in Dallas Good games to follow on ESPN Florida Vandy number one Arizona at UCF Texas AM Texas at a top 15 matchup BYU at Texas Tech If you have not seen AJ Deanza you got to watch BYU Texas Tech How good has he come Hes as good as he gets I mean the freshman class is unbelievable Him Peterson Boozer um will you know I mean its its incredible group of players SMU has knocked down four of their last five That one goes begging Nearly an offensive rebound for Tombs Ripped away Malik Thomas with a head of steam Finds Hall in transition Cant connect Another offensive rebound Thomas backs it out and hits it Malik Thomas cashes in on the offensive board and its a twopoint game Its a hard shot when you rebound dribble out and turn and shoot Its Its not easy Down the lane Scoop to the hoop for Boopy Miller At the end of the game Boopy will be the guy that is going to be there Hes just taking it slow to start out but hell be there Got a really good referee and crew here today too Veteran guys Ron Groover Jeffrey Clark and Chase Shaw Well I hate to say that but you know its its good to Ron Gver Is that the first time youve ever talked positively about officially I think once before I might have but I might not have Im not laughter sure But Ron Gver is a great Hes really one of the best in the country Has officiated multiple Final Fours SMU staying in attack mode Theyre going early in the shot clock and theyre cashing in Theyre getting what they want really Theyre really getting the shots that they want And Virginia has not had much of an answer for them Well Virginias best offense has been second chance points They have five offensive rebounds Its led to seven second chance points And Poops given Hall a lot of trouble getting the ball up the court Hes making him work They cant really get into their offense like they would like to Hall dumps it down Grunlo gets it to go Johan Grudlos first bucket of the afternoon But Virginia they need a stop Coach SMU shooting 70 from the floor Nine of 13 Theyre getting the shots they want Germaine ONeal Jr cant connect His father was good Hes looks like hes going to be a good player too someday his father a great NBA player 18 years at the professional level Great rebound there Cemeu ripped that 7 foot2 from Turkey Hes made a big impact on this game early Hes a lot to handle down there Boopy calling for it and gets it Crosscourt pass Good look from three Its good BJ Davis Ray the freshman fires SMU up seven And thats Cookie Thats all the way He was was patient He didnt force anything He waited and he got a wide open three cheering Good look for Thomas Got it again Malik Thomas Hes hit three threes in the first 10 minutes Really He doesnt play like a freshman Hes pretty really solid You can tell he wanted the ball He wanted the ball that time He was going to make that all the way Oh hes got the hot hand Six threes in the ranked road win at Louisville and already three threes today in Dallas Down low Eiglu double team comes in He misses the layup Bounced out Washington fires it and hes fouled So Cory Washington shooting three free throws When we come back SMU up by four Cavaliers trying to get Cory trying to finish this season undefeated with a national championship as Washington steps up to the line for three free throws I I I think Indianas the most likely winner but Im going to go Miami I I think the trenches the trenches I dont know if Indianas faced a team with as dominant an offensive line a defensive line as the Hurricanes have Im just I think coaches will come up with something to counteract that and what they do Um hes a funny guy and hes a hes a a really good football coach Tell you hes he comes up with some great stuff Whats incredible though is Miami people didnt think theyd even make the field SMU beat the Hurricanes during the regular season People thought that loss would cost them and they get in the last team in and they make it all the way to the championship proven themselves for sure Well little zone here See what Virginia does I I would think theyd be pretty good against the zone Just kept it in play 5 seconds to shoot Got a good one And Ditter finds the soft spot of the zone catches in And thats just really when you see the zone the first time and you are that patient and you get a sixfooter thats thats a good sign Virginia starting to find their offensive rhythm Theyve hit six of their last eight SMU theyve gone inside all game long IU missed it and an offensive foul on the rebound 12 points in the paint for SMU They have a clear game plan Couldnt connect that time though Yeah theyre definitely going to go inside if they can Good comes out of the game SMU a fourpoint lead So it feels like the Mustangs have been the team in a better rhythm and more command And yet Virginia only down four on the road Heres Chance Mallerie on the end zone Thats not his shot But nothing but the bottom of the net Thats not what hes saying I got this Has he hit any this year Probably one Hes taken hes taken a few But usually they keep him on the inside But hes in there for Gruno who is a capable threepoint shooter And he knocked it down Yes he has hit five on the season He believes he can shoot Edwards Tough take Fading away Virginia getting a couple of stops now Lot of contact cheering And theres the call Offensive foul The shove by Jakari White Yeah no doubt about that one Extend that left arm out Its going to be Its an easy call Easy White has added a boost off the bench returning for that Louisville game after missing five games giving some depth to this Cavaliers team Yeah they can bring nine guys in Theyve got players that come in and get the job done Heres Boopy Miller Pierre pull up pop cant stick it Battle for the rebound Very physical in the corner but its won by SMU And a timeout taken by Edwards after he grabbed that ball So well step away This both shoot threes I mean these guys are theres not not much that you dont like about these guys Yeah Tess Ritter He turns 23 in 14 days but a freshman on paper and hes been an instant impact for Virginia this season SMU wins another hustle play Second chance opportunity Miller lines up the three Missed it Thomas fouled as he tried to rip down the rebound Malik Thomas transfer from San Francisco Hes been terrific this season coming in for music the Cavaliers Hes already hit three threes in this game and he makes tough plays Yeah like that And I had a senior moment I know its his first year but hes not a freshman but I get confused with the Louisville times but hes a veteran player and shown it today He might be younger than Ditter though laughter And thats the state of college basketball Ditter cant connect on the three Every rebound is contested Two really good teams on the glass going back and forth Tombs he can hit it from there Not that time and way off the mark Matums missed two months with a wrist injury and sometimes hes still coming back from that with his release point And here is the freshman Chance Mallerie Charlottesville native lobs it up On the Enzo fires Virginia in front Really good play from the freshman Honey Enzos really does a lot of things Hes a really good backup big guy Most a lot of teams would like to have him as a starter Maller tries to keep that in play Cant quite do it music But here comes Yigolu and Grunlow back into the game The two sevenfooters music Its been a great big man battle to watch so far this afternoon I think Bruno is more of a forward and hes playing in the low post against a bigger guy Hes got to battle him in there a little better SMU in a scoring drought of 3 minutes and 30 seconds They have missed their last six shots Miller trying to change that off the window No good Make it seven misses in a row as Virginias defense begins to dial in on the road stringing together stops and cashing in on the offensive end Home crowd thought it was a travel Well theyre football fans down here They didnt they dont see all that stuff laughter Passing out of the double team Thomas the hot hand missed it that time Ditter trying to clean up the spill Latest Ritter so good at positioning himself Always in the right spot Just couldnt quite finish it Hes going to go down there with first down Thats Thats the danger when you were on the double there You can get some open threes Thats a Thats a offensive foul You cannot do that Theyre going to call that every time Just a little movement He was good until the end and then he stuck his leg out And thats two fouls on Yigato who just checked in He has to go right back out with just under six minutes remaining in the first half How would you handle when you were coaching Would you always take the guy out with two fouls I didnt Even when we played manto man in the beginning I if you take out with two fouls he tends to not play hard after one foul So I let him go to three and then would take them out and start them in the second half But its most coaches take them out with two and try to some leave them out the whole half some will sneak them back in Its coaching preference Neither right or wrong Sam Lewis flying to the rim Couldnt finish it on the inside Both of these teams great at rim protection Nothing comes easy That was really had a chance to be an easy layup and made it a hard one Tombs righty hook offensive rebound Edwards and he draws the foul The physicality is certainly increasing over the course of this first half Yeah I mean both teams are physical Both teams play hard on defense and both teams can go get it off the batboards I mean these are two you dont see a lot of weaknesses here They have just really good solid basketball teams music Well you look at what Virginia has done defensively and theyre doing it a different way than they have in the past under Tony Bennett but still very effective when you look at the percentages and certainly the blocks Well nobodys better than Tony Bennett defensively but theyre theyre playing good defense and their offense is so much faster We bring up Tony Bennett UVA decided yesterday theyre going to dedicate the John Paul Guns Arena Court in honor of Tony Bennett Thatll happen a week from today Welld deserved Great great great coach At SMU back in front after the make by Geron Pierre Back and forth we go in the ACC Two of the hottest teams in the country Brunow drives baseline Good ball movement Miller swiped it away recovered Thomas beats the buzzer on a three Malik Thomas thats his fourth three of the first half And that was great defense And then the ball pops loose and go they go right to him for a three Got it off just in time Crosscourt pass intercepted Heres Don Hall Great anticipation from the veteran transferred in from BYU Coach has told us hes been a coachs dream He plays with intensity purpose Another good look from three Another offensive rebound Seven offensive rebounds of this first half Hall cant cash in there Another offensive board TILLIS A THREE GOT IT Offensive rebound Thats what its about Oh Virginia cleaning up on the offensive glass and theyve cashed it in for 10 Second chance point Looking forward to that Zuben and Malcolm Always great to hear my guy Malcolm Huckabe in studio Jim Beaheim Jay Alter with you in Dallas Virginia A 132 run over the last 6 minutes to grab control of this game And its offensive rebounding and getting it back out for wideopen threes Thats what they do Miller trying to shoot SMU back into control of this game and misfires Mustangs just one of their last 11 Theyve gone cold and Virginias capitalized Malik Thomas nothing but the bottom of the net Hes got 14 Hes really having a day The transfer from San Francisco has been terrific all season for Virginia We got the mismatch here Runo comes over and helps and they get the ball out Mallerie had it for a second Stolen back by SMU and it leads the three BJ Edwards and SMU needed that as Virginia was stealing the momentum Hall looking for that immediate answer Another rebound Thomas and its good for three Devin Tillis Thats the game I mean right now its just offensive rebounds Throw them out for threes Going inside Yigu cheering And thats a jump ball Possession arrow with SMU as these teams are trading threes Great hustle play here and to get the open three music and that is 13 second chance points for Virginia now after the tillis three You said it coach that is the difference in this first half Virginia cleaning up on the glass Iu is fouled Hell get two at the line And Virginia has hit eight threes in this first half Probably five or six off offensive rebounds one way or the other Either directly out or eventually out off getting the offensive rebound Hill is a you know really Paul is really an interesting point guard Hes not looking to score Hes just trying to get the ball to people and be tough and strong and be a really old school point guard Hes Hell take a shot once in a while but hes getting the ball to people and hes got people that can score the ball Tomorrow double header on the womens side It tips off at one with Louisville at NC State And then in the SEC its LSU at Oklahoma Thats tomorrow ESPN 2 You were talking about Hall coaches said that he is just playing with so much purpose intensity the leader of this team And look when you got all new guys somebody has to step up as the leader and thats been Don Hall When they started in warmups she was talking to everybody He I I wasnt sure exactly who it was but it was obvious who it was cheering because hes talking to everybody So Virginia has dominated the last eight minutes an 187 run and theyve done it on the glass out rebounding SMU by six during that stretch Odenzo the sevenfooter kicks it out Great ball movement again finding Derritter for an easy two Thats all Great play Just their movement their togetherness for Virginia is outstanding You know they had a slow start but they were never that far out of it And then when they hit their stride they take control of the game You would never know This team had never played together before this season All new guys They have found fast chemistry Theyve won 10 of their last 11 Playing with a lot of confidence as SMU goes down low and Mitchell Holmes puts it up and in for two They need to get something down there They need to kind of get cheering stabilized Theres Its still a good game Its still right there in the game Its a fivepoint game It seems like Virginias just knocking them out of the box but theyre not Even with that made bucket SMU just three of their last 14 One minute remaining in this first half Heres Hall drawing the foul Hes a tough kid He just keeps going keeps looking to penetrate Hes always looking for the next guy And you know when you play for Virginia thats the kind of guy you want to play with Hes looking for you Hes not looking for his shot Hes looking to get you the ball in the right places Its time Heres Mallalerie Finds Der to Ritter Rolled around Did not drop Missed layup there Was too easy Heres Edwards Hes got a mismatch going against the sevenfooter Can he get by him Has a step Uses it Really good play I mean thats You want that matchup but you you still made a really good play Virginia can hold for the final shot of what has been a back andforth first half in Dallas 8 seconds left in it Mallerie in attack mode Kick out A three No good Falls off the rim And we head to halftime with number 16 Virginia in front by three You cannot let them control the boards Virginia had nine offensive rebounds in the first half They turned it into 13 second chance points as we show you the first half music stats and really the the rebounding was the difference and and the threes Yeah second chance points I think the threes its a threepoint shooting differential in this game You get eight threes youre going to be ahead Virginia has it underneath their own hoop Inbound to Sam Lewis He was scoreless in the first half the transfer from Toledo Part of this roster overhaul under firstear head coach Ryan Odum Thomas shot clock ticks down to seven Spins free Cant connect this time Virginia trying to keep it in play Derop grabbed him but he didnt get it Still have time on the shot clock Thomas lets it fly NOTHING BUT THE BOTTOM OF THE NET FOR THE hottest hand of the ACC Malik Thomas Thats his fifth three He missed a two but he got the three Pierre pull up pop An immediate answer Yeah I think theyve got to go more perimeter Get their cheering perimeter guys going a little bit better Well Pierre a proven scorer whos a Conference USA player of the year a year ago 22 points per game Hes brought that scoring with him to SMU cheering Lewis fires a three Misfires it And every rebound has been a battle That was the theme in the first half Nothing is coming easy on the glass for these two teams Very physical solid teams Really good tournament teams at the end of the year These teams they do everything well Heres Boopy Miller A quiet first half for his standards Only five points and three assists Draws the foul there Hell get two at the line and one of the best free throw shooters in the country But you were just talking about these two teams as tournament teams both in the top 32 according to the net rankings Virginia all the way up to 14 during this winning streak And last year I think we had four teams in the top 30 at this time of the year maybe three So its a different league Theyve really done a great job of getting in the portal getting NIL out and its it makes a difference when you have better players And what that shows is theres plenty of opportunities to pick up a quality win whereas a year ago there wasnt There was there was none Now you have chance to pick up five or six quadrants Well Boopy a terrific foul shooter 89 on the year and he knocks them both down Yeah he has to be more involved Hes and he will be SMU 11 and0 at Moody Coliseum this season Virginia trying to hand him their first home loss Thomas Why not GOT IT ON A HEAT CHECK Malik Thomas buries it again Thats his 63 Theyre smart too because theyre looking for him Gritter set a great screen for him Unselfish See when you go inside to the center you have no offensive rebound If he misses you youre empty possessions Inside Grunlow left it short Another battle for the board and it goes off SMU Itll be Virginia basketball Home crowd doesnt like it SMU is really pretty small when you take away the big guys The other guys are not big physical guys Virginia is just physical in here Hall nothing but air and another foul Will keep the ball with Virginia Paul cant buy one today Hes getting good looks too And still scoreless 0 for six from the floor But Virginias going to get another crack at it because of the foul on the rebound Thomas missed it that time but he can let it fly every time he touches it the way hes shooting right now Miller sets up Edwards goes inside Iu rims out No good Hes just two for eight in the paint Layups you know two feet two three feet from the basket You got to make those Lewis tough take Lays it up and in for two And its all Gruno screening down low Keep screening Rescreen And all of a sudden now theyre so worried about the big guy that he gets through and gets a layup stolen away Miller lost the handle Bruno the sevenfooter from Germany stole it and Bruno was tangled up with Yigolu off camera and theyre going to call the foul against Grunllo Two sevenfooters down on the court and Kunlo was saying that should have been called against Eiglu Lets take another look at it We really cant we cant get a look here No we cant get a look But the official Chase Shaw was right there and he pointed right at Gruno and said That foul is against you Previous action is under review for a potential flavor foul We never got a look there That was Jeffrey Clark who just came over leg with one I dont possible I didnt I missed it So the best look we have is coming from overhead music Well thats I dont see that I dont see that music He looked like he just tripped over him basically It looked like Grunlow was just trying to get up Yeah Yeah thats thats what it looked like Okay music Well he did put his hand on him but that I dont I dont think we got anything music I used to yell at Chase Shaws father all the time Curtis when he came into the lead I told I told Chase I think youre better than your father laughter Curtis will be mad at me All right here comes Chase coming over with the call right now Have to review the call on the floors uphill Common foul Virginia SMUs ball 20 seconds on the shot clock Thats Ron Groover making the announcement So ultimately a common foul not a flagrant It does go against Grunlow though I I think it was even tough to call a common foul there I mean it was they were just both getting up and going but it definitely wasnt a flagrant And thats Kunlos second He comes out of the game SMU this is their largest deficit of the afternoon Trailing by seven and its stolen away Derritter comes up with it And then off his knee itll go right back to the Mustangs The big guys like to dribble and hes got the guard with him I think they guard the ball in front of the lane and you get a layup but they like to do Well its been start stop at the beginning of this second half and SMU completely out of their offensive rhythm They have not scored a basket in the last 2 minutes and 40 seconds Pierre tough take and manages it Theyve got to go perimeters Thats Theyre just not getting anything to go post They need to be a perimeter team right now Ditter through two They say it touched the Belgium native last So SMU ball trailing by five Mustangs trying to swing the momentum here at home where they have not lost this season The Whos to a 152 record 41 at ACC Theyve won 10 of their last 11 The lone loss triple overtime against your rival on the road Ryan comes from a great coaching family Dave Owens a great coach at Wake Forest for many years His mother knows a lot about basketball too So hes wellversed in the game of basketball Shot clock did not reset and a good defensive rebound by Jakari White Yeah ODM grew up in Charlottesville when Dave was on Terry Holland staff Count the basket Thats a really good catch and finish there That was a hard play to finish Ditters really he was talked about as a first round late first round draft pick when he decided to come to college Hes pretty good He does a lot of things had of course the March Madness upset when UNMBC beat UVA And you know Andy Enfield SMUs head coach hes no stranger to March Madness history His Florida GF Coast team beat Georgetown as a 15 seed as Boopy Miller puts it home and its a fivepoint game I think its going to change now I think Boopy is going to try to be more of a bad foul Yeah he commits the foul there and that is his third after the make Just as SMU is music trying to steal the momentum away Miller commits the foul at his third and has to come out of this game You just dont want to commit fouls down there You just hit a basket Youre they need Miller to be aggressive and be cheering offensive minded Little more than five minutes through this second half Virginia a fivepoint lead on the road Looking to make it five straight wins and 11 of the last 12 White just didnt catch the ball Bounced right off his hands and out of bounds And thats a turnover music Seventh turnover for Virginia today For all the defensive pressure both teams are taking care of the ball Thats what you have to do Veteran guards for the Mustangs BJ Edwards Poopy Miller Both with two and a half assists to every turnover Its a great ratio Edwards has it here Big guy moving his feet Thats great defense from Ger going inside Yigu righty hook gets it this time He needs to make a couple if theyre going to keep giving them to him down there cheering Back to a one possession game Fans are getting in it a little bit Ditter went up with it Too strong SMU starting to string together some stops in this second half LOOKING FOR THE TIE GOT IT Pierre is cheering tough to handle Hes really tough to handle They have to go there Seven nothing run by SMU Hes got a big size advantage too Oh hasnt hit one today Cant connect again Just having a nightmare shooting TWOHANDED SLAM GERON PIERRE ON A wreck attack I know the Mustangs have stolen the momentum at Moody Coliseum SMU on a nine nothing run They just had to get to the perimeter and get the perimeter guys involved and thats when they go and put it on a poster How about a Sports Center top 10 Giron Pierre SMU up by two now in front by two Its their first lead since it was 2827 And Virginia controlled this game for a long stretch but now trailing by two on the road Heres Hall yet to make a shot today Shot clock down to five Tillis a three Its good Out of the timeout Devin Tillis delivers And Hall makes a big play Hes not making shots but thats a big play Thats what point guards have to do when theyre not making shots And it quiets what was a rockus Moody Coliseum after that nine nothing run Ties third three Hes perfect from beyond the arc Three for three Virginia has 11 made threes Tough to do on the road Risky pass It pays off Germaine ONeal Jr sticks it and SMU back in front by one Hes a good young player cheering His father played 18 years in the NBA Sixtime allstar with the Indiana Pacers Bruno been quiet Hands it off Tried to go a give and go and it ricocheted off a foot Will save Virginia possession here music Well back and forth we go in the ACC This has been a fantastic basketball game You dont want to miss this finish If you want ACC Hurricanes focused programming ACC Network has you covered on Monday It begins at 5 Eastern time and theyll take you all the way through the postgame interviews Weve got a great game here in the ACC between SMU and Virginia The Mustangs up a point Home crowd doesnt like this call Theyve tagged SMU for stepping out of bounds as they took it up the court So itll be Virginia basketball Thats always a tough film when you go step out of bounds The Lions have been painted the same for 50 years so you got to stay in there Coach Coaches do not like that I thought he might have gotten fouled though too I believe Thomas leads the Whos with 20 Hes made six threes cheering Hall has yet to make a three 0 for six Tillis step back Cant connect This will be SMU ball Every rebound coach feels like it is an absolute war for possession And every shot is tough to come by Theyre just not giving them easy looks As last Thomas looked he was rushed a little bit That rush was rushed a little bit Its Its difficult to get a good shot against this defense And a lot of people want to talk about these two programs Offense SMU leads the ACC 88 points per game Virginia not far behind just under 85 points per game But Im with you Its been a defensive battle The good looks have been hard to come by 100 Theyre pressuring theyre physical Theres nothing easy So these are two tournament teams going punch for punch at a Saturday in January A loaded slate of college basketball across ESPNs networks today Tombs that rattles in and out Did not drop for the freshman Jaden Tombs He struggled a little bit today but we want to get him in these kind of games Great pass from Hall Good look from three Tillis misfired it and another scramble for the rebound Itll stay Virginia basketball with Tombs on the floor Good to see him pop up Everybody is just flying to the glass Clearly a point of emphasis Virginia leads the ACC in rebounds and got nine offensive rebounds in the first half SMU trying to adjust They both teams are going hard to rebound Theyre going to the glass Two physical teams Virginia now up to 13 offensive rebounds Thomas screaming finds Lewis The transfer from Toledo So crafty on the inside off the window and in for two Virginia back in front 5554 Geron Pierre has been the goto guy in this second half in attack mode here Good defensive adjustment Miller Shot clock down to four Boopy Miller has to let it go Fade away Missed it Good defensive possession by Virginia Yeah I mean their big guys can stay with guards which is hard to do He couldnt got he could not get a shot and hes being played by a 610 guy Ta Ritter what an music impact he has made under firstear head coach Ryan ODM This team has found fast chemistry blended an entire new roster and now on the road looking for backto back quad one wins in the ACC trying to keep their winning streak going Would be five in a row and 11 of their last 12 10 minutes left in it Miller gets the ball and draws a foul Came from out behind him Never saw him He just got a piece of it and then got on the floor and got it back Hes been looking to try to sneak in and that postman stands out high He just turns and really good defense He finds ways to impact the game even when hes not scoring Yeah Boopy Miller only nine points today He averages more than 20 0 for two from three Still a long way to go Hes going to be effect Hes going to get in the scoreboard pretty soon Right on Q Missed it though got a really good look Battle for the rebound Itll stay SMU basketball with a fresh shot clock Really just these teams are fighting like its this is the championship game right here Theyre going at it Heavyweights Every play everything is contested Its even hard to get it in bounds Miller has to float it into the 7 foot2 cement Yigu in the post Righty hook missed it He cannot make that pass Just just a little bit outside of his range Virginia upping the tempo Thomas in transition off the mark Miller a lob Pierre thought better of the onehanded slam attempt Takes it out puts it up Cant connect Cant score now Neither can SMU in a scoring drought of three minutes Theyve missed their last five shots cheering Tillis backing in Good bounce pass to the corner but Ditter couldnt handle it and its stolen away and Ditter runs right into Miller Boopy Miller almost waited for him there He did No not almost He waited and laughter really smart play I dont I dont like it necessarily but its a smart play Miller knew what he was doing here Yeah he went right in front of him He moved in front of him Ditter pleading his case Hes not winning that Its a smart play Well SWU needs to end this scoring drought that has now lasted 3 minutes and 31 seconds You know Virginia theyve had an opportunity to separate coach but they havent scored in two minutes Defenses are overpowering the offense right now That happens Two very aggressive defensive teams today Known for their offense but today their defense Whats the best way to shake out of a scoring drought You got to have a point guard make plays And thats what Miller does Only nine points three assists today Hes averaging near 25 the last three games And a tip in goes The freshman Jaden Tombs got just enough on it to fire SMU back in front by one struggled but hes got hes hes going to be a really good player Paul great feed on the inside Bono an easy finish Thats one of the few easy baskets that theyve been able to get today Miller that rolled around didnt drop Offensive rebound Cory Washington up and in cheering in perfect position to clean up the spill And thats penetration from your point guard They come to help And now you got offensive rebound A foul called Pierre thought he got it cleanly and they say he reached in Brings us to a stop in the action 10 lead changes A terrific back andforth game in the ACC guy Now its the perimeter guys that down the stretch are going to probably try to get things done Big guys have not been effective Alab great play out of the timeout Usually ono will finish that Misses the dunk on the alleyoop finish Thats when you sometimes coaching tell you got a great play and misses a dunk You know its just the part of the game Great play out and time out Couldnt draw it up any better Everything but the finish there Heres Boopy Miller Physical Wow Letting him play through it and Virginia steals it away That was a really physical series Oh good feed in Virginia Back in front Devin Tillis Paul does a lot of good things And when he makes shots hes really good Hes just not making shots today But hes got nine assists And that assist the biggest of the bunch Virginia back in front by one Eighth lead change in this second half And the Mustangs trying to sub in Eiglu 7 foot2 sophomore from Istanbul Turkey music Hes their rim protector And on offense theyve been going to him throughout this game Hes just three for 10 in the paint though He just hasnt known to convert Pierre hes had the hot hand in this second half That rolls off the rim No good Mallerie saves it And Virginia can go up the other way HERES MALIK THOMAS AND A FOUL CALLED Pierre got all ball but Ron Gruber saying he hit him with the body before the block That was close Really close play Hes a very good official A little bit of contact and clearly its all ball on the block I just think he got him with enough of the body It was that was close cheering When its that close then its you know its hard to make a difference call Well Thomas has carried the Cavaliers scoring today Did it on the road midweek in their ranked road win at Louisville cheering Hes hit six threes in each of those games including today And now Virginia up by three after Thomas goes two for two from the line Its pretty much been Thomas guarding Miller too Hes been really physical with him Tombs the freshman has a 4in height advantage on Thomas and a foul called music Get the mismatch down low and now you got to be physical Well call that sometime Im not sure how they decide theyre going to call it because its been going on the whole game Miller tried to kick it to the quarter where Pierre was waiting for it Swatted away Nothing coming easy in this second half for SMU Theyre just two of their last 10 Virginia defensively has totally disrupted their rhythm I mean this these are two offensive teams that are playing great defense today and thats why its the game is where it is Theres nothing easy Heres BJ Edwards Shot clock down to seven Gigglu rejected OH NENZO says no Not having a big night down there Two elite rim protecting teams Points are going to be at a premium down the stretch Virginia up by three Looking for more Mallerie missed it Offensive rebound That is Virginias 14th offensive rebound Hall misses it again MALLERIE CLEANS UP THE SPILL in perfect position And Mallerie is 5 foot maybe 10 and he gets offensive rebound He is playing with so much heart The Charlottesville native Take another look at this sequence Valerie he just opportunistic Hes looking where the ball is and fouling up I mean he goes for rebounds and hes a physical tough kid And Virginia 20 second chance points Thats the difference in this game But those two of the 20 for Mallerie the biggest of the bunch so far Cavaliers going fullcourt pressure here Leading by five A little more than five minutes remaining in this one Been a terrific back andforth game SMU needs to get something going offensively They need to get a bucket here Get just change the momentum a little bit Well they lead the ACC in scoring 88 points per game Well below that average They need this three And they get it BJ Edwards delivers Thats a big play It wasnt a great offensive set but he got the look they needed that And Moody Coliseum comes alive with the Mustangs back within two cheering Ditter mismatch going against Miller Hes got nine inches on him trying to take advantage Two seconds ON THE SHOT CLOCK and thats a turnover That was a really good play I dont know how he didnt get that That was a really good pass Perfect The lob was there for Onienzo and just missed timed it The defensive intensity out there is crazy Theyre just going after both teams Heres Miller trailing by two Kick out Edwards missed it this time That would have given SMU the lead UVA ripping it up the court Wasted no time here and itll stay Cavaliers ball Weve got a fun finish coming in Dallas a twopoint lead on the road trying to close it out Cavaliers with the basketball at a twopoint lead STOLEN AWAY Edwards read it BJ Edwards in transition decides to kick it out and Boopy Miller can set up the SMU offense Miller weaving through traffic Pierre hes been quiet in the last few minutes started this second half strong THE SPIN CYCLE COUNTED PLUS THE FOUL Giron Pierre a chance to put SMU back in front And its all perimeter guys right now Really good anticipation on the steel and then he waited didnt get anything And Pierre hes so strong physical Hes so much stronger and bigger than the guards from Virginia That was a big time man play right there Pierre completes the and one He has 12 second half points and SMU back in front cheering And this is the loudest Moody Coliseum has been all day trying to will the home team to the finish line Hanging on to a onepoint lead Little more than three minutes left Thomas into the paint Hes fouled hard and hell get two at the line At the end of games if you go to the basket youre going to get to the foul line Thats a big key He really had no place to go there but theres still going to be some contact and theyre going to call that Its been a career afternoon for Malik Thomas Just his second career double double 22 points 10 rebounds and a chance to fire Virginia back in front down the stretch on the road in Dallas Misses the first Well these two teams have been playing like its a playoff game a tournament game Weve got some NFL playoffs for you tomorrow 245 Eastern time Texans at Patriots Yeah were in football country here in Texas So that should be a good one ABC ESPN and the ESPN app They

You dont want to miss this finish to start your Saturday slate of college hoops Boopy Miller he was the hero Wednesday night on a halfcourt shot to beat Virginia Tech Passing it off Edwards underneath the follow No good And a foul called See Yigu will go to the line to shoot two And a really nice back door play Virginia contested the shot but the big guys right there to put it back He just cant get

Thomas the rebound Hes now got 23 and 11 So many options offensively for Virginia Derritter nails it Tester Ritter buries it and Virginia back up by two Not many big guys can do that Pierre in attack mode going coast to coast and he missed it A lot of content too Lobbed ahead Ditter on the inside Rejected Iu says no Great defensive play Back and forth here And a block called against the freshman Chance Mallerie Goofy Miller ran right into him And they call it against the freshman Break it down Coach blocked charge after the block byu Great block by They get it out This is really close Really close to a charge right there Thats Thats really close Well you famously had a music strong opinion on a controversial block charge at Cameron Indor Yeah I cant I dont remember that What happened there laughter They still talk about it Thats what I did it for Miller makes the front end of a one and one He is a great music free throw shooter just under 90 on the season Hes the guy you wanted to follow But the Ritter stepping out and making that three is you know thats what European players do They step out and shoot that three Baylor misses it So Virginia a narrow onepoint lead as we tick down to two minutes to play Virginia trying to make it five in a row 11 of their last 12 A foul called SMU very aggressive defensively And that time the Mustangs called for a foul And it sends Virginia to the bonus to shoot a one and one here They dont want to call those but some it gets to a point and you have to call it music Well the Cavaliers have not had many foul shots in this game Theyve just taken six today and theyve made five of them As physical a game as it is thats not many free throws And its the freshman Chance Mallerie Hell have to make the first to earn the second They

Thats an innouter You have to imagine everything going to run through Boopy Miller Two in white down the stretch One of the most clutch players in all of college basketball Heres Miller TURN AROUND GOT IT He goes for it You knew he was going to do it He got fouled on the way in They didnt call it He didnt It didnt matter He went and finished it cheering Tied at 68 A minute 20 to go Really good end of game player Hes going to have the ball You see what Virginia cheering tries here They got They dont necessarily go one man one guy Theyre looking for people Ditter not shy of the big moment cheering Draws the foul and hell go to the line to try and fire Virginia back in front Heres heres Boopy at the other end This is a tough play Really tough But thats his play Thats what he does So here Ditter just goes to the basket He just puts his head down and theyre going to make a call usually in that situation cheering Ter makes the first Hes a good shooter European play Hes been playing professional baseball in Europe for years since he was probably 17 So theyre used to these situations Two big clutch free throws They make free throws Those guys are making free throws So Virginia clinging to a twopoint lead on the road One minute left in regulation Everything working through Miller Heres Boopy hunting a shot Hall defends him well Miller weaving in Rejected Cant defend any better than that That was great defense Hall I mean not many could have gotten back and gotten that one right Miller can usually get his shot You have 8 seconds here off the inbound into Pierre Pull up Pierre missed it This will be Virginia basketball leading by two Just under 40 seconds remaining Both teams have two timeouts Well you can play this down and then you get to four five 46 seconds Its But I mean its tough Get to nine Yeah youd get to 9 seconds Would you foul here or would you play it out if youre SMU Try to steal it here full You try to make a defensive play but you have nine seconds So you let him let him shoot and push it down and try to get a bucket to tie it Well if you get the stop you need to get the rebound Virginia 15 offensive rebounds today could be a factor 10 seconds to shoot now Five on the timer Hall hasnt made one today and but Virginia gets the offensive rebound and a foul called Itll send Tester Ritter to the line to shoot one and one A chance to make it a music twopossession game with 10 seconds remaining This is the wrong guy to send to the foul line for SMU He just made his last two music Hes a perfect four for four today And again that offensive screaming rebound comes because the big guy switches late So now the big guys out here and the 510 guards down in the low post against 610 cheering Europeans do not miss free Youve said that a couple of times and right now Ditter is proving you right A perfect five for five and we have to step away for 30 seconds before Ditter tries to make this a fourpoint game Well be right back music What a great game this has been in the ACC between Virginia and SMU for the home team Mustangs Very familiar position to it Wednesday night They were down four with 8 seconds to go and then this happened Boopy Miller music off a missed free throw A half court heave at the buzzer to win it here at Moody Coliseum Well if he makes this free throw the threepoint shot is not going to be enough So and the winner is probably going to make this free throw This guys he does not miss in these situations Im surprised you didnt recruit more Europeans if you if they dont miss free throws I got two Europeans that couldnt shoot I mean laughter I had I had two I had Mckled I was a great European player but he couldnt shoot I said Marc youre the only European guy Ive ever seen that cant shoot Well Tester Ritter certainly can from Belgium Hes been terrific all season long and trying to make it a twop possession game One free throw coming SMU still with one timeout Virginia has two Lets see if the timeout is taken away I dont think it will Hes mechanically cheering just too solid screaming Got it Too cheering solid SMU has to hurry Under 10 seconds for Boopy Miller Trailing by four Miller
