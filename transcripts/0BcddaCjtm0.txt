Sweet and slick white and orange jerseys Mark Schneer Justin Porterfield Claire Aubrey have the whistles tonight And off we go from JPJ in game number two of the 2526 season Cavaliers working quickly here as Sam Lewis attacks the rack and earns a couple of freebies Cavaliers working quickly is something that you can say a lot this season on both ends of the floor They are going to attack and be aggressive offensively and defensively throwing it ahead will be something that youll see a lot and you see Lewis going to the rack All right Mac Im already thinking like a coach Okay Virginia the other night to start the season 19 of 34 from the line Yes they blew out the Bronx and they blew him out pretty handily by 34 points but Ryan ODM wants to see better free throw shooting immediately Small sample size theyll be just fine Cavaliers with fullcourt press as they will do offm makes NC Central trying to get going here One change to the starting lineup tonight for coach Motton He brings on Jonathan Dunn a transfer from Copen State Last year he had 11 points against this Cavaliers team Yeah Dunn is a really good athlete This is a a kind of a dynamic defensive team in terms of athleticism but theyre putting all those pieces together NC Central now will counter with its own fullcourt press And Don Hall running the show once again for the Whos If he has five assists and one turnover every single night Ryan ODMs going to be one happy man Yeah he took care of the basketball The the Whos took care of the basketball Six turnovers in an uptempo game where you score a bunch of points Thats outstanding Uptempo And also Mac this is a team that is still in the jelling process A lot of new guys and a lot of different lineups Yeah learning the offense learning each other Makes it all the more impressive that they took care of the ball that well Heres Malik Thomas Only one for 10 the other night Cant get that one to go But the PG flying in Its Hall the transfer from BYU Another offensive rebound Something they did very well on Monday night 22 offensive rebounds The most in 10 years for this program believe it or not Timer at five here Hall skip past Thomas Elevates Heres another O Thomas who averaged about 20 points per game at San Francisco last season A prized recruit out of the portal Heres Tester Three ball Yes sir and the fullourt pressure immediately after Derritter We we saw him post up in the uh top of the show He can also step out and shoot that three He played with the Baal basket last year and he shot 39 from three as a role player trying to take a bigger role here with the Whos nice scoop shot there Deontay Johnson one of the few returners that NC Central has Yeah and following up on Ditter he he was more of a role player for his team in Europe Hes got to be the goto guy for Ryan ODM here at Virginia Lewis carving into the lane Barely brushes off the rim Virginia resets Thomas tripped up and fouled Ed Ritter has a diverse skill set Really good passer But he can pop out You better close out in a hurry because he can shoot it from deep 69 about 240 freshman from Belgium but hes 22 years old Yes they nickname him the tank And here is Tank Hell back a man down from here now Post ISO and a kick out Theres the passing skill Lewis three ball 44 from three a year ago at Toledo Second team all Mack He was fourth in the conference in scoring at just over 16 per game and 11 on opening night here with the Whos You talked about the intentionality of of Ryan ODM and his staff in the recruiting process to get shooters Runner off the glass doesnt go for Gage Latimore who had 20 points in the opener against NC State Now Ditter pushing the pace Thomas three ball Better job that time by North Carolina Central allowing one shot Johnson accelerates hangs and cant finish Inside cheering Cavs get it to go Thomas is on the board And I like to see Thomas do that He missed some shots the other night Went one for 10 You mentioned only seven points and he probably is going to be one of the leading scorers on this team But if you miss a shot take it to the rack Make something happen And he is a pure scorer He has tallied 20 or more points 23 times in his career Yeah Not just a onedimensional shooter at all And there he goes flying up for the board Averaged four rebounds per game last season Lewis Trey Johan Bruno in disbelief thinking that it went off NC Central but not the case Heres the post ISO Brings people in Quick ball reversal Youre going to get somebody wide open when three people were having to guard Dritter Man it seemed like the other night watching that game against Ryder The Bronx were okay with those 1v one post ISOs but maybe NC Central is not going to adopt that philosophy tonight I would think they would they would double team make make somebody give up the ball And uh we also may see a little zone from them They played a lot of zone against NC State on Monday night Of course it didnt work either No they gave up 114 points This is what Lavel modem is known for Manto man very aggressive on defense Pressure when you can Meanwhile the Cavaliers have made a few changes here Jakari White is in in addition to Ugana Anzo and the freshman Chance Mallerie also in Heres Jay Slack to inbound for NC Central coming over from division 2 West Virginia State where he averaged 18 per game Yeah had 40 in a game Johnson rejected inside by Ano who had four blocks in the opener Now Mallerie the freshman from Charlottesville Its a white three The quick shot in transition Its going to be a staple here Jakari White now has 199 career threes dating back to his time at North Dakota State Had 11 Monday night cheering That three air mailed board No conversion there for Dunn Numbers feed it inside Ditter scans Double arrives back out to Thomas White Dont leave him open OH HE BAKES IT IN HOWD HE DO IT OH hes only two for seven for three the other night Off to a better start here this evening Jakari was seventh in the summit with 17 points per game last season with the Bison Keep an eye on Cory Carvey by the way coach Yeah great offensive rebounder He had a successful game against NC State 19 points on the offensive end Eight rebounds for them offensive very early on in that game Oh Latimore gets fouled here by White 3T or more from beyond the arc but the Cavaliers are cooking back music and thats fine UVA will shoot some threes Yeah and theyll shoot them quickly in transition inside out music and a lot of folks can shoot it Don Hall the mid30s Jakari White 40 Malik Thomas 40 Devin Tillis 40 Sam Lewis 44 and that doesnt count Groom Low and Ditter who are outstanding from long range I know you like numbers so Ill give you some more here The Cavaliers transfers they combined to make 622 career threes coming into this season And that also includes Ugana Anzo who had zero in his career So its really five guys So there was intentionality Thats the word we keep using about all of these guys They can shoot at all positions Yeah I I think sometimes intentionality is overused Not in this case That free throw by the way ends an 11 nothing UVA run Its Gage Latimore at the line Hes a transfer from Division 2 Seatan Hill in Pennsylvania Spent one year with the Griffins Yeah really a good player Outstanding shooter Long lefthander It is a threeshot foul Jakari White committed outside the ark cheering NC Central on opening night 19 for 28 at the free throw line 68 They didnt play the whole season but averaged double figures and 42 from three Speaking of good marksman well pay attention Derritter out here with mostly second unit guys Thomas also out there See that wide open lane Thats one of the benefits The Ritter going to work the whistle So what does the open lane do It does a lot of things First of all it gives you great driving lanes to drive get to the rim get fouled or kick it out for a threepoint shot It also gives you a chance to iso Whoever has got the best matchup you can go down in there after setting a screen or back cutting Uh and of course running rebounders This athletic team can can really run and get rebounds You dont have to be the biggest team in order to go get some offensive boards Were looking way ahead in our mens basketball double header for next Friday night Cameron Boozer and sixth ranked Duke host the Sycamores of Indiana State at 7 Eastern and Caleb Wilson and number 25 North Carolina host NC Central at the Dean Smith Center Both games are also available on the allnew ESPN app All right so the Eagles taking on

is Open shooter Hall You bet Thank you Jakari White Drive it to the rim Shrink the defense Kick it out a career 36 threepoint shooter And Mack the Cavaliers are five for their first nine from beyond the arc Yeah after going eight for 30 the other night Heres Ryan Archie in the game Red shirt sophomore Cavaliier ball Archie a talented point guard Yeah Get to the paint See what the defense does cant get back there in time And Hall again another good shooter the transfer from BYU But thats so awesome to see if youre a Cavalier fan You just saw Jakari White hit a couple of threes Now hes the one initiating offense Oh yeah Yeah If you play for ODM youre going to be unselfish I can promise you that White drives attracts a lot of eyeballs and finds Hall on squeezes the board Whistle and one I really like this guy cheering I went back and watched some of his interviews when he first got over here at Kentucky before he went to Kansas State before he came to Charlottesville This is a really smart young man who who has some serious goals of playing basketball for a long time and he has improved so much Mac you said to me before the game heres a guy whos a backup right now in college who you could see playing in the NBA one day I dont think its any question He Hes long Hes athletic Hes hes bouncy at 7 feet tall and hes really worked on his skills Hes getting better and better all the time and and a tremendous rim protector How about the wingspan too 75 Ridiculous That balls out That ball is out So we dont have a signal yet as to who the ball is going to All right its going to the Cavaliers NC Central committed 18 turnovers on opening night at Lenovo Center as NC State had its first sellout on an opening night since 1999 On Yenzo got a piece of that discards the shot Dun floats faking Carvey goes up leaves it short Carvey gets another miss Pushes off on Gruo and all that congestion down low Finally gets a whistle Central kept on attacking Looked like it was going to be another block shot Of course that whole series started with Aneno with the block down low So now Carvey at the line 55 and a half last season at Morehead State And here is our week 11 ACC Network

Scott Stadium Yeah Virginia has a really clear path to to some rare air Did you see that They moved the Marshall tip off next Saturday from 12 to 2 to accommodate a road game Thats how excited people are to watch this Virginia football team They should be cheering Steel here and Malleries tripped up and fouled Good steal that time Force the action Head up Mallerie will uh I dont think Ill be going out on a limb to say hes going to be a fan favorite Well he does have the home crowd behind him because you know hes hes from this area but part of it now Hes an exciting young player Can really shoot the basketball Had a good night the other night 11 versus Ryder Two for three from long range Central with a little zone now on finishes Post to post sevenfooter to sevenfooter right Yes These guys are so versatile They can pass they can score they can block shots cheering As you like to say Mac they check a lot of boxes Yes they do A lot of diversity on this team Vladimore 0 for three to begin Carby taking a J Cant hit Played so well 19 and 8 Monday night in Raleigh A short road trip about 10 miles to the arena Ball directing traffic here Bruno feeds White scampers into the lane Flips it up Uhuh On Yenzo No Patting his steps We talked about it Hes just so good Uh Anenzo filling the lane for UVA Cavans excited Everything music working from the jump tonight for the Whos Jakari White and company up by 21 what the offense can do But it doesnt mean that Ryan ODM doesnt have defensive principles VCU making the NCA tournament last year if coach ODM was over there They were ninth in the country in scoring D last year Yeah it it it is going to look different but but I assure you the goal was the same They want to limit good shots by the opponent and allow one shot And while they do things differently picking up full court getting in the passing lanes it is still going to be good defense or you dont play for Ryan And the scores might be higher just because the tempo is higher here but in terms of defensive efficiency they want to be around the same totals that Tony Bennett was coaching Yeah Field goal percentage defense limiting uh limiting you know attempts to the free throw line Latimore from deep Yeah we mentioned that he can really shoot the basketball Back NC Central started the game 1 for13 Yeah Latimore needs more shots Had 20 against NC State on Monday This is that zone that they played a lot against NC State They trap some out of it Did some different things Its given Virginia a different look Elijah Gertude is in Shes got the ball at the top Hall blow by the defender Banks shot doesnt go and Gruno just smacks it in Size matters So this the uh the zone there from NC Central is that them just saying Okay we dont have the size of UVA We we got to pack it in Or is it something different No Basketball is a game of matchups and and they have a disadvantage at a lot of different matchups Ta Ritter checking in now for UVA and it was a gorgeous opener in college for him the other night 21 points and 10 rebounds and just 14 shots Yeah and and and after a a less than stellar performance in the exhibition against Villanovavva uh I am sure it was good for him and the coaches and the fans to see what he is capable of Thats the deritter that well see the rest of the year Yeah some project him as a top five player in this conference So he is going to do some special things here with UVA Oh yeah He is going to add to the list of of Cavaliers in the NBA at some point Yeah I think some fans were panicking And he had only eight points against Villanova Oh my goodness Hes not as good as we thought No trust us No he is He absolutely is I promise All right heres that zone once again from the Eagles See if they can improve defensively Ditter makes himself available Free throws Good look by Hall And against any zone you want to get that ball into the lane especially into the free throw area And nice pass by Hall to find the Ritter inside that zone We had a nice chat before the game with associate head coach Griff Aldrich and he said You know the thing about Tess is hes a wonderful player but he was a role player overseas Now hes coming over to UVA Were going to throw him the ball a lot and we want him to be assertive Yeah And and and its a little bit different because so many of these guys that they brought in were the man on their team So its taken a little bit of adjustment by everyone And uh yeah Im going to tell you weve talked about this Were not going to see great consistent basketball in November and December by anybody Not not talking about UBA or North Carolina Central or Ryder anybody Its going to take a while to get these rosters assimilated Oh Gruo just spanking the shots And Gertude fumbles the pass from Ditter Yeah Ditter fumbled the pass to start with laughter UVA now with three turnovers And by the way youre saying that everyones not going to be playing great basketball just because of the newness of all these rosters Yeah And so many people to to try to get on the same page and uh and and its almost every roster Its not just the University of Virginia or or Duke A lot of people are putting a lot of new players on the floor How about what Gruo can do on the defensive end Matt Yeah weve seen him on the offensive glass but on the defensive end while not really strong hes so long and active What a rim protector And youve got the benefit of having two of those guys in there for UVA He along with Anenzo And it helps when Gruno is 12 in taller than the opposing guard Deontay Johnson Cavaliers find an open shooter once again Thomas Nylon Yep And again we didnt see the the real Thomas on Monday night but uh this is a guy who is going to be a consistent scorer and we see him make the three there but he is a guy that got to the free throw line a whole bunch with San Francisco last year Yeah he he is a threelevel threat Ki Okrog is in 21 started the other night Senior from the Bronx coach Hes brought his teams to four NCAA tournaments but hes also one of the really good men in this sport In October he was inducted into the Order of Long Leaf Pine Society which is one of North Carolinas highest civilian honors And I think youd speak to many of his players in years past They really appreciate the time that they get with him He really is a like a great player great coach but way more than that Hes at a park named after him And look he he understands where NC Central is in terms of the mix across the country but he wants to coach guys who are eager to improve and eager to win as that one banked in by Carvey He said Look these guys are coming in from mostly programs that have suffered losing seasons but if you have the desire to win I can work with that Exactly He pointed out a lot of great examples in the NBA and college Heres Carvey They want him to act like Joel Embiid Not kidding you Thats what he said before the game Wide open three Yes Vladimore Nice And and just like Virginia on the other end if you got the post up going have to help a little bit Kick it back out to your best shooter Latimore And coach Motton said about Cory just doesnt really understand how good he is I want him to have the ball in his hands and think about his own shot That time he draws the defenders and kicks it out for a three Zona slowed Virginia down a little bit in the half court Thomas tries Its a contested jumper Not necessarily keeping him from scoring but making them take more time off the clock Tequo Carpenter is now in for NC Central Five in the maroon coming over from Austin P Averaged four a game last year Carvey stifled inside by Gruno in that seven foot length And we showed it earlier with the shot block and he he affects a whole lot more than he even blocks Grulo smallest man on the floor Deontay Johnson rebound Yeah the real leader of this team and one of the few returnees He was second in the MAK last season with nearly four assists per game only behind his former teammate Isaac Parson Preseason MAK played at Maryland Eastern Shore before so he has uh seen a lot of that league Theres a few guys for NC Central who have transferred in from fellow MAK programs Yeah Maryland shore Coppen State Little two from each of those So theyll be familiar with that league when it gets in January and February MAK opener for NC Central against Norfick State on January 3rd Spartans the reigning champs Timer at seven here Its a three Thats way too strong from Johnson Its an offensive rebound All right heres Carvey Hes going to work against on Yenso but Ugana has the answer Yeah he sure does Hes the answer to a lot of things to be honest Yes he is Hes got a few blocks already Good on the offensive boards too Sam Lewis Carby on a trampoliner Check that Whites three ball No Mallerie board to Ritter Scoops it around That doesnt go Batted out Lewis White hops in the air Virginia possession Oh White quick trigger What a possession Lots of chances for Virginia Couldnt convert any of them and Central gets it going the other way Im sure one of the things Coach Motton would love to see tonight I think he knows that his team is going to submit some offensive rebounds but how do you respond after that Yeah and and that goes for a little bit of everything Uh you know Virginia size is going to bother them like it has already on both ends of the floor But but how they react is going to be what what coach Motton is most interested in How they react tonight and uh and how they react getting ready for the next game And he thinks they made really good progress from Monday night And I would agree with that Yeah They said couple of really good practices the last couple of days and it doesnt show itself necessarily on the scoreboard but theyre executing a little bit better offensively but just outmatched down low some Theyve also done better defending the perimeter Cavaliers are now seven for 18 from three NC State on opening night against them tied the school record 19 threes on 40 tries Johnson jumper Yes really nice execution Took a lot of time off the clock occupied the ball and got a good shot Johnson now two for seven with four points Under four to go now in the first half Cavaliers shooting 43 as a team Get that ball in the zone There you go Its not hitting the floor right now Mac The ball still hasnt hit the floor And I know they dont score there but thats thats got to be an encouraging sign for coach Oh it is a good possession despite the final result inside and a jam Okrow rog Ryan meets Tom The NC State game on Monday Cory Carvey played well Monday He was playing well again tonight from long range assisting on the three and a 100 run for North Carolina Central here to cut the lead to 16 Yeah Okro Rogro with that last slam And if you compare it to the other night against NC State at halftime Central was down by 28 points down 16 right now It is still a basketball game and I think Coach Motton has to like that Yeah And both coaches are doing the same thing here Theyre trying to find out who can play when the lights are on who can play together and who can play consistently well Both coaches with the same goal even though that this the game is not necessarily competitive from a score point standoint What can the Cavaliers do here coach to solve the zone Got to get the ball to the high post either on the dribble or the pass All right they get it there Look to Ritter is Stonewalled Nice job that time again Coach Motton wanting to speak with Justin Porterfield for just a second on the baseline Just under three to go now in the first half Coming up at halftime were going to preview the next episode of Proving Grounds preseason with Virginia mens basketball Excited to get a look at that Also some first half highlights here from John music Paul Jones Arena Virginia and NC Central The third ever meeting between these two programs Obviously the faces have changed so much but they did play a couple of years ago Virginia won by a 30 steel here Central very active on the defensive end I think this little run has given them a little bit of energy They had their hands on a lot of balls in that possession And the other thing Mac crowd nonfactor right now It has gotten quiet here in JPJ Carpenter bounces to Carvey again They initiate offense from seven stays here Tomorrow morning at 10 am Eastern the ACC Huddle Crew will be right here in Charlottesville to get you ready for another full day of football with a 2hour pregame show Theyll have game previews along with music expert analysis and featured stories right here on ACC Network in the allnew ESPN app Oh that place is music going to be jumping tomorrow Looks good right there doesnt it Number 14 in the country Who to believe All right one and one here for Oakro Rogro He nails the first college football playoff standings and uh highest ranking ACC team Virginia was at at 14 cheering Okrog misses the second extra possession here for the Eagles Brian Odum applectic thinking that it was a double dribble Yeah I think he was more apoplelectic about giving it up though Carvey a long two cheering Ugana Anzo seven points seven rebounds in the first half No high post touch just yet Got to get it in there Hall now penetrates fumbles the ball regains and finds Thomas Good defense inside from Carvey Didnt matter Nice job playing through the contact Incidental in there Good no call but a good finish by Thomas Yeah that is exactly why Malik led the WCC in free throws made and attempted last year because he is not shy going to the tin Buck 20 to go in the first half Johnson now uses the ball screen from Carvey Cory gets a step on Ugana and Ditter tight roping the baseline Secures possession fires it away Heres Thomas A tre applause Good three ball The foul away from the ball on North Carolina Central You see the threepoint shot You see the block out over there and a little extra taking ono to the floor Now hes going to the free throw lap Yeah I think thats smart Uh dont let the sevenfooter who has great jumping abilities get towards the offensive glass Like you mentioned already 77 rebounds coming off the bench He was 10 for13 at the line last season at K State Rattles that one in And he does get one more here off the one and one Senior from Nigeria Soccer was his first love He didnt start playing basketball Macken until he was 12 years old Well Virginia fans are going to love that he switched to basketball Yeah Id say so Ugo misses the second Its a rebound for Carpenter and NC Central Johan Gruno waiting to check in at the next whistle Central taking a little more time off the clock Oh Ryan ODM you heard him earlier say after the last game he wants his team to get into later clock situations defensively Johnson beats the Cavaliier D Were being told that this is a delay of game call on Tester Ritter of UVA And you see the confusion for the Cavaliers because theyre the team that would throw the ball in there Yeah Im not sure what he did but Mark Sner seemed pretty emphatic about it Okay Matt you want to explain that for us Yeah And Derritter held the ball and essentially letting the game clock run down to where the shot clock would be equal to it and they could hold it for one possession Maybe something that Tess is learning from the international waters to here in the US I dont know that he was thinking like that but uh but that was the result of it And good to see the official Markner then have a conversation quickly with Tess to explain it I thought that was nice game and shot clock separated by four Mallerie double clutch fighting for the board Carpenters got it Lasers it ahead 5 seconds to go In and out dribble Johnson to the rack Layup doesnt go Carvey sticks it back in as the horn sounds Cory Carvey Five points for Garvey five rebounds three assists Nice team to 66 Was a good play by Der He switched and knocked that ball loose It was going to be a layup otherwise And we start the second half just like we started the game with a block shot by Grunlow the drive Come across Catch it You must have stepped out of bounds Three blocks now for Johan Me and Aneno They are quite the rim and they played together some in the first half Yeah Vladimore on the pull back Got it Nice play Created a little space Step back base and jumper for the lefty Gage is now in double figures Shes got 11 15point deficit Heres that zone again from NC Central Mac they had a little luck Grew low They had a little success Hows that No Im with you I got you Thomas turbos and feeds Gruo and hes held up Yeah And if you cant get it to the high post the next thing is penetrate a gap cause two people to guard you someone will be open and he found Grunlo open in the middle of the lane You know Matt Ryan ODM has talked about it throughout the off season bleeding now into the regular season The way he recruited he found a lot of guys who scored the ball but also guys who are unselfish Theyll pass it Oh yeah And again you talked about the fact that youre not going to play for Ryan unless you play defense You also must share the basketball and the ball goes to the high post and good things happen against the zone Points 10 and 11 now for Derer Cavalier fullcourt press following a make Yeah Trying to get the opponent to start their offense deeper into the shot clock They have not initiated their offense yet and theyre down to 15 seconds before the offense is initiated Now Virginia doesnt have to play defense as long and they dont get as tired Tear the opponent down Now its at five Three goes up from Johnson and he misfires badly Stretch pass here Thomas zipping into the lane Thomas taking contact to Ritter cant stamp it in Another whistle though and a foul Long shots equal long rebounds Long misses equal long rebounds And that initiates a fast break Malik Thomas took it to the rim Didnt get it but created a situation where Derritter could follow up with the second chance See the long rebound Attack the rim Bigs run the floor and go to the free throw line Neither teams been to the free throw line very much Cavs now seven out of 10 from the game 70 looks a lot different than it did the other night when the Whos were 19 of 34 56 Yeah this is too good a shooting team to do that Too good Yeah they even struggled shooting free throws in their exhibition against Vanderbilt lead up to 19 Kyrick Davis didnt really mention his name all too often in the first half Scoreless picked up 35 minutes Still well outside the top of the key and were down to 10 on the shot clock Three ball goes up from Okro Thomas climbs the ladder for the board Malik feeds to Ritter fakes Tess stepping in and scoring with the left hand Shot fake Drive it You got to guard him on the perimeter cuz hes such a good threepoint shooter You know Mac if you translate his name into English means the Knights Hes fearless going to the cup Thats outstanding Yeah Good stuff Yeah You know once in a while I pull something out of the bag All right here we go once again NC Centrals got nothing going here until 8 seconds on the shot clock And here they go Its a moving screen in transition The trailer shot fake Now the ses part And if youre only righthanded you cant make that play But Ditter can use both hands effectively around the rim led the Cavaliers in scoring the other night with 21 against Ryder and once again leading that charge here against NC Central Thomas wide open Had a really good look We had a good look behind him Just a little off Davis recovers free throws Yeah Cant bail him out right there Going to take a tough contested shot Not a good foul by the Cavs that time Hey Beck we were watching the game on Monday night Virginia and Ryder And again if youre thinking like a coach youre saying Okay we won the game by a large margin What are we thinking about here Couple of fouls that you could characterize as overzealous from UVA in the opener Yeah And cheering and easier to to reel somebody back in than to speed them up though I like the aggression The ACC fall championships continue Sunday with the mens soccer quarterfinals starting at 2 Eastern hosted by the higher seed Each match is right here on ACC Network and the allnew ESPN app Virginia playing at 400 pm George Gnovach in year 30 has done a remarkable job with that program Nick Simmons the freshmans been fantastic If you have not watched him play please do so Just over three minutes gone by here in half number two Paul getting marauded here by Johnson And a lot of contact near the free throw line Foul on NC Central Latimore Yeah that that kind of physicality by Johnson Deontay Johnson the returning point guard for Central That thats kind of uh typical of Lavel Mods team Very aggressive on the defensive end M correction The foul goes on Davis Thats his fourth Rough night Davis the transfer from West Georgia Averaged 10 a game there last year Yeah theyve made the transition from junior college to division two to division one rapidly Grulo flush Penetration against his own is the other possibility That was nice Create some help Dish it to the open man 13 assists on 17 made baskets from UVA tonight Good job by Hall right there making Latimore give the ball up Halls got another five assists tonight Same total against Ryder Grulo running the floor here Its Ditter getting it back and slamming it in Yeah Ditter got the finish but Thomas made the play He could have thrown it ahead He waited on Ditter to come down the middle They had the numbers Watch the decision making He could throw it ahead He waits on Ditter Wide open at the rim You know so some pundits thought that Tesder would be a second round pick if he had gone to the NBA draft this past summer Max So being here at UVA what exactly is he going to accomplish Well first of all hes much more approximate to the NBA teams they can see him on a regular basis but more than that he he can adjust to the American game more than the international game This helps him get ready for the NBA The NBA and college are not identical but they are more similar than the international game and the NBA And hes been very clear about what his goals are Meanwhile another international player Johan Grunlo is down cheering So we will keep an eye here on Johan as we go to break here Virginia up 5229 over NC Central I think theyre going to review as well So its on Carvey Prior play is under review for what Thanks Thats two mistakes from him No Im just kidding Okie dokie Oh so its Johnson Johnson got him Not not Carvey Yeah They got to change that regardless I would think Yeah they will What do you think they upgraded or No I dont think so I think its unintentional Yeah Call foul on both of them but I dont think you can call both of them No I dont think this rises to an F1 No thats in thats just incidental Hes not trying to hit you in the face Course I might be 0 for one after this too Yeah the second one is more of a problem than the first one I think You can make the argument that theyre both basketball plays but one of the fans ended up with the ball So I got some terminology ready to go Causing excessive music or unnecessary contact with an opponent So Johnson comes in first Ben Carvey Okay All right I Okay Mark Schneer Justin Porterfield music Claire Aubrey deliberating here trying to decide if an F1 should be given out to Cory Carvey of NC Central maybe even Deontay Johnson Both players were involved in a bit of a collision underneath with Johan Grunlo After you the foul on seven stays and the play stands All right So a common foul has been given out here to Cory Carvey And well take another look Mac Yeah Johnson with the foul with with the contact but they didnt call that But Carvey over the top swiping at the ball Just a common foul basketball play Move on All right we will Zone defense here from NC Central out of the timeout Jakari White jacks it up and in cheering Nice play by Hall Dribble penetration Just one dribble up in the gap Shrinks the zone and he kicks it out to Jakari White who came came off the bench and did well in the first half Deontay Johnson running point here The leading returner in points assists and rebounds Vladimore pal inside Not like Johnson had a lot of competition in those categories One of just five returners only three who played last year Yeah Johnson is still the the leader of this team But like coach Motton said you used to have you know 6 7 8 9 10 returnees and they could actually coach help coach the newcomers Now when youve only got a handful of people who you know one in particular who played at all that makes it a little more difficult cheering Cage Latimer at the line 11 points tonight three for three make it four for four Were looking way ahead at our mens basketball double header for next Friday night Cameron Boozer and sixth rank Duke host Indiana State at 7 Eastern Then Caleb Wilson and number 25 UNC hosting these NC Central Eagles at the Dean Smith Center Both games also available on the allnew ESPN app I think if you had told many Eagles fans before the season started that division 2 transfer Gage Latimore a sophomore would lead the team in scoring in both the first two games I dont think they had that on their bingo card This guys pretty good Yeah Satan Hill I I had to look up Satan Hill to be honest but uh lefthanded shooter uh 80 free throw shooter 42 threepoint shooter Those are good numbers A native of Greensboro so hes basically coming home on gathers it in through a crowd Chance Mallerie in the freshman Physical cheering defense on the outside Mallerie beats it Short pass to Ritter and the rebound inside Justin Edwards in the game Played just three minutes against NC State Latimore Another three Yeah opportunity fast break right there Nice throw ahead to Latimore He pulled it up Hes still trying to probe this zone Had a little better luck here in the second half Heres White Scanning drawing two Long pass over to Mallalerie and now Thomas beaming down to the block Thomas halts and kicks Mallerie tries and makes the local product delivering That was a big get in the recruiting process by Ryan Odum Committed decommitted recommitted Yeah he said after the game on Monday against Ryder it really was a full circle moment Heres a guy who was watching games here at John Paul Jones Arena up in the top level A lot like Kamora Johnson for the Lady Cavs Yes Brilliant player for Coach Moxs team Oh Kamuras here Whats up Mo What an exciting player she is Well get to call some of her games later That be fun Cannot wait One of the best returning players in the ACC If you think about UVA womens basketball thats who you think of UVA women will be back in action on Sunday 200 Eastern time against Bucknell right here on ACC Network Extra Edwards three Jakari White the rebound This guy is a real Swiss Army knife He really does You You made a good comparison You compared him to Derek White in the NBA And no relation I just think they play a similar game They do Theyre both outstanding athletes both very aggressive and both effective on or off the ball Onenso three Hes never made one in college Loose ball foul And this will stay right here Will we see that streak stop tonight Ono He made one in our exhibition game UVA and Villanova but we were privileged to have the call up That was so much fun by the way Im glad we got to do that Oh yeah And they looks like um Villan Novas gotten some of those guys back Oh yeah Ascu and Bryce Lindsay Yeah What were they picked Seth in the preseason pull in the Big East Yeah If if theyre seventh in the Big East the Big East is going to have a big year I can tell you that His Virginia program by the way picked fifth in the ACC behind Duke Louisville UNCC and NC State And that you know pick fifth with this many newcomers is a is a real credit to the recruiting class that that uh the coachs staff has assembled All right So mentioning that preseason poll in the ACC once again you got Duke at number six in the country Louisville getting the remaining 15 first place votes Pat Kelsey Mack has just done a tremendous job there Hes quick order Yeah he he really has And a whole lot of people had big recruiting classes I I I think the number of teams in the NCAA tournament could double from four to eight Really I really believe that Okay One of the main storylines for the ACC throughout the off season just the amount of international players coming into the conference I have it down is 45 international players within the ACC alone Yeah that thats really incredible And of course a lot of that has to do with the with the NIL situation and thats been a big plus for colleges trying to get international talent over here Mallerie connects on the first here Chance scoring nearly 2400 career points at St Ans Bellfield right down the road here in Charlottesville You really can do a little bit of everything a great handler you know and and hes physically ready to play at this level which you know that that didnt used to be the case coming out of high school And you know what I also think too I think the Cavaliers have the the great situation here of having a veteran like Don Hall who comes in with experience made the NCA tournament made a run in the NCA tournament last year with BYU Hes not a flashy player right But a lot that Chance can learn from him Thats a really good point He gets the play but kind of in the shadows a little bit Vladimore to the cup Cant get it Sticks it back up Uhuh Okro looking to snare it Doesnt get it Here is White bustling ahead White taking contact and feeding Its a three for Elijah Gertrude applause The Swiss Army knight coming out of the pack going to the other end And I know its cliche but he just does so many things for this team Well step aside here Virginia up music very comfortably over NC Central here with 12 to go music is a leader Hes a winner and hes a versatile player An undersized post who can take advantage of his athleticism but a big wing also that gives him another rebounder in there Average 14 and eight 40 from three and 82 from the free throw line Theyre counting on this guy being a big part of what happens this season And Mack he is a really talented player and theres no questioning that But the way that Ryan ODM wants to play he really wants guys to have maybe three to four to 5 minute shifts So to have one more guy in the rotation obviously helps that cost Yeah And a guy who can play extended minutes at multiple positions Thats really valuable What you say to me before the game Hes a uh hes a big wing but an undersized post That was the terminology Thats it Thats it And both create mismatches And Elijah Girtu just glides up the court He had a big time performance against these Eagles couple of years ago 13 points on six for 11 Yeah I think we did that game Yeah we did You look the same by the way Havent changed Gertrude to the rim Neither is Gertrude explosion right there after missing last season And its impressive because he suffered a scooter injury a couple of springs ago ACL injury second time in his life but he is still pretty bouncy and still pretty speedy Yeah Wasnt expected to play as a freshman Got kind of pressed into duty and did very well his freshman year Man he did not debut that year until late November Grunwall thats what Im calling him Grunwald cheering You cool with that No No He is groomed low Come across Never left the floor Still got the block shot and fired up afterwards as well He plays with a lot of passion after getting hit in the face He was glad to get back in there Wants to deliver some punishment of his own Skip pass Ditter Nice play all again A little penetration and the skip pass That is seven assists tonight for Don Hall You knew that shot was going in just based on the play And again just one turnover So in these first two games he has 12 assists and just two turnovers A six to1 ratio Come on Yeah thats that experience talking Carpenter seeing two Shot clocks at five and NC Central hasnt penetrated inside the arc until now Swirls off the cup that time from Latimore Extra possession here for the Eagles Carvey Oh my goodness Grunlo is an eraser Now Hall in transition stops Mallerie getting it back here Hall The two PGs link it up cheering Tequo Carpenter challenging Hall Cant score Tipped up No From Oakro Rogro Its been a rough night offensively for NC Central Eagles havent scored now in over 5 minutes and theyve made just 24 of their shots Yeah the two hand block right there on Carvey and the presence of mind to catch it and initiate the fast bait by Grunlow You dont get anything easy at the rim against these Cavs Seven blocks Its ridiculous And you know that that doesnt include that stat doesnt include the number of shots that they theyve influenced that they maybe didnt get a hand on Gertude get a trip to the free throw line Virginia now 10 for 14 at the line tonight Pull up Trey Latimore using the quick offense mentality Mistake by Gertrude right there Went under the high ball screen Latimore has such good range Youve got to go over top of that Make him drive it Ends a 10 nothing run here for UVA Eagles back into a zone here Thomas Hall to Ritter stepping out Floated ahead now Davis playing with the four fouls Rocking the rim They did a nice job that time on Enzo was was sizing that up for a block and he ran into the back of a North Carolina Central player who couldnt get there You know Mac Im curious your thoughts here You know some fans of high major teams would say Oh you know youre playing these games against you know opponents out of the MAC like why are you doing it But Virginias gotten a lot of looks here against a zone defense and that could prove to be helpful down the stretch of the season Oh yeah Yeah All these things are are opportunities You you dont get those things in practice Playing against a different team playing a different style playing different offensive sets Uh the these are invaluable despite the score Right And you mentioned practice there Like Brian ODMs never playing zone He hes never been a zone coach Been a mantoman coach Drop coverage with the five Thats kind of been his thing So youre never going to see a zone in practice like youre talking about Exactly and and he hes going to have a lot to show and theyre and theyre throwing some different looks out there to see what works with this particular group 20 points for Derritter 10 music for Thomas nine for White Virginia in front here by 26 Johnson scoop shot tumbles off the rim Thomas gets bumped here by Carvino whistle We continue on The last couple possessions Virginia has tried setting ball screens against the zone And your thoughts on that No Anything to disrupt the zones coverage is what you want but you still have to penetrate some way on the pass or the dribble Thomas turnarounds That was off the dribble by the way Yes it was Thank you for defining it for me sir cheering Virginias playing another clean game offensively Just seven turnovers after committing just six on opening night Tripping a foul here Davis going to the deck with under seven and a half to go Johan Gruo you cant beat this guy at the rim The sevenfooter is all over the place Come on How you getting it through him A very successful head coach at Longwood NCA tournament just back in 2024 Yeah And you know not only is he a a close friend but a brilliant coach really helps He has been in Ryans seat He understands what a head coach has to go through Uh and I cant tell you how valuable that is to this staff Yeah He said to us Griff before the game Ive been on this journey with Ryan whether weve actually been together or not By the way there was uh a potential over and back call on the tip that Virginia wasnt really happy about cheering and applause Yeah it wasnt controlled I dont I dont think that actually was It looked really bad cheering but just because he touched it didnt mean he had control of it in the front court Yeah fans were going crazy here but uh Mac you are a scoot in the in the rule book Appreciate that Ive never been told that by an official I can tell you that Well they should put you on the public address so you can tell the fans how you feel I I still dont think they would agree with you No No Theyre not supposed to Theyre fans Yeah thats right Thats right All right Heres Thomas jetting into the front court Sam Lewis back in for a three Thomas said I can score but I can also help our team score Nice pass to Lewis in the corner for the wide open three Uh kind of going under the radar here M Malik Thomas has six assists tonight Thats a careerhigh Im Im surprised its a careerhigh Im not surprised he has six assists Hes a very unselfish player despite the fact that he is the scoreer Yeah hes had a nice allaround game tonight Remember he missed his first three shots tonight Bounced back nicely Aneno commits the foul and one here Gage Latimore continues his nice night Yeah going with his right hand all the way off the ball screen around the arc and finally to the rim and finishes through the contact What a nice play Protected the basketball Hes enjoying that right there Let me go Zen it hurts to take on a seven What a good shooter does Let Let me Let me relax Ill get to the free throw line Im an 80 free throw shooter Ill be fine All right So that conversation there between coach and and on ano what do you thinks being discussed there right now Well you know he was a little late on the rotation and and then if he just goes straight up hes got a better chance right there He didnt have to go into the body and create that foul essentially Trust your length Exactly Very good way to put it Moore with his 20th point of the night matching his total from the NC State game Thomas flipping it over his head Knock down here from Johnson Lean Carvey Big time jam and a steal here Its Johnson again on a bounce for the Athletic Done Yeah furious action here with six minutes to go in this game Back and forth Chance Mallerie got knocked to the floor on the other end A little incidental contact Two players going for the ball at the same time looked like an NFL play Well we remind you that the Eagles got absolutely waxed in the opener against NC State They are fighting here Yes music theyre down by a sizable margin but they get a dunk in transition Cory Carvey little flex cut right there All right so lets teach some basketball Flex cut defined for us please Here you go Well its a cut off the baseline cross to the other side of the lane off of a screener on the block and then a screen for that screener That is the longtime veteran of college basketball M McCarthy giving us the details Cory Spectre with you as well and our hardworking crew here in Charlottesville Appreciate all their hard work As its known Mac you know this crossover season these people are working hard this time of the year Not a question and a lot of supports to handle and a lot of people wanting their time and expertise Shot clock here in single figures Jakari White the penetration in the feed Lewis three So unselfish So unselfish 19 assist on 24 made field goals That is a great percentage NC Central trying to break the press and we have a blocking foul Chance Mallerie tried to draw the charge Not happening for us It looked like he was pretty stationary Was he outside the arc He was outside the arc Oh he moved just a little bit Maybe left foot right Just stepped and leaned Yeah thats a great angle What camera work and thats perfect right there Thats what the official saw and the fans disagreed with Cory Kby at the line Good crowd here tonight too Yeah Friday night Know what it would be like And uh first big football game tomorrow Maybe theyre going straight from here to the stadium I uh I saw the ACC huddle truck driving in today Nice cheering Those folks do a great job Yes that show Phenomenal coverage 7347 Virginia played has played well but they got uh they got really beat up on last week by Florida State Are you the analyst for tomorrows game too or I could do a little football Okay Im like everybody else I know if you if you run it doesnt work You should have passed Okay Great stuff there Youre going to make it in life Its to be determined 5 minutes to go now here in the second half Virginia at 46 NC Central stuck on 30 Its been a rougher offensive night for the Eagles tonight by comparison to Monday They shot 44 against NC State A respectable number Yeah it its really tough when you dont when you cant get anything near the rim Youre forced to all jump shots and your percentage is going to reflect that Yeah just 16 paint points tonight for the Eagles Tyrick Davis triggers in Johnson Mallerie is a good open court defender He pers right Really hard to get around him Good switch right there by Diver Vladimore to the rim too strong Went off the foot of Thomas Back to the Eagle Shot clock does not reset here Davis soaring and scoring Yeah that was very alert on his part to understand the shot clock We have a hold here prior to the inbound Were in the double bonus now for the last four and a half minutes So in steps Chance Mallerie holds the Saints single game record for points and single game record for threes 45 and 11 respectively Wow St Ans battlefield product By the way the fouls were at nine You jumped the gun there So it is one and one Go Getting ahead of yourself A little antsy Its all right Math has never been as strong All right Vladimore around the screen Pull up three This guy can play That was a really nice play right there Did not need much space Hes going to be a beast in the league Thomas a tray that doesnt go Tipped up for Ditter Sees two Kicks it out Mallerie with so much space Such a good looking shot Such a good looking shot I know how he got it 45 Was that the number Yeah correct 2400 nearly fourpoint shot They couldnt give him a extra couple of baskets in the score sheet Here he is on the defensive end Right They try to outlet it quickly to midcourt denying Latimore And even the Jakari can appreciate what Chance Mallerie does So good inside out feet set nobody close to him Just overall unselfishness from the Whos Yeah 21 assists on 26 made field goals is unbelievable And and thats led to a lot of people Think about the Ritter Thomas Lewis Mallerie White and Anadzo all with eight or more points You know we uh previewed the next episode of Proving Grounds which is coming out next week during our halftime coverage tonight If you watch the first few episodes you get a really good feel as to how close this team has gotten throughout the off season You know they tooured grounds together Here comes Tesa Ritter near us By the way I know you were bracing for contact Thats thats the tank by the way Need an introduction Just Just I am not getting in his way Okay I had you covered there No but but youre right about the closest the team is going to be big because so many of these guys were the man on their team and now theyre having to play a different kind of role and and that is a real credit to the coaching staff to get them in that mindset And then you got just the opposite with Derritter who was a role player and now they want him to be the man You know this is a shameless plug We did the interview with Tester Ritter for the Villanova exhibition and uh you know I was chatting up with him both before during and and after the interview and Im just really impressed with this guy just how comfortable he is in a new setting Like think about it I know hes 22 Hes not 17 or 18 years old but hes fit in seamlessly with this team and he hasnt played two games two complete games yet Yeah 22yearold freshman uh you know is pretty mature and like you saw in the interview he he is he knows what he wants and he knows the path to get there That thats incredibly valuable and uh hes going to have an outstanding year in the ACC I think UVA fans will fall in love with him I I really do Step down by Latimore to the second level second row Latimore has really played well on both ends tonight 22 from Satan Hill Not Satan Hall but Satan Hill But what a gift for coach Lavell Motton And another thing that stands out for me tonight how about his usage He hasnt come off the floor Hes played all 37 And I would imagine for this NC Central team that brought in 10 new players all transfers once they got in around mid July or so they probably had like open competition Like you want to be a part of the rotation you can go show yourself that you belong They werent established roles right You know what I mean And and I think thats still going on to be honest Theyre still auditioning and and the goal is the league you you need to win the tournament Youre not getting it at large bid in their league but you can be playing your best basketball in March for the conference tournament And its a league thats been dominated recently by Norfick State and Howard Those two programs have combined for five MAK titles in the top again Yeah absolutely All right so Mac were about 80 minutes through the season for UVA Set it up Cavaliers new team Ryan ODM new head coach all these newcomers Martin Carrer one of them Hes coming in here What do we make of what weve seen thus far Well I I think youve seen depth I think youve seen explosiveness Uh I think youve seen unselfishness Um and uh and and thats a good start There there a lot of things that they still have to fix a lot of things that they need to do more consistently but I think theyre trending in the right direction I I really do like this team pick fifth in the league that uh you know that thats entirely attainable And I would imagine at years end as you see the leading scorers for tonight like that list is going to be very fluid throughout the year I think some teams will say tester Ritter no we cant let him beat us So all right Malik Thomas is going to find himself more open Right Yep Exactly And and thats thats where that thats why that threepoint percentage is going up tonight 42 from threepoint land after after struggling a little bit the other night And thats a direct result of the inside presence that you have with with the bigs for Virginia By the way the Cavaliers have Hampton coming up on Tuesday Thatll be a 900 start on ACC Network against the Pirates team thats picked fifth out of 13 in the CIA Transition basketball here Davis has played it for a while now with four fouls Heres Carvey collecting the board faking and boy shot fakes are so important when going up against a guy like Anenzo Yeah And on the other end Ano uh missed the dunk on a beautiful pass by Chance Mallerie Fumbled it out of bounds And here go the Eagles the other way cheering Harvey tonight 16 points nine rebounds and four assists following his 198 game against NC State Yeah hes kind of established himself as he and Latimore are going to be the kind of goto guys on that offensive end although they they still have some other weapons that they havent necessarily gotten comfortable in the offense yet Very intrigued to see how Jonathan does Dunn does in this system 13 in the maroon Full court press here from NC Central and a hold here on Ryan Archie Hes a guy who coach Motton wants to see more of moving forward Yeah the Coppen State transfer He was all rookie in the MAK at Coffin last season Averaged nine points two rebounds Not a great threepoint shooter but a but a really good point guard and he and Deontay Johnson may be may end up playing a lot together Mallerie at the line Eight points tonight Two for three at the stripe Expect him to be a really good free throw shooter with that form Youll appreciate this Mac Chance So obviously hes here at UVA His grandfather Steven played football at Virginia Tech Wow Did not know that Yeah Both sides of the rivalry there Good nuggets Yeah Trying again you know kind of keep you on your toes Theres some back and forth between those two schools a little bit Just a tad the the Barber brothers and uh and their dad being a football player at Virginia Tech while I was there actually 100 ticks to go and well have a timeout here Now Coach Motton cant go back to uh Durham and accumulate those timeouts though he is still coaching his squad Tester Ritter tonight 20 points five rebounds music and again Matt super efficient Yeah shared the basketball too Very unselfish total of points tonight Theres that left hand Weve seen him on the drive Weve seen him in transition Weve seen him finish it music through contact catch and shoot guy that you got to get out on Its really going to be tough for people to take him out of the basketball game Uh you put a smaller guy on him youre going to see him go down the block and back you down You put a bigger guy on him hes going to step out and shoot the ball without a lot of pressure And I think he played this pretty smartly Again a role player overseas at Bill Ba basket He averaged just over nine points per game Hes getting an opportunity now to step up into the limelight and NBA folks will get to know okay is this a guy we can throw the ball to consistently Can he get us buckets if we draft him Yeah the answer is yes Already youre that convinced already I am 100 convinced The people that pick him as one of the best five players in the ACC I think are are uh on to something Smart cookies Virginia massaging the clock now Mallerie the left cheering on Yenso tearing down the rim They got it this time The two tried it earlier missed it This time on Yenzo now with 10 points seven rebounds Fantastic night for him Davis double clutch layup Davis from Americas Georgia He was playing in his hometown late in the shot clock Penetration against the zone They have to come help And a beautiful catch and finish this time by the Kansas State transfer That is such a big catch radius You hear that a lot in football Oh yes But chance doesnt have to be absolutely precise with that pass Just put it up in the area right laughter 100 75 wingspan A guy who can really jump high in the air Good mobility Nice night for him Hell head out Carter Lang checking in now for UVA applause and cheering Mallerie has a chance to be the fifth Wahoo into double figures Territter with 20 Thomas with 12 Lewis with 10 with 10 Ugo adding a couple of blocks tonight as well Crowd goes quiet for the hometown kid cheering Couple more possessions here for the Eagles No conversion there from Davis and Carrer cant keep it in The red shirt freshman transferring over from VCU where coach ODM was at last year She has cooled off from the free throw line Malleries missed three here lately himself 11 for 19 now just 58 Didnt clear up everything from Monday nights performance And again you reminded people earlier in our telecast tonight across the country were not going to see many mosaics being painted by teams right now Not at all Not at all Youre going to see brilliant spurts brilliant individual performances but consistency is not going to be there for a little while Just too many face new faces on each of these rosters Desmond Roberts also coming in now for UVA Red shirt sophomore also from Stab cheering So those three guys are all on the court right now Carter Lang as well A young man named Odum in the game Yeah he scored the other night Owen couple of points in the last minute 13 against Ryder Carrer Odum Crowds going to go nuts if he hits this Roberts tip back Carrer Yes Kaboom applause Shot clock off here 19 to play Now Virginia hitting 80 points Something that this crowd is not really accustomed to but it is the new norm for UVA And the Cavaliers will salt off the remaining time in game number two of the 2526 season picking up a dub over NC Central 81 to 62 Really solid performance
