Jim Lena 40th years ah head coach overall is 13th at Miami and his hurricanes will start with the basketball Jamie lucky Tim clockery AJ desire officials Miami in the black Syracuse and the home whites it is an orange out it typically is but its specifically an orange out here in the dome where the Hurricanes off a 29 and8 season control first and they get an easy touch for noo want to start that as a twopoint per game scorer has the games first two and you see right away with Malik Brown hedging so high they have to have that rotation Come From The Bottom thats something Syracuse and Miami both need to have tonight Syracuse is starting five Starling Judah mince is their top score Brown has been terrific this season getting to start with nem McLoud out for the year along with Justin Taylor and Chris Bell through to Min the oranges leading score at 18 and a half per game controls the leading scores in the ACC will lean in with a second to shoot and his Miss shot cleaned up by wga popper and we have an injured Miami player here as poppler got the rebound and appears to have been hit up high look at the full hurricane starting five Pat Cleveland popper George and naoko and heres what happened to wga Music popper maybe hes got hit with his own hand on the way down that happens it it happens sometimes in the game that would be one of the more bizarre injuries weve seen a selfinflicted facial injury poppler will tow it off it can itll afford any more injuries right now up Miami without it is already a team that gets almost no production from their bench yeah only playing six or seven guys they need everyone they can get hurricanes off a loss against Florida State on Wednesday 8475 and working inside of noo again how about this start Michael noo The Freshman from Toronto the first two baskets and youre going to see it all game from both teams theyre going to try to get downhill you see Cleveland with the steel and Cleveland a little bit of an odd delivery midair ends up banking it in off the back of the rim and Miami starts three for three these two teams are similar as far as their style of play wanting to get downhill but two things theyre going to have to do is contain the guards and be able to take care of the basketball two teams that play at a high Tempo Miami and Syracuse that Balls thrown away by Bell another turnover and then mince will take it back and get bumped in the back by Wugga poppler for the games first foul but it is a sloppy start with the ball couple of turnovers so far for Syracuse yeah you see right here theyre trying to play up the short roll Miami does a great job of hedging hard the short roll should be open but Miami did a good job job of rotating from the backside and getting there thats just something that these Syracuse guards are going to have to notice where does Syracuse most Excel on offense theyre getting downhill theyre I mean again Miami and Syracuse are similar as far as their style of play they really Excel getting downhill obviously Judah get to the free throw line and JJ get to the paint but what really helps them and separates them is when they can get their perimeter Shooters going and that helps space the floor and helps those guys like JJ and Judah get downhill Le Crow pokes it away off the Miss three by Chris Bell 19 to shoot for Miami Hurricanes the second highest scoring team in the ACC 832 points per game and the fifth most efficient offense in the conference very good Shooters very good from three and they will struggle with turnovers heres George a deep one is Off the Mark for Kean georgeon cleaned up by the yards leading rebounder Malik Brown heres Brown off the feed from mince lays it in and they can finally take their seats here in the dome and Kevin we talked about that short rle Miami does a great job of hedging hard their defense is high up so that leaves the rim to be open a lot Syracuse has to be able to take advantage of that throughout the game Brown now 70 for 99 71 field goal percentage on the Year Nigel pack with a little step back too 1499 Career Point score the fourth year Junior pack gets on the hes a guy who leads this Miami team as he goes the Miami team go there is Starling and thats a pleasant sign for Syracuse aete a couple of Threes that P on Tuesday JJ Starling is at a tough years shooting from three only 26 with a confident Music start on the ball right now at pack freshman George right in front of the very active Adrien ay first gear Syracuse coach bring mnam to his right on the drive heres wga popper dud is are very capable Defender but a lot of times he plays ol defense and lets his Defender go right by hes a guy who needs to be able to stay in front and keep those guys doesnt put so much pressure on his bigs Miami starts at five for six Taylor off the shot fake Blows By George rattles out at two and starlings able to keep the ball in bounds heres a three for Malik Brown which is red probably not the best shot that they wanted but you know what its good to see Justin Taylor getting opportunities and looking for his own early on popper misses a three heres Bell and popper bumps him in front of the bench thats a second foul against wga popler for an already thin Miami team foul issues early but Michael noo in his first career start with a couple of buckets JJ Sterling a Syracuse

of silence was held before the game for Liam zby young man who passed away last Friday at age 22 as a result of complications from an aneurism Liam was a student manager with a Syracuse team had had many health conditions and health issues during his life but had such a deep deep love for Syracuse basketball was enrolled to the University School of Education Jamesville dit graduate very close with Buddy baheim Joe Gerard former Syracuse players very close with this current team the funeral held yesterday and a whole lot of Syracuse coaches players and administrators when we want to send our love and condolences to the zagi family and talking to folks around the program Liam was such a bright light not for this team but in this community in general so our best wishes and love to all of Liams friends and family Syracuse plays with a heavy heart on this Saturday afternoon the Syracuse managers just overall mean a lot to the Syracuse basketball program and we know how much they do so again sending our condolences to the friends and family at practice yesterday think there were 20 Syracuse managers theyre like seven more managers and there AR players on this staff at all times and then if theres a wet spot youre going to see all 20 of them right there on the floor getting it ready to go so its they mean a lot to the Syracuse basketball program theres just a handful of them down on the end of the bench so Miami with a 105 lead they take wga poppler out of the game he picked up his second foul going to break but here Copelands on the floor for Syracuse hes missed a couple of shots already fighting to get his own rebound back and then a foul AJ Casey Off the Bench for Miami and Casey 69ine sophomore in there with George foul is charged to kesan George and for Syracuse we know they excel at getting to the bucket getting to the paint but we have to see some of those perimeter shots knocked down so you can open up some of those driving lanes and make it a little bit easier for these guys get into the rim hes just two for eight to start that ball deflected with 14 to shoot Bensley Josephs on the floor for Miami for the first time his first game Off the Bench this season and Casey replac Moko at popper Judah minz taking a seat for Copeland early for Syracuse here is the hyperactive guard Copeland looking to get his shot up again at the expiration of the timer fighting for another offensive rebound Josephs on the deck in a Copeland Taylor sandwich and the possession arrow will stay with Syracuse and you like the energy for young players a lot of times they see the first opportunity its open they dont take it and then they go into the second opportunity and makes it a harder shot and that was the case right there for Copeland but Copeland you know over the last 6 seven games hes playing extremely extremely good basketball and not only is he a Swiss army knife he his energy just impacts this team at a whole different level turnover is an issue of points but talking to Adrien autrey feels like the last few weeks theyve gotten some of the crazier plays out of his system quader Copeland Benny Williams checks in the game now hes found a real connection with Copeland Off the Bench and Judah Min returns to the floor Bell off the shot fake now it out two and Miami finally clears it with a junior benley Joseph theres that high hedge from Brown Step In by George and an offensive foul as he hit mince in the face thats two fouls on kesan George so two starters with two fouls already for Miami I dont know Kev I mean it was it just looked like he was getting by it was inadvertent it wasnt anything on purpose but I guess bad luck for George and this play is going to be reviewed at the monitor by Jamie Lucky in the officials because of the elbow up high officials will typically review a play even if it seems inadvertent with an elbow to the face does this meet the definition of flagrant or is this a normal basketball move I dont think theres much there Kev having played it happens all the time I I just tell you that and I dont think it was inadvertent but I mean how they calling the game now I guess its something that you just have to look at questions for flagrant is it excessive Andor unnecessary is it a legitimate play on the ball and this is going to be a common foul clean up quickly and George is 68 and mint is 6 foot so that he was already at that level where so nothing malicious by George at all cleaned up quickly by this veteran officiating crew you deal with these officials much in your time Jamie Tim and AJ you know what I Id like to say I did deal with them no it wasnt in no it wasnt invert yeah Jamie L giv us information exactly it it happens when youre playing basketball did any of these officials tee you up is what I want I Ive had a few tees in my day Kevin I have I you know what I wasnt the quietest guy on the court when I used to play I used to I used to talk a little bit so is that right it is heres Williams getting position inside Benny Williams on his first shot sticks in layup good to see Benny Williams hes had a lot of ups and downs this year but when hes engaged and locked in and comfortable he makes a big time impact for this team Miami working on a scoring drve of nearly 3 minutes as brown deflects it from Casey youve got Christian Watson who did not play last game on the floor for George this is an odd Hurricanes lineup as Pat misses a three and its punched in the air to Judah minz surveying the floor the Syracuse sophomore into Brown from Williams heres a three for Bell thats good Syracuse ties it on a Chris Bell triple Ill tell you what if Syracuse can have that guy right there Chris Bell come to play theyre a whole different team just facing the floor out and talking about those driving Lanes just getting a little bit bigger for Judah and JJ and the guys get to the basket and Kev speaking sorry speaking on oms absence for a second is just going to put a lot of more pressure on these guards pack Bentley Cleveland to really be able to score the basketball happy Cleveland misses a three again if youre just joining us nor chadow Meir out with a lower extremity injury which he suffered during the week Miamis leading score and rebounder not available today up ahead watch gets the leak out Christian Watson cannot finish the layup blew it right at the 10 with mince behind Copeland B comes flying in and Cleveland clears for Miami Cleveland and pack but two scores in the lineup right now and Matthew Cleveland takes it strong to snap a four plus minute scoring tra Kev I really like this guy uh Matthew Cleveland I think hes just a NBA type of player three Lev score hes improved as a jump shooter as his career has you know got uh prolonged but hes a guy that can really uh make an impact right now and I think at the next level as well talked to Bill Courtney their associate head coach before the game he said he pleasantly surprised by Clevelands decision making this year first year over from Florida State its been a big lift for them deep in the shot clock at three MCE is fouled on it by Joseph the fifth Miami foul and J Min will

before going to break Jud mins fouled shooting of three by benley Joseph who got him right on the hand in the act of shooting and that puts Judah Min the play that hes very comfortable at top 10 of the country in free throw makes and free throw attempts just as a head coach fouling the threepoint shooter especially a guy whos really not a threepoint shooter is going to kill you and and Joseph hes still out there but uh you know another one of those is obviously get him on the bench Scouting Report Kev Scouting Report its not a great threepoint shooting team as a whole minz has improved this year but the orange third worst threepoint shooting team in the ACCC 33 though they did shoot it well Tuesday at pit they were 10 for 17 had seven players make a three in that game its the first time Syracuse had done that since 2011 against Colgate M here goes two for three yeah when Syracuse can have bell and Justin Taylor contribute on the perimeter and make shots theyre a whole different team so Miami without topper with the two fouls George is off the floor with the two fouls they get it inside to noo the freshman in his first career start has six points hello Nook thats what youre here to do just be around the rim drop off bang it home he had not scored since December 6 until he had two points on Wednesdays three for three in the first 9 Minutes up top he somehow sees Brown through the trees that last dunk by Nook was an athletic powerful dunk that was just a hes taking advantage of his minutes Christian Watson a spot up three Off the Mark grabbed by mince Miami o for five from three theres seven for eight from two BR looking for Kyle cuff hands his transfer in the game for the first time out of bounds off Miami with 19 to shoot and Kev you know what an advantage Syracuse does have is theyre playing Miami is hedging hard now theyre getting that short roll with Malik Brown and its making Nook come out from the rim a little bit further than he wants to I think Malik Brown has that Advantage right there you know getting by and get to the rim Adrian auu told us to practice yesterday you can run anything through Malik Brown offensively hes one of those special centers and here he finds C cuff lost it on the way up chance for an assist but out of bounds last Touch by cuff in a Syracuse turnover I just think Malik Brown is an NBA Talent hes a guy that can provide a lot of different things on the court and I think at that next level you always need a guy like that who can do a Applause lot hack to Joseph up running the show with Cleveland Watson and noo and no Nord Shadow Mir with a lower extremity injury Joseph nearly traveled finds Cleveland another rebound for Judah Min is fourth coming off a career high nine on Tuesday Williams Syracuse is 5 for 15 in the first half of the half Mi pulls up and gives the orange its first lead great patience just holding him on his hip waiting to see the read whats open knocks down the open polo round called for Syracuses first foul on the swipe from behind Im looking at nooku and hes this is the most hes played in a while Kev hes hes a little Gass but hes hes earning his minutes today right now hes definitely earning 79 minutes per game in this season hes already played six and hes a very good recruit in Nook hes a fourstar recruit out of prolific prep which is a terrific program played with Aiden Holloway whos at Auburn Ed Mei at Baylor Trey Green at Xavier and hes been thrown into the fire today his first career start with omir out lot of dribbling by Christian Watson Copeland All Over pack from way outside no and Syracuse has been a little better than it typically is in the defensive glass as Starling emerges from the freay great individual defense on that possession MCE round it out heres Cleveland taking the ball all the way down the floor Matthew Cleveland finishes at the rim and hes got six to tie the game that was a tough finish we talked about him being a threelevel scorer there you see him getting all the way to the cup and then he defends Starling well as Joseph runs the other way for Miami Cleveland off the bounce off a tough game against his old team Florida State on Wednesday Matthew Cleveland leading all scores with eight leading to an Adrien ay timeout 30 second timeout with Miami back on top despite being shorthanded at the Dome has your adviser

from a 298 final four team a season ago but they are without one major piece today North Shadow Mir started all 17 games leads the canes in scoring 172 a game one of the best rebounders in college basketball 96 a game its being dubbed a lower extremity injury that happened earlier in the week how are they coping so far without him you know I think Nook is doing a great job coming in and take advantage of his opportunity like we said in the post in the pregame it comes down to containing the guards and how are they going to play defensively yeah offensively it puts a lot more pressure on the guards but I think these Miami guards are used to you know carrying a lot of the load on the offensive end only 12 out of 15 defensive efficiency in the ACC but right now theyre holding Syracuse to 6 for 18 shooting with three turnovers Min trying to back down benley Joseph a terrific Defender and Min finishes strong over him J de minz with his second made field goal I guess you dont typically see a six foot guard going into the mid post and and working on his post game but you know Jude is a guy whos super crafty has great feet and he knows how to get out of situations and and you know get that open shot theres pack penetrating Christan Watson and a foul go against Kyle cuff that will be a two shot foul for Watson when we return all squared away between two 12 and five

Center another wild night last season Miami made its first final four and this season they are not even in the final four teams out of the field according to Joel lardy theyre are next four out right now the net is 62 only one quadrant one win at the moment they have losses in Quad three and quad 4 including uh a pretty brutal home loss to Louisville a couple of weeks ago so in Miami you figure a lot of the players return from last years final four team maybe theyre going to be a contender again Isaiah Wong Jordan Miller Big losses though theyve been a little bit banged up and pack and popper missing some games and it just hasnt been the same Elixir right now for Jim L well you said it I think guys have been injured they havent had the chemistry that they thought they would have you know going into the season you know guys havent been practicing like they thought they would so it takes a while for guys to figure out their roles get comfortable with each other and and and develop that chemistry but Kev can you tell me a little bit more about the quadrant stuff Im not Im not well versed on it I I dont really know too much about it quad went one quad two were actually going to give you a pop quad quiz at halftime okay great I need that actually this would probably be a quadrant one1 Miami in the long run because itll be a road win against the top 75 team you figure if Syracuse ends up in the top 75 the net and right now theyre 76 it would be a very good one lets lets put it that way but if Syracuse loses it could go down to a exactly okay Syracuse beef hit Tuesday in the road was a quad one win and then Wednesday morning pits net had dropped so far was a quad two win just win baby basically yeah thats it its a lot of different factors that go into it I guess Miami throws it away for Cleveland our first ESPN big Monday double header the season coming in a couple of days and we start in the ACC where North Carolina is still rolling undefeated top of the ACC RJ Davis in the heels against a good Wake Forest team then number three in action Kansas hosting new Big 12 member Cincinnati starts at 7 Eastern on ESPN and the ESPN app hurricanes a twopoint lead without nor shadow here in the dome Orga popper has barely played in the first half Kean George same thing both with two fouls so in that respect Jim LGA has to be very pleased JJ Sterling with his second three thats a great great shot by JJ and you know what they have to do on That Elbow set they have to do a better job of going and really going hard into that down screen now they got the slip and also they got that guy coming off into that threepoint shot second stra game with two threes for Sterling Joseph in all kinds of trouble in the lane we have a tie up Miami with the arrow with eight to shoot so far in half court Miami has really struggled getting downhill I think Syracuse is doing a great job of being there on the boxes and elbows and being in help and then individually theyre doing a good job of staying in front of their guys right now z l has not made a substitution in 5 minutes he has rolled with this unusual lineup fronted by pack who buries it from three Nigel pack surp passing the 1500 career point mark with a deep one and when you have 1500 points in your career that means one thing you can score the basketball and we all know that Nigel P can do that snaps an 0 for six start from three for Miami Vince misses and here comes Cleveland whos run a oneman fast break show of points he sets up Watson Christian Watson with four points off the bench and Miami getting some unexpected contributions this is where Miami excels at and both of these teams want to be able to play up and down and get out in transition less decisions to make pass it ahead and get to the rim Miami does a great job of getting out and Mitch just throws it away an unforced arrow over the head of Taylor Syracuse turns it over for the fifth time and just being simple with the basketball make make the right play you know you dont have to overdo it if its not there kick it out reset it and get it going again Kan with 10 nothing edge of Fast Break points 188 points of the paint right now pack again off the screen from noo couldnt convert from three Miami without omir still does not have an offensive rebound and Starling nearly had his third three I love the aggression I love when he sees it and its open take it CL sensing the mismatch with bell HS the dribble alive gets around Chris Bell and scores it great job of proven just keeping the ball alive not picking up his dribble waiting till something opens up hes a guy hes another guy who can score on all three levels seven nothing Miami run its been a stagnant start off defensively for Syracuse Bell cop penetrating Bell catch and shoot left to short and heres Joseph on the run again tag might have gotten away with a travel Applause there theres benley Joseph attacking the lane Joseph gets to the off hand and Adrien Onre will use his second first half time out nine in a row for Miami which is six for its last seven from the field his shorthanded hurricanes attacking the paint in Syracuse a big

and yet Miami has still dominated the paint yeah you see Miami getting out and excelling in transition they play best when theyre in space Nigel pack proven waiting for the right opportunity to get to the basket and you see Bentley just getting downhill and having a strong finish they excel at those things getting out in transition and getting downhill to the basket 22 of 29 Points in the paint right now for the Hurricanes outside the paint not so good 1 for eight from three 11 for 14 inside it Adrien alri used a couple of timeouts and Miami on a N9 nothing run looking for what would be borderline quad one quad two into the dome for team that gold andard has in the next four out just Taylor back on the floor for Syracuse Starling feeds Bell bit of a high catch couldnt pull it down and shoot it deep in the shot clock again for the aens its Starling a hard screen by Brown freedom and then three hurricanes including Watson go for the rebound and heres Joseph again pushing Tempo pack dragging in behind and he couldnt convert rare Miss near the rib for Miami Syracuse needs to get play Up Tempo a little bit more too get easier shot there it is semi transition to see Bell hitting open sh but Miami is doing a great job of pushing Syracuse away from the rim being there on the catch and making them play tough shots second three for Bell snap set N9 nothing hurricane run G led by Cleveland with h Taylor fronting him right now a foul Malik Brown was reaching in from behind and Malik Brown just picked up his second now I dont know Kev are you disagreeing with an official its my second time today well red hry is going to leave Brown in with the two fouls remember Syracuse does not have nem McLoud their normal starting center is out for the year here with foot surgery Brown has played the whole game and brown takes it away right here Syracuse goes to their typical two three out of bound out of out of bounds its nice to feel a little bit like its still all time its still of two3 in the dome its still there they still got a little bit of that manto man defense has been exceptional but Syracuses best defensive team in quite a few years first year manto man under Adrien ay pack getting around mince into the paint Nigel pack leades it short rebound forer copelan can he run for syu without numbers Scoops it to Bell great extra Starling yes that was a great extra pass by Chris Bell great job by Copeland pushing it down creating that opportunity for the extra pass backto back threes for the orange and its Copeland leading the break and then this pass you love the extra feed so much by Bell love the extra feet and when JJ Starling is hitting jump shots his confidence is on another Music level JJ Starling had some knee injuries last year and a pretty debilitating shoulder injuries at Notre Dame hes admitted it really hurt his mechanics it threw his shot out of whack he started the season one for 18 from three you include the three today hes 15 out of 37 C if we do some quick math which I know youre a fan of quick math I love math its 41 sense hes looking like the McDonalds AllAmerican he was out of high school and too I I think it was a mental thing you know when you have an injury and when its messing with your form it could get mental and now when you start to see the shot not falling like it typically does now it plays into other parts of your game so I think for him its just getting back to what hes used to getting in the gym getting those extra reps up and I know hes been in that gym with with GMAC getting the extra reps up and and you could tell hes hit three threes today and and again when hes hitting jump shot its just opening up um the rest of the floor for his downhill game and everything else that he has three threes that ties a career high third time Sterling has done that so off the Miami timeout Nigel pack will control the twopoint hurricane lead and no wga popper since the 153 n Mark with two fouls Jim L has been very conservative in this first half Cleveland around and out Miami still does not have an offensive rebound dud has his fifth defensive rebound could be that omir effect you know hes averaging 10 rebounds a game and a few of those are definitely on the offensive side of the ball under two to play in this first half which has been led by a shorthanded hurricanes team Williams will step into the foul line line drive it out only two offensive rebounds for Syracuse they tie it up here with Copeland and mince and the orange has the arrow Kev I love what quer Copeland brings I I feel like Im out there in his body right now when hes talking but I I just love the energy that he brings to this team you know besides on the court and his skills his energy goes to everybody else and they can feel that and thats thats the most important thing that he brings for me hey a said hes just as talented as anyone in this program he has found a little more consistency last couple of months quader Copeland Williams left them all alone and Benny short arms the three well hes capable shooter if hes going to let him shoot and shoot the ball Joseph with an air M at the other end that looked uncomfortable that elbow popped out Kev when that elbow pops out its not going to be a good shot imagine you know as a shooter when your elbow pops out instantly this is not going to be what I intended Im trying to keep that elbow lined up right there straight through Bell off the screen by Williams a drive by Chris Bell stood up by noo Williams battling hard got it back and hell get to the rim extra effort from Benny Williams Off the Bench I thought initially Nook did a great job of just being straight up but Benny Williams bringing that energy and effort thats what we thats what Syracuse expects from him and I like what Chris Bell did instead of settling for the pullup getting all the way downhill to the rim hes 67 and athletic you can get to them and make a play at The Rim Benny Williams 10 for 19 at the free throw line this season shoot two p ESPN womens basketball match up tomorrow afternoon Angel Reese the defending national champions the LSU Tigers hosting Arkansa 5 Eastern for local on ESPN and streaming on the ESPN app one short one long there two Miss free throws for Williams free throws matter they do matter especially in a game like this a Miami scoreless for over 3 and 12 minutes nursing a twopoint lead into noo again Williams ties him up and Cleveland comes out of nowhere to statch an accidentally perfect pass Matthew Cleveland with 10 after a twopoint game on Wednesday against Florida State he leads all scores and Miami leads in the final half minute of the first pins in the lane Williams for three yes indeed well we just talked about hes a capable shooter he missed one if you have another opportunity Let It Go Pat can hold for the last shot Williams on him Williams commits a foul Syracuse has quite a few to give not a bad foul with 26 to go Kevin we talked about the similar styles to play you can even see on the defensive side of the ball Syracuse and Miami hedging high so theyre really decep of leaving guys away from the rim they got to be able to see that rotation on that backside both teams copel for back celand did not get it off in time wave off the basket it does not count and Miami picked up his second foul at the 1401 Mark he didnt return wiga Poppers second foul was at the 1539 Mark he didnt return theyre both back on the floor for Miami along with Cleveland noo and pack and look at this wga popper who sat for the final 1539 picks up his third foul after 11 seconds well Kev that was just silly right there I mean there there was nothing there and then you see him put his shoulder right down into his chest that was have some awareness of you already having two fouls Jim Leno will let him ride it out for a little bit Syracuse with mince Taylor Starling Bell and brown the Ares starting five theem McLoud out for the season due to quip surgery Malik Brown a permanent starter heres Bell for three thats not close Chris Bell just two for seven from Deep today you see Miami switching up they picking roller covers to set of hedge and you see Nook he sted it stay down a little bit protecting the basketball pack floats it in and out the first offensive rebound of the game for Miami comes from Michael noo who is one away from a season high in minutes and hell go to the free throw line Kev this dude is a monster under the GL I mean his body type right he he is a big boy and you know what we talked about ear hes taking advantage of his opportunity and he seems like hes having fun with it as well the season high points was nine against the vaunted NJIT Highlanders hes got six already and he is making his first start because of that man on the left side of the bench North Chad oir a lower extremity issu suffered earlier this week 17 point per game scorer 10 rebound per game Monster on the boards aoko has seized the opportunity he goes one for two and Miami has the first point of the half and and no woko has done a great job but theres no replaceing omir what he brings just as an experience to the team hes been around the program for four years you know hes a guy thats really Irreplaceable heres Taylor thought about the three hell set up mince instead that is off the IR to the right Zs now 6 for 19 from Deep Cleveland its so good in transition today KCK it back for wiga Poppin a step back three and another offensive rebound for Nook popper again steps inside Taylor gets to Cleveland in the pinkt Cleveland swishes and hes got it does it and I thought wga had the you know first threepoint attempt inste he didnt he didnt shoot it but but it was a great job getting to the Lane and find the open guy good job by Cleveland finding open space doz the points six rebounds three assists for Matthew Cleveland two to minz six points in the first half for him JJ Starling LED with nine Starling its the bigger George will feed Taylor three to shooting Taylors got George all over him Taylor gets it on the ren popper Soares in for the defensive rebound je you said in the first half how Syracuse was stagnant offensively that was another possession where theyre just playing all out on the perimeter its hard to play basketball like that youre always going to end up with a shot like they just got Adrien AA practice yesterday had a moment as Starling sets up and misses a three Taylor grabs it he just blew the whistle he crouched he stayed silent for 10 seconds and he said everybody please just pass the ball and right now they havent passed it terribly well they miss a couple of old threes thats from Taylor 0 for five from three to start in the second half pack penetrated and he left it short tries to get it back Taylors on the de pack as well this tie up will go the way of the arm you know what I think a lot of times too and especially for both of these teams Syracuse and Miami they have a lot of individual Talent so you can get caught up sometimes and trying to do too much oneonone instead of being able to get in move the ball around and get the best shot Applause Syracuse fans are still on their feet the tradition here at the is you stand and clap until the first made field goal of the half that will come from Tay right on time Im not standing the whole time Im sitting down a couple times seriously Im sitting down man take a break make your own rules popper only two points in the game gets his deflected pass back Brown will hedge back thats a good recovery by Malik Brown tied for second in the ACC and steals hes just forcing it right now W hes forcing a little bit too much Taylor Maybe got hit on a follow through there but no foul and Cleveland was all alone under the basket for a moment popper didnt see him Poler will take it himself and brown just parries it out of bounds on the way up yeah again I I think its you know poer hes trying to do too much right now hes trying to make up for the time that he hasnt been playing and and you know rightfully so hes trying to make plays but you just have to be able to read and make better decisions I think Jim Lena thinks the same thing youre thinking popler will take a seat its the first sub since the 1140 Mark of the first half not including the reentry of the players that were subbed out at halftime its actually a great throw in right there about an 88t pass what of the basket George from Joseph spot up three is good for Kean George who they have gotten hit there as well no foul but he gets all three for Miami and look who hes guarding now hes 68 guarding the six foot point guard Judah minz one of the best scorers in the ACC that just shows his versatility and we weve been waiting on George since the beginning that we talked about him hes hes a very capable player no deflection there thats a bell turnover Kean George with his first bucket Miami keeping the orange at Arms Lane with no fees or minimums and no overdraft fees banking with Capital One is the easiest decision in the history of decisions even easier than this Ill take Barkley yes I still got it I told you shed pick me first yep even easier than that with no fees or minimums and no overdraft fees is it even a decision thats banking reimagined whats in your wallet Im bougie Im like 7 bougie

after you were playing here your strength coach here at the ed23 foundation thats you with Fran Brown and a couple other folks getting a 10000 check yeah well I mean the Syracuse Community has been you know a part of me since 2005 and um they mean so much to me and in the ed23 foundation it was three things that really came to mind provide resources Inspire change um and connect likeminded people and and thats what were trying to do in the community and we couldnt do it without the help of um you know everybody in it so Im Im very blessed and grateful for the for the check that athletes who care provided the foundation youve had a lot of different roles on our family event pack misses Matthew Cleveland has the offensive rebound player for Syracuse analyst philanthropist and of course how can we forget beheim Army Champion under the rule of Ryan Blackwell and Kevin BBY a couple of years ago at TBT shout out my guy Kev BBY and and Ryan Blackwell I guess Im trying to be like the uh the quader Copeland I guess the Swiss Army Im trying to provide a a little bit of everything man but again its just Im so grateful to be a part of the Syracuse Community uh and theyve stuck with me through the ups and downs and and Im super blessed to be here and and do what Im doing Sy right now down by five Miamis had the lead most of the game and Matthew Cleveland a big reason why misses a jumper orang shooting at 1 for seven in the second half 0 for six from three the quiet game offensively for Mintz again Syracuse just needs some more movement even off the ball just going to down screen or just being able to exchange on those wings theres no movement its a good look for Bell its a seventh straight missed three though to start the half Cleveland just straight up lost it Miamis had some turnover trouble thats the 11th for the ks I dont know if if Cleveland is uh you know typically bringing the ball up as the point guard like that but you know Judah saw that took advantage of it put some pressure on him see what his handles like and Losing Isaiah Wong the ACC player of the year really is hurt Miamis ball handling issues here the second worst turnover team to turnovers per game in ACC play Hopeland going to drive it into George Hopeland hanging in the air for a long time rebounded by Brown Bell will step in off the fake and Bell shot is spiked by Nook noo are you making your presence felt yes you are you definitely are making your presence felt but how about George as well I I I mean just his versatility as a freshman 68 being a you saw him guarding mints and now taking on Bell staying in front making a hard shot letting no wo come over and you know get the block deep in the shot clock again Starling will pull up from the elbow and JJ Starling has had the jumper going I think hes a guy right now for Syracuse that has to look to be more aggressive he has to look for a shot he has to look to get to his spots and pull up and then if he has an opportunity he has to take it lead down to three Cleveland gets around Bell and slithers in with the left tough inside hand finish tough right there Matthew K hes got 14 to lead all scores mince Starling again using the shot fake to his Advantage get him the basketball right now you you got to ride that hot hand hes feeling good hes hit down hes hit a couple jump shots now you can mix it up and make better decisions as far as what you need to do get downhill or do you have that open shot Mii with popper back on the floor replacing George looka popper with just two points one for five in the Applause game hack throws it for noo scooops it right to Bell another Miami turnover the Hurricanes 12 mince somehow it got to Brown Copeland no and then Brown gets out what a starling yes give that one right there to Malik Brown just that hustle and that effort those are the type you play plays that you need if you want to win these type of games Malik Brown hello and now you see the defense intensity pick up the crowds getting into it a little bit more lot of dribbling by pack hes tied up with brown they hit the deck hard smashing into Jim Bayan courton its Miami ball on the jump with seven to shoot Im ready to go in sub me in for real I know Im a sub right here but I could go sub it right now and play I tell you what that energy that Malik Brown is bringing is at a different level right now and you see the Dome is getting into it I mean if he doesnt get to that ball Miami might have a five on two break I tell you what effort is a skill a lot of a lot of players dont realize that but a lot of guys arent playing as hard as they can when you play as hard as you can youre giving yourself and your team an advantage I he throws it down the floor with only a few seconds to shoot pack the pull up he missed the rim and Copelands got the rebound Syracuses last lead was 1614 and mint has a chance to take it back look for him Starling stripped and out of bounds it will go to Miami off the knee of Starling one more look at this play and the effort by Malik Brown to keep this possession alive leading to three from JJ starling Tax Act doesnt sponsor any cool pro athletes Tax Act is

has played nearly every minute 68 sophomore from Virginia Benny Williams guarding Cleveland Browns got the rebound hes fifth to go with six points two Steals and a block the same thing we were talking about with Syracuse being stagnant Miami is getting in that stagnant mode and just settling for shots instead of moving the ball and getting those good looks that they got early on Williams he found copelan after the hesitation buter copelan will shoot Applause two Georges third foul and and I and Ill tell you this some fans dont like the the emotional and and the talking back I love it Im a guy who loves the guys getting emotion out there obviously you got to control it but it means youre passionate about what youre doing youre passionate about the game and if you ask me you have to be passionate about something if you want to be really good at it and I see Copeland out there he brings that I just love it I you know I cant say enough about this kid hes got the the whitest smile on the roster but your C for sure 66 sophomore from Philadelphia optimistic joyful you go to Syracuse practice to see Adrien ay get on players and coder Copeland will be just smiling behind his back or in front of his back the whole time too just loves to play loves to play I I tell you what Miami needs to do they need to get packed back on track he needs to look to be aggressive and just cuz hes 3 for2 he cant settle you got to be able to get to that bucket or take that opportunity that you get pack with Cleveland popper George and Casey heres Kean George pack with 10 to shoot good movement better movement popper bodied up really well by Judah mince has to throw it back to Nigel pack its his game at the end of the shot clock and buries it from Deep pack he must have heard me he heard me

rebound and its pack again backto back possessions hes up to it does it yeah he knows its time hes you know under 10 its his time to go ahead and start being a little bit more aggressive I think hes fell back a little bit in the early on now he sees that he has to take over 14 point per game score Nigel pack H the 1500 Career Point Mark today Starling a catch and two brown got in there late and mince is blocked but fouled by a disbelieving Cleveland his first Kev we need a stat for Malik Brown how many plays is he keeping alive how many deflections is he getting I tell you has four offensive rebounds but as for deflections and somebodys got to be charting that on this sys P absolutely its not us but they are over there they if they want to come over and tell us they can but wed appreciate it hes keeping plays alive so free throws for Mintz whos two for three at the line today first tonight from sced Bank Arena in Toronto UFC 297 the middleweight title fight between Champions Shan

and it is on kesan George on number seven ke George thats his fourth personal I see him just getting downhill playing off of two feet I think young kids I say this all the time once you get in that paint area if youre able to play off of two feet even if that first opportunity isnt there you keeping the Play Alive you can kick it out or you can pivot off and get into a you know right left hand shot whatever it may be but playing off two feet like Copeland did there he just gave him himself a better opportunity so George is going to take a seat with 848 to go BS the Joseph returns George with three points four fouls popper with two points three fouls omir injured an unavailable Miami hanging on for dear life with 848 to Applause go Applause Joseph been letting Nigel pack cook of late he hasnt touch the ball on this possession C its Poler and its going to be a blocking foul this time on Malik Brown very close to what would have been Poppers fourth instead it is Malik Browns third I dont know number one Malik Brown well I mean the extension of the arm right there is enough to you know call the offensive foul but again I I just think poer he hes forcing it man you know we know hes a talented guy but you got to just let that come to you no facing on that drive at all track for his worst offensive Game of the Year can he get it going here yes he can that typ of guy hes that type of guy he just needs one of those to go down and now hes back on track Miami h four straight shots and a Kanes lead it by five in the lane minz left it short contact no foul Here Comes Cleveland

yes we we only growing stronger reaching higher yes Queens we selfempowered that was spectacular this is game Music day 7 Minutes 1 second to go in this game and the odds are good that Matthew Cleveland will play the final 7 minutes and 1 second he has played the first 32 minutes and 59 seconds of this game has not had a sub in a day where Miami does not have North Shadow Mir where theyve had foul trouble for wiga poppler and Kean George Matthew Cleveland on Wednesday playing his old team Florida state two points two turnovers shot one for eight talking to Bill Courtney before the game and he said look remember Matthew Clevelands really close with a lot of those guys still his former teammates they figured it was just a one game blip for him turns out they were right yeah I know he was chomping at the bit to get to that next game and just erased that from his memory and you know so far hes having an efficient game you know besides the four turnovers hes the guy that has continuously put pressure on this Syracuse defense ler Copeland five for six at the line Syracuse back within fre despite a poor shooting day benley Joseph for Miami sets up Cleveland get it out rebound Malik Brown where do you look here from Syracuse well you got to look to get downhill and get to the basket if you can I mean you want to look for the open opportunity but right there MCH gets down hill he missed the layup though 11th rebound for Cleveland Miami has an advantage and poeland not a bad foul really to slow down that Miami break its only his first and the teams third and I like the play by Sir you get it to the Elbow come off that little rub screen he hands it to him then he has an opportunity you just got to finish now when you dont finish those opportunities a lot of times they can get out and transition and play fast and thats when you have silly fouls or you know opportunities that reming P finds that extra gear and thats a go t taken off the backboard by browni by yeah definitely definitely a go t looks good though Kev it looks good looks good on TV Nel packs four of his last five hes got a game high 17 now Miami has led for nearly the whole game Syracuse just a 90 second lead Benny Williams from Starling thats way short heres popper only five points in the game popper Cleveland quarter pocket Theo tips it and its into the hands of Judah minz Ill tell you what I love these Miami guards though nothing phases them and theyre going to be aggressive regardless if theyre 0 for 10 or or 10 for 10 theyre going to play the same way Copeland spinning into traffic Copeland draws a foul its on popler and its going to be a two shot foul so wga po has four fouls and Copeland will go back to the line I dont know if uh if popper and and Copeland have a little bit of History I dont know if theyre both from Philly but I I you know I could tell by the back and forth that I think that might be it playing against each other growing up or whatever it is but they they definitely have some ties yeah they are Philly guys and look is still laughing at go watch out watch out five for seven shooting and now six for eight at the line tell you what the game of basketball brings together all type of brotherhoods man and and they stay forever so its unbelievable to be able to have Applause those pack again got three rebound to Brown thats his ninth to go with eight points just another day at the office from Malik Brown B now thats a big one he got it and its a onepoint game Syracuse is hitting perimeter shots they are a different basketball team now you see the energy pick up on the other side of the ball popper itss the screen drowns out there to hedge Poppers off the side of the rim moroko keeps it alive offensive rebound and its pack with the Finish plus the foul what a tough player I mean probably wasnt the best shot by W it wasnt a good shot at all but Pat getting in there 6 foot look at him getting in there at 6 feet not afraid of the contact finishing over Brown thats tough and you know as much as he struggled you know for most part of the game hes come back and showed us what type of player he is a really significant foul to the fourth on Malik Brown and much as brown kept that offensive rebound alive for the Starling three earlier in the half Michael noo a freshman whos been so good keeps this play alive for Miami pack is a great free throw shooter cant finish the threepoint play scored exactly 19 points in the last two games hes at 19 today Sterling for minz and we are ti what an exciting game on both teams Miami Syracuse these guards are getting downhill and making plays its going to come down who can get a stop Kev who can get a stop a 10th assist for Judah minz as well good no call good no call Jose Miami

you know what he thought it was a broken play Kevin then he gets it throws the crosscourt pass hes not known as a shooter but he stepped into it and was confident and knocked that thing down Qui here Copeland how you doing just his sixth made threepointer of the season the Oranges first buzzer beat at home in seven years and look with Eric dandorf in the house fin out the last second three its only right of course you got to bring instagam video as well enjoy it young fell that doesnt come too often man enjoy that moment unbelievable he had been one for eight from the field before that shot

guys good luck cleaning that up in the Applause studio Kev what a scene from inside the Dome we got more Hoops action coming your way more orange coming your way whos been hotter than Dalton connect averaging better than 33 per game over the last three games a RedHot Alabama team on Rocky Top coming your way top of the hour with Jay Williams coach Seth greenber Kevin Connors here its been a while since that building has had that kind of reaction at the end of the game what did you see Jay well I mean I want to give a shout out to Syracuse here right because first off I mean quadir as all you guys are yelling in the studio quad here like was I mean hes made Big Time threes but I also got to give Jud men a lot of love here I mean I dont know if he finish the game with 11 or 12 assist but down the stretch man he just made play after play and after play and the last play heres what I dont understand if youre Miami you know theres going to be some kind of pick and roll with Mintz involved Blitz him Seth get the ball out of his hands forcing the player with his back towards the basket if you give him a soft Blitz here he can see the court and look off this what are you doing why you drop back stay up on it he makes a nice crosscourt skip pass game over and if you look at that that play right there youre going to youre going to seal and tag the roller right there on the left hand side we can see that again thats a long close out for Beverly you cant close out short you got to actually get in the air and contest that shot move on the air time in the pass he held on the tag just a little bit too long but you got to give credit that is a big time shot and an incredible find I mean like judan 63 what do you want to do heres the do Jay if I was coaching you and it was the end of the game Im going to put the ball in your hands Im going to say go make a play a first year head coach hands the ball to Jud toits the last four minutes of the game and said go make a play and you know what he had trust in him and you got to also say like you would understand youve also as a player right youve got to have selective aggressiveness you know selective aggressiveness I like that can we just show the play one more time please just like one more time no no no no because if youre Miami youre going to be so at at one point I just want you yeah if you can freeze I dont know if we can freeze it it but when he comes off this ball screen okay look he shows look at the big the big shows and then he gets back but you dont you do not apply and sustain pressure right here we go freeze it freeze it stay stay why are you dropping back when you stay youre having active hands you deter that skip pass but by dropping back he sees the angle I mean Kudos is the m making a pass but you cant leave him in that a what did you see Jay well I mean I want to give a shout out do Jay I was coaching you for Syracuse for the final show Kev you put it in juds hands you want to get
