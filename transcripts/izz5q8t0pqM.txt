you win the ACC tournament title you dont have to discuss any of this stuff and thats what these teams are here for to win an ACC Championship they are here to advance into the semifinals the winner will do that against Virginia tomorrow night Roger Ayers AJ decides Ted Valentine are the officials and away we go first possession belongs to the Tigers Applause a good matchup at the point Joyner guarding Chase Hunter this is PJ Hall better than 15 a game DJ Burns is on him turn around by Hall is short and DJ burns the Lefty had 24 points against Clemson one of the earlier games but its difficult for him to have to guard PJ hall because PJ Hall can step away he can play Pick and pop and draw him away from the basket if you havent seen state if you havent seen DJ Burns now as that goes down for turquion Smith and he makes an early statement in this game this Wolfpack Team all kinds of fun whether its Smith and Joyner in the backcourt OR burns the big fella in the middle Smith has yet to find a shot but he cannot make anywhere on the floor and when he gets hot forget it its video game stuff Applause and an early 30 lead for the wolf pass and Smith came in to the game against Virginia Tech in his last two prior to that hed been five of 25 from the field but thats but a distant memory after that 30point performance right back into Hall Burns got some help from Smith in the pack forced the turnover great Dig Down by turquavion Smith Joyner the transfer from Ole Miss a sixth year player along with the sophomore in Smith and just two Dynamic guards at both ends of the floor now this high low pass watch turquion Smith come digs down and goes after the ball knocks it away from PJ Hall and you had DJ Burns stay in between Hall and the basket to force the turnover you cant make DJ Burns play oneonone against Hall this is where its really dangerous thats picking pop stuff if DJ Burns helps on the ball hes got to recover too far to get out the PJ Hall thats whats Difficult about this matchup with Paul and then with Hunter Tyson as well all with 610 40 from three on the season Tyson First Team all ACC 41 from three on the season and speaking of Threes Casey morsel the second chance kicking it out for a three youre just not going to find a better chance to knock in the three Marcelli vastly improved threepoint shooter from where he was a couple of years ago when he was with Virginia on this three there and a pretty good look for Chase Hunter this team gets the ball down court so quickly long shot long rebound for join us and actually long rebounds give a little bit of an advantage to NC State they dont want to have to grind It Out Underneath against this physical Clemson team you dont have to watch the wolf pack for long to see the confidence with which they play but it Bears repeating Clemson beat him twice during the regular season to buy 14 at Clemson on December the 30th and then by 25 less than two weeks ago in Raleigh Applause Burns hes a lefty didnt get the call big fella but great footwork good hands and he has been a major Force for State this year Galloway unimpeded all the way to the rim and give credit there to Ian shefflin for screening off the health Defender to allow that drive all the way to the basket by Galloway Applause three minutes in the wolf pack by four Applause Smith draws the foul tough to keep him in front of you get your chest on him and he sold that call very well but you have to press up on ion Smith because he can shoot it from so deep and that gives him that first step to be able to get around you and thats a big loss for Clemson that is the second foul already on Brevin Galloway Brad Brownells had to go to his bench redshirt freshman Josh Beadle is into the game as the reverse goes for Joyner and Clemson is very very young in their second unit one of the reasons is theyre without an upperclassman and Alex Hemingway they want to win an emergency appendectomy a couple of days ago so he is out and its basically for the most part freshman Off the Bench for Clemson good old fresh screen up top to three Jack Clark for that pick and pop action and he can make that shot hes a good perimeter shooter that can really stretch a defense Clark getting the start because Greg Gant is out tonight suffered a knee injury in the win last night Ian sheffler who kept the toe down but its out of bounds in the back over to NC State Applause the wolf pack 239 on the season 128 in the lead and they come in as the sixth seed playing their second he gave it as many nights this is the first game for Clemson they got the double by being one of the top four seats Clemson does such a good job of staying in gaps theyre physical on the ball and they show you bodies not wood nice Up and Under move Burns couldnt finish it though still had to finish through the chest of PJ Hall thats not easy to do Applause when you turn your back on the inbounder sharkell Joyner is smart enough to take advantage of it he sees the Defenders back throws it right off of him comes in now I think you should get an assist and a bucket there that should be an assist or at least Chase Hunter should get a great play by jarkel Joyner by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times and Dave and Busters the best place to watch your team with your team because we mentioned a big win for State last night about the only downside was an injury suffered in the game but more heres Holly well thats right Greg Gantt went down with a very awkwardlooking knee injury to his right knee in the game last night and Coach Petes called this a big blow he had just really started to play very well for them hes come back for a couple of different things this this season playing 17 minutes a game he has been a big time blue guy for the Wolfpack he has been on crutches out here a heavy brace on that right knee and coach Keith said theyre not exactly sure the extent of his injury they were going to talk about getting an MRI but well let you know when we have more on that so Jay what do they lose without Gantt and what do they get or gain by having Jack Clark a former starter himself this year taking his place Well Jack Clark can stretch the floor which is not something that Greg Gantt does at 68 in a junior but Gantt is a really good Defender he can defend multiple positions he can switch out a good rebounder he had 10 rebounds earlier this year against Wake Forest and he brings a ton of energy over and back on Clemson youre going to see Ebenezer dewana play more in Gantz absence probably Ernest Ross whos about six nine another good energy guy hell hell need to do more you know nobody has to be Superman in gantts absence but youre gonna have to have players Off the Bench do more Music Ebenezer dewana has come into the game in the middle for DJ Burns for state to one I had 11 points five rebounds and two blocks Off the Bench a great effort last night I think DJ Burns there was putting on some sort of uh headband or something for his hair or something you and I dont have to worry about anymore thats many many years in the rear view mirror then Middlebrooks hit off the bench for Clemson sophomore from Fort Lauderdale again they are very young on the bench you know Ben meadowbrooks uncle is dont you who Danny Cannell oh right so Ben is not going to his uncle for help with his homework Beetle no and Middlebrooks the foul how do you evaluate the case of this team again we talked to Brad Brownell about it you know there are some teams who dont have those big wins but they dont have the troubling losses Clemson has some really good wins the two or three losses that kind of stand out on their resume which kind of you know two teams have similar numbers but ones got the better wins but also the troubling losses which case do you prefer the first thing you look at if youre evaluating two teams is which of the two do you think is better and if you cant answer that question then you go to the paper but Im not troubled by a couple of losses all these teams are going to have losses well what my thing is who can you speak and Clemsons proven they can beat good team yeah and look every Committee Member is going to vote their own conscience and the way they look at it all the votes are different I dont think the committee is necessarily of one mind but when I look at Clemson I see a tournament team I agree with it Tyson knocks down the three First Team all ACC Hunter Tyson almost 16 points per game almost 10 rebounds per game and with all respect to Clinton post of Boston College who was the accs most improved player I thought that Hunter Tyson should have been First Team all ACC and the accs most improved player he went from good player to Star but he is a bona fide star thats a complete player he knocks down threes he just hit his 77th three of the season with a little late pressure the averages just under 10 rebounds per game thats fourth in the league the jump that he made from last year to solid starter to First Team all ACC just you have to give that young man a ton of credit he has worked to be uh one of the best players in the league and one of the most respected players in the league remember he broke his collarbone last year two years ago took I think a knee to the face suffered facial fractures one of the best things may be the best thing Clemsons had going for this year is theyve had a healthy Hunter Tyson and a healthy PJ hall both of those guys have dealt with multiple injuries in their careers Joyner got his man in the air didnt he he is so good with hesitation moves that little juke move and the shot fake draw on the foul he is a player man Holly well Hunter Tysons not only terrific on the court but right top scholar athlete in the ACC um its of course named after former Wake Forest coach but he is a fourtime member of the all ACC academic basketball team hes got a 39 GPA with an emphasis in athletic leadership meta of the Presidents List and there you see him getting it from commissioner Jim Phillips before the game he is a terrific athlete not only that guys he has fought through a lot of broken collarbone a broken bone in his face this is a tough young man good grades great on the court what dont you love about Hunter Tyson wed love to see you now hoping to cap off his career with a trip to the NCAA tournament as Burns checks back in for State well to answer Hollys question I hear hes not a great dancer nobodys perfect wow pressing company excluded the things I have to say America didnt have to say it just kept me from saying it well back by six Applause oh the job Chase Hunter has done this year for Clemson switching over to the point guard position he was a guy last year with hunt his own shot now hes doing that hes scoring and running the team his seventh in the league and assists hes got a two to one assist turnover ratio and still averaging about 1314 points a game Music Casey Marcel back into the game as Joyner gets a breather Clemson started off the year 70 in ACC play they were 184 overall at one point got into the rankings took some losses down the stretch and now hoping to get hot here again late in the season but they got a tough challenge tonight yeah theyre the three seed and states the six nice spin move there by middle Brooks and hell hand to the line but I think this State team has won that every you dont have to watch a lot of them to say if theyre clicking they can blame just about anyone especially with their cards that guard Trio with Marcel Smith and Joyner those guys can make shots from anywhere but that last play when Middlebrooks caught the ball in the middle of the lane he got that deep post position the DJ Burns just has to stay between him and the basket if he pivots in there who cares if he pivots out toward the wing or toward the top of the key youre protecting the basket Hunters going to sit now so Hunters on the bench Hall is on the bench it is Beetle and Dylan Hunter younger brother would Chase in the backcourt right now for the Tigers theres a lot of hunters going on in the game hunter Tyson Bill and Hunter Chase Hunter its better to be the hunter than the Hunter Brad Brownell knew he would need some strong contributions from the bench tonight against the NC State team which in spite of some injuries this year has showed impressive death Burns you know if you dont like TJ Burns you dont like fun he is fun to watch well just the back down of Ben Middlebrooks and Middlebrooks did a good job just being physical with him and making him score over the top he made a tough shot over pressure Burns started his career at Tennessee and then came from Winthrop New South player of the year last year but either nice job by Smith to stay in front on that drive thats a pretty good look there for Hunter Tyson wont go and now hes got his hands full with the big fell again and Over The Back Jack Clark Applause CJ Burns 69 Lefty and he is a load down in the low post gives a little juke move goes back to that left hand and gets it off the glass nice move by the big fella just be into it again sending our best wishes to Kansas Coach Hall of Famer Bill self away from the team due to a health issue will not coach at all in the Big 12 tournament we talked about it in the first game tonight everybody around the college basketball World sending their best to Bill self for a speedy recovery not only one of the best coaches in the game one of the best guys wishing all the best to Bill self takes a little bit of time to get healthy Dan Schulman J Willis Holly Rowe NC State Clemson the winner will take on to Virginia in his semifinal here with the New York Life ACC tournament three misses for Chase Hunter long rebound bounces to PJ Hall and he got caught yep use the off arm Knocked Down Smith and gets called for his first this person and right now it is not going for the Tigers like it did in the two regular season meetings where they beat the wolf pack by a combined 39 points did you mention Ernest Ross a little bit earlier he is into the game for the first time now for the pack Clemson does such a great job look how their help side defense is loaded up they can turn you into a oneonone team well Burns is getting the shots he wants hes just not hitting them tonight a great save by shefflin and then BJ Hall came right back to the ball that could have easily been NC States ball and a 10second ball going against Clemson well the clock started when shuffling got in possession of the ball Applause so the fifth turnover committed already by the Tigers in just over nine minutes of action Clemson making catchers difficult for NC State and they still score Smith in traffic if you gamble sir quavion Smith can make you pay for it hes just a natural scorer hes got five state by nine their largest lead of the night theres a high low should help by Smith Applause from the elbow and hell knock it down Ian shefflin the sophomore from Loganville Georgia had an absolutely incredible game against Notre Dame on Saturday seven for seven 16 points six rebounds two assists and two blocks this is not a top 100 guy a threestar Prospect but a guy who seems to be getting better and better and Brad Brownell said part of their job is to convince him how good he can be so he makes Smart plays out there uses his body really well capable hashing ability yeah hes a capable shooter when hes open oh how pretty is that just spinning off the defense just a great feel of where the defense is playing him a little spurt here from the Tigers to get back within five Applause foreign ER thought about it puts it out misses it and back comes Clemson with late pressure by PJ Hall all for three got it and thats what DJ Burns has a tough time with that pick and pop action DJ Hall sets the screen and then Pops to the open area to the threepoint line thats a lot of ground for DJ Burns to cover so the size and strength of burns at one end and then the pick and possibility of Hall at the other Smith short Clemson the ball with a chance to tie or take the lead already on a 70 run Applause and Chase Hunter is fouled now watch PJ Hall the two separate plays here Ross gets on the high side and he just spins off to that righthanded jump hook along the Baseline here the pick and pop the screen Burns Hedges toward the ball and now he has to recover all the way out to the threepoint line boy that is a versatile big guy at 6 10 they can pick and pop from the threepoint line or take you down into the post and a guy coming off an offseason knee injury was on a minutes restriction early in the year Brad Brownell telling us it took him a couple of months really to feel like himself how about sheplin spinning finishing in time the game it could have taken that jump Urban instead just went to the back down thats an example of his using his body well hes not a a guy thats going to play Above the Rim but he uses his body and plays angles very effectively 90 run as you can see Clemson to tie the game Smith keeps the dribble alive follow wont go and its Clemson ball with a chance to push numbers Dylan Hunter yes time out Kevin Keats Applause Clemson just keeps grinding at both ends of the floor skilled big guys and you mentioned Ian shefflin just taking advantage using that body getting right into the defender and then Clemson with the run out a three on Two and a terrific take to the basket by Dylan Hunter Bernardi moved up even coming into this game North Carolina was first four out Dr Leonardis got him down on the next four out Clemson was next four out now they are first four out Arizona State on ESPN after this game tonight against USC if youre a Clemson fan youll want to see what the Sun Devils are up to Holly well in that last NC State huddle a couple of frustrations boil over team mate with each other and DJ Burns just saying coach Keats reminded them this is a game of runs basketball is a game of runs we went on ours they went on theirs everybody just settled back in well they continue to be on theirs a steal and finish for Dylan Hunter and it is now a 130 run for the Tigers and thats an example of Clemson and their Gap protection their help side defense is so good you know they play the ball they dont just play their man and the ball keeps them in good position on help side but NC State needs to get more pressure on Clemson on their defensive end thats how they won the game against Virginia Tech was through their defense they made shots but their defense is what set them up and when youre driving that initial Lookout the help is positioned hes driving into three Clemson Tigers there is nowhere to go and just really good hands by Hunter there to take it the other way and you know NC States not a team that turns the ball over a lot theyve got a really high turnover margin they only turned over like nine and a half times a game and a plus for a turnover margin thats one of the best in the country and the best in the ACC first of speed from Smith but a tough shot it doesnt come close and its back over to the Tigers Clemsons defense turns you into a oneonone team and you can get penetration against Clemson but it can sometimes be one or two dribble penetration and then youve got to spray it out and play out of it if youre gonna try to take it all the way off a dribble move their help sides too good and Kevin Keats told us this morning this is a tough matchup for them Jack Clark with a steal and lays it in thats a big bucket for State snaps the 130 Run really nice play by Jack Clark to shoot the Gap Greg Gantt out with that injury up and cheering on his teammates BJ Hall on the bench right now for Clemson middlebrooks up front with Tyson this is sheplin spins a little bit short Tyson The Rebound in some traffic and hell kick it back out Applause Middlebrooks draws a foul on duana Applause its a bit of a lazy pass just trying to get it back out for reversal and Jack Clark takes it the other way and Brad Brownell coaches tend not to like turnovers for touchdowns you cannot defend a run out you just make a pass fake and let the Defenders shoot the Gap and then make the pass Clemson an original member of this conference they have never won the ACC tournament they have made the final twice they are trying this is their first game here in the 70th edition of the ACC tournament 29th time it has been here in Greensboro you know the four teams that we had here for the nice nice session Carolina Virginia first and now Clemson and NC State all relatively close to bearing degrees here to Greensboro All have traveled well you see red and blue and orange and purple and everything in the building here tonight its fun Applause knocked away recovered by Smith back to Burns two big strong bodies going out one another and a play on and now uh Applause youre not kidding about two big strong guys Music Middlebrook sits Hall is back so a different challenge now with the defensive end for burns you have to expect the Clemsons going to go back to some of that pick and pop action try to move DJ Burns around Applause Tyson in the hole jump hook no shefflin in the right place at the right time kick out to Hunter for three but what a play by Ian shefflin such a good position rebounder and a wedge rebounder on the offensive end when he didnt have the immediate stick back hes got the basketball IQ to look out for an open threepoint shooter hes all over the place airs flying jerseys coming untucked Burns inside nothing much you can do there and when he spins off if you get on the high side of him if he goes middle at least hes going away from that left hand when hes on the left block Chaplin over a couple of Defenders for the basket first two games the Clemson and NC State played Ian shefflin had six points in each game against the wolf pack its amazing how far out Burns starts his move and how deep he can get this time the kick Joyner misses the three you know the tempo and rhythm of this game favors Clemson a little bit slower then than state would like its not so much the slower but theyre just making a guard in the half court instead of letting NC State get out in full court where theyre really dangerous Beetle turns it over Applause joyners so good with the ball he changes speed so well he dropped about a 20 points 10 assists last night against Virginia Tech now on the right side of the floor burns now he wants to get to the middle always wants to get to his left hand and Jay somehow always does get to his left hand crowd wants or the uh Clemson the uh State fans rather want to flop as well they dont get it but they do get the bucket for burns well the fact that weve seen a bunch of guys go down on some of these back downs and TJ Hall taking advantage there of DJ Burns Out by the threepoint line and that draws him away from the basket but the fact that they havent been called and no flop was was called either shows that you know the referees arent fooled they dont need this this Flop Call just dont call it foul on burns his second Applause BJ Burns is a load inside just drops that shoulder PJ Hall goes down then its a pretty easy score once your guys on his back hard to block a shot thats my experience anyway ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by principal when you take care of your team they take care of business and Shane can dunk an original movie streaming March 10th only on Disney Plus we got a good one here between Clemson and NC State the winter to advance into the semis to take on to Virginia tomorrow night coming up at the half its the AllState halftime report Rhys Davis see Reese Davis lafonzo Ellis say hi Fons High fawns and last but not least coach Greenberg they will tell you about the heels theyre done in the ACC tournament and youve got to believe their hopes of an NCAA tournament bid are done as well Duke into Miami winning earlier today well meet in the semifinal tomorrow night the Kings and the Blue Devils split their two matchups a narrow win by Duke in Durham and then Miami ran Duke out of the gym down in Coral Gables itll be an interesting matchup tomorrow night looking forward to halftime with responds and the coach but we have blown out the budget here at the ACC tournament and the Lions share of the budget has gone for hair and makeup especially hair for Rhys Davis you should see the amount people that first have to staple that to pay on to that head and then work it from there the amount of hairspray it looks good it looks spectacular yeah and if you want to hear about how good it looks say hello to Reese and hell tell you all about it well of the five of us hes the only one getting any work done on his hair in case youre wondering because from behind we look the same thats me thats him why were not taking advantage of the the nil space weve got up there is beyond me yeah we should do that yeah Lem should buy Six they trailed went on a 130 run very little for NC State in transition and Chase Hunters done a nice job on Joe Cleveland Smith Tyson down with a rebound in traffic off the Miss by Smith Hunter Tyson one of the best defensive rebounders in the country he gets about eight defensive rebounds a game last night by the way turquadion Smith 1113 tonight two for nine all faces up on dewana Applause and left it short nice job by Tawana he had such a good game against Virginia Tech at 11 points in that first half hes just so energetic blocked a couple of shots just a presence Applause boy Schmidt had Tyson on him elected to pass off instead of going Adam Joyner rejected by Hall that surprises me Smith can get by just about anybody and had a big guy on him but passed the ball away and anytime you drive youre driving in to help and that help is so well positioned BJ hall right in the middle of the lane you know Clemson just rallies to the ball everybody in the appropriate Gap Smith with his third field goal of the night State back within four he doesnt need much room does he any little opening and he gets up and gets that shot off so quickly its been explosive offensive player I dont think NC State is putting enough pressure on the ball theyre really not making Clemson as uncomfortable as they need to and a nice job by Casey Marcel there but he picked up the foul Applause and this is where Kevin Keats talks about the difficulty in the matchup either theyve got a guy like Burns having a Chase Tyson or Hall after the threepoint line or Burns is on the bench Jade theyre giving up some size down low well Clemson presents some really difficult matchup problems when they have PJ Hall and Hunter Tyson on the floor at the same time both of them can go into the post depending on the matchup guarding them and both of them can knock down threes between them theyve knocked down over a hundred threes on the year both are very good foul Shooters as well actually thats a real strength of Clemson theyve got four guys that shoot over 80 percent that play the most minutes they are third in the nation as a team shooting over 79 from the line and how valuable is that going down the stretch in big games Applause with gravion Smith went to the bench that foul his second so hell sit for the rest of the half Music action for three so when that ball screen was set by dewana Jack Clark was in the middle of the lane as dewana rolled out of it Clark just replaced up the lane under Tyson saying to one of the officials hes grabbing my jersey this is an incredibly physical team Clemson and they dish it out and you have to expect youre going to get some of it back and NC States giving it back Applause Hunter races Dylan Hunter races into the front Court Scott good speed Applause good passer how about that pass Champlin for three the assist to chase Hunter and Ian shefflin again is playing some great basketball here for the Tigers that was a 35foot hook pass Applause final minute of the first half Clemson to buy a half dozen same play again that roll replace action deep one for Clark and it goes thats six points just off that one play that one action and Brad Brownell will take a time out here to set something up at the end of the half we talked about the value of Jack Clark who transferred in from LaSalle Jo hes knocked down two big threes to make it a one possession game these days it seems like everything is vying for your attention theres roll action so all the defenses go into the roll shefflin recovers but Jack Clark replaces up so they call that roll replace action with Clark being the replace guy and NC States run that twice in a row and Clark has gotten two threepoint shots off and nailed them both and those were really big shots for NC State to make this a one possession game Clark started the first 15 games of the Season before suffering an abdominal injury in a game against Clemson actually missed 10 games now that Greg Gantt is out Clark back into the starting lineup tonight Clemson basically could hold right down to the end here a one second difference between the game clock and the shot clock Applause Chase Hunter down to 10 backstream ball screen Galloway finds Hall called with a hop step and is called for the offensive foul so now NC State he bobbled it here thats why they didnt call the walk but a good job right there by Brian pass to take the charge and now just under four seconds and you can dribble it a couple times and get a shot off Joyner does Music as the first half comes to a close good competitive first half between two good teams here with Clemson leading 393650 for Smith and Joyner last night still doing well but a little more in check the field goal percentage down put a bit 17 in the first half Holly threes and then everybody in the lane and Hunter Tyson does a nice job of relocating and Casey Marcel has a long closeout they knock down another three but Clemson thought they shot 54 in that first half but they didnt get as many shot attempts as NC State because they turned it over eight times and a foul on DJ hall right off the bat here in the second half as we check in with Holly Kevin Keith kit using the word fight weve gotta fight were not fighting for position were too far behind PJ Hall is hurting us inside our guards have got to fight theyve got to put more ball pressure on the ball he just kept talking about theyre just not fighting hard enough particularly their defensive positioning lets see if they can get it a little bit better right now Ollie thank you a significant foul the Third on Hall and Brad Brownells has to take one of his scars Jay out of the game right away here in the second half and without PJ Hall on the floor Clemson becomes less versatile offensively Ben Middlebrooks comes in and hes more of an interior player hes not going to be knocking down threes so all of a sudden DJ Burns can stay in the middle of the lane nice touch there by Chase Hunter to extend the lead to five as Hall is now relegated to the role of a cheerleader on the Clemson bench again big picture for those around the country may not be all that familiar NC State seems safely in the tournament Clemson although they are the three seed in the ACC theyve got some good wins but a couple of losses that jump out on you Joe linardi right now has them out of the field in the first four out as Hunter knocks down another one so a win over NC State a third win this year over the wolf pack would be extremely meaningful for the Tigers well you can see Chase Hunter with those two buckets after halftime the second one coming in transition after a sloppy turnover by NC State and what do you do to stop that once he gets into your chest knocks you back doesnt matter whether youre as strong as Ben Middlebrooks you take that kind of jolt its hard to Hold Your Position he is now five for nine DJ Burns and Jay I think all nine of them hes gotten back to his strong hand it was lefthanded with his size hes going to get going the way he wants to get going you play against anybody like him not quite like him no Hunter again the only guy I played against like DJ Burns was probably Jim Smith of Ohio State playing pro ball in Italy when he took him a while to get down the court he was older but when he did boy he locked you down and theres a little added element to his game the first a little Fade Away jumper off one leg for DJ Burns and he is keeping State close and how about the bumps he was taken from Ben meadowbrooks when you talk about physical Applause Big South player of the year a year ago at Winthrop his coach was Pat Kelsey is now the head coach at Charleston theyll be playing in the tournament theyve won over 30 games theyre going to be a tough out they shoot a ton of Threes And they play a really fast tempo Jack Clark had a couple of big threes in the first half for the wolf pack Im so impressed with Clemsons defense good cut and how about a nice pretty bounce pass from Burns and stayed within three and because of the spread floor and thats part of the value of Jack Clark in addition to his rebounding hes a very good rebound but hes the best rebound of year hes ever had as a college player shefflin had a big first half and Middlebrooks fouled by Burns and thatll be the third on him Applause while DJ Burns posting up on the wing in just a quick 45 degree cut by Jack Clark and look look at this I mean you kidding me thats a lot of contact there looks like a sumo wrestling match and after that call on burns Kevin Keith stood for about 10 seconds with his hands on his head and you could see him thinking to himself what do I do what do I do and at the last moment he called dewana sent him to the scores table so Burns will be coming out of the next whistles and that whistle is now so Hall on the bench for Clemson burns on the bench for state both coaches trying to buy a little time Brad Brownell trying to buy time before he can put PJ Hall back in the game all standing up just so you could try to stay loose a little bit Tyson yes when he when he shoots it from the catch spot fits down I mean hunter Tyson shoots over 40 percent from three just about 50 from the field and almost 85 percent from the line talking about an efficient front Court player thats him and how about the 31 Point 15 rebound effort he had in the first one of the year over the wolf Fest hes had 15 double doubles on the season been about as consistent at a high level as any player in the ACC let alone any big guy Smith and Middlebrooks has called for the foul North Carolina State overall has done a pretty good job on Hunter Tyson he hasnt had too many openings but this one after the screen by sheplin on the ball reversal you shoot it from the catch spot its down and the bench loves it remain Miami and Duke of the first semifinal tomorrow and then to Virginia against the winner with this one so the Virginia coaching staff whos still in the house here Jay doing a little bit of scouting what did you like about the whos performance against Carolina I thought Virginia was just so good on the offensive end they got in that mover blocker offense and theyre cutting and passing was immaculate and they were able to get into the paint they outscored North Carolina I think it was 2820 in the paint and it seems like you know North Carolina should have the paint Advantage but with the passing and cutting and the play of Reese beachman and Kihei Clark is really impressive by Virginia to get a second win on the season over North Carolina played Without Ben Vander plush who unfortunately broke his hand in practice yesterday done for the season and got very capable minutes from both Francisco caporo and Kaden Shedrick up front Galloway hoists it up with five on the clock and is down to dewana and the pack pretty good pressure on the ball on that possession by NC State didnt think of the first half they impacted the ball as much as they could have but another turnover a couple of sloppy turnovers even though you know North Carolina States shooting 75 percent in the second half theyre three of four you cough the ball up you dont get a shot off and that was really in large measure the difference in the first half it was eight to four in turnovers in favor of NC State and thats why NC State had more shot attempts even though they didnt shoot as good a percentage as Clemson did they got more shots and Clemsons basically gone five minutes now without PJ Hall he picked up that third foul 14 seconds I think it was into the second half and they have extended a threepoint lead to six with one of their stars on the bench sheplin fights to get it off but it rolls off the rims nice job by Jack Clark just to stay between shuffling and the basket and just forced a difficult shot oh a tough pass away even if dewana catches it whats he gonna do with it Applause not having nearly as much fun tonight as he did last night Applause but he shot some deep ones last night I mean it wasnt even a Logan lets put it this way the referees didnt have to go to the monitor see if anybodys foot was on the line on a three there was no doubt yeah its whether the heels were on the low yeah exactly it would be an over and back violation before it would be a foot on the threepoint line well and you could see it was just one of those nights where they just knew the ball was going in you know kind of like Clemson had against NC State a couple of weeks ago sometimes you just had those nights turn around off the rim for Chase Hunter and to want to dabble the rebound a nice block out by Tijuana Applause cell with a quick release from the corner cant hit it and Middlebrooks wraps up the rebound Hunter being aggressive had it swatted away but there for the follow is RJ Godfrey and its the largest lead of the night for the Tigers Clemsons got some goodlooking freshmen RJ Godfrey his dad played in the NFL Randall Godfrey he was a linebacker for about 10 11 years in the NFL to gravyon Smith now three for 11 good look here and it goes for Dylan Hunter great ball Movement by the Tigers and Kevin Keats wants another timeout okay the turnovers and poor decisions by NC State against Clemsons defense have put the NC State Defense in a bad spot the closeout and then a great kick out by Godfrey to a wide open shooter all right Clemson feeling it right now and stretching out that lead foreign Music by New York live UCLA and Oregon have already advanced to the semis Arizona Stamford are playing now and again right after us tonight here on ESPN yet a USC and Arizona State as we have mentioned the Sun Devils are a bubble team so lets say youre a fan of uh oh I dont know Clemson youll want to stick around and watch Arizona State to see how they make out tonight its its all about rooting for your team Jay rooting against some others if you want to see your team get in Applause yeah they could work by Ben middleburgs down in the low post that was chest to chest lets go to Holly well guys very positive NC State last title coach Keith trying to infuse some positivity in his guide saying hey were fine were fine but weve got to get stops and weve got to rebound them not rebounding has been a big issue we talked about going into some Zone here well see if they do it but hes trying to stay positive even though theyre down big right now thats going to be a little tougher after that Ben Middlebrooks with a bucket its a 100 run for Clemson and Middlebrooks has really fought DJ Burns at both ends of the floor around and out for Clark and what a rebound by Hunter Tyson well thats what he does hes one of the best defensive rebounders in the country you know an NC State some of the turnovers have really set NC State back in this second half middle Brooks for three left it short Burns back into the game for State Hall remains on the bench for the Tigers NC State trying to make something happen off the very first action they need to get a reversal how about the minutes middle Brook shes giving them yeah just a really poor pass though by Van Smith you have to pass away from the defense not just to the offense and Middlebrooks was able to break contact and get around knock that ball away just a lazy pass for NC State our turnover and a run out for Smith youre not going to catch him Smith thought he might have been fouled by Hunter but a big bucket for the Wolfpack NC State needs some more stops like that and here they go with a little bit of Zone 23 theyre going to bring the wings up a little bit so the corners are a place you can attack in the short Corner Godfrey staying behind the defense tough catch by Middlebrooks four to shoot I dont know if he knows it Godfrey did left it short but they get it back Applause the pass stolen away by Clark and again its Smith on a run out for a bucket where your half court defense Victor Clemson has been so good and then a couple of turnovers and NC State gets layoffs and plays ahead of your defense and a little change of momentum here after going Zone turquavion Smith a couple of buckets and NC State trying to fight back into it got it down to single digits defense turning into offense for the wolf pass down by nine a lot of time left Five Guys between eight and eleven points led by PJ Hull who was on the bench for over nine minutes picked up a foul 14 seconds into the second half Brad Brownell sat him down and probably if you were to ask Brad probably sat him down for longer than he thought he would because Clemson played so well in his absence the NC State turned the ball over and the turnovers have been a problem for the wolf pack in the second half those shots those are shots that you dont get but one thing PJ Hall when hes if hes on burns defensively hes got to play low and give himself some leverage you pick up that third foul just being stupid too straight up and down and NC State can have stayed with this Zone Applause Tyson got free of Clark but amidst a baseline jumper father got a little bit when he went up Im surprised that Tyson didnt take it a little bit further toward the rim all covering Burns and again each of them with three fouls bounce pass again in traffic the Joyner cant finish Joyner had 10 points in the first seven minutes of the game none since when you cut off a DJ Burns one he can hit you with that pass but also if he doesnt that clears the area for a double team and he can go oneonone in the post Applause oh turn around yes thats where hes dangerous in the middle of that zone he can turn and make that short shot he can get out and set a ball screen against the Zone then pop out third Team all AC sheep DJ hook Applause tough one as Smith got bothered somebody reached in on him threw him off balance a little bit on the drive well he and Chef has given really good minutes to Clemson in this game nice pass and Hall will go to the freethrow line take a look at PJ Hall here against the NC State Defense down in the short corner here and hell just as soon as he theres a little exchange he flashes into the middle brings up the middleman but he can make that shot not every player can operate out of the middle of the zone and thats one reason Jim behind played it for so long notably that foul heres the fourth on DJ Burns so he sits again dewana comes back in DJ Hall is in the top 10 in the ACC and field goal percentage shes 54 percent he knocks down 40 percent of his threes and hes hit 33 of them on the year and he shoots over 80 percent from the line and thats an efficient big man plays hard his played for their injuries in his career describes him as about the most happygolucky guy youll meet didnt look like he avoids the weight room either put a good combo up front between him and Tyson Applause drop coverage and that means its a tough two good rebound by sheffler a touch for Hall doubled and fouled and when you reach in on Hall Casey Marcel came down to dig down you really have to go in there with two hands and just try to grab the ball if youre just going to swipe at it youre going to hit some arms no foul totals for both teams you can see three on state two on Clemson here in the second half and weve got less than nine minutes to go Applause good look in the corner a little pin in screen by PJ Hall to free up Galloway Applause he talks about it more of a Clemson Pace in this game and its been that way most of the night Marcel now and its not that Clemson doesnt want to play fast but when they get here they take away your transition youre going to play five on five in the half court and their Gap protection is excellent and they played fast there and Galloway knocks it down the assist to chase Hunter and again its the largest lead of the game for the Tigers up by 16 on a team that scored 97 last night against Virginia Tech this is just a tough matchup for NC State yeah you know it really puts a ton of pressure on their front board and Clemson now theyre in a horn set back to mantoman Clemsons such a wellcoached defensive team boy theyre getting anything they want right now the tigers are rolling sheplin has been outstanding in this game six foot seven inches tall a sophomore from Loganville Georgia hes physical hes an outstanding passer and Clemson now in transition Chase Hunter does a great job at getting into the paint and then kicking it back and shepler shuffling excuse me out from the threepoint line he showed every facet of his game in this one start in the Pac12 Steve bulgerowski with Arizona pulling away from Stanford Arizona total way late behind the strength of their front Court following to Bellis have combined for 44 points well Tom Green Lets go to the big 12 rough and rugged game here between TCU and Kansas State look at that live up to Kohls takes it in pump fake all right jumps over the phone uh the the Yellow Pages Ill give you all right and still gets it off sounds like Jay billis is vertical hey now first of all Yellow Pages coach boy are you dating yours were all dating ourselves I guess fun books my vertical was measured in sheets of paper 19 point lead Clemson Jay they have had three different runs of 10 or more three doubledigit runs 130 and a couple of tenos look at this work from Middlebrooks I mean just playing volleyball up on the glass just second and third effort by both Chef Lynn and middle Brooks and really Clemson has had great contributions Off the Bench and I think they think theyve just about shut out the NC State bench but you know Clemsons gotten really good production off the Pine Middle Brooks has been great Dylan Hunter has had great minutes tonight three to three eight points just a second made threepoint over the season tonight Applause very impressive performance after the first four or five minutes of the game or Tyson gets rid of it in a hurry as this one rims out that goes from a shooting pocket to up in a hurry doesnt it Marcel nice little bump creates the space and it goes in I dont think Chase Hunter thought it was a nice little bump Im comparing to the summer those are not nice little bumps those are collisions Applause and a nice drive in the finish by Chase Hunter Im so impressed with the play of Chase Hunter snooped over to that point guard spot just seamlessly how about that block from behind by Hunter Tyson boy they are playing well at both ends theyre doing everything well right now spin oh you got grab yep well to your point Hunter Tyson coming from behind the hesitation by Smith as he was trying to go through the Chester Galloway just wiping that away before it could get to the backboard Hunter Tyson cant say enough about the senior from Monroe North Carolina just a complete basketball player hes gotten better every year you know worked hard to be a consistent score and start as a starter last year to being a firstteam allconference player Applause and you talk to Brad Brownell about him as we did earlier this morning and hell talk about his voice and his leadership and how hes a connector on this team and Brad Brownell has done such a nice job with this Clemson program hes got over 400 career wins now both these coaches Kevin Keats and Brad Brownell were they coached at UNC Wilmington and Coach him to the NCAA tournament and then Brad Brownell went to Wright State and he was a pressing coach back then how about Ian shepler another terrific game and terrific might be understating it had one against Notre Dame on Saturday and now having an equally good game here tonight against the Wolfpack I dont think theyre going to have to convince him anymore how good he is I know I think he gets it what a turnaround here in this game NC State led by nine early in this game after this sheplin bucket we have seen a 33point turnaround as the tigers are now up by 24 lets send it to Holly a lot of people are calling Ian shefflin The X Factor for this Clemson team and since he came into the starting lineup when they went to this big lineup hes really settled in and gotten comfortable he admitted that last year could get thrown in the game and it would kind of freak him out he didnt always know what he was doing but he knows what hes doing now his last four regular season games he combined for 36 points shot almost 70 percent and he is very comfortable out there hes been a huge Factor today and I mean that this big lineup is making it hard for NC State to get clean looks a terrific couple of weeks and with each passing minute on their way to their third win of the year over NC State we talked about a big picture again thats what people are talking about here in champ week theyre a bubble team Joe lunardi moved them from next four out to first four out earlier tonight theyre in there got to be in its not even a discussion they ran before and theyre in now another quality win here four minutes and 20 seconds away for the Tigers I mean you know but this is all fun to discuss but Id like to hear some Committee Member explain to me how some of these other teams are better theyre not Applause Brad Brown Elders is his 13th years the head coach at Clemson if they get into the tournament it would be the fourth time they get in under him Galloway followed it up and its fouled 355 to go you wont see it yet but boy hes got to be pleased Beyond pleased with his teams effort there are all kinds of products in this world theres exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times well here in the last quarterfinal of the night early on and Kevin keeps his wolf back at a 2011 lead theyve been outscored 6128 since and you saw that coming into this game their two most lopsided losses of the Season were to Clemson its now going to be three the Tigers have had the Pax number every time theyve played and Brevin Galloway knocks down these two free throws Galloway started his college career at Charleston where he played for Earl Grant then went to Boston College and now having the best season I think of his career at Clemson Burns spins to the Baseline double teams and its Clemson ball five starters are on the floor right now for the Tigers as Galloway lays it in Brad Brownell still barking still coaching at some point you know hes going to look at the bench and probably get all five of them out of there theyre gonna have another game tomorrow Applause Virginia by the way Pete Clemson in Charlottesville by seven a couple of weeks ago Brian pass with a baseline jumper well if I were Clemson I would think long and hard about putting some full court pressure on Virginia and not not full court pressure to speed him up but actually full court pressure slowing down take time off the clock and then youve only got to guard their stuff in the half court for about 15 seconds or so its going to be a slower Pace game no matter what when you play Virginia and you might as well use some full court pressure to your advantage not for everything you want to know about whats gone on all day and night here in Greensboro the place to turn is over on acc Network the nothing but net crew is getting ready Kelsey Rich Joel Berry Thomas Hoosier Luke Hancock ready to roll Carlos Joel are texting each other right now thats how Duke guys and Carolina guys talk to each other theyre not allowed to speak publicly so no eye contact yeah Music Carlos Boozer won three ACC tournament championships in this time at Duke and he was named the most outstanding player of this tournament his junior year Joel Berry also named the most outstanding player when Carolina wanted an ACC Championship a few years back uh Carlos Boozer and trajan Langdon have wonderful arguments over who is the best player ever out of the state of Alaska its pretty good uh pretty good to be in that conversation thatd be a spirited debate Kelsey Riggs is the one with the hard job oh absolutely the victim scoring leader out of Alaska right now though guys I hate to break to you its Alyssa peely shes the Pac12 Player of the Year from the University of Utah so Im going to throw her name into the ring as one of the best players ever out of Alaska well done lets get around that tux chain Applause Laughter State ball with 227 ago you surprised all the starters are still in the game maybe a little bit but you know this is Clemsons first game of the tournament and so keeping a little momentum before you you pull the plug well you want to avoid it somewhere where a guy gets hurt obviously but Tyson will go to the line foul on Ernest Ross of state so NC State will finish up the regular season 23 and 10 and away their fate on selection Sunday they seem assured of a bid so Brad Brownell yeah taking his starters out Applause Brad Brunell has his arms around Chase Hunter right now and Chase Hunter played another great game I mean hes been great in ACC play hes averaged about 13 points four or five assists and four rebounds at ACC play but nine or ten assists in this game not very many turnovers if at all just a really good four game by an outstanding player nine assists one turnover to your point tonight that is a nine to one assist turnovers sure Applause Ross a little strong number three will be an interesting matchup with Clemson and Virginia tomorrow night again in Virginias without being vanderplas so itll be Cafaro Shedrick and Gardner those are the three big guys two will be on the floor at any time for Virginia who will be tussling with the likes of Tyson and Hall all right Applause Marcel splits the defense and will go to the line for two its gonna be fun tomorrow Miami Duke in the first one and then Clemson to Virginia in the second and that means top four scenes right chalk into the semis we were all talking about how crazy it was going to be weve got seats one two three and four advancing you know how close this conference has been you know this robot for folks outside the league who may not know Pittsburgh went into the last day of the regular season if they had gone down to Miami and won they would have been the one seat by losing they were the five seed thats how close it was for the top five or six teams in this and they only lost by two points down at Miami and I got knocked around pretty good by Dukes today Duke getting better and better by the game right now well if they knock in you know anytime you have 27 assists and knock it what did they knock in 12 threes or something if they shot the ball ridiculously well and Tyrese Proctor gets better by the game all right looking over at Brad Brownell hes got to be very pleased with the way his team has played not only all season long but especially tonight you know where he went to college no DePaul not to Paul De Paul you know who else went there no Brad Stevens not a good coach Applause Brad also played high school basketball with Calbert Cheney now I wonder who got more shots yeah so he wasnt the leading scorers Laughter nearing the final minute here an impressive performance by the Tigers and a win that you got to believe and I know their fan base has to believe is going to be enough to get them in regardless of what happens Beyond tonight another quality win for Clemson and I Godfrey nice pass Wiggins for three Applause Music Applause to one a big Collision got the worst of it with Middlebrooks as we are into the final 30 seconds on the semifinals of the ACC tournament are going to be fun and the referees trying to get in the way of some of the players make sure that everybody keeps their cool as this thing ends up and dewana not happy with the Collision that he had with the middle Brooks middleburgs not happy with gawannas reaction to it the games been physical all game long the gay to Miami Dukes going to be fascinating the last time they met Miami really gave it to the Blue Devils Duke clearly is a better team now than they were a few weeks ago Miami the one seed in the league and theres the first smile of the night finally got it in the last minute of play me and his team have earned it earned one smile congratulations youre in the semifinal and you get one smile and now the second unit will come out and the WalkOns will come in for the Tigers now I think there needs to be a change in NCAA rules that land deep bench players the WalkOns get into the game that they dont have to dribble out the clock that they get to play that its not bad form if they take it yeah exactly I would actually vote for extra time Music youll now see Jack Nasi Matt Kelly Devin Foster all checking in for Clemson and Ill see brothers from Dayton Ohio and Daniel Nassif was a manager before being a player and nobody works harder in basketball than basketball managers if you are an employer looking for great employees hire a basketball manager shot clock turned off well see if somebody gets a shot up here for Clemson and if they wont take the job hire a commentator because we always have tenuous job security in our current positions looking for work thats right well work for food you call will answer they will let the clock run out what a performance by Clemson tonight down nine early they win going away by 26 and beat NC State for the third time this season pick up their 23rd win of the season and move into the semifinals so to date with a two seed to Virginia tomorrow night here in Greensboro and to quote Jim Boeheim after Syracuse beat UConn in that six overtime game are we in the tournament now
