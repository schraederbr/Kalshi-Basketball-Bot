love for more than four decades and Cameron theyre sitting just under the Baseline here first game that Mike shazewski has attended since retiring Duke is wearing the Coach K Graves as they call them gray as a nod to his days at army to Gold signifying the gold medals he won as the head coach of the USA Basketball the Fighting Irish in the dark uniforms and philipowski didnt get fouled didnt make the basket and Dukes up two nothing not a surprise to see coach Shire get filkowski going early seven times hes been ACC rookie of the week with that Virginia Defense sort of vexed him though the strong move at the end that has been discussed and cussed at least among Duke faithful on the better part of the last few days good Cuts in the basket with chesky gets fouled and hell go to the freethrow line Notre Dame knows Duke is going to switch one through five with Derek Lively on the floor because he can guard and bust up ball screen action so if you move the ball and you cut hard its a great back door cut on the weak side by the chefsky when they we mentioned in the open 33 against Virginia Tech hes an excellent freethrow shooter at 86 percent Music twotime team captain against the Fighting Irish on the board the Irish just 2 and 12 in ACC play as Debbie mentioned off the top the last time they were in camera in front of no fans they got a 9389 victory its their only victory in the last nine tries against the Blue Devils and Machesney has his first two of the night and were even up the Duke lineup is a familiar one full of freshmen in addition to Jeremy roach who has just been Sensational 99 points over his last seven games in the Fighting Irish showing a little Zone threequarter court pressure back into the zonekowski two for two to start the game for Duke Fighting Irish home with a bit of a tweak to their lineup is JJ Starling the McDonalds AllAmerican is back in the starting lineup my great feeling that he functions a little better getting things started early but now when Lubin is in as well he is a freshman out of Orlando and philipowski pulls away the rebound Notre Dame going Zone on make man on Miss right now defensively her name doesnt foul much then turnovers have been a thorn in the side of this Blue Devil offense but Notre Dame doesnt Force many of those among the bottom 12 or so teams in the country in terms of numbers of turnovers scores and Jeremy roach gets his first bucket which means if you move the ball and you go side to side youre going to have opportunities if you think get a piece of the pain and kick you should be open to be an up the line defensive effort Marcus Hammond the transfer from Niagara loses to handle momentarily but Cormac Ryan had a big game for the Fighting Irish won here a couple of years ago we had 28 that night and now hes got three taking advantage of that switch you know quarterback Ryan can shoot the three one of their better threepoint Shooters five percentage for Notre Dame Applause is noted for its defense but they have the Blue Devils deep in the shot clock for Lebowski for three Applause the Irish get the rebound its a little bit coming up with it moving to 68 freshman this is his third s hes averaged 12 points in the last two starts they need some size against Duke on the glass Starling drives fortunate to retain possession as Hammond gets it and the left he puts it down the transfer from Niagara who played for former dew point guard Greg Thomas during his time there puts Notre Dame on top by one the ACC logo area open against the 23 Zone phillipowski strong but he cant get it to fall Hammond has the rebound and its had a little trouble with the handles a couple of times but hasnt had a turnover yet Ryan feeling it more Matt Ryan wide right and itll be out of bounds and itll belong to the Blue Devils there is Mike gray winning his coach in Notre Dame history stepping down at the end of this season its been a tough year for the Fighting Irish and Fabray his team won 15 ACC games last year but this year a lot of those close wins have turned into close losses and Notre Dame has dropped seven of its last eight of course gray was insistent here at Duke for eight years one of the reasons that Mike shazewski is in Cameron tonight to watch Duke in the Fighting Irish Mike cisevskys first time in Cameron watching the Blue Devils live score Brady helped in the six final fours and two national championships at least to continue to come and say goodbye well show you the fabulous party gift that Coach K gave him during practice is Hammond now has four Notre Dame as a threepoint lead I think Duke was willing to honor great during the game in front of the crowd and Mike Thriller would have none of it down low and Derrick Lively now 35 of his 46 field goals are dunks all right Mickey shezewski happy with what she sees on this Valentines Day night the shishevskys in the house to watch the Blue Devils in the fighting irons here on super Tuesday away from DeMatha and Grace says thats where everything really started for him in terms of his career and it has been a fabulous one twice taking Notre Dame to the elite eight and the cusp of making the final four in fact Debbie Mikes last National Championship team in 2015 lost four games all season two of them were to Mike Green another game they almost saw them again in the final four he would have had an opportunity to I should say is Friday hours came up just short against that Kentucky team that was undefeated until the final four in 2015 made a nice run through Greensboro for the ACC Championship Applause is just one of ten on The Seasons threepoint shots and Wow Mike Bray often encourages his team to play loose and go ahead take a bad shot that might be Van Allens quota of the bad shots for the night heres Hammond hes been off to a hot start Tyrese Proctor had it for a second and Jacob grandison the grad transfer from Illinois picks it up Applause Lively off the window we watched Lively working out today working on that very move but he catches it that deep in front of the rim it is really tough to stop the seven foot one post player inside a couple of times had 10 points on Saturday against Virginia and his return after missing the previous four games he really helps stretch the floor offensively you have to guard him now that has been Alvin lubins game there you go thats where he should catch it thats a quality catch for him in the paint where he can make a play so the Irish off do a good start here trying to hang in against the Duke team which has lost his last two following its victory against Tar Heels in this building about a week and a half ago here is Whitehead from the corner a contested triple Dane Goodwin there on the catch hit a couple of corner threes in that Virginia game in the second half he was rated as the number one small forward by espncom coming out of high school thats a good fracture in the off season it slowed the development at the start but when hes been in he has been terribly effective and Dane Goodwin into the game and into the box score another quarter three this time for the road s almost picked off the pass headed for Cormac Ryan Applause Notre Dame is going to make you guard for a great majority of the shot clock and leslachesky just fires The Hop but generally speaking theyll get your feet their games move quickly because they dont foul already were headed toward the 12minute medium its clean they dont turn it over they do take you deep into the clock they get into the second and third options offensively remember those six graduate students on this team theres an older veteran group that know how to play you mentioned that ACC area just inside the foul line where you tried to attack that zone that Notre Dame was in that time I think Granderson might have had an opportunity to be sort of stumbled a little bit on his catch in there if he made the cut inside a 13 all game inside 12 minutes to go heres Hammond again from the Baseline Hammonds another guy he injured a knee in the offseason in the preseason rather that set him back a little bit they brought him in to give veteran leadership maybe because JJ stalling a little time to develop and hes starting to play his best basketball hes averaged 11 and a half over his last eight and Notre Dame might not force turnovers but theyll take unforced ones and thats really what that was in the Irish the 1137 Mark with a twopoint lead how about Derek Whitehead knocking down the three can you over help you pinching the paint he can stretch that D what a great start for Blue Ridge Whitehead Purdue black history storing telling and coverage stream to Black History always collection on ESPN plus that is a fascinating it is coach McClendon Renee Smith Basketball Hall of Famer you hear a hear a lot of stories and about 10 20 years later Applause games like Mississippi State slipped out of the state to go play Loyola because they were permitted to play and integrated games with this is a fascinating one between North Carolina Central and Duke and one of the forefathers of the fastpaced offense which Duke was trying to run on its own then Applause one at 33 on Saturdays only points coming in the first possession with free throw line and hell get called for the charge third turnover for the Fighting Irish Applause well coming up next on ESPN well take you to Gallagher IBA Arena Jalen Wilson in number five Kansas taking on Oklahoma State and you better watch out for the pokes theyve won five in a row one of those teams that are sort of quietly surging as we hit mid February and ready for the top 16 reveal and get closer and closer to selection Sunday we were talking about how hard it is to win on the road in the big 12 before the game virtually impossible Phyllis I think coined the phrase there is no bottom from the big 12 there are teams who might not be a topic standings but theres no real bottom as philipowski scores he has a half dozen after his scoreless afternoon against Virginia on Saturday tile back to his normal form in the early going and hes JJ Starling his return for parade softly Granderson clears it away and Granderson steps into a three Applause trying to scoop the game up a little bit coming off the timeout theyve extended their pressure theyre looking to score quickly in their transition game Goodwill fade away happened on that shot hes got four both of them on similar looking shots Applause good win Upper Arlington Ohio right outside of Columbus its got a brilliant career for the Irish you know hes played more games in a Notre Dame uniform than any other team see it and be it and dukes back on top his second trip had his ability to stretch he brings more depth hes a very good Defender Applause now hes set up his ability off the bounce next time he touches the ball I bet he gets a piece of the paint oh Goodman didnt realize Philip housed he had fallen down and had a clean look in the midrange Whitehead makes him one shot and roach has it to initiate the offense for the Blue Devils this is the versatility of Duke on the offensive typically been the point guard right but Proctor is taking on about uh 70 percent of the offensive load on the top of the floor which gets the roads off the ball right now hes playing the point has really been scoring near theres another turnover for the Blue Devils thats four of them and Notre Dame really doesnt Force many as we mentioned nailey Force about nine a game theyre over halfway home we usually Notre Dame wins that turnover margin but against Duke they win the margin on the glass thats where it could balance out yes technically almost halfway home but were not yet at halftime so theyre on Pace to be above their average its called on Lubin I mean look at that thats green and to Ryan who opens up Ryan young opens up the floor for filipowski and then the skip over the top of the Irish defense Whitehead doing his job outside the ark knocking down shots Applause you know one of the things John sire told us today a shooter and I was he blocked away Whitehead brought the motor the energy the Readiness to the Virginia game he said he sold him on getting minutes well he played yetos and solid game offensively win not a lot of guys did roach did a roach hit seven of 11 from the floor which both 30 Duke has a threepoint lead Applause its a great slip but a better rotation defensively to disrupt that play defenses Applause he gets past Starling but the help is there for the Irish Tyrese Proctor into the paint called battered around and for Matt Ryan has it for Notre Dame Applause Irish a good threepoint shooting team theyve made just one of seven so far staling the strong drive but couldnt finish it the only place pushes to Rose rose gets inside young with the offensive rebound and young cuts it back Brian Young is shooting nearly 75 percent and ACC play largely because of the high percentage shots he takes Music notary really has a floor spread they got twoman side over here with the cheski there he goes back door brought down to five but he works North Carolina made it from Charlotte and Blue Devils have it again up five theyve scored the last seven young thought about it from the top changed his mind Roach will not change his mind young with another offensive rebound Applause lets see if they can get what you see going on this set right here Reese theyve got Dukes not switching right now see if they can get something in the middle ball screen middle third of the floor right here and scores Dane Goodwin snaps to Drought for the iris he has a half dozen really good execution by Notre Dame Applause I think everyone got in touch that time a little high low Goodwin got a hand on it Beyond his able to finish and draw the foul Brian Young is just wearing out that back row whether its zone or on the glass against man the grand transfer from Northwestern out fights Goodwin puts it in youll have a chance for the threepoint play when you come back to Tampa as you got to find trans and not go underneath on that handout dude 15 points a game 42 for three over the last five Creightons one seven straight meanwhile set number 23 NC State at Syracuse just 44 on the road to wolf pack for quavion Smith finished but Ill tell you when everyone says the accs down dont tell NC State case hes down theyre looking for their 21st win tonight back to Reese and Debbie stages to game and a half out of the lead by the way Debbie was not pleased to find out they were a one point Underdog tonight its not a Blockbuster on Saturday four oclock Eastern time Baylor in Kansas last two national champions college game day will be their twohour Edition starts at 10 AM and Duke will be on the road against Syracuse as North Carolina state is tonight that will be at six oclock Eastern time Applause I think the Irish could use fonzs help on the glass right now and Seth youre all over on Smith I love it could be the ACC Player of the Year Trey wurtz missed the three will get a fresh 20 on the shotsky couldnt handle it and he gets it and young whos been everywhere in the first half in his first six minutes of action Ryan young has six rebounds not to mention four points and he did just get the foul but that was awesome foul going for Louis ball and after a productive few minutes Ryan will take a break Young on the offensive glass working that weak side during those productive minutes and Blakes almost able to pick Hammonds pocket Applause and theres a call that you see more and more and its fitting that the first time I really mentioned the officials tonight on February 14th it was Teddy Valentine making that call hes here with John Gaffney and Raymond Steins second foul on wacheski good call by Teddy V Happy Valentines Day teddy Valentine if you dont tell me every day every every day is Valentines Day because daddy Mitchells got a ride at that ACC spot in the middle of the Zone cant get a shot off Jalen Blakes will get a shot up and hes wide right lets see if Mitchell can get something going here defensively thats when he really is on his game I think he has an incredible motor hes got the Goodwin matchup right here then he gets the switch for him and Hammond has it knocked away and take it away now Blakes is ahead of the field blades with a wild shot gets it and saves it to Ryan and David just wasnt able to get himself under control and make a strong finish he looks at a couple of opportunities in transition that they have not completed detail that I was talking about earlier not over complicated but the Finish First Place Cormac Ryan who hit a three Earl hes now just one of three and the Irish are one of nine from behind the arc good threepoint shooting team typically but so at the moment theyre making about nine threes a game two in the ACC but its a two possession game and basketball is about minimizing your mistakes and taking advantage of your advantages in numbers and size and length and so forth Duke hasnt been able to pull away theyve missed some opportunities in transition and their offensive rebounding has been the difference Coach K seeing a Duke game for the first time since John Shire took over Devils up by five oh Seth you know we were talking to John Shire about it you hate to continue to belabor it but I really thought that John handled that entire situation with the utmost maturity look they they got back theres just no two ways around it it wasnt a misjudgment call or something like the hold in the Super Bowl this was a missed rule you know and those are the ones that that are the hardest to live with but hes handled it with you know with I think maturity and said he told his team we had a chance to beat Virginia on the road this shows what the ceiling is on the upside for this team so take it and use it as fuel as opposed to you know sort of wallowing in the fact that they had a bad call go against him good kick from live way to Roach into the corner and he cant hit the three neither team exactly is setting the world on fire shooting right now Iris had just one of their last eight Henrys just to button that up I mean John Shire is a no excuses no excuses coach no excuse player he said he got into his guys pretty good in the locker room after the game about turning the ball over and about playing on the road and how they had a chance and they did want that call to just be something that ended the way they went about their business oh with nine points after that bucket the Irish normally 37 percent threepoint shooting team theyre shooting 10 percent The Reef Whitehead meanwhile made all three of his Duke has his biggest lead in The Irish get one on the board Im the Freshman Ben Allen lugan but you know right now well look at this later on Leonardi has Duke on the nine line how would you like to be a one seed and see Duke with a healthy very quiet more mature and seasoned phillipowski after a while as good as hes been all year in scores immediately on cue he has eight thatll thatll be a tough second round matchup tough first round matchup for whoever the eight would be in the eight nine if it were to hold that well all the way to go into it lets see whos coming out alive and I think Dukes depth is getting better I think their productivity Off the Bench is better theyre getting healthier glad we can do that after shots at The Rim thats a heck of a finish Inside by JJ starling he just weaved his way through that Bluegrass you got to throw it almost off the shot clock widely around the rim shot facing philipowski goes in strong and tiles into double fingers Blue Devils up by eight hes carried a heavy load for Duke All Season the freshman philipowski Lively Applause there it is into the fifth row but you know what he usually doesnt do that Rhys he usually blocks it into their transition game Applause watch this play right here its a great curl by Goodwin but theres the Eraser at the rims you would get every block shot that live has had this year earlier today there it is to your point that hes 57 into their transition game 30 retained by the offense it just speaks to how much control he has and why hes so important to Duke on the defensive end Duke has an opportunity for two for one quickly that may have gone by the boards by now by now is Notre Dame making the tough though hes spending a lot of time in that way Lively cant get the jump hook to go the one thing that post players need to learn is where they are in space on the floor and I think thats something that lava is going to continue to work on because he definitely has a half hook with both hands we saw it today and shoot around all right Notre Dames going to try to get the final bucket of the half will be back in 30 seconds it has been an expeditious first half 205 seconds remaining Notre Dame has the ball down eight only six fouls called the entire first half on both teams combined Mike Briggs final season as a Notre Dame head coach back where he was an assistant for eight years to Cameron baby is in the crowd with my autograph on his head by the way although its perhaps theyve you know used some type of ink removal by now Applause Irish event trouble shooting the ball with 37 just one of 11 from behind the yard and with fouls to give Jalen Blakes is in there reaching heres the baby which is ubiquitous that babe you might have had today or where that baby gets to go in the uh nonbasketball season it camps out in kville of course those tents are gone Carolina game is midseason blates hits the deck pops back up about five seconds Duke still has fouls to give here now so they can make it extraordinarily difficult on the Irish to get a shot up thats just the fourth team foul of the first half down 53 to go Applause Trey Wurst the Charlotte native Id make a direct pass to the block if I could add a bounce play Brooks gets it to Starling instead of Proctor chasing him and Stalin gets to the bucket and got it on the rim but he wouldnt go and well go to halftime as the Blue Devils have an eightpoint lead Applause Mike shazewski returning to see the Blue Devils play for the first time since his retirement and John shires team is now up by eight time now to send it to Kevin lafonzo and Seth back in the studio for the Jeep halftime report Superior aunt though Reese I think is a disrupter for Duke because I think he changes the way they play and makes it more challenging for Defenders at other teams a whitehead hit all three of his threepointers he was the only Blue Devil to hit a threequarter themes Rich trouble was one of 11 the Irish have to put one up to beat the shot clock in Marcus Hammond cant find the bucket the Blue Devils will have it after a good defensive possession Duke had nine assist on his 13 made field goals he mentioned the struggles that the Irish had from behind the art company turnovers in the game weve hit on a lot of these things and Duke sort of settled in after a while Notre Dame had to lead a couple of times changed defenses to try to disrupt him and theres philipowski whos up to a dozen now the game slows down Notre Dame can stay in their Zone I think its their preferred defense against Duke and when they miss they do get in there mantoman they did that in the first half Applause Music Applause crazy ones if he didnt already know that he shot an air ball last night JJ Starling The Freshman a little too hard out the window and here come the Blue Devils a chance to push that lead roach almost turned it over Applause he has 14 71 can catch it on the Block and score catch it in the high post and make a play Its the quality of the catch for Kyle filipowski inside that Shire system 92 seconds in Bray needs a timeout trying to hang in the game Music disrupter Reese when I say that I mean hes an emerging skill set and talent he could stretch the floor hes capable outside the arc he can put it on the bounce he defends inside theyre switching mantoman he can guard one through four if hes a disruptor because I think hes going to change the way Duke continues to evolve on a positive trend Applause coming down the stretch of the Season it seems as if the blue Devils ceiling is extraordinarily high as Goodwin goes past philipowski and has a chance for a threepoint play what a dang good one its 66 backing down 71 taking philipowski to the midline Dane has been in double figures just one time in the past three games after he had a string of 10 straight in double figures and with that is still sitting on eight Applause Blue Devils by 10 Tyrese park for the freshman Eric Lively 13 on the shot clock no baskets 33point game Saturday against Virginia Tech Louisiana Debbie just two field goal attempts his two points came on a couple of free throws in the first possession of the game and they just picked up his third foul Applause working on Trey works take philipowski right down to the block again the good one on him I love that twist action in the middle third of the floor Applause knocks down to three Mark Mitchell his first points of the game in first three for anyone other than Whitehead for the Blue Devil before thats an incredible part of his game if he could Elevate that alive we Swatch it off the board Here Comes Duke in transition roach pulls up and Cormac Ryan snuck up behind him and blocked it heres luceski for three buckets that block shot with Lively is what Im talking about into their transition game you got to make a better decision you get numbers you have to be efficient offensively in transition oh slip past the Lively the kick to phillipowski and he couldnt finish it point lead for Duke here come the Irish AJ Starling loses the handle gets it Trey works Works hit it up the side of the rim and itll be Duke basketball Music team this is some Mitchell boy if that could be and then the block by Lively off the glass not into the fifth row the chesky doing a nice job in transition pulling up in getting his feet under his shoulders Kevin you mentioned Mitchell adding that to his game he shot a good percentage this year but that was only his 14th made three of the year but the percentage has been in the mid30s all season trying to get it in the block to Avenel and Lubin they pass it out of bounds seventh Notre Dame turnover of the night Music Notre Dames not very deep in fact only rice plays fewer bench minutes than do the Fighting Irish theyve worn down late in some games too and Lawson close ones close games did they won a year ago when they won 15 ACC games in a couple of games in the NCAA tournament theres Mitchell going strong and Teddy Valentine has a block Mitchell will go to the line John Shire told us today he wanted Mitchell not defeat not to freeze up just go play hes done that in the early moments here in the second half Music and Allen field house for Kansas and Baylor the last two national champions a little bit of a slow start especially in conference play for the Bears and somehow despite being in the top ten its almost as if theyve been decided Applause turning for Scott Drews team they won the first matchup against The Jayhawks return engagement Saturday afternoon Mitchell makes both free throws Whitehead returns mashewski by the way that last foul that sent Mitchell to the freethrow line was Nate Sports so as if Notre Dame didnt have enough problems now theyre most potent offensive weapon is on the bench with four fouls lets go to 16 minutes to play Music Tyrese Proctor Whitehead like that corner three quick close out by the Irish Ryan young very productive in the first half she continues here in the second hes got a half dozen Ryan young was two for three in the first half with six chords and four points hes filling it up in that five spot but he did it in six minutes too Debbie that was he was cleaning up the window while he was in Applause Music the first season with the Blue Devils after a question four match Ryan Crocker is all over him and theres another one Ruben gets it and puts it back in on the second shot weve been doing work inside the physical freshman from Orlando hes got six now hes been in double figures in the last three games hes played two of those coming after missing a couple games Im looking at the combinations that John Shire puts on the floor and I think John Shire is an excellent play caller by his Personnel right away Applause Im liking the way Whitehead is developing and I really like Mitchell on the floor with him because of his motor can you imagine what thats like in practice I gotta get in there and see them all over Ryan Notre Dame off the scramble gets it to the bucket and drops us out that was called him philipowski its his second when I asked John Shire today at shoot around what he was most worried about her the last thing that he watches on film when hes prepping for Notre Dame he said their ability to make shots six graduate students they can experience well theyre switching man to man with their High hands and their ability to move their feet has been outstanding Wednesday night seven oclock the new number one team in the land Alabama on the road to take on Tennessee Crimson Tide coming off a victory at Auburn on Saturday and Brandon Miller back in his home state lead the Crimson Tide against the volunteers crazy crazy atmosphere wasnt it yes it was and it will be again on Wednesday night speaking of teams who could put a lot of different combinations and a lot of different weapons on the floor Nate Oaks can do that with the Crimson Tide but theyll be sorely tested by that great Tennessee defense and a volunteer teams lost a couple of Heartbreakers with weight hopefully pleasure beaters Ryan with the Hip Pocket on jointowski draw his little contact from Whitehead Valentines got the Block its the Reeds first person so as Dyer and as hopeless as it seems for Notre Dame in terms of shooting hasnt been there tonight theyre two of 15 from three shooting just 34 overall Cormac Ryan has now cut it to single digits Ryan who had 28 in the Irish victory in Cameron didnt go the last time they were here a couple of years ago but there was no one chanting air ball at him because the arena was empty well how long do you keep Nate lasheski on the bench for those four fouls as long as it stays within two or three possessions if you can keep it there and take off some of that time while youre trying to dig back in it its gonna have to be on with your defense Applause grandison in and theres Ryan young with another rebound he finds Granderson who missed the dunk but he got fouled on his way to the Bible Ray expressing his dismay so second foul ball on Lubin oh yeah Anderson hasnt shot a lot of free throws this year but he hasnt missed any either hes 13 for 13 now Bray didnt like the call I cant say that I blame it now it looked like all bowling I didnt think he got him on the followthrough but sometimes you get a great freethrow shooter and ball does lie and he gets the two free throws anyway Applause 4433 Duke up by 11 heres darling down the bar what a move gets to that Rim uses his body to protect the shot blocker from behind game again nautical Pace favoring the Irish and just havent been able to knock out a lot of shots Whitehead Mitchells going to try another three and Wertz has a rebound for Notre Dame is Notre Dame to put a little game pressure on Duke if they could score here and Whitehead bucks works on his drive its to reach second foul how about that drive from the McDonalds AllAmerican JJ Starling I mean its a good job of playing off that lube and Screen getting the switch Ryan Young and taking him to the basket using his body look at that stretch Jeremy roach is going to get a break as Tyrese Proctor turn for John shires team Jeremy just with four tonight what a tough shooting night just one of eight he is really been playing well all around particularly offensively and shot the ball well its 16 on 7 of 11 shooting against Virginia at a 24 game against Carolina in here Starling again tipped up by Louisville cant go Clark from almost lost it out of bounds and it looks as if he did and the Irish have it back great Hustle by the Irish keep the ball alive quick trigger by Goodwin timeout for the Blue Devils theyre just hanging around a sixpoint deficit for Notre Dame were back to Cameron in 30 seconds its way back into the game you see the Irish just refusing to give up coming up with the loose ball and turning it into a three earlier today at practice Debbie I was talking with Cormac Ryan veteran guard for Mike Grays team and Cormac said you know the narrative around this team 2 and 12 in the ACC five games under 500 overall as it were defeated that we you know feeling sorry for ourselves for giving up he said I havent seen that and said weve had plays not go our way and he pointed out that last year they won a lot of the close games that they havent been able to make the final plays this year but he said hes seen no quit now so far as Notre Dame makes another Scrappy hustle play McCormack has been right on target with his his perception of his teams effort Notre Dame with the ball down six as we go inside the 12minute mark no question they are accelerating through their sets theyre switching up their defense theyre staying with Duke on the glass they dont turn it over theyve minimized the mistakes inside this game they just havent made enough shots but theyre on a run right now three works of Fade Away Andrew Anderson clears it away they have come up with six turnovers from the Blue Devils now Duke has turned it over 43 times in the previous two games with Notre Dames not as defensive typical forces a lot of turnovers but the Irish extra boost her name has it again Applause to replay that has missed his two shots in the second after a perfect first half good win oh how about this soft touch you might have gotten a Little Help from the basket interference either way it went in exactly and its now a fourpoint game as Goodwin has 13 and the Cameron crazies awakened from their Slumber they need to attack the pain not settle for a jump shot here look to be aggressive Applause so 34 on the shot clock and Duke will have to get one quickly and theyve got a couple of offensive weapons returning with Jeremy roach and Kyle phillipowski coming back Blue Devils has been almost five minutes of game time without a field goal Applause philipowski for three offensive rebound fresh 20 hell shoot that is a big time board on the weak side situational offense their Baseline out of bounds plays there are atos after timeouts have been very good its the kind of bucket you expect from your captain votes the leader of his team not the biggest guy with the offensive Rebound in the bucket now the Miss from Ryan who has had a tough shooting night now hes one of seven one of five from the high in the armor Applause and hes fouled I dont know for a second he wasnt going to get that call either but but he got that but second one on startling how about this play from the captain Jeremy roach he goes way up for this sees his advantage and then a little fade away in the paint good offensive board for a point guard about that veteran move to sort of vaulting off the Freshman JJ Starling with the offhand make sure he couldnt out the truckowski now has 15 unlike all that middle ball screen action that Duke runs I think thats very challenging to guard when they have the right Personnel in there and that twist action Im talking about is when they screen and then they restart Applause what is it about that thing that makes it particularly difficult to go I think most teams are in drop coverage in that and you certainly would be in drop coverage with Lively because hes not a threat to shoot it but it opens up the space on the floor and it gets them to the midrange to the elbows where they can make place and roach makes another play with the steal hes in the open floor he puts it up and Mike Bray is going to use a timeout the Blue Devils answer with a six nothing run to breathe a little life into the crazy his strong suit offensively right now I mean its a great following transition no doubt about it a couple of Ducks tonight for Lively and a couple of block shots as well look between him and Ryan young if they can get somewhere between 16 and 12 and five block shots or Ryan young is very good at rotating the draw charge thats pretty good out of the five position well over about 75 percent of his made field goals have been flushes this year Goodwin trying to back down Proctor fade fire and fill it up again dang good when hes using that one I didnt know Dave Goodwin had the Barclay back down in his game Applause Goodwin has been desperately trying to keep the Irish in and hes got 15 Applause my boys coming out to set that screen Debbie was talking about now the high pass that wrote saved and Goodwin Goodwin had it and was on the line but I think John Gaffney is going to say that Duke knocked it out of bound Music how do you think that view is over there for coach Kelly for the first time in Cameron watching what goes on in here hes showing the replay and the crazies are reacting Coach K stoic arms folded thats what you have to do you know he he has been intentional about giving John shires face and Shire said you need space glad to have you around her all the way yeah thats Proctors first bucket of the night you dont need space Coach K your names on the court you could come whenever you want sit up here with us if you want sometime thats what John said is that he can sit anywhere he wants including right there by wheres the Ninja report Applause blue been working hard on the boards but Proctor comes away with it for the Blue Devils inside eight to

fans seeing Pittsburgh wearing those home whites for quite a while in the tournament and further they finish first or second Dukes going to get a third fight at the Apple on this possession Applause this is where johnshire essentially has two point guards on the floor Applause and philipowski is going to be called for the foul thats three on him Shire displeased Applause the second bump is displacement thats a foul all the officials are doing are adjudicating the rules novel concept no thats not nice thats a flagrant one on me luceski returns playing with the four fouls Notre Dame down 10 and they need him hasnt had his best offense at night hes one of three from the floor as Dukes done a really good job on him defensively limiting his opportunities Applause Goodman meanwhiles been exceptional he spins his time to the left hand move instead of the fade away wow brilliant Goodwin with 17 points hes only missed two shots hes eight of ten from four coming off the bench well he said they wanted to start stalling tonight kind of get him going and Goodwin veteran guy comfortable in any role and I was uniform milcheski gets the rebound and another name Ill give him this they just wont go away that might be one coach Shire might look at on now tomorrow okay were gonna look at this one too Goodwin has plenty and just when it looked as if the Irish were about to get blown out theyre back to within five Applause at least on him hes got to go into the paint Roach off the back iron made a strong move inside Goodwin has scored the last 12 for Notre Dame Works tries to get a couple of Camp Proctor and Notre Dame gets back very well and Tyrese didnt have any numbers he does have filipowski with it Whitehead passed to Phillip honesty for the layup great look from the Freshman to the other freshman to replay Applause Applause scoring stream going good win make it the last 14 for the Irish and a chance to have a threepoint play Dave Goodwin Off the Bench tonight for Notre Dame six points in the first half look at what hes doing here in the second with his off hand Music he has a chance to score his 23rd Point Deb is season high is 24 earlier this year against Lipscomb career high 27 hes done that a couple of times hes got just under five and a half minutes to get there and the Irish will probably need him to to have a chance and its a fourpoint game this is the kind of game pressure that you want to put on Duke and make this young team have to execute right and start thinking hes lost two in a row and had a chance to put him away blue Devils undefeated at home this season good winning Lively are tied up theyll call the jump ball itll stay with the blue guys only a handful of teams only five power Conference teams undefeated at home Duke is one of them Applause heres that fight you were talking about that Cormac Ryan was saying about this team this doesnt look like a defeated team at all it doesnt look like a 212 team in the ACC either they are really connected on both ends of the floor tonight against Duke shot clock at five little powski down the boulevard easy one he now has 20 points after that scoreless day in Charlottesville threw down the lead to six supermind he hasnt practiced the last couple of days hurting his ankle on that play at the end of regulation against Virginia hes got great footwork back on the Block this time working on Granderson see what movies got this time to fade away again and it goes down again a season High 25 per day in Goodwin John Shire wants to know whos going to guard John Dane Goodwin 11 of 13 from the floor has struggled tonight Cormac Ryan has struggled tonight and Dane Goodwin has just put the Fighting Irish on his back and Waking Up The Echoes of some good days gone by for Notre Dame theres not a bad seat in the house theres one bad seat if youre behind almost seven foot three Pressler and to catch some Duke basketball and all of a sudden you wind up behind almost peeking around him but at least she was giving him bunny years 5652 its been the dang Goodwin show for Notre Dame and Tyrese goes in and gets his second bucket of the night just four points pushes the lead back to six Goodwin has Notre Dames last 17 points and the Irish turn it over well thats the kind of execution coming off the timeout that I was referring to earlier about John Shire an excellent play caller ATO sets up a great play with multiple options and Tyrese Proctor does a great job turning the corner Applause four minutes to go in Cameron Indoor same set Proctor too long off the rim scrapped for it and guess who Dane Goodman said everything else he might as well get the rebound Applause its got to be for good one right got to ride the hot hands a season I25 just two off his career high shot clock at 10 space guarding good one now the lead for wachesky and its blocked by philipowski great defense by the Duke freshman s been held to one field goal on four attempts tonight after scoring 33 against Virginia Tech on Saturday weve hit the threeminute mark Blue Devils with the ball in a sixpoint lead Jeremy Rhodes to the bucket with a Twist clear out one side excellent execution really hard to guard way worse driving on philipowski and scoring Applause its his first bucket of the night the first one by anyone not named Goodwin in a long time for the Irish Applause Notre Dame back to the zone Applause good call by Mike Bray great pass inside phillipowski misses it and a foul is calling inside and if its on with chesky hes done Applause you know what I know youre going to think um I think thats a patient Whistle by John Gaffney the ball went in I dont think the foul would have been called Im not a fan of that though if its a foul its a foul call it its not dont watch the delay here you yeah I think it was a foul okay yes Mike Brie begs to differ I believe but thats the end of the night for lacheski he came into the night Debbie was a foregone conclusion he was one basket away from 1500 points for his Notre Dame career and one basket was all he got fouls out Five Points made a couple of free throws and its been a tough night for the big fella Applause got a lot of Great Moments in Notre Dame uniform this has been a tough season for them boy what a turnaround for Kyle filipowski oh defense had his number as they do so many young players and so many veteran players for that matter but tonight especially Biggs Maurice when youre playing against Tony Bennetts assistant because youre theyre always going to double the block owski now with 22 and the Blue Devil lead is eight and Notre Dame is going to need some offense and Lead it in a hurry if theyre gonna finish here heres Starling down middle and he cant get it to go another opportunity for the Irish Cormac Ryan for three fivepoint game just his seventh point tonight Applause Music Irish a little pressure in the back court Applause I like philipowski here Bowski pops out now hell drive on move and spin to the basket its blocked by vanellen Lubin 90 seconds to play in Cameron startling for three hes got twopoint game Applause full court pressure by Notre Dame they just got to get a stop right here the sideline and John Shire wants a timeout with 111 to go and Mike Brays last trip into Cameron indoor arena as the head coach of the Irish they are putting the fighting into the Fighting Irish tonight 25 made threes coming into the game a 30 threepoint shooter JJ Starling with a huge triple here late the last time the Irish were in this building just a little over two years ago cormack Ryan who just hit that three went off he had a career high at the time 28 points Apprentice hub with a shot clock winding down he had 15 in the game Irish had their largest lead of the night after that one Duke got close but Wendell Moore Jr with a Chance late and Notre Dame came out with a 9389 victory a much different atmosphere this time of course that was two years ago no one in the arena tonight Cameron crazies got comfortable a couple of times but Notre Dame just continues to stick around poised mature veteran did not get rattled never let the game really gets separate bro theyre really Duke separate from them they came back with a great punch and Dave Goodwin is the guy right here down the stretch for another game whatever the led by as many as 14 in the second half right now their lead is two as we hit the one minute guard Music Jeremy roach Jeremy will go to the free throw line I love that said backtoback ghost screens and Jeremy roach turns the corner hard to the rim roach just three of 12 from the floor hasnt made a three tonight but salvat free throw shooter at 74 percent hes made both of his tries tonight and Lively and Mitchell waiting at the scores table for defensive purposes to substitute in Applause never again Blue Devil Captain hes got nine theres the substitution you referenced Debbie great shot blocker Lively returns Music Allen rolls out in Notre Dame with a three could tie the game and off to starling Reuben tried to set him a screen Notre Dame running a top hits really high lets see if they can find Goodwin Applause makes it a onepoint game Applause what a take thats why youre in McDonalds AllAmerica thats exactly right its who you trust in these situations as a coach about a five to six second differential in the shot in Gamecock Applause I love that passthrough action the Notre Dame content to play it out here Deb Mitchell for three in the corner a huge three the first and slightest reaction from Mike shazewski whos watching Duke play in person for the first time this year how about the Lefty lining it up and knocking it down you absolutely help off Mark Mitchell on the strong corner now thats a concept some dont but in this situation how about Mitchell hitting the biggest three Im guessing of his Blue Devil career its his second one tonight and it makes it a two possession game with 108 seconds to go and that might have been the finishing touch you need it tonight youre definitely playing the analytics there Rhys I mean most teams dont help off the sort off the strong side corner but its Mitchell in the corner who is a 30 threepoint shooter for under duress to be able to make that shot wow you mentioned earlier he hasnt attempted a lot of them but boy that was a gargantuan one from the corner as soon as were done number five Kansas on the road at Oklahoma State Cowboys have won five in a row Jalen Wilson and Company trying to set up that Showdown with Baylor to come in with a win Kansas gets the Bears at fog Allen on Saturday afternoon every game in the Big 12 this year seems like it just an absolute battle to the Finish much like someone surprisingly this one has been tonight Applause so Dukes going to try to make Notre Dame use up some of that clock and they have put a few tenths of a second back on Notre Dame will have 11 seconds to work with down by four you got to make Notre Dame come back to the ball you gotta make them work here dont give up a three darling to the bucket again and the tip in from Ruben 39 to go twopoint game now theyve got to foul quickly and Cormac Ryan wanted to jump ball but John Gap hes going to call the foul on it first foul on Ryan Tyrese talker this is his first trip to the free throw line tonight Proctor has been an excellent freethrow shooter making 39 of 45 87 percent coming into the game he makes them both that should wrap it up for the Blue Devils hes got a cool demeanor about him his maturity and his confidence level you can see it growing on him each game officials looking to make sure the time is correct oh just a few seconds remaining in this game here gives us an opportunity to give you a reminder that we hope that youre able to help the people affected by the earthquake in Turkey the American Red Cross you can donate now at redcrossorg ESPN as you look there that is Dukes Stanley Borden who is a native of turkey and Stanley has organized a 78 kilometer run on East Campus tomorrow 78 due to the magnitude of the earthquake in Turkey his family wasnt directly affected thankfully but so many people were in such a terrible tragedy and Stanley is done a great job already organizing and raising money a ton of donations have come in and a lot of people across campus are part of that run tomorrow and family Gordon doing his part to help people who have been devastated in its native country almost icing the shooter since Proctor standing at the free throw line they gave him half a second so Debbie itll be three seconds and Proctor has been in that key area for a while there are those is they dont go in there until the later if theres some type of delay lets see if it bothers the Australia so three seconds be like three actions so for Notre Dame three actions Reese catch dribble dribble shoot maybe two dribbles here if you can catch it at Mid Court its water in the van four point lead four Dukes Starling and thats how its going to end the Blue Devils remain perfect at home but man oh man did the Irish give them a fight and Mike gray winning his coach in Notre Dame history more than two
