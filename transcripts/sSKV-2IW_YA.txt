game I think its going to be really important for him to see the ball go through the hoop early in this game Chase Hunter wears number one for the Clemson Tigers you see this is the 167th meeting Clemsons wants two in a row and 14 of the last 16 and Wake Forest has not won here at Clemson since 2009 nine straight home wins in the series and the Tigers owned the opening tip you got two very good shooting teams here uh you know I bet not withstanding what I said about Chase Hunter just a second ago but uh both very good offensively tigers are 47 from the floor as a team they shoot the three well 40 on the season Mike thats second best in the ACC the shot clock is down to four in the opening possession Hall in traffic lost it on the way up heres Appleby immediately to the rim and he was challenged by Hall and the outlet Hemingway yeah hes a break all by himself when he wants to be really fast with the basketball youve got to pay attention to him in transition Hemingway was reaching for that basketball and picked up the personal foul first on hemenway you see Appleby number one the ball is going to be in his hand a majority of the time and hes made a big impact leaving the conference this early on in scoring and assists saw the substitution as Beetle comes in a couple of turnovers on their opening possessions for the Tigers Brad Brownell amazingly in his 13th season Mike alltime leader in wins in the school history his team wants to run calculates the angle the tigers are on the board a great aggressive start for him I talked about making baskets are really a good drive and the thing too hes got Appleby guarding him so try to get him into some foul trouble challenge him to defend Chase Hunter averages over 15 points per game as Mike mentioned as the leading scorer so far this season for the Clemson Tigers shot clock at 10 for weight goes out of bounds off of Hildreth but it will be off of the Tigers hes a righthanded player but showing the ability to you know to go right fake left get inside good penetrator good guy and also to look for and Wake Forest Hildreth he has really made a big jump from last year stepping on the end line going the other way Monsanto ran out of real estate thats Santo thats a trimmed down version of Monsanto yeah 30 pounds hes lost from last year was really a guy coming back from amazingly coming back from his Achilles injury in one year but that the weight loss is going to help him there as well it was in May of 2021 that Achilles injury for Monsanto who averages almost 10 points per game Applause well hes been on minutes restriction coming back from that dislocated kneecap but uh how about against Penn State 22 points in 25 minutes of action he was also eight of 11 from the freethrow line Mike and hit both of his threepoint attempts for PJ Hall a little bounce off Beetle elevates to grab it Music Tigers six and two start the season 50 at home the win against Penn State on Tuesday thats a turnover Galloway out of the corner third turnover of the half Galloway is the one portal guy that uh Brad Brownell has brought in its amazing you have to you have to recruit the age in your roster as much as you do the Freshman these days so the Tigers have connected on both of their shot attempts so far Wake Forest is over three from the floor as close to losing turning the ball over theyre efficient Hildreth Applause Monsanto to Fall Away picked up by Hall Chase Hunter crosses it over right into hildren it falls but its an offensive foul on Drive heres the look and this is a tough thing to do in Hildreth in in Retreat and a guy with a full head of steam be able to make that play and thats whats gotten him starting and on the floorboard that Hildreth has always been a very good offensive player now Steve Ford likes what he does on the defensive end of the floor as well so Chase Hunter with that personal foul to the bench for Brad Brownell and the Clemson Tigers Cameron Hildreth making his fifth start of the Season hes a doubledigit score as well over 12 points per game Applebee off the glass set in for three every once in a while the backboard is your friend oh Tyree Appleby graduate student from Jacksonville Arkansas with his 17th made three of the Season he shoots 46 percent to lead the team from Beyond the yard all the turnaround did not get the kind bounce get in good position here early Marsh is a big party to go up against Marsh just checked in for Wake Forest and thats kildren a little bit of touch on a floater near the rim he shoots 53 from the floor and uh since his start hes averaged 15 points in those four starts so really responding to that role but uh you could see the jump hes made from last year Tyson a little show who was defending thats the thing Wade can throw some big bodies theyve got some good depth on this team and they like Carr out on the floor early to start games because of his defense foreign Tyson at the freethrow line for Clemson lets take a look at tonights forward keys to the game with Mike jaminski about the fact that Clemson is one of the most physical teams in the conference so theyve got to match that in this game and how about for Clemson take a bite out of the Applebee yeah well I would love to say I came up with that our crack staff came up with that graphic well done Ill never Ill never Ill never cheat I learned that early at Duke and it never really never take credit for something its not your work great to be alongside Mike jaminsky in our outstanding production crew here in Clemson South Carolina its the opening night of conference play of the ACC after finishing off the ACC Big Ten challenge the final Edition and thats Carr in the paint and Clemson choosing at least early on to go oneonone not come in the double team with him he had plenty of time to operate in the post midair contact Dylan Hunter hit the floor and your brother Chase Marsh is wide open for a Wake Forest ripped Bender miscommunication on the way back and March that first of all nobody had Appleby and then nobody had Marsh inside the force went on the road on Tuesday beating Wisconsin 7875 shot 54 percent of that winning effort Applebee right towards our broadcast position there is a Timeout on the floor 1506 to go in the first half Appleby inside to Marsh for the Slam in a threepoint lead

watch right in the center of your screen its Chase Hunter the leading scorer this year for the Clemson Tigers yeah and then and again the case of a guy whos averaging five assists the game as well as the 15 points should involve very well from three early on and you look at that statistic that includes the one in 12 night he didnt have a field goal in that game until the first overtime he hits a three and then fouled out about a minute later he did have a couple of critical blocks in the OTS and the Victory against Penn State hes on the bench right now with that personal foul Junior from Atlanta Georgia we told you his younger brother Dylan Hunter has the basketball right now both of them out of West Lake High School shot clocks at seven on the bench not wanting to pick up that second foul Wake Forest started the game oh for four from the floor as hilders Hildreth drives against the double team and travels they had been four for four from the floor since missing their first four attempts and they turn it over hey but its really astonishing to me how how much better Hildreth looks this year as opposed to last year so much more aggressive offensively his bodies changed Galloway looking for three Galloway who transfer from Boston College he started his collegiate career at College of Charleston guys around in the game now who are well traveled to have been to two or three schools in their career as Galloways played 109 games in his career as Hildreth misses out of the corner and this this guy number 500 is going to break the alltime record for games played here at Clemson fake drive not to wear by Marsh Tigers maintain possession with 21 seconds on the shot clock theyve got size and shot blocking along that back line especially Marsh hes another guy whose game has really taken a step up from last year Tiger basketball you mentioned Hunter Tyson Mike number five in white this is 115th career game he needs 20 games to become the Clemson alltime leader in that category Galloway were the first step quickness in score able to get to that right hand no help side defense on the Gap that time by Wake Forest Reverend Galloway played 43 minutes in that double overtime game against Penn State on Tuesday had nine points it was four of eight from the floor in this game my map will be had that bank three and thats his only point so far hes letting people working lets see if he gets more aggressive shot clocks at five its the only made three of the game so far for Wake On three chances and thats Marsh doing a chin up and getting fouled and this one off screen rolling the Clemson kind of forgetting about number 33 so far in the game hes had a couple of uh easy finishes that one for a chance for three Music free throw line thats Tyson going to the Clemson bench Hunters back in and you see why him coming into this game 14 of 16 from the floor on the season for March Applause both of his field goals have been dunks and he finishes off the old school threepoint play for the sophomore from Cornwall England he was four for four from the floor in the Wind on the road to Wisconsin on Tuesday Mike all their five rotation guys were perfect from the floor Music foreign against Penn State traveling violation down on the Block and thats Gottfried turnover number five in the first half for the Tigers and Godfrey these uh hes got a collegeready body already just so theyre trying to get their shoulder down could have taken a little more time on that play no double team help coming Steve Forbes in his first year six wins for Wake last year Mike they had 25 for the NCAA tournament going 137 in ACC play kind of a wild shot shot the marsh plus 19 jump one of the biggest in college basketball history this is all working well created contact with her in his free throws Applause Crystal Matthew Marsh so PJ Hall at the freethrow line and youre looking at uh youve got Bradford you got Marsh you got Carr thats pretty good you can throw some size out there and keep fresh bodies three points and three rebounds now for DJ Hall Monsanto comes back in Carr he just mentioned him Heathers out now they go a little smaller but theyve got a better offensive player in Monsanto out there its a nice group there all accs second team boots Justin mutts from the defending champs in the ACC Virginia Tech as they beat Duke in the title game a season in Brooklyn this year were going back to Greensboro Applause on a driving Applebee we talked about it in that you know he is hes had an outstanding start but six feet tall a little challenge size wise and you can see Hall starting to trust that injury a little bit more the knee with that supported sleeve we told you about the kneecap injury and it dislocated at coming back he was rehabbing getting back on the floor from foot surgery look pretty good on that play Mike yeah absolutely and thats the last thing you got to get confidence and just react out on the floor not think about that that injury Hunter crosses it over with stumbling down taken away Wake Forest Clinton Applause LT up a three and knock it down for the demon Geeks starters freshman year only 21 percent from three coming in so that may be not on The Scouting reporter only for him just the fourth main three of the season for the Freshman from Malmo Sweden Clinton number 34 in the old gold and black fall catch and release thats a shot that hes worked on in his comeback is trying to get some range becoming more of a threepoint threat 43 shooting in the first half so far for Wake Forest again they shot 54 and that road win at Wisconsin in transition right down the lane and a foul on the drive so Chase Hunter will go youre free throw line for the Tigers well take a timeout threepointer from Clinton hes

winning going into that game but you know so far in this in this game time that Clemson on the year has done a very good job taking care of the ball the averaging only 10 turnovers a game already at six now turn out points off turnovers a big factor in this lead for Wake Early they will be at the free throw line with Hunter he got foul on the drive Hunter Tyson back into the lineup as well for the Tigers a couple points couple of rebounds for number one at the freethrow line here remember we got that early offensive foul and uh you know that Brad Darnell does not like the play guys who pick up that second foul in the first half 77 percent of the season seven points but as Mike mentioned just one of 12 from the floor for Chase Hunter Chase Hunter last year when the teams met late February here in Clemson 21 points it was a career high at the time to travel all got in the air with the walk that time lets see lets see if Clemson can make a little inroads here with apple be out of the game yeah you see you just moved moved his pivot foot third turnover from wake Music 33 shooting so far in the first half almost Midway and through for the Tigers they lost him defensively he had a terrific look that time on the weak side and the Tigers second best in the conference 30 percent its going to be an offensive foul and cougars had a rough stretch here his first two possessions they had to travel and then picking up the offensive foul heres the look shes hes a hes a big strong guy hes not tall but trying to make some space around Hemingway sophomore from Gaithersburg Maryland seeing action in his third game this season hes a transfer from Marist Poughkeepsie New York tigers are one of their last eight and no field goals in about three and a half minutes 10 22 and rolling in the first half call on the Block Bradford was defending to get the foul first on Davey and Bradford well and that you know we talked about his points against Penn State and for all the freethrow line was a big part of that eight made free throws in that game so hes got the ability to get guys and foul travel down low lets get a message from Works Nitro meet Works Nitro powerful tools for any project with gaslike power without the gas fueled by powershare batteries to give you the power to outperform talk about a consistent scorer Mike PJ Hall at the freethrow line he had a stretch last year where he went 25 games in a row doubledigit scoring and that foot was an issue for him most of the Year too I mean he did not practice all that much so that would makes that even more outstanding he just wish that he could stay healthy Clinton puts it up top and Bradford on the business end for the Deeks I tell you what wake has done a great job their Biggs have really been scoring on the back line on lobs and dunks the lead is four for Wake Forest got eight points now his fifth made three of the season for the Junior from Spartanburg South Carolina from Gorman High School Applause around the perimeter out of the corner and wake gets a three right in front of that cuts and bench for Williamson more of a seasoned guy here at wake uh much better leadership this year than in years past a lot more vocal on third try to drop it off the hall and he got away with a double gathered and laid it in hey its not a double dribble unless they see it its not a lie unless you believe that you believe it PJ Hall by the way to 10 points just talking about his propensity for doubledigit scoring especially last year Applause eight Applause beetles going to get called for the bump heres the look youll see it right here dribble he wasnt expecting you dribble gather catch dribbled good score thats the recipe and the lead is just two now for Wake Forest weight getting production from its bench so far in the first half 13 points from the Wake bench Middlebrook speaking of bench coming in now for Clemson which does not have any points from its bench so far in the first half Galloway also to the scorers table set to check in for the Clemson Tigers were inside of 8 40 to go into first half Tom rumor Mike jeminsky our outstanding ACC basketball production crew with you from Tiger Town were thinking about football but not until tomorrow Mike when they play in the title game of the ACC in Charlotte against North Carolina and that should be a sold out Bank of America Stadium for that game I would imagine that those two schools going at it fouling Middlebrooks his first after just getting into the ball game yeah you see the hook right there and uh the Baseline referee is going to see that more times than not and were talking about Bradford a big body hes actually slimmed down two came in about 290 but in much better shape Bill Covington Jr Tony Henderson Jeb Hartness in charge of the proceedings this evening car slipped down shot clock is at 10 away Applause out of the game be interesting to see how long Steve Ford goes with that and he is as I say that hes walking right in front of us to check in the dunk by Hunter Tyson ties us at 20 wake has led for the vast majority of his first half and the tigers are getting the ball back Applause up ahead Galloway with

years ago heres the steal and the conversion the other way and the jam from Tyson well the points off turnovers had been an advantage for wake and now Clemson has flipped that its even six a piece great finish there and I think the thing time you look at this game the Optics wake really looked like they should have been ahead more than they were at this stretch and Clemson has found their Rhythm offensively gotten back to a tie game and a lot of that has been with Appleby out of the of the game now hes back in Wake is led by as many as six Hildreth also into the lineup for way Tyson after the jam hes got four points of steal and a rebound Applause tigers with a chance to take the lead they led by four very early in this game four nothing Galloway down the lane jump off yeah he got tied up by Keller Applause tried to split and Keller nice job he kept his hand on top of the ball that time good call by the referee Arrow favoring the demon Deeks seven different players have scored for Wake Forest 13 points Off the Bench into the corner Williamson one more time its the second time hes knocked it down out of that corner pocket three ball and six points and hes starting to find his way Tom its missed a few games with the back uh injury didnt start up to Wisconsin but uh looks like hes feeling a lot better now transfer from East Tennessee State third year in the Wake program for Damian Williamson came over with his head coach he did those Forbes at his third season middlebrooks over the top car able to extend and give it to Appleby Williamson got by the defender and that one spins on in for David Williamson yeah youve got to defend the three youve got to go out and honor that and it opens up the driving lane say what this is not a tall backcourt by any stretch for a wake but they are very fast Williamson now has eight points missed by Millie Brooks hildrift three on three situation Williamson trying to get around Beetle couldnt do it Williamson by the way Mike just three points and one of four from the floor in the win at Wisconsin Applause Beetle up to the board jogs it up for the Tigers who want a timeout so we were tied at 20 just a second ago but thanks to Damian Williamson Mike its 2520 wait for 556 to go in the first half theres the look and you see and you know Hunters got to be careful hes got that one foul already and then this is a this is just a terrific fine the extra pass by car and heres the wake is winning the threepoint battle right now four of nine and theyve only got one twopoint field goal in the game Clemson making hay at the freethrow line at seven of eight two of those threes for wake coming from Williamson Tigers normally clamping down defensively as far as the threepoint shot is concerned but Williamson has a couple first four they gave up 40 percent to their opponents and that number has come down dramatically in the last four Music Tigers were tied at 71 at the end of regulation on Tuesday against Penn State after trailing by six at halftime and we should talk about Wake Forest travel uh this has not been an easy week for them and what the Big Ten challenge brings in is the central time zone and so they play up in Madison at a nine oclock game on Wednesday night preferred uh yeah on Wednesday and they get home at about 4 15 or on Tuesday Im sorry they get home 4 15 in the morning on Wednesday guys got to go to class and then they hop on a bus and come down here yesterday has not affected them adversely so far as theyve got the fivepoint lead with 549 to go in our first half ACC won that challenge against the Big Ten the last edition of it eight six first time theyd won the challenge since 2017 and a lot you know like again you can look at that in a vacuum and say yeah its Big Ten but its matchups whos playing who whos home whos you know who Duke had a very good win against Ohio State but it was in Cameron but uh you know its its just for me its its tough to get your my head wrapped around the fact that its only December 2nd and this is the ninth Game of the Year already for both these teams its a its a long season out there I mean theyre playing four months before they even get to March second true Road game of the season for Wake Forest with its seven and one record theyre trying to adjust the clock and get it back to working order with 5 56 to go in our first half tigers are working on a modest twogame winning streak the win against Penn State they also beat Cal in the Emerald Coast Classic in Florida he won five of their last six you just saw a Chase Hunter on the bench and I you know Airways like he can hit that early basket I thought he was off and running and thats the only basket hes had in the game so far Music chefman is in there number four for the Tigers rims out from Hunter Tyson a little one off that careerhigh performance Mike a little smaller look out there for Clemson with shefflin in there and PJ Hall out only lost this season for Wake Forest is on November 20th against Loyola Marymount in Jamaica and that was in overtime so now the lead is eight as we approach the fiveminute threshold Tigers just one of seven on threepoint chances make it one of eight and missed by Hemingway and that was a that last basket was a step back three by Appleby theyre five out right now Wake Forest not nobody in the middle Applause Appleby The Graduate transfer last two years at Florida Williamson over shefflin came up short Tyson pulls it in Ill tell you what with a a guy was healing in Williamson and he and Appleby on the floor at the same time that puts a lot of pressure on you defensively great cut away from sheplin great cut better pass that time the lead back to six for Wake Forest Applause Hildreth trying to connect with Keller able to preserve The Possession to Carr the Wake had been five of ten from Beyond The Arc Mike yeah but youre going to live with Keller taking threes out there as opposed to some of the other guys out on the floor Music everybody 36 percent from Beyond the arc on the season to wait for it in the conference amongst three black jerseys the tieup and the arrow favors Clemson who just grabbed that offensive rebound what a pass right here galloways he threaded it in there for two Music are you a good student interested in attending college but need help each year at the Jimmy rain

real Road game after that at Rutgers and theyve got an 11 game break between Duke and Virginia Tech and thats the hot thats the hard thing and theres Clemsons uh schedule coming up again theyre going to play each team will probably play three game three League games before the start of the year but you come in December youve got finals that youre dealing with and then youve got the Christmas break so its really a disjointed month after playing this many games this early in the year and then you got to get cranked up for fullon League played gen one December was kind to the Tigers last season from the middle of the month to December 22nd theyre able to string together four wins in a row tie up again and the arrow will favor Wake Forest this time the Arrows gotten a workout here in the first half last year they wanted Virginia Mike beat South Carolina which nipped them this season they also beat Drake in overtime they hate the Drake Wake Forest had a nice January of last year Mike they won nine of 11 from January 4th to February 9th that included wins against North Carolina on the road at Virginia and twice against Florida State again wake won 25 games a season to go thats Carr yeah they would much prefer to see him shooting uh making that move instead of teeing up threes Tigers win 8 and 12 in conference play a season ago that was 10th in the league lost in the second round of the eventual champ Virginia Tech in Brooklyn at the tournament 7675 in overtime Ill tell you thats a thats a nice looking Clemsons offense when you get a high low with Hunter Tyson and the PJ Hall in the lane area Marsh picked up his second personal foul Galloway midrange on Santa was over the top for the tip to Carr Applause big forced five of 11 on threepointers they average about nine made threes per game second best in the conference two and a half minutes to go offensive foul its really solid defense by shuffling you see it took it on his sternum moving his feet a little bit you lower that shoulder youre going to get the call you get that charge call most of the time Applause and they just Steve Forbes just comes in with another set of big bodies Clinton back into the lineup for Wake also number 20 Davey and Bradford seven foot Junior from St Louis Missouri guarding the paint the free throw line shuffling got pushed slight bump from Clinton for the personal foul so Clemson going to be shooting free throws through the rest of this half so its shefflin stepping to the free throw line the sophomore from Loganville Georgia Grayson High School and a little bigger look along the front line with uh with shefflin in along with Hunter and Hall coming up at halftime well go driven with Brad Brownell the head coach of the Clemson Tigers first half highlights and Analysis with Mike tominsky also go around the ACC this is the first night of conference play in an NC State are also playing tonight at least a little bit of a drip a drought for Clemson the last three years they had to run 25 wins 20 wins and then the last three 1616 and 17 I need to flip that get back to getting into the tournament they were in the tournament back in 2021 third time under head coach Brad Brownell to make the NCAA tournament Steve Forbes in the Deeks also close the season ago they played in the NIT and they managed to make it to the quarterfinals were inside of two minutes to go in the first half wake has led for the vast majority Hall with the good hands but he traveled he was able to catch that pass in tight quarters Mike but he turned it over ninth Turner over the game now for Clemson you know you know its this lead basically in Wake has gotten it without Appleby being a huge part of the offense he had an early three by Hildreth Applause wake had its largest lead just a second ago at eight hilgers with the steal checks the defender knocked away as Chase Hunter recovered out of bounds and its tiger ball Applause that wasnt it he had a he had a kind of brain freeze on the turnover there which you dont see and then he doesnt give up on the play and that is a terrific recovery and Hildreth thought he had an easy Deuce there great Hustle timed it and did not foul and thats especially coming from behind when you dont really have an angle that is tough to do four points for the first half for Chase Hunter on one of three shootings and hes made both of his free throw attempts in fact the tigers are nine of ten from the line Mike wake has only gone to the line once how about that view jaminsky and that is that is clean as it can be too I mean it wasnt even close to a foul its a great lesson though Mike right he made a miss you dont win and thats usually you know when a turnover takes place out front like that youre really vulnerable and its its rare that you get a play like that Mike you talked about the travel schedule for wake dont forget Clemson went to double overtime so theyre trying to recover from that double overtime win against Penn State to 101 to 94 in the ACC Big Ten Challenge and could have taken care of Business and Regulation but a couple of missed free throws let Penn State into that game mentioned that November 11th game that was at South Carolina a close loss for the Tigers 6058 to their instate rival after they beat them last season at home 7056 Hunter with an awkward step there Mike is hes shaking up a little bit Tyson trying to spin in against Monsanto and you know what but you cant complain about the defense on that play I mean he forces Hunter to take a fade away jump shot which is in his Arsenal but for Monsanto whos smaller you force him to make a tough shot six points now for Hunter Tyson averages just over 14 per game Hildreth is on the floor through J hall with the foul first on a hall he points six seconds to go in our first half and the guy theyve got to get going in the second half who really helped them in the Penn State game is Hemingway has not scored in the game so far O2 from the floor the Hemingway had 15 points in that win against the Nittany Lions and made four threepoint baskets in 41 minutes of action there he is number 12 the senior so there is a review ongoing right now Mike Bill Covington is at the monitor joined by Jeb Hartness nah I mean they were looking about the hall just kind of he ran three he ran through the screen you know I look at that it was a physical play but there was that elbow stayed pretty much intact I dont think theres anything there Bill Covington Tony Henderson Jeb Hartness our officiating crew yeah theres nothing there it is a common foul and I like the way Bill Covington explained it big guy the little guy well and when youre a big guy thats what you should do to little guys they may think twice about that the next time all right well lets check it out PJ Hall 6 10 245 and he ran into Hildreth right Mike yes Hildreth six four two hundred so giving up a few pounds and a few inches Monsanto for three his first points of the night tamari Monsanto their big three has been kind of quiet about both teams big threes have been relatively quiet scoring in the first half Santo leads the team in made threes hes now got 22 this is all tried to put some spin on it pretty good defense by Bradford that time to force him underneath the backboard Music Applause so the final seconds coach Forbes wants the final shot here in the first half maybe a second in between and so much for waiting on that Ive heard cries of no from the Wake Forest bench and now Hunter trying to beat the buzzer wont do it so the struggles for the Tigers from Big Point distance continuing now one of ten from three and Wake Forest knocked down six threes most recently that Monsanto threepointer theyre pretty strong under coach Forbes when they go to the locker room with the halftime lead which is exactly what they have against Wake Forest which is working on a threegame winning streak this season 71 this year Tigers start with the basketball theyre six and two on the year after the win at home against Penn State in double overtime first double OT game for the Tigers since 2014 when they beat Maryland at 7773 deal Monsanto Applebee trying to cross it over over Galloway I have a feeling early on in this half that Applebees going to be pretty aggressive looking for his offense Appleby was too far from the floor did make a couple of threepointers for his six points but had three of the six assists for their team locked away and taken by the Tigers all right were working on an overall eightgame homewinning streak Mike thats a three ball ers that bad the only one made three in the first half pretty good defense too all made the three in the first half and now Tyson has one hes got nine points Applause 103 career made threepointers for number five and tiger orange and white elevating for the board wrapping it up hes fighting with Carr pass the whistle fourth jump ball of the game the week is going to keep possession Appleby to trigger the inbounds Music trying to catch up and he wont get there nice burst of speed by Hall and that was uh that just kind of went through his hands a lack of concentration on the catch Applause 12 points now for PJ Hall the lead is two for Wake Forest deflected Away by Galloway into the student section see that passing their way I dont know that he was expecting that Keller was not expecting that pass and see Hall out in the open floor looking a lot more confident in that injury Progressive picking up speed and getting to the rim the PJ Hall shot clock is at five for Appleby well launch it three way off the Mark Carr able to gobble It Up Fall did not hit the rim on the Appleby shot Mike shot clock violation and I dont know that there was great shot clock Awareness on that possession and Appleby had to hoist that up it looked almost like he was surprised Appleby can certainly shoot the three at 46 percent of the season mental mistakes early by Wake Forest and then the bad pass Hildreth challenging Hall spotted off the glass much more challenging finish that time with bodies back for Clemson I thought Hildreth Mike who on November 26th had the third triple double in school history we did the second one we did with alondis Williams last year against USC Upstate and the first one belongs to Tim Duncan heres the look he didnt see any help and you know hes one on four right now theres a lot of white jerseys back and a lot of guys might have pulled that back and waited for help but he was committed to the layup and fortunately made The Shot 14 points 10 boards 11 assists against Hampton for Hildreth Galloway back iron easy board for Carr and now Appleby best in the conference almost 20 points per game the scoop is a Miss Tyson and now Hunter on the wing Hemingway and theyre going to score the best in the foul during the course of the shot and its a threepoint basket for Hemingway big hoop for him heres what happened that when Appleby takes it all the way to the rim like that theyre a little vulnerable and Hall is going to get called for the foul even someone back so Hemingway who is a career 42 threepoint shooter fifth in school history knocks it down and now Hall second foul and thats a thats a bad second foul to pick up too you know you got the shots got a good chance in the you know going in and that foul doesnt really even if he missed what doesnt get you anything 12 points for Hall in the game the only player on either team to get the double digits so far and score it shot pocket 10 Central dribbling Clinic launching three the Lakers had a settle for some tough jump shots here early in the second half tigers have a chance to take the lead with this possession having LED since the early stages on the first half Galloway all the things were lifted that time in the back door cut there was he was overplayed defensively so just take what the defense gives you second time weve seen a pretty assist with Shepherd Tigers LED 65 early in the first half they have taken the lead on the Galloway layup by one 1613 to go in the second half Keller went for the jam and got fouled at The Rim cheflin the challenge his first heres the look pretty nice feed by Appleby that time although you know again if youre Clemson heres the look right there you see you can hilders gets the winner turned around if youre if youre Clemson I think youre going to live with those plays with the ball out of Applebys hands you know make trying to make those tough finishes just a second free throw attempted in the game by Wake Forest monsantos coming out Marsh is coming in 33 you know gold and black not just yet though one more free throw for Keller and this was a uh Im being interested to see this lineup out there for Wake Forest with Williamson and Appleby out on the floor at the same time Applause just a sixth free throw of the season for Keller and now three or six you see I mean you know Sheffield gives up the foul when you make a murder at the free throw line you come out of there one of two so youre ahead of the game tigers in this this half Mike 405 from the four make it 506 and a third made threepointer well the Tigers its Callaway well he got himself loose with that layup gets himself a little bit of Rhythm and all of a sudden opens the basket up somewhat wake is just one of seven from the floor in the second half theyve missed all three of their threepoint chances the thing is theyre not getting great looks Mildred fouled thats a three Applause Music Applause so Hildreth fouled by Galloway will be going to the line for a chance at the fourpoint play tied at 39 he can give the Deeks the lead in the second half this is the easy way to a delicious holiday enjoy one of Americas most loved holiday meals from The Fresh Market choose from

playing in the championship game tomorrow how about Cameron Hildreth going to the freethrow line Mike chance at a fourpoint play were tied up but for how much longer yeah you just you gotta at least run parallel to a guy if youre going to challenge that shot they just ran right through his body picked up the chance for the fourpoint play but its been a different half for uh Clemson so far three or four five or six overall it looked like Carr picked up that foul third against Carr only the only first team foul but kind of a giveaway foul in that situation youre not going to come up with the ball most times are not four ties four lead changes in the game tigers are five of six for the floor in the second half Beetle out of the corner spinning front rim Hildreth whos hit double digits hes scoring four games in a row had that last three last trip down the floor for wake and Williamson is back in as well Mike hes got a couple of threes they find him wide left not his best effort dollars Tyson directs a little traffic they got shuffling he runs that offense then hes done a nice job from the high post with some really nice passing Galloway a little bit he needs more Daylight because he had his hands down that time nothing no no hand in the face to challenge his sight four of five on threepointers in the second half for the Tigers after going just one of ten from Beyond 22 feet one and threequarter inches away in the first half thatll come up short Bill drip trying to follow his Miss from the clearance struggles from the floor in the second half continue for Wake shefflin offensive glass against Marsh and Carr came away with it maybe a little early shot that time Williamson in traffic in the paint Bill Griff is looking for Marshall has knocked away 10 turnovers for Wake bison swooping in Appleby wants to slow it down a little bit yeah both teams uh throwing a lot of punches but nobody connecting them in the last couple of minutes six points for Appleby coming off that 32point performance season high end game high in the win at Wisconsin he tries to drive it Beetle defending hell pick up the personal second on beetle Clinton Monsanto reenter the game for Wake Forest Hildreth and Carr get a breather and you know and somehow and you know for for Beetle a redshirt freshman in there a tough cover a guy like Applebee but man you gotta you have to sit on that right hand if you can make him go left Applause right there first inside thats exactly how to play him just keep him pinned on the sideline going left Tyson wants to run finds Hunter on a wing that was a threepoint attempt doubtful B brings it up Applause tries to hook it into the paint Marsh got the deflected basketball Damien Williamson the dragon Studio from WinstonSalem North Carolina end of the Geeks and he really wants to take Tyson badly off the dribble had him isolated Applause all the way across the Williamson back that is going to be looked at Bill Covington is looking over at the scorers table not sure about two or three on that shot by Williamson but you got Hunter Tyson flying out there on not under control and thats the good pump fake in the look foreign seconds on the shot clock Hunter hopping into the paint over Mark score the bucket Applause and see that time even though Marsha big body in there that Hunter initiates the contact draws the foul and he cant block the shot heres that look you see that little bump right there terrific take off the right hand and a threepoint tiger lead CMax presents the cycle of savings it all starts with a proprietary

better care of the basketball in this half 10 turnovers in the first half only two so far in the first eight minutes here Tigers is a team nine of ten from the freethrow line the hunter has a chance to finish off the threepoint play as he was fouled by Marsh six points couple of rebounds a couple of assists for Chase Hunter Music whos now three for three from the line and the lead is four it matches the largest lead of the game for the Tigers PJ Hall back into the action it was a seven point halftime lead for Wake Marshalls double teamed and fouled Paul was in the neighborhood so was

possession for for Clemson Tigers Trail by six at halftime in the double OT win against Penn State on Tuesday on this court thrown by seven at halftime in this one Hall angling to the rim and Santo came in to defend may have picked up the personal foul he did heres the look nice split there good bounce pass and Ill tell you what I like the job that Beetle has done he hasnt scored in this game but hes doing a nice job with the offense lets Hunter play off the ball Music Bradfords coming in for Wake Marsh coming out Hall at the line with 13 points is 47 from the floor Marsh exits the game with five points and two of three from the floor but hes another guy Bradford 42 percent from the freethrow line you know their their bigs are shooting outrageous percentage from the floor thats struggling from the line outrageous percentage from the freethrow line for Clemson 12 of 13 after those two from PJ Hall Bradford up and under Paul recovered it Applause Music and off the Hunter Appleby guards them that is an offensive foul second on Hunter Mike yeah Im gonna have to I dont know about that one that was awfully close it did it really didnt look like Hunter ducked at all with his and thats the thing you look for on that shoulder they just looked like a couple of and not really overt bumps either lead is six for the Tigers the largest of the game Appleby has struggled in the second half Mikeys over four Williamson Escape dribble hits Baseline Music so Williamson has 12 and this is a game certainly hes going to gain a lot of confidence coming back from those back issues coming off the bench for Williamson as well lines it up and knocks him down second three of the game for him 17 points for PJ Hall and that leads everybody he and Galloway are doubledigit scorers for Clemson Williamson leads the way with his 12 Off the Bench Appleby gives up a couple of inches and lays it in so hes so crafty with that onehanded finish inside eight points for Tyree Appleby you know lets lets see what he finishes the game with what he does in this last 9 30 Paul reloads that was uh I earned that second three Im Gonna Take It still the tigers are five of nine on threes in the second half misfire Whitman over the top shefflin had the position in the board and then Monsanto has really struggled in this game one of eight now from before driving Chase Hunter fouled in the process Applause Clinton personal foul number two Music Keller and Hildreth coming in Tyson and Middlebrooks for the Tigers Applause comes out for Wake and now the uh your your three three primary guys on the perimeter you have to lock in on if your Clemsons or Appleby Hildreth and uh Williamson Mike how about 1415 from the line for the Tigers as a team and now nine points to chase Hunter tigers are seventh in the conference of freethrow shooting before tonight and you uh and you add in the five of nine from three in the second half and you got yourself a lead six total threes made for the Tigers theyve overcome the seven point halftime deficit that will be the kick Williamson everything but the Finish Applause complete turnaround here in the second half favoring the Tigers on their home court middle Brooks uh back it down on Keller physical Play Between The Duo whistling foul against wake come on heres the thing you know youve and this is this is just a great rest for PJ Hall you got the under eight timeout coming up so you bring in Middle Brooks and now hes got a chance to give you a little bonus here with a couple of made free throws looking for his first points of the night just three of seven on the season from the line middle Brooks that contagious freethrow shooting for the Tigers thats not you know for for Middlebrooks for what he did last year a point in a 11 rebound a game but now hes giving you three points three rebounds in 11 minutes you know thats thats nice production dont forget he tied his career high Mike with eight points in the win against Penn State and double overtime earlier this week yep and now 16 of 17 from the line for Clemson Wake has gone to the line six times and made two of them Applause approaching the eightminute threshold of the second half Galloway thats going to be whats going to be at the freethrow line wake will be shooting free throws from the for the rest of the way second on Galloway so its Hildreth at the free throw line go for one so far from the stripe that Miss was on that threepointer he made he had a chance to make a fourpoint play earlier in the half hell earn another free throw seven and eight for Wake as a team in the game Music now its in six boards for hildred Drake is just one of eight and threepointers in the second half tigers have made five of them on nine tries

Mike a little more modest performance so far for Appleton yeah I mean you love what Damian Williamson has given you in this game but you know and you look at the but the three big guys Appleby Hildreth and Monsanto for Wake Forest to combine seven of 28 from the floor so a nice defensive effort by the Tigers there Lake just one of eight on threepoint tries in this second half after connecting on six in the first half its a complete reversal Mike Clemson made one of the first half theyve got six in the second half and but they also are getting to the freethrow line as well as making those threes 16 of 17 from the stripe for the Tigers in the game Hilton down on Hemingway tiger foul you know when we talk about Davion Williamson working back from the hes he has been solid Hes listed hes missed very few games throughout his entire career and he has been very healthy very reliable Applause okay Williamson number four for Coach Forbes third year in the Wake program we mentioned that he came with his coach from East Tennessee State Williamson playing in his 128th career game has gotten a double digits and hell add two at 11 points and six ports for Hilton you know its interesting I talked about uh Brad Brownell given PJ Hall a rest and hes left middle Brooks on the floor even through that because his team is playing very well with him on the floor nice pass Tyson hanging hes going to the freethrow line Hunter Tyson Williamson just picked up his first personal foul Hunter Tyson the graduate student Mike from Monroe North Carolina Piedmont High School and think what their year would have been like last year had he not been injured in February it was a big hit for them Music in fact when they won that game in late February and that was here against Wake Forest to 69 in the last meeting between the teams Hunter Tyson was out and PJ Hall was out and they still wanted 80 to 69 11 points and eight boards for Hunter Tyson Applause Tigers trying to extend the winning streak on the home floor against Great for 10 games to go back to 09 for the last demon Deacon Victory as Appleby hit the deck different player going left Galloway rifled that one to Middle Brooks so the reach was not long enough under the basket 15th turnover of the game for the Tigers yeah that was a low percentage shot pass to try to connect that time if youre going to try it maybe a bounce pass instead but that that had some heat behind it Appleby looks over at the bench area just to the right of our broadcast position for Wake Forest theres Keller working Baseline a surprise Middlebrooks assessed the personal foul second so one more and no Wake Forest will be in the double bonus Applause not the worst thing right now that youve got you know wake up the line and scoring a chance to score with uh with the clock not running Paul comes back into the game and I would suspect barring any kind of uh injury or fault issues that this is the group thats going to finish the game for Clemson 17 points Keller is now three for four from the line very limited experience this season from the free throw line coming into the game with just four attempts for the Freshman from Highlands Ranch Colorado Hunter got caught in the air through the hands of Galloway and back to Wake Forest sitting by eight you never leave your feet as a passer you know he just he got stuck and great job by wake of not giving him any Vision underneath the basket 16 turnovers a season high for the Tigers average talking about average 10 a game coming in and still have a lead despite that Williamson or wants it too strong Applause Hunter will take his time with five and a half minutes to go on regulation theyll take an outright break at this time but if its not there Clemson will be a little more deliberate Tyson against two Defenders all the way around to Hemingway he rips the ropes for the Tigers yeah nine points all of them here in the second half Alex Hemingway the senior

Hunter Tyson 11 points 10 boards tonight Tigers skillfully break to Wake Forest pressure and now weve got three minutes to go in regulation Applause tough for the beaks Mike when the leading scorer in the ACC Appleby has just eight points and one of seven from the floor in the second half well theyve really controlled Williamson and Appleby and Hildreth and monsantos had a really tough night for the miss Santo with a three its not going away eight points for Monsanto Applause prior to that the Geeks have been one of 11 on threepointers in the second half theyll make and heres where and this is again finishing the game we talked about Clemson let Penn State into the game end game situation by missing free throws they need to be solid here because thats who wake is going to do is this last two and a half minutes is 18 of 19 from the line thats not enough still room to work but you can improve you can always improve but especially especially in this stretch right now when youre shooting oneonones you got to convert at least the front end Reverend Galloway played 25 games last year for Boston College company rebounds and three assists in the game for Galloway speaks neat points they need him in a hurry closing in on two minutes to go Music and Santo just made a three side rim and out of bounds to the Tigers 22nd Luther didnt there wasnt a lot of urgency early on in that shot clock and then you settled for a 300 arrest when youre not seeing a big basket its tough shot me in that time Clemson has dominated the series recently they won two in a row and 14 in the last 16 and some punctuation from PJ yeah I think that may about do it 21 points for Hall Appleby Breakneck Pace met at the ram ball back to the Tigers in Galloway Applause shot clock did not reset properly backtoback games now Brad brownells been able to watch PJ Hall go over 20 points two straight games coincidentally his first two starts of the Season as well coming off of the offseason knee injury and uh you know what there wasnt uh hit the NC State 6860 so they continue their Resurgence but um you know not a lot of points off the bench for Clemson but I still you know Middlebrooks did a nice job in there Beadle did a nice job running the offense shuffling gives you some nice looks at the high post couple of pretty assists tonight from shefflin Tyson bumped on his way into the lane Applause second half threepoint shooting story eight of 12 for the Tigers Wake Forest just two of 13 and no room for the Improvement at the free throw 11 of 11 not this half see if Tyson can keep it rolling from the freethrow line foreign got to give this young man a lot of credit Mike coming back from the clavicle injury last season the year before he had a facial injury missed five games I mean he really is the heart and soul of this Clemson team along with PJ Hall yeah but you know and and to have the code you have the option to come back you know if theres nothing compelling out there for you as a player if if the most important you know thing is coming back and getting another year in college its a great option hes coming up with a doubledouble tonight for Hunter Tyson third this season and the Tigers 22 of 23 from the free throw line knocked away and taken by Tyson and then Applebee being ushered Away by Bill Covington Applebees being restrained by Monsanto and he was he had an issue with Bill Clinton that that ball was kicked and now hes getting out of Monsanto Music it looks like it hit Galloway in the back of the heel too so Applebees technical foul Tyson Music hes now seven of seven from the line 14 points ten boards double double four Hunter Tyson some frustration for Appleby yeah the frustration of the evening for him and I Im I cant think of the last time I saw a player get a technical on the game usually its the usually its the coach frustrated from the floor tonight for Tyree Appleby three of 13 and you consider what he did Mike on the road at Wisconsin with those 32 points its a different story tonight second half its Paul Tigers Tyson coming out of the game with his DoubleDouble Hunter Tyson 15 points 10 boards perfect from the freethrow line eight of eight they have all out of the game as well really efficient scoring from those two tigers have made their last five shots an 80 runoff over the last minute 15 now the final minute and after trailing by seven at halftime I dont know what coach Brownell said but it worked in the second 20 minutes maybe you said make a few threepointer since it only made one at the break cross it over Hunter hang and score rattling home he joins the double figure scores boy Hemingway Hall Tyson on that list Tigers here in their first ACC action thatll extend the winning streak to three games overall 10 in a row in the series at home for the Clemson Tigers who have now won 15 of the last 17 meetings with Wake Forest and the drought continues for the demon digs they havent won here since 09 well for Clemson fans now its the attention turns up to Charlotte for the ACC football championship tomorrow night about 26 points in the first half Mike 51 in the second half for the Tigers on the
