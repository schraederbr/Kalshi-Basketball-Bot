for Steve Forbes Demon Deacons last year these two were two of the first teams out of the NCAA tournament field they would like to avoid a repeat of that fate in 2025 Lee Cassel AJ decide Jeffrey clar are officials Wake Forest in possession first Fon Reed with the ball and note that Reed has scored the first points for Wake Forest in the deaks last five games Wake Forest not at 100 Cameron Hill still surviving from the flu Ty lore Johnson did not practice yesterday with flu like symptoms well theres a good start for hildr whose minutes have been way down of late an opening Salvo with a three for week heres the starting five for pit Damen duns back out there great defensive game against UNC cam Coran and Zack Austin maybe had the game of his colleagues life five blocks 15 points in the win over Carolina that ball was deflected according to AJ inside not according to Steve Forbes great help by Fon Reed inside Leed puts up along two grab by the Appalachian State transfer Trayvon Spillers here is the Wake starting five theyve been much better since Johnson took over at the point nine games ago Salis hildr Spillers and Reed Dunn gets a deflection hits the deck and Dunn Scoops it to Coran for the first pit points great job of hedging on that ball screen in the middle third getting the deflection Cor to the rim and what a pass by dun great hustle and those are the kind of plays that are going to make the difference in this game today both these teams equally matched then it comes down to the details and the 5050 plays wake is 10 and one at home their only lost last Saturday they gave Duke a fight though before losing by seven and they get a basket from Spillers averaging 10 and N in his first year with the deakes Spillers gives them that right side of the box score a effect hes really good rotating hes good on the glass he gets tips and deflections and he blocks shots at The Rim Austin great threepoint shooter rattles in his first 42 from out there Zack Austin the Winston Salem native uh playing in front of a big Hometown crowd hes made the most threes for pit you have to know the Scout and get out on him hes got range into Reed working against Coran epon Reed gets to his left hand spins around to his right but spun too far its a travel in the second Wake Forest turnover Kevin W you catch it that deep you got to go over your left shoulder you dont need to counter you already have buried him in the rim Jeff capable his team knocked out week in the ACC quarterfinals last year lost to UNC in the semis one of the first four out right now Joel lonardi says theyre one of the last four buys very difficult nonconference strength is schedule wake is in the next four outs so the game more important for weight than it is pit but it will be a quad one win for the Panthers Miss three by Reen here is low he and led good rebounders for guards good allaround players for Pittsburgh hard drive by Dunn he gets Salis in the air and Damen Dunn draws the first foul of the game Damen Dunn was such a good pick up out of the portal for Jeff capable and his crew I mean you knew he was coached hard and he played good defense coming from Houston but he also played with a good backcourt Jamal uh LJ CER Jamal shed Emanuel sharp I mean when you play with those kind of guys and you pick up somebody like this in the portal you know youre going to have a leader you know he knows how to play defense and he can get stuff done on the right side of the box score as well the numbers werent great but he was banged up and remember Jeff cable followed Kelvin Samson and Oklahomas very close with him coached his son Kellen Kellen was on staff as well so Jeff C got a very high recommendation from Kelvin Samson and dun whos missed some time with a thumb issue has been a huge impact player for pit theres a three for Johnson no good and swatted into the hands of legan w fars one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in the nation the one for three start well the last two threes were people that dont make threes for Wake Forest Cameron hildr made the first triple in the corner of the first points of the game Austin missed a clean look rebound to Reed wake far is the second worst offensive team in the ACC only Virginia has been worse hildr into the lane a hard take and he is fouled so the first free throws coming for Wake farest coached by Steve Forbes 10 and one at home wake has been awesome at home in Steve Forbes tenure they just havent picked up enough quality Road winds or neutral sight wins to get to the tournament its another team thats very close but you look at whats coming down the stretch that you really need to win this game and then some road games at Stanford at SMU at Duke they will need to pick up as many wins as they can to crack the field he told us before the game today Steve Forbes that this is the first time in his tenure at wake that he is returning his leading score that would be Hunter Salis who is yet to get going free throws for hildr hes got five of the first seven pit goes to guo Diaz Graham twin brother Jorge will come off the bench as well at 7even feet tall hes a pick and pop guy more than he is a roll a step back for leot rims it out he started 0 for two hildr down the floor to re caught it deep back for Spillers a three for Johnson hes missed his first two well hes only made seven on the season and remember hes coming off the flute in practice Music yesterday low on the drive lost his footing was able to get it out to Dun in time and dun is STP by Johnson very active Defender Johnson crosses leg it lobs it for Spillers it looked like Johnson had a clear Lane to the basket there dished it off instead and then a wake far as foul will send it the other way we expected a close game were getting that so far 77 and that its February 1st were starting the penultimate full month of the season in college basketball and for folks who maybe are just tuning in end football this is the kind of day where you get to know the Stars the standout teams the teams that are going to matter come March and of course Carolina Duke if youve heard it once youve heard it a million times it always delivers because it always does 77 here pit and wake farest Jaylen low denied by Johnson been a block in a steel early late shot clock three missed by dun good box out by Cameron hildr coming off the timeout a really good job by W Forest lets see if they get Hunter Salis going four of their five shots have been threes and only one guy who makes them has taken it thats Cameron hildr and sales hasnt taken a shot yet fourth leading score in the ACC freshman Juke Harris is on the floor wearing number two hildr works it inside to Spillers Strong finish yeah thats what Spillers can do lefthanded on the left side of the floor Steve Forbes gets him in a single twoman game with hildr its a nice finish at the rim and has made just one substitution so far Panthers went only seven deep in the eightpoint win over UNCC Tuesday really tighten the rotation for that game swing it to low Diaz Graham freshman Harris on him Diaz Graham takes him inside cant finish thats the way to guard him though you got to make him put it on the bounce you cant let him catch and shoot twopoint lead for weights six minutes gone by here is Salis playing with an empty block Kevin lot of space and to Spillers driving on Diaz Grant Trey Bon Spillers very skilled player with the last two wake buckets long and athletic active backto back baskets by Spillers anywh pit has missed its last six second best offensive team in the ACC against the second best defensive team and leot snaps that streak with his first two thats the challenge with the pit back cour is trying to keep them out of the paint they do a really good job of spacing the floor and they are hunting a piece of that pain on every possession Johnson Diaz Graham got trapped in the corner he commits his first foul and Pittsburghs second Treon Spillers five double doubles coming off eight points and eight boards and the last one does a nice job on the single side twoman game and then again another post up right here and he just faces up goes one strong dribble to the midline really nice finish hell take a there for the first time with an early six nice easy Scouting Report they saw him in the NIT last year had a double double against pit for App State there a lot of double doubles this year Salis first shot of the game comes seven minutes in L it stumbled off the rebound there Coran back on the floor for Diaz Graham low sets up done for a line drive missed from three Applause Demon Deacons a slower Tempo team as the years gone on Bob inside to read theres a whiff for the fourth wake fars turnover see thats part of the decision making right knowing who to get the ball to when and where giving Fon Reed a chance to shape up to the ball last nine games oh thats five games for w should say just 45 assists 52 turnovers yeah see thats my my point about taking care of the basketball and getting it to the right players I mean hunter Alis has yet to get going Leed into Coran one hard dribble goes up against Reed stands his ground Parker Frederickson first action on the floor hildr against Austin hildr to the left Austin with his first block shot of this game after five of those on Tuesday ACC leader in shop blocks I mean undersized really good standing up Cameron hildr you know hildr is going to spin when he drives and then nobody guards Austin who misses a three Forge Diaz Graham fighting for the rebound its taken away by Applause Salis 8 minutes in theyve gotten Salis one shot attempt that was on a baseline out of bounds here is for three the freshman at a nearby Salsbury North Carolina salz sets it Applause up low driving lefthanded finish for Jaylen low his first bucket see Parker Frederickson while hes on the floor has to be able to find ways to knock down shots otherwise the pit guards are going to isolate him on a oneonone opportunity and he has not been knocking down shots this year just 21 from three yeah hes two for his last 10 but he did make two in the Louisville game Reed trying to bail himself out of trouble with a one liger Here Comes low 176 a game sixth in the ACC in scoring misses badley on a deep three pittis is not getting good looks which wake far is still du to him and the Demon Deacons will keep it with a three feels like a team that can play itself more into contention this next month well let me say this first there is a lot of basketball in front of us that has yet to be played with some quad one opportunities that you have to take advantage of Stanford I like I love Maxim Rena leads the league in scoring and rebounding I think hes done an excellent job Kyle Smith has in the first year in the league its a tough road trip out there for everyone so I like their chances to get some Ws uh but I also like both of these teams here I think they both are are good enough on the offensive end certainly wakes a little bit better defensively than in years past but they both have star power and that matters cuz they can make plays and Salis makes one there hes not scoring but he does have a couple of assists as he sets up Reed pit meanwhile started two for three Panthers are just two for 12 since then a steal for Frederickson Parker Frederickson reverse finish what a big time play for the sophomore he only has 14 threes and seven tws coming into the game so he doesnt get a lot of layups and hildr jumps in the passing Lane takes away from Austin Salis top two off the window and good timeout Jeff cable who was screaming about a travel on Salis but W 15 to4 Run for the Demon Deacons Applause pit has gotone cold four of 15 from the field but Dunn will drive it there and get fouled by Hunter Salis who collects his second I love the atto by Jeff cable this is why you call the timeout because you know now wake is up their level theyve ramped it up and what do you do you either go back door or you put it down on the deck and you drive it hard to the rim to get an n one opportunity its a great call from the bench by coach cable and it gets Hunter Salis out of the game at the 929 Applause Mark Johnson and Spillers return to the floor for Salis and Harris pretty thin wake rotation well see how long he sits I might expect a little token pressure right here by pit yeah here comes some pressure off the the made free throws I like it because youre going to apply pressure with pressure right especially with Salis out of the game its a good time to bring it Don and Lake a jump Johnson who turns it over lob down to Dunn fake scores and he gets Five Points Damien Dunn and about 15 seconds I like the pressure because its one less ball handler when Salis goes to the bench and now youre making Johnson make decisions take eight seconds to get it across there and theyre into the run of the offense pretty late hildr thought about a three instead feeds Reed and a non shooting foul on the reach in there thatll go against dun his second its a one two two three4 court and when you drive up the floor and you pick it up at midcourt of course Pits going to bring the Trap you want to keep it in the middle or in the middle third but you got to move the ball before the Trap comes and certainly dont pick it up at the midcourt strike oh he said a huge crack between hildr and Coran and Cameron hildr still down well dun just picked up his second for pit Coran picks up his second for pit and the officials are going to review this play about 40 seconds Salis dun and Coran each pick up their second papa amadu kante is on for pit number four his first minutes in the last two games as hild misses low crosses him over Jaylen low long twopoint jumper is pure you learn that playing on the black top right there put him on his hip keeps hildr on his hip gets separation that way jayen low has great separation skills in the open floor and in the quarter Court seven nothing pit run Reed goes into the substitute kante finishes over the top yeah I like that move go oneonone score in the low block youre catching it in a place on the floor where you can finish Leed shakes loose miscommunication on the switch there and isma leot has four leot had one of the games of his career last year against wake 30 in the ACC tournament quarterfinals averaged over 22 against wake in their three meetings last year pit one two of the three wake one Applause here Frederickson office screen back for Johnson slashing dishing hildr three to shoot it late shot clock lob and Austin called for a foul Jeff Cel is pleading his case falling to the floor and the foul will be the first on Zach Austin coach cable didnt like that 149 over the last 100 meting every time they play We update this graphic and its 5149 or 5050 and Blue Devils have a chance to pull away a little bit this year uh a very special team still has not lost an ACC play I dont think theyre going to lose I think their perimeter size is a factor today Cooper flag is a factor today uh malawat in his first experience playing in this matchup is going to protect the paint I think uh Dukes defense is just too much anything to the fact that its the first Duke Carolina game for a lot of these kids and that UNCC has a few players who have played in it nope NOP not today this is that level of maturity for these do players I think so in their house with 9300 strong 93 9300 And1 cuz Im going to be Im going to be in there as well cuz you wont have enough basketball today no never do thats if we know anything about you you never have enough basketball Debbie Elli jayen low will lobit into legged have you done a triple header of course the last time uh I I had a double header ACC women semifinals in the tournament in Greensboro and they went over and called The Duke Carolina game on the ACC second screening with with my guy Wes Durham and Mark Packer Im just saying maybe you could squeeze in one between this game and well the weight Forest fans are hopping mad right now there was a low potential elbow maybe so in the previous possession and then the fouls called here uh Im not sure for What on Spillers maybe across the face Steve Forbes just catching a glimpse of the replay his leged hits the first of two well he feels like theyre better equipped defensively to guard ish legett this year Steve fors because last year he got a lot of switches onto some of the big men like Andrew Carr and just owned wake he had a season High 22 in the first game and then a season high 30 in the last game which ended effectively wake far Applause season 139th game of ish leeds career began at Rhode Island and he is flourished here with pit ACC six man of the year a year ago fulltime starter this season seven to play first half wake by two heres Frederickson into Reed they have been good in the paint today but leg comes over its too slow moving on that that move you got to make that move quicker when you catch it that deep low and here hell be called for an offensive foul as hildr ends up on the floor yet Applause again and I asked Cameron hild before the game how he was feeling he said from a flu standpoint hes better from a fatigue standpoint hes not quite there and I said CER come on man nobody plays as hard as you do that would be an example of it right there did he get Music established hes taking any breaks he can because typically Cameron hildr isnt constant motion you tracked this yesterday talking to him the miles hes run in games this year over nine miles in the game against Michigan earlier this season the average is 73 mil a game in these eight games its impressive dukee Harris is fouled with 19 to shoot second foul against Austin this is starting to become an issue for Music pit three starters with two for Jeff C talking to Milan Brown on the pit sideline juk Carris 61 free throw shooter you got Applause it nice coming out party against two team High 14 a week ago wake gave Duke a real fight they had a 17 to1 run in the second half held Duke to a 1 for 19 start to the half but the Blue Devils clamped down late 6356 well this is the big lineup on the floor for pit right now when you got both the twins out there and Diaz Graham but they both shoot the three extremely well so they space the floor H fouls Reed one and one coming for week hey big womens basketball game in the ACC tomorrow Hannah hialgo in third rank Notre Dame head to Louisville Tak out a very good Cardinals team its at noon Eastern on ESPN 2 lot of a great talent in the ACC this year Notre Dame the best Championship threat in your view uh no question right now theres a little bit of separation between Notre Dame and everyone else in the ACC however Notre Dame hasnt played NC State or Duke yet and theyll get their hands full with Louisville Jeff WS team who survived the game on the road at SMU earlier in the week Hannah hendo is one of the top players in the country must see TV shes second in the nation in scoring and the best scorer in the ACC and in the nation right now is tanay Laton at Florida State both of those guards if you get a chance to check them out you should yeah not only the points as you saw but the Steels four a game for hiago one woman fast break for the Irish threepoint lead off the Miss free throw by Reed for the one and one and leget starting to take over for pit hes got a team High Applause Music eight you think with the with the two twins out there that it would be be less space on the floor but theres actually more space because of the way they play and the guards for pit are so good at getting into gaps PR dribble hand off and just doing a nice job of snaking behind that ball screen leg its hot right now somebodys got to figure out if they can cool his hand off a little bit remember 223 game against wake last year in early eight low for Diaz Graham hildr now picks up low got a mismatch inside had Diaz Graham against Johnson low somehow got that shot up rebounded by Harris wake has done this without Hunter Salis who continues to sit on the bench with those two personal Applause fouls Salis has been out since the 929 Mar since he committed that second foul on a threepoint play pit has scored wake first Music 135 Juke Harris had a mismatch inside he was trying to get the ball to swing to his side of the floor Johnson just hoists it and gets bailed out on the foul by leot with 47 to shoot thats ish Li gets first so wake will be in the double bonus the rest of this Music Applause half Tyler Johnson sophomore from Brooklyn making his ninth consecutive start and everything changed when he jumped into the lineup he was averaging three points one and a half assists per game as a reserve points four assists as a starter came over from Louisville a lot of players who were at Louisville the last couple of years scattered into the wind hit the portal after the disastrous two years and there was a lot of talent there but taken some teaching taken time to mold TI Johnson into the Wake farest habits in the Wake farest way but hes really thrived of late for Steve forbs Applause Music Applause Leed going to work again outside the pain thats well Applause Music short getting a feel for Tempo all those things Johnson has learned different system a lot of the same Concepts decision makinging is at the rate of speed Steve Forbes wants him to play with right there was a nice leave at the front of the rim for Fon Reed another player picks up foul number two guo Diaz Graham Reed will go to the line Reed Fon Reed coming off his first double double of the Season at louville 11 points 13 boards I think he can give Wake Forest more hes got to continue to run the floor hard got Contin to make himself available at two feet in the paint at The Rim averaging eight and six but when you watch him in the post sometimes the moves you go doesnt look like an e six guy he he he can do more hes got six and three in the first Applause half fivepoint lead for Wake farest which is only lost once in home this year to Duke a week ago read Hedges out on low I mean look at the size jumping out on that ball screen most sevenfooters cant do that and recover but its a good tag from the weak side and now Reeds going to pick up Dunn back in there with two fouls dun drives around him and the health came from Spillers 2924 wake fars to Locked In defensively considering theyre holding pit to 36 from the floor and a pit team that shoots a lot of Threes is hit just one now theres a f foul before the ball could be inbounded and Damen Dunn ish leged I beg your pardon ish legan ends up on the floor I think that was Cameron hildr on the push and there will be another official review its hilds first well lets see the officials do want to review this previous fouls under review oh he got hit in the face by his own teammate Papa con oh wow yeah it looked like a got hit in the face and a shoulder sble whammy Shing it off though now this should be the shortest review of the year once they finally take a look common foul is confirmed Applause the foul was on hildr the foul was called on hildr I guess you cant racee the foulon hild but clearly the contact the damage was done by K the only way wake Faris can slow down ish leged is to uh get one of his own teammates to shoulder and elbow him apparently so its only the fifth foul against wake and youre playing the way legs playing you dont want to come out of the game Jaylen Lo just two for seven shooting start heres Dunn got Reed lying in weight dun shuffles around Harris and scores it whether he kept the pivot foot down or not hes ruled to have done so and he scored nine to lead Pittsburgh Reed operating out of the dunker spot gets good position inside waves off Harris for a cut out of a double team back to Harris in the corner a three Juke Harris two for two from De wakes doing an excellent job in the paint playing through Fon Reed good job Swing Swing bucket in the Applause corner re comes out to HED on low throws his hands up into the paint Damen dun again to the right boy Dunn is playing a physical half he has been aggressive coming off timeouts the tendency for Jeff capable has been to get the ball to Damien dun off the bounce and Pits going to show a little Zone here pit has played two possessions of Zone in the last seven games that was against Syracuse well if youre going to play zone you got to do it at the Dome and it works out leged deflection low takeaway heres dun with a shot fake and hildr commits his second one of the things that you can do is Fon Reed has already established himself on the Baseline so this time when the double comes he kicks it back to the top Swing Swing triple and then done that might have been a little Shuffle in there but he gets away with it and this is another Drive hes just putting his head down against an aggressive defense its one of the ways that you can beat that D but right now when dun drives hes driving to score hes not looking to Dish hildr takes a seat with his second foul both hildr and Salis are out of the game with foul trouble can pit take advantage they can Papa con just a 27 Point per game scorer gets on the board changing the rhythm of the game Jeff capable by throwing this Zone and Johnsons got to do a better job ball faking on the Music top Johnson with Fredericks in the guards Harris Reed and spillard Johnson not a great threepoint shooter and hes over for three today long rebound to low wake far still does not have a single offensive rebound coach capable two for two in the zone 90 seconds in the first half wake has l head almost the whole way low nobody within 20 yards of Damen D his threepointer puts Pittsburgh on top at a first half suffering an injury earlier this year and then when he got the cast and splint off he still didnt have full range of motions so no flexibility hes been getting more and more flexibility back every day starting to look like the Damian done they saw in non conference play come with a short close out on Johnson drives in and scores it Tyler Johnson now that was a good decision by Tyler Johnson nice take off the Baseline bounce to the rim two for one opportunity here for Applause pit see if they take it low rolls it into kante they really dont take the two for one at this point theyll try to get a good one and Le it is stuffed look like it may have gone off Leed at the end but its rolled off weake Leed still looks a little shaken up doesnt he and the crowd just saw what we thought we saw which is it did go off legged but cant review that in the first Applause half five to shoot for low steps inside Johnson and hes fouled oh goodness my goodness come on an AB absolute no if youre a coach you cannot cannot give up that foul we will confirm a threepoint shot smacks him in the head and theyre looking at it to make sure he was behind the line its going to be three free throws here you have to have better discipline you have to have better time to score awareness we mentioned tyor had the flu yesterday and is trying to battle through but coach Forbes continues to go with him because you mentioned a short bench Salis with two fouls hildr not 100 therere the two uh leading scores for Wig hildr and sales we highlighted in the open they both have two fouls so three free throws for low and Im not making an excuse for him Im just telling you the the facts a short beninge for w we havent seen Omaha beloo in the first half Here Comes Salis hild for an offensive possession here you dont think the games mean anything you see this right here right look how important this possession is for Music Wake hter low fourth best free throw shooter in the ACC 88 goes three for three so pit leads it by two and weight can hold for one both teams have used a timeout already Pits got Brandon Cummings in the game first time in two games hes been in their number three because of all their foul trouble staying in the zone to end the half got to flash somebody to that ACC logo area Salis hadent been in the game in about 9 minutes hell hoist and hell Miss so a disjointed end of the first half for Wake Forest Demon Deacons LED this game by Nine Pit leads it by two big first half for Damen dun with 14 wake Faris really needs to win this game pit would really like to win it with two teams fighting to get their way off the ACC bubble 3634 pit at halftime zuba ment Josh pasor our studio are coming up as well continue

te Applause Music Music Applause Lo Applause Lo for e Music okay welcome back to Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum the Joe for short good first half pit leads it by two over Wake Forest we thought this might be a coin flip game its been a coin flip half Kevin Brown with Debbie Antonelli wake farest LED most of the way nice pit push at the end yeah I thought the shift by Jeff cable going to the two3 Zone changed the rhythm of the game for his team G in the lead and for Wake Forest they got to stop turning the ball over theyre shooting 55 from the floor theyve got eight turnovers as a team they just got to get the ball down to the paint where theyve been effective if youre Wake Forest you want some good news Hunter Salis only two points and theyre only down two good news for pit though Damen Dunn looks like Damen dun again he has played well and his scoring has come but because hes been the most aggressive guard on the floor he has looked to put it on the deck he has been aggressive at attacking especially off of ATO Jeff Capel has put him in a position to succeed their spacing has been outstanding hes just turning the corner and putting his head down hes been getting to the free throw line as well and his ability to drive sets up his ability to knock down triples as well this is a well put together first half by Damen Dunn and lets see what Hunter Salis has for us here in the second half for Wake Forest yeah 2514 pit after Sals second foul which was on a threepoint play by Damen Dunn Wake Forest in the next four out according to Joel andard as we begin February pit the last four Buys so Panthers in a much better position because the much higher net better non conference great the schedule be a quad one win for them it would be a big quad two win for a wake and again not a game they can really afford to lose at this point Zack Austin first shot of the half air males a three and the balls off of Cameron Coran and pit did not shoot it well in the first half just two for nine now from three and 42 for the game both coaches maybe went a little deeper into their bench earlier in the game than maybe we had anticipated Wake Forest has outscored pit 9 to2 Off the Bench wake led by hildr and Juke Harris with seven Trayvon Spiller zept and Reed each had six Salis just three shot attempts in 11 minutes a game play Salis out of the double team here flips it to hildr inside Spillers didnt bring it down and missed it long thats a change in the ball screen coverage by pit they had been hedging with Coran on the floor now theyre looking to trap especially late in the ball in the shot Music clock Jaylen low with seven for pit in that first half their leading score on the year done into Johnson fumbles it loses it ahead to Hunter Salis Salis over Austin there Applause Music badly low like a bump from Johnson there spills to the floor been a very physical game each team with big foul Tribble six players with two first half fouls four for Music pit low dribbles around Reed good help good D better hits with a done throw three anyway largest lead for pit 177 for Damen dun Steve Forbes told us he had to get his team better prepared on the defensive end this season and hes done that they have struggled offensively to to shoot it but theyre shooting it well and seven times this season in the second half theyve shot it better than 50 so you expect them to play well here in the second half Spillers into the post out for Johnson and theyre just letting him shoot every three he wants and finally after three misses he hits just his 83 of the year I wouldnt adjust my defense until he hits a few more low for Don Tangled Up and a foul is called on Johnson his second wake is there on the catch they have done a great job communicating Cameron hildr gets under the screening action right there and then its just a better offensive play Dunn who has had the hot hand here knocks it down and then Johnson straight on steps into it that might be a good spot on the floor for him to take it d a little screen from Coran Huth jumps out to contest Austin good ball fake low drives it on Salis who blocks the shot quickly the other way its a three on two its hildr its a wake foris Applause lead again its the D that allows wake to get numbers in transition well theyre really driving Johnson theyre taking advantage of him off the bounce and his size leged whos got at least three inches on him couldnt finish Applause wake far is five for 12 from three what has been a brutal threepoint shooting season much better today Salis kept the feet down driving it on leged Rise and score for Salis 80 wake farest run thats the hunter salace that I was looking for in this matchup today his perimeter size against a smaller pit back court and that time he gets to the paint and elevates over the top loud as the Joels been this afternoon Austin three missed it and tipped into the hands of Applause Salis were under 16 to go but we might be one more basket away from a Jeff cable timeout at this point Johnson late catch by Spillers driving a in and Austin with a rejection a lot of contact there Steve forb screaming about a foul its Austin second block Austin again wont shoot it this time hooked in to corad who Applause finishes really good patience and Poise pit comes right back down plays with maturity in that possession gets it to the spot on the floor that they want hildr controlling Johnson again another three uhoh what what well when youre seven for 39 I guess youre due two straight for Tyler and the Demon Deacons after an ice cold start to the season and finally found the touch from Deep Music leg get spinning into Johnson he draws the third foul against Johnson free throws coming for pit but you expect Cameron hriff to make threes you expect J har pit with ishmail Leed at the line Panthers are now nine for n from the foul line today foul was Johnsons third he stays in the game Jeff capable has been in that position for much of this game frustrated with the official sh in and his team what theyve created turnovers they forced eight but when wake gets a shot up theyre not creating much wake shooting 56 from the field right now six of 13 from three nine of 11 from the line twopoint lead for Wig farest again its a much more important game for them as their opportunities to pick up quality wins few and far between the next month plus at least in regular season play and Reed lost his foot good no call there ninth turnover for Wake heres low quiet scoring game and here comes hildr was tipped right to him hildr into D steamrolls him and a blocking foul and count the buckets a threepoint opportunity for the senior from Worthing England Cameron hildr hildr makes up his mind about three4 court that this is going all the way to the rim watch this right here past midcourt its two dribbles and he knows the contacts coming he also knows its really hard to draw a charge in the game anymore so he takes the contact absorbs that and gets an n one sand done with his third as well did they count the Applause basket yes yes they did yes the score Bugg in here just didnt update it right away but hildr does convert on the threepoint play thank you for that youre welcome hes got 13 Steve Forbes team is up by five 10 and one in home Pittsburgh has never won at wake fars trying to snap that today 0 and six all time Leed gets foul thats a non shooting foul and Fon Reed picks up his second wow so much great college basketball today theres also fantastic Saturday primetime game of the association Lakers and the Knicks LeBron at the Garden is always must CTV NBA countdown starts at at 8 Easter presented by Papa Johns tip at 830 ABC and streaming on ESPN plus tough shooting day for pip second best offense behind Duke in the ACC by offensive efficiency low just lost it on the way up a fumble Salis for Spillers and Austins called for a foul here this time he thought he had a clean block and went straight up there have been a couple of times where the inverse of that has happened and Jeff cable shows you what he thought Austin was doing so coach Cables got to be feeling like it slips out of his hands a couple of guys for Wake have hit threes that we dont anticipate and were right there two possession game right maybe Wake Forest had that run maybe pits turn to go on a run and they got to get it done with their defense Austin third as Applause well rare free throws for Trayvon Spillers thats only his 37th free throw attempt in 22 games as much as he plays around the basket and he goes two for two with that size and frame and that athleticism its kind of surprised that hes not at the line more averages two free throw attempts per 40 minutes Hunter Salis only averages four free throw attempts just asked Steve Forbes about that done and another foul thatll go against hildr for his third old teams old guards and its been an appropriately physical game and these teams of late you think about pck Carolina Tuesday and then wake Duke on Sunday Saturday they have played in some really physical games of late it looked like Cameron HR did get off the contact there but Damien Dunn has been so aggressive off the bounce Shing off what it looks like fell awkwardly look at that right there today thats pretty good 17 points leg it got him started he had the hot hand early and then done thats Jeff capable on Tuesday what do you guys need to do to be better that was before the Carolina game he said we need Dame to be D and again you you look at the right hand the right thumb is still taped up by the way on the play where he suffered the thumb injury this year he also sprained his left ankle so two for one but Dunn has been fighting hard through it hard to the paint number of times today and hell take a seat with 19 hes taking some pressure off Jaylen low having to do so much on the offensive side of the ball eight times Jaylen has been over the 20o mark he leads the team in assists here comes that two3 zone that was effective at the end of the first Applause half Salis working out of the high post gets it back from hildr he didnt realize at space hildr weaving his way in and theres the first offensive rebound of the game for Wake par and of course it leads to a three it took him 27 minutes the first offensive rebound for wake in the game is a tip out by Reed and an eighto Deacon lead low will answer his first bucket of the half and see thats why Jaylen low is performing like an all ACC guard because when dun goes out now its his turn he had been Distributing hed been spacing now hes looking to be aggressive off the bounce Applause himself sixpoint lead for Wig Forest closing in on 12 to play that pass has got to be better in the corner thats a three hildr driving around Diaz Graham into the other Diaz Graham and then the second offensive rebound for Wake too long on the putback Music try heres guo Diaz Graham a rainbow three and just like that the lead is cut in half 70 of the shots he takes are outside the arc and thats a perfect time in the trail to take it just the fourth pit three hildr Reed had it slapped out of his hands now they cant stop getting offensive rebounds so they can for the the moment Diaz Graham thats down to three that is a twoand jam timeout wake first Here Comes Pittsburgh right people taking shots now that was the team called timeout so were still in the 12minute timeout Zone Tyler Johnson and Wake Forest and they are in the next four out seven team out of Joel lardys projected field as we begin the month of February pit in the last four buys little bit more margin for error for them hildr and he is fouled so cam hildr will shoot to and thought would be Hunter Salis he has not been and yet wake is still winning how do you square that well top five in the league and scoring is Hunter Salis and he played limited minutes in the first half after he picked up that second foul so he should have fresh legs after only playing 11 minutes in the first half I still think he will help determine the outcome of this game I think hes too good and hes too important to what wake does wake with the 131 Zone off the timeout duns back in there for Pittsburgh hruth with 18 to lead week Dunn with 19 to lead pit that shot contested by Spillers spills out to Johnson he may have just kicked Salis in the head and Hunter salace is slow to get up the officials will stop play look like spillers accident kicked Salis in the side of the head well I like the switch to the 131 its a driving lane down the lane line by D and its Spillers at the rim and good job by the official Safety First two3 Zone by pit what you say they played two possessions of this the last seven games yes been living in it since the end of the first half HRI weaving around Coran hes been the man in the second half hes the man here hes got 20 hild had six points the last two games because he was sick one for 13 in those games against Duke and Lille back to five four quick ones for hildr Coran just his fourth shot of the game it wont go pit getting ready to bring low back in at the next whistle playing that 131 keeps Fon Reed around the rim and allows them to rebound wake is plus three on the glass Salis hits the floor again be a lot of ice baths later today for these teams forehand try to body up Reed Johnson three Here Comes Leed dun leaks out ahead of the pack and that ball was goal tended by ales got to the glass so give done 21 when your point guard takes that deep three and its a long rebound your point guard should be your first person back on defense ball hits the backboard Applause first and to your point Johnson was the third one back on defense done too shy of a season High threepoint lead 915 to play critical ACC game between wake and pit Salis cross the way to Johnson H salz has only attempted five shots Balls not gone below the free throw line the whole possession Leed charging and Johnson helped out from behind there with a chase down SWAT itll be pit ball cant play on top of the two3 zone you got to play inside it so either you got to get to the dunker spot and shape up from there you got to get somebody to the logo how much of this has been a wellrun Zone versus Wake just not seeing a lot of Zone I think the zone is good I do think wake prepares for it they they practice against it they play some Zone leg it hangs in the air too strong rebound Reed Music Johnson and the switch on Diaz Graham thats a mismatch Spillers Johnson again Blows By Diaz gramy missed it at the rim and then kante couldnt handle it just Mega frustration both ways but wake will have possession this is a great job right here just attacking a short close out because youre quicker good recognition by Johnson Salis hes so good when he is given any space to rise and operate and when he gets to that right hand and he can get a piece of the paint one of the quickest releases in the ACC fivepoint lead for Wake low got stripped at foul Applause out and thatll go against Tyler Johnson its his fourth foul and he will take a Applause seat watch Salis right here catches it and then he does a nice job of getting a piece of the paint to the Elbow playing through the elbow and he just has the ability to elevate over a smaller back court for Jeff cable Austin and Coran replace kante and Diaz Graham now this Zone just got a lot bigger and wider nice job attacking inside the zone right theyre not playing on top of the Zone very well done by pit and let dun be the playmaker sets up Coran 5956 with under eight to play pit trying to win at wake farest for the first time theyre 0 and six wake might have size over for every position on the floor right now Reeds trying to use his reed barreling in and dispossessed well I think hes actually played the game under control a little bit better and everyone in the ACC thats watched him is probably laughing but I do think he has been a little bit more balanced I think hes one of the best weak side Defenders because hes active just like that and I do think that he is a really good teammate I think he cares about winning and he cares about making plays that result in Impact winning one of three returning starters from awake team that was close to the tournament a year ago Salis off the window and if youre pit dont let Hunter Salis get hot backto back baskets for him stretches the lead to five wake back in their man they have led this game nearly the whole way pits only lad for a little over four Applause minutes Damen Dunn with a game by 21 Low isolated against Salish extends the elbow drives hard got the rim Austin a rare offensive rebound for Pittsburgh just there sixth of the game Leed gets to his spot for two doesnt over penetrate doesnt penetrate into the sevenfooter pulls up and hits the midrange hes been quiet for a little while only shoot a four for 12 but hes up to a dozen rebounding assisting stealing two another good allaround game Salis misses thats a shot that he usually doesnt miss when he gets to the elbow and plays through there good slip D hildr again done into the paint lefthanded no left it short dun missed Zack Austin and then he just picked up his fourth foul Applause Hunter Salis right here playing off that middle third ball screen and when he can get right here off the glass to his right hand like it doesnt over penetrate you see Fon Reed right there to Applause help Daman Damen Dunn missed Zack Austin wide open for a three on that last play because the the slip took up the the tag and Spiller couldnt get back in time Diaz Graham replaces done out for the moment with Applause four five to shoot it for Wake HRI buries it oh man what a game its his flu game under five to play five is the Wake Forest Advantage crossover from low a beauty of a step back wow Applause gorgeous a little pressure again Salis easily passes out of it hit P Trad for a quad one roadwi solidify their position as a likely NCAA tournament team wake farest needing a quality win badly Salis Juke Harris The Freshman misses a Music Applause Music three heres Leed hit without done in the game with the four fouls legot drives leot lost it it ends up in the hands of Austin who misses another three hes just one for six big rebound nobody was taking that away from Hunter Applause Salis hasnt scored it much but five rebounds two assists two Steals and a Music Applause block Spillers high low with Reed got Twisted in the air hildr salz no good ball movement playing through Fon Reed flattens out the defense opens up the top of the floor nice extra pass by hildr to a wideopen Salis now low gets a little bit of daylight sets up Diaz Graham he wont take it Austin driving it around Harris fouled and he couldnt finish but he will does have some fouls to give wake does not and a lot more ACC basketball to come today Florida State BC following on acc Network Virginia Tech Virginia and a sneaky good game between two newcomers Stanford and SMU two other bubble teams Austin and pit are now 14 for 14 at the line and this game is tied for the fourth time weight led by as many as eight here in the second half both teams have been nails from the Applause line hildr with Johnson Reed Spillers and Salis the starting five out there for week P really picking up their level right here switching one through five if we really saw them do well against UNC Salis driving it into legged hes got no space and he still scores how is that go win hadnt even see the basket and answer prayer Jaylen low finds an open legged it was a low catch drives it into Reed theres a foul called little bit of a later whistle from AJ decide but a foul on Reed his third nobody likes the patient whistle do they watch Salis right here he drives into traffic little hesi through the double team and and then three pit players with a hand in his face this is just really good work right here playing the game low to high and then exploding to get into your jump shot they get at the line they get 15 for 15 for pit Salis getting the right shoulder checked out here leg it hits him both the ninth best free throw shooting team in the country on Pace to set the Pittsburgh record in free throw percentage 16 for 16 theyve needed every single one of them back to the Zone they backed off their pressure a little bit into the Zone flash it into Reed High post Salis Dunn Johnson salz one to shoot it oh a rainbow three win game might be a little dramatic but its not far off for week and their tournament resume you cant get screened here oh its knocked away they try to post up leg it I think Johnson may have gotten a hand in there for a takeaway theyve been picking on Johnson all night all game will transfer an up and down day but he has made some winning plays ropes it into Salis Spillers a rare three it wont go first threepoint attempt of the game Im surprised Hunter Salis gave it up low deep one what a rebound by Spillers and heres hildr down the floor wake by five oh they just totally missed him must score possession for pit they do with Coran and Jeff cable uses his final tip you off Johnson into hildr theres the quick trap and theres the first of two fouls to Applause give itll go against Diaz Graham that is his fourth he will stay in the game with four same thing going for the hard trap the steel and now youre not seeing double Jorge Diaz Grahams going to take over for his twin because Jorge does not have a foul and GMO has Applause four Johnson to inbound again cant run this time and Reed gets rid of it to Johnson they tried to foul Reed Johnson sprinting down the floor now boy now thats a tough time to foul because you lost so much time now do you have to foul again if youre pit cuz theres only 40 on clock you still play it out Im Im Im putting Im playing it out I mean I Im I want to get to the bonus if you if you get the right player to to get the ball in their hands with those if Trayvon Spiller catches it Im fing Johnson almost fell over the line dun is back in the game with four fouls and Sal has control against lean tend to shoot for Hunter Salis hes not going to give this up forehand with a hard head you may have to give it up they double him Johnson and thatll be a foul against Coran who is trying desperately not to with two on the shot clock he reached over the top Jeff cables not happy I understand why but it looked like there was enough contact they do a great job here of making Salis give it up thats a foul hes got his body all wrapped up right there he didnt want that foul so Johnson for a one and one 79 shooter last year he was his seventh best free throw shooter in the ACC two possession game with a make whats the play for pit here Im looking to drive it extend the game they dont have any timeouts left its a two possession game I dont need a three right here Ill drive it I put some pressure here though make pit come back to the ball low touches it late low drives in it theres a foul 178 thats the right play by low though its a one and one for Jaylen low its spillers third so I would not let Johnson catch the ball I would not let hildr catch the ball on the inbound Assuming hes going to make two here and youre going to have to foul right away no timeouts for pit well they havent missed at the line today theyve got the force bit free throw shooter in the league and low does it miss you better box out remember wake does have two time outs back to a one possession game with a make can run the Baseline and he got it I dont call timeout here cuz I dont want pit to have to set their defense but its a good job of substituting by Jeff cable so that he has a chance to set his D gets done and whos four fouls out of the game Diaz Graham on the inbounder Johnson hild and Salis around there oh boy that ball is out of bounds to pit it will be reviewed with 164 to go and the pit bench thinks they may win this review and Steve Forbes keeps Spiller at the other end of the floor so hes not involved in helping inbound the ball but he keeps him on the floor for rebounding purposes call on the floor is white ball it will be reviewed three Johnson the inbounder at 79 Reeds at 68 and Spiller is the worst one at 58 see he backs his offense up right here gives you more space to operate youre pit youre letting Spiller catch it and youre fouling right away once again Johnson to throw it in and Johnson better get it in or use a timeout and he will use the last wake fars timeout guarding Johnson and AJ deai saw them get tangled up so he blows a whistle all right here we go no timeouts left and I mean leg its all over legan and Johnson were tangled up before the play started Jeff Cs trying to argue that theres a hook and hold Johnson ripped through here but leg it is called for the foul Applause Music no time went off the clock enough contact there for you for that fou I think so so Johnson just hit two big ones I did like though Steve for changing up the inbound season High 12 for Johnson all to talk about pit from the line wake is right there with him 16 for 18 one and one for Johnson and very very calmly drains it cam hu gives him a little bit of instruction before 13 points five assists two blocks two steals for Johnson another still getting a quick two here fivepoint game low will pull up for three two strong and leg it got it and then got fouled and that is a two shot foul for legot on the way up fouled by hildr at 99 and leot will need to keep pits Perfection from the line going have to see that again he was in the act of shooting hes giing theyre giving him two shots Steve Forbes is really upset and Fon re telling him dont do it coach not now call that some veteran Applause Savvy boy Steves face is uh you Chang colors a few times you dont want to get one Applause now pit is 19 for 19 at the line in a game that would take a minor miracle to win at this point wake 18 for 20 leg it makes it 20 of 20 from the line amazing and dun will come out of the game for Diaz Grant Nei team with timeouts T pit just needs a deflection would still be a one andone for one more foul hildr into Johnson and theres the foul so Johnson can basically seal this game at the line I like the way the management has taken place though extending the game Im always big on trying to extend the game how much can you manipulate that clock Applause late so Diaz Graham in for Diaz Graham its GMO for Jorge duns in for Coran Id say this would be if he misses that this would be a three you foul if youre wake if he misses I dont like doing that but theres a lot of coaches in this league as Ive pulled do like fing and now it doesnt matter incredible Poise by Wake Forest down the stretch Johnson seven for seven at the line his season high was 11 today hes got 16 theyre in a 131 Zone Austin has to hoist it Austin misses it tipped out to Dun his three irrelevant and it will count well that is relevant to some yeah thats significant somewhere hey its a win for
