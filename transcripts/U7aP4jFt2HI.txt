Conversation happening more than Earl Grant would like to start this season but all they can do is try to take the positives out of it try to bounce back today as New Haven gets a quick turnover The Chargers in their first division one season five and four record Theyve won three games in a row all of those against division 2 teams The announcement was only made this past May and they became a full division one team in July So this is a really quick on thefly job by Ted Hotalling to kind of get everything ready for the season and thats where they are right now Debriefs Patrick plays it over for Andre Pasha Its been very good so far and Pasha for three right at the end of the timer is good Well you talk about the players hes brought in Pasha one of them who was a junior college national champion a season ago and had to do it without an assistant coach who left for Yale and had to do that all in a span of a couple of months to rebuild a whole team So going back to the point about the bench for Boston College Errol Grant today has taken some of those guys and put them in the starting lineup So Caleb Steager who had a season high 19 minutes 11 points against LSU he gets the start Luca Taves who tied his careerhigh 14 points against LSU he gets the start today for BC Hastings goes back for Taves and the Eagles will reset trailing three nothing in their gold uniforms here on this Saturday afternoon from Kanti Luca Taves kicks Donald Han for three and thats a little short rebound though for Shaw and then it ends up finding Stefano Falopa the junior from Italy Its a great job by Falopa just tracking that one down even with Shaw kind of his presence there down low Chargers Its about trying to find some of their offense here a little bit Averaging under 70 per game Theres a right hand Thats good So so far you see what Andre Pasha can do Hes a sophomore from Syracuse New York Last year played for Mohawk Valley Community College where he was an allAmerican Taves kicks to the corner Caleb Stiger for three is no good Shaw this time secures the offensive rebound BC resets hand right to the basket Drives no good Hastings got a piece of it though BC resetting for a third time Donald Tand again is no good from three And then a foul on the rebound attempt goes against Hastings Now you like it for BC take those shots try to create second chance points but if youre New Haven you want to secure those rebounds Just dont let the bodies the active hands pull it away and give BC multiple opportunities Youve got a fivepoint lead here early on Want to try to keep that front foot going put some pressure on BC here early on out on the road Your partner was Aiden Shaw who was called for that last foul for Boston College So good start for New Haven Theyve made their first couple of shots from the floor Last time out a victory against Mitchell College on Sunday 92 to 69 Heres a drive from Fitzpatrick Kicks to the corner Briggs thought about a three now takes it on the second effort That was very long And then a foul returned on the rebound attempt against Falopa You mentioned just the jump up 2D1 for this New Haven program Theyve had longstanding history in division 2 They were competitive in the NE10 A couple of conference finals appearances Its a team that wanted to make that jump It feels like they have the right people and administration on campus to help make that transition to D1 Its been a shifting of the NEC A lot of programs jumping up Theres Luca Taves who gets Boston College on the board for three Now five for 12 from behind the arc this year for Taves who missed the first two games of the season Was great against LSU 14 points six of 11 from the floor Knocked down a couple of triples Got a lot of experience this past summer with the Japanese national team and got to develop That was nearly taken away Instead it cycles around Fitzpatrick driving left hand No Shaws been active on the board so far And another foul called on the rebound attempt And as we said New Haven 5 and four this year Theyve won three games in a row Picked 10th in their first season in the NEC They do have a couple of Division 1 wins Their first ever was against UMass LOL back on Monday November 10th a win over Delaware State as well How about a welcome to division 1 They played their first game as a division one program on the road at Yukon Theres Stagger Good take to the basket Yeah Then they had to welcome in a Penn State program in a gym that fits about 900 Yeah they had a lot more than that that day Fitzpatrick and dries Four guys go to him which leaves the threepoint shooter wide open Najimi George the sophomore from Bridgeport Connecticut makes it 85 New Haven And hes a scorer He scored over a thousand points in high school and all state recognition Tes offensively has been the firepower for Boston College so far He has five of the Eagles seven Just smooth release right He just gets it up at that point and just the release off the hands finds the bottom of the net Friendly fire there Taz nearly lost his footing but does a good job to come back Nearly takes the ball away and a fast ball inside and Fopa couldnt quite control it Good start Three of five from the floor from New Haven Boston College answered back a bit behind their point His skills kind of translated to the D1 level that he could make a jump And to his credit he he really has so far Yeah Had 81 points last year 32 rebounds One of the leading returners from a year ago Didnt have a lot coming back and use that presence You talk about just being able to help with the scoring offense and transition the culture of the program to that D1 level as well A lot of newcomers as we talked about a lot of new staff guys for Ted Hoting but done a decent job putting it together Theres Fit Patrick for three Thats no good Bowden Capky into the game for Boston College for the first time Has the rebound Fred Payne is out there as well for BC coming off the bench today for the first time this year Taves kind of lost the handle on it and its taken away by the Chargers Fitzpatrick running the floor Cant finish at the rim but the followup attempt thats off also from Falopa Third effort on it and it ends up finding its way to Taves for BC Foul called on that sequence Yeah I thought Pay did a great job defensively just staying level and not reaching in Luca Taves hops to his spot 16 to shoot for BC Taves lost the handle on the drive Turnover created by New Haven And on the run its the Jimmy George Well after that timeout its been three possessions for Boston College and three turnovers on the offensive end They have not been able to get their offense set So New Haven has taken advantage Five points off turnovers so far Heres Fred Payne Thought about the shot It cycles around Luca Taves for three is short Kapky has the offensive rebound Aiden Shaw now driving He lost the handle on it and is bumped and a foul goes against Jabri Fitzpatrick a junior from New Jersey Yeah you talked about it Eric Three turnovers in the last two minutes and you can just see Luca trying to penetrate there in the middle and a nice finish on the opposite end here for New Haven You talk about Nimmy George He can shoot from the outside He can attack the paint He can finish with class at the rim BC retains possession Chase Forte in for the first time Heres Fred Payne for three That was halfway down before it came out For a team like New Haven doesnt feel like theyre rushed Doesnt feel like theyre caught up in the moment here right It feels like theyre staying at base staying in their system and going after it Yeah Kind of going five out here Fitzpatrick onto the hardwood Gets it off for Adeli Now six to shoot George pull up two No good And a rebound for Kappy Now all of a sudden both teams have gone a little bit cooler from the floor This early start from Kanti Forte fires from Fred Payne Nice job shifting back right moving the defense with him Comes around for Forte driving the lane Floater is off Thought that was a good job by Fitzpatrick to cheat cut off the pass and force that drive And with some bodies in front not an easy layup to try to make Here is George Nice little handoff inside for Fitzpatrick who has his first two Thats a kid that played well at Fissian and played two years there average 199 points per game Forte for three Thats no good Boy Shaw has had a piece of it Feels like almost every rebound This one the Eagles do get to And Shaws floater No good Boston College just three for 12 from the floor to start this game One of seven from behind the arc Haven has taken advantage to a tune of a 127 lead eight minutes into this first half Pull up jumper Posasha is good Andre Pasha has seven points and New Haven has doubled up the Eagles early You talked about it with Pasha He averaged 142 points per game 109 rebounds per game He was getting buckets at Mohawk Valley And you can just see that stroke where he gets into those spots that hes comfortable in And for three thats no good LC still just trying to find their shot early on in this game He goes a lot of threes taken here in the first half Straight on Pasha good Andre Pasha delivers He has 10 points already which is the new Well the New Haven Chargers Its a 9 nothing run over the last 245 Go back even more than that 122 BC looking for their first points here in 4 and 12 minutes Yeah for Boston College they had four offensive rebounds but zero second chance points They forced a couple of threepointers where it felt like the middle was open Here is Hastings inside Goes right to Mascin is foul But you like that right Attack the paint Stop shooting these threepointers that arent in in rhythm or with contested shots Go and attack that paint You have the size and athleticism to do so Yeah especially the way it matches up in this particular matchup So Hastings goes right to the basket and well go to the foul line Jaden Hastings is at 68 from the free throw line this year Marco Reddanovich into the game for Boston College out of that timeout called by Earl Grant Hastings who played a season high 31 minutes against LSU on Wednesday had nine points continues to grow and this is his third season in the program Second season playing consistently Hastings has two at the foul line Its almost like you you almost have to restart the game for Boston College You know the shots just havent fallen so far So you kind of just reset it That shot selection that you mentioned in the second half against LSU when things were going well early in the second half felt like that was such a key against Harvard as well Its trying to get back to that Still plenty of time in the game George pull up jumper and George as his game today Hes got seven So you got George with seven Pasha with 10 Leading the way for New Haven Its just in rhythm shots right Hes getting to his spot Somebody lost his shoe there Its just a loose shoe on the zone When you get comfortable it makes it easier to get in rhythm Hastings kicks for Forte did a good job to catch and get it for Fred Payne who jumps over the shoe and then Forte for three is no good And now got to tie that a little bit tighter there Tristan Berth just squeezing it in And right now hell hell redo the laces But again just couple steps in Nice little move to create some space there on Rodunovich And then youre in rhythm right Your little fade back You know where that net is You know where that rim is I mean New Haven was taking shots in warmups in the warmup line from just a couple of steps in right They werent driving They were trying to find those spots here on the court and now its paying off for them here in the first half So New Haven to their credit yes Boston College has missed on the offensive end but New Haven doing a nice job to take advantage of it And thats what you got you know its going to like come back at some point So how big a leap can you build until that happens Theres a three Thats no good from Taan Steel freshman from here in Massachusetts from Worcester Had an outstanding career here in Worcester where he led his high school team to two championships North High School here in Worcester Red Payne kicks for Rodonovich 15 to shoot Goes inside for Hastings who was held before that pass was inserted into the paint And the whistle came just in time though Some helpside defense coming coming to try to pick it pick the pockets but on the move You can just see the contact down low on Hastings So he draws another foul Thats five fouls on New Haven in the first half Just one on Boston College 20 to shoot off the reset Hastings backing down Has a size advantage but was pushed out from the paint Finds its way to Asamotto in the game for the first time and he knocks down the three So Jason Oamoda a sophomore coming back to Massachusetts after playing last year with Baylor And thats a big threepoint shot to try to get the Eagles going offensively Again just drawing in two defenders right Find the open player Makes it a much easier shot than a contested three Coming up on the 9minute mark of the first half 1912 NEW HAVEN WIDE OPEN INSIDE AND HASTINGS cheering COMES OUT OF NOWHERE TO BLOCK FIRST Here is Forte right to the basket and the Eagles have a jump Ted Hoting knows it and he calls timeout len of the floor to get over and block that shot Thats 69 on 68 So not a not a huge difference there and yeah Perth just couldnt get up enough and Hastings able to just swat it So New Haven now still 50 from the floor and the lead by five Dear Anthony a freshman from Queens gives off Pasha Hes been the best player so far Little miscommunication there and its turned over to Boston College out of the New Haven timeout Yeah Ver Anthony a four star a fouryear starter at St Francis Prep Was a first team all selection in his conference a season ago as a senior Hes just a hardworking attacking player excited to see how he creates some offense here So New Haven all of a sudden now has not scored in a little over two minutes Well you said it Eric Theres going to be feels like spurts in this one where teams are just going to struggle to find some offense Rodovich thought about the three Gives it back for his point guard Forte driving Forte lost the handle on it and he throws it away to Felopa A little slippery here on this side Falopa coming back down And Fitzpatrick can settle things 17 to shoot for the Chargers Hung up on the 8minute mark of the first half New Haven with the lead by five Weve sat on this score for a bit now And Hastings reaches and takes it away Forte running the floor Forte up and is fouled You love the aggressiveness here for Forte A couple times down just trying to attack and find opportunities This time he attacks and draws a foul Will have an opportunity to bring Boston College within one possession music here at Chestnut Hill Over the last couple of years they went to the Metro So you have some new schools who have you know were traditionally division 2 schools jumping up to the division one level Stonehill Mercyurst Chicago State on that list Le Moine on that list as well And then you have a St Francis Pennsylvania which is going the other way and is going back to Division 3 after the end of this season So its its been a lot of moving parts in that conference But its also a you know decent place to try to build up a little bit in this first division one season Yeah And look they already have a win against Boston College this year with CCSU surprising the Eagles earlier this season So when you think about just kind of the development of the conference and what teams are able to accomplish in their first couple of years or first couple of seasons before moving on or or making that transition it feels like New Haven knows what they can accomplish this season out of the NEC and put up a fight against some of these teams in nonconference Notable after Forte made those two free throws That was the six team foul on New Haven So the Eagles will shoot the rest of this half Trailing by three Trying to get a takeaway and a held ball Possession will stay here Just 26 on the timer for New Haven Up by three here with 727 to go The Chargers still looking for their first points here in the last three and a half minutes Boston College is on a little seven nothing run Yeah defensively the Eagles have done a great job just matching up not allowing players to get through into the paint So theyre forcing tough shots whether its threes or midrange jumpers So credit to BC defense and making those adjustments with Earl Grant Lets see what the setup is for New Haven here Got to go quickly in bounds does come in Got to get it up They do but its short Never hit the rim So possession violation there Trayor the freshman from Harlem couldnt get it on net You look at this New Haven roster too You got players from New York Pennsylvania New Jersey Massachusetts You mix in some international flavor some some players from down south in Texas and and North Carolina So youre getting a lot of players who come from really good basketball hot beds and just putting them all together Again this was Ted Hodling just trying to put everything in the last couple of months or since the announcement in May only had a few months to really get a team together Luca Ts back in and his jumpers good So Taves has seven He had a couple of those turnovers early Settled down a little bit Back into the game now And he hits the jumper Boston College has worked back within one Nine nothing spurt here for BC to answer the nine nothing run by New Haven 177 at one point Now its 1918 George back in for the Chargers Heres Pasha who had an early 10 spinning against Hastings Pasha is no good at that midrange game Couldnt hit the jumper there NBC can take the lead but this is going back the other way Yeah weve seen Pasha hit the three already Find that midrange and attack Didnt have really the numbers down low to try to put that type of shot up where youre kind of fading away You want to try to at least have one blue jersey down there to try to fight for the rebound and put some pressure on Boston College for that defensive rebound That was Hastings first foul Just the second on Boston College Its Patrick goes wide against Capki Brigs down low Pasha finds the outlet and the three is good from Stefano Falopa He was active early but thats his first points of the game And New Haven gets the lead back to four Theyve made four threepointers in music this first half But again credit posture right Instead of forcing a jumper there with the defender on him he finds the pass a skip pass and open three Thats the seventh team foul on New Haven So well see if Boston College at the foul line can get some points back here First lets watch the threepointer Little float pass there from Pasha I thought Kappy was playing great defense but then you got to got to be creative on how you can get that pass through And you said nice little float gets over to Falopa and smooth shot Nothing but the bottom of the net Taves is good on the free throw Boston College five for five from the foul line to start this game That is really a spot where youve seen some of the difference Wins versus losses They were 14 of 21 at the foul line against LSU As a team this year 68 and it felt like it started with Hastings right He got to the free throw line got that big block and then got to the free throw line again Can kind of use it now Youre going to get a lot of foul shots with 529 to go in the bonus you get that build up some of the confidence offensively to sort of go on a little bit of a run Pasha with seven on the timer Jason Oamoto hit that big threepointer Hes back in this one You want to see him just reset kick it back out get it again to reposition Rodanovich Acamoda for three That was strong Payne had a piece of it but the rebound bounces down to Adeli for New Haven whos running the floor Adelie up Adeli thats going to count the basket as Kappy hit the rim going for the rebound attempt So New Haven gets credit and leads 24 to 20 again just attacking the paint right you just go after it a great job going right back at it by Adelai and cant do that before the ball makes contact hustling back but a bit of an unforced error Boston College now down by four Heres Fred Payne Elbow jumper Little strong Good rebound by Kappy and he resets a possession Asamot for Donald Hans Thought about the three instead drives inside and has Acamod for three Little bit strong DC two of 11 from behind the arc And Fitzpatrick is fouled by Taves coming back Weve talked a couple of times about Capkin what hes been able to do just his presence at 611 He was able to track that one down and it felt like he knew immediately he had to go to rim when that shot was coming up and able to create more opportunities for BC on the offensive end Eagles werent able to pay it off but you just like his presence out there and his effort so far Fitzpatrick had his season high 23 points in New Havens first division one win over UMass LOL 18 of those 23 points came in the second half Yeah hes one of those players that once he gets in rhythm its hard to stop And we talked about him a couple years at Felician and he was a great player at North Brunswick Township High School Also attended the Patrick School for a year of prep I mean this kid has had experience and as a junior can really develop with this program in his first year with New Haven and then as a senior kind of trans translate that to the new incoming freshman as well Here is Kapki inside Kapy to his right Couldnt finish at the rim I think he got pushed back maybe a little bit farther That that angle of trying to go off the window wasnt quite there Yeah great defense by Pasha Balopa kicks back Pasha got it Andre Pasha has 13 in the first half Yeah the kid is good The kids good He won NJCAA region 3 athlete of the year for a reason Help Mohawk Valley to that national championship first in school history So this really has been a half of runs It is a seven nothing run for New Haven right now Luca Taves driving lost the handle on it stripped away Here is Adeli who wisely going to reset everything Didnt he think he had the lane to the basket Can tell hes a graduate student right He just knew exactly what to do in that moment Theopa works it back Posasha again this time short but an offensive rebound by Fitzpatrick And I love this right Look back at coach See what you want to do here on the second possession get into a set play Pasha inside to the cutter George will go to the line when we come back 2920 New Haven What a D1 debut here in Boston when you have that consistent scoring Hes a good example of you know he has the threepoint shot and a lot of times we talk about the kind of the midrange game the efficiency of it you know is not what we see you know that game as much as what we saw maybe in years past But when you can hit it as much as he is it still becomes a really effective shot Couple of free throws for George The New Haven Chargers have their largest lead of the game Theyre up 11 with under 3 minutes to go in the first half It is a nine nothing run their second nine nothing run of this first half Eagles have a nine nothing run of their own It wont start a new one here as Staggers stepped on the out of bounds line Sometimes you just forget how close you are to the end line here or the sideline and quick move quick step just stepped on that line here on the near side Really the thing that is kind of a surprise here for Boston College today they have been very good at limiting their turnovers Only averaging a little over 10 per game but they have nine of them in the first half Its Patrick driving against Forte Fitzpatrick cant finish at the rim Decent look with the the spin he put on it You just want to make sure you hit rim or hit some or hit glass or something to get it that momentum to to hit into the rim or something like that because it just felt like he thought he was in a better spot to kiss it off the glass and just missed everything Forte lost his footing and New Haven gets another sequence here Two minutes remaining in the first half and DC just kind of looking for answers right now as they try to get back in Theres a three thats short from Adeli Donald hand back in for Boston College Stagger comes inside the arc around for Kapky 14 to shoot Kapy spinning Catch for Forte Thought about the three Gives it up for Stiger cheering Forte again Forte drives Forte Four on the timer Forte cant hit Naj Jimmyi George with solid defense for New Haven And you can see Fred Payne just trying to encourage his team as he comes off Its you just dont want to force these types of shots Youre down by 11 You You still had four or five seconds Maybe that was the issues Felt a little bit rushed there but that one had no chance And again throughout this one New Haven has never felt under pressure or sped up Even in that in that little bit of a jump theyve been really solid Adeli what a pass inside And the back door cut Its an 11 nothing run for the New Haven Chargers They lead 3320 here in the first half Now Jamie George has 11 Theres a big answer Fred Payne trying to encourage his Eagles to get back in here late in the first half Big shot Big shot by Payne there And we knew it immediately He was coming off the bench He wanted to encourage his team and leading by example on that one First three points of the game for Fred Payne Its a 10point lead for New Haven 23 seconds to go here in half number one Fitzpatrick about a 10second difference here The possession of the game at the end of the half Fitzpatrick against Kapki Hes got to find a way out Fitzpatrick falling away No good 10 to go for Boston College at the end of half number one Its Fred Payne steps into it Payne is short Still time but its taken away and the half comes to an end Turnovers and 12 points in the paint Those are both leading the game over Boston College I think thats got to be point number one for Earl Grant I would guess in the dressing room is that you know this Boston College team this year they really have not turned the ball over So if you can kind of just sh up that piece get back to your game perhaps on the next possession as New Haven comes up the floor there I think that part of what happens is when you get back down like this youre just inevitably forced a little bit right Which can lead to some more of those chances DC gets the ball back here So down by 10 as we start the second half Fred Payne in transition rolling to the basket and Payne scores Five points for Fred Payne BC back with an eight Feels like just mindset wise thats who really has to try to get going for Boston College Fred Payne came in when they were down 13 He wanted to motivate his group He hit a three at the end of that first half Now starts off here in the second half with a big bucket So try to get him going early on and again not forcing shots Jabri Fitzpatrick had four points Felt like he even outsized impact than his scoring Heres Posasha Thats no good from three Aiden Shaw did enough to get a hand in his face So Fred Payne kind of running things right now Payne aggressive take and he scores Thats what you need in moments like this Whos the guy whos just going to take over reset things Payne does He has five in this second half to get BC back within five And again I love it He goes back and hes talking to Donald Han and just saying Hey lets go Lets go Fast ball inside for Pasha Double team there He kicks it out Good catch by Falopa to reset for New Haven Fitzpatrick in and out Offensive rebound though Good effort by Kenny Briggs the senior from North Carolina Fitzpatrick again Cycles around Palop was blocked by Hastings but he couldnt hold it and stay in bounds Still wonderful effort by Jaden Hastings to get out there Go back to this layup by Payne I mean just awesome job moving his body controlling that ball as he goes in and then lets the defender sag off You going to give me that much time and space Im going to nail it Talked about the block by Hastings Thats a couple periods today where he has just gotten all ball threepointer Pasha Thats no good So those two felt a little more force than the ones that he hit so effectively in that first half Payne comes inside Nice little design there Shaw to the basket up and under No but a foul Yeah I thought Shaw got pumped on the first contact He was able to go through and then got hacked on the way through So couple of fouls there Finally one gets called and Shaws another one that it felt like early on he was tracking down offensive rebounds trying to create opportunities See here again on the foul Just great movement in creates that split between Pasha and Falopa and then draws a foul Second foul on Stefano Falopa the junior Aiden Shaw continues the run Neither team has missed a free throw today We talked about some of these players coming for New Haven Falopa who played at UT Martin and started his career in JO trying to find a home here at New Haven Right on Bounce on You admitted it this time at least laughter So one of two at the line for Shaw And Haven looking for their first points of this second half And a foul goes against Luca Taves Thats his second Thats his second personal foul Really just good defensive presence for Boston College Theyre staying with their man Theyre switching when they need to Theyre not falling for the pick and rolls Theyre staying Everythings in front for BC so far Ted Hoting orchestrating the offense for New Haven His 15th season at the helm of the Chargers Fitzpatrick Three on the timer Fitzpatrick tried to get it off and had to rush that pass And it goes off the hands of Adeli And again its Fred Payne causing that disruption to create the turnover He comes in on the help side D forces the air in pass Now BC has a chance Taves And its taken away New Haven forcing another turnover Fitzpatrick driving Throws a fast ball into the first throw was right in between Adelai and George and felt like both of them thought it was going to the other player so none of neither of them moved That one just went right into the crowd Whistle before that shot went up It was Mason Adelai a grad student from Arlington Texas played for Texas Peran Basin in division two last year It was an allconerence third team selection Can I Briggs comes back in for the Chargers Pay Nice little design for Hastings Kicks for Luca Taves Has got cheering 12 points for Taves And Boston College is within one Just a great job with ball movement Not getting too complacent with just taking a any shot and finding the right shot inside a foul as Falopa going up with the right hand Second foul on Aiden Shaw again Just great ball movement You get it down low youre stuck in a tough spot Quick one time pass out to Luca and he hits it Hes shown that he can hit that shot and especially in open space Its a good little run here for Boston College to get back in it Theyre trailing by as much as 13 Balopa was six of seven at the foul line this year coming in today and he makes the first one Junior played last year for Tennessee Martin He averaged just under three points a game Played in 27 after his first couple of years with Monroe College in New Rochelle New York So a little bit of a different second half The fouls elevated much more here at the beginning of and hes helped Boston College climb back in it after trailing by 13 Now the Eagles down by just three here early on in the second half Payne inserts as we restart here 3532 the score New Haven and their first division one season out of the NEC has led by as much as 11 today It was 10 at the break Its just three right now as Payne goes slashing through to the basket and makes it a onepoint game Yeah you just got to lead by example a red shirt sophomore from Louisiana Hes trying to take this game over for Boston College and getting to his spots attacking just great control especially when hes going to the rim Wide open Pasha in and out but an offensive rebounded put back for Stefano Falopa You talked about Falopa his solid frame Hes able to play physically at both ends and inside and stretch outside Saw him get blocked on the threepointer Heres Payne GOT IT AGAIN SOMETIMES WHEN YOURE HOT youre hot A 10point second half for Fred Payne He has taken over Kanti as BC has squared this game at 37 Little give and go Heres George on the drive George slipped inside and traveled Its that extra step that causes the turnover But lets go back to Fred Payne and he is causing some pain for New Haven Nice drive here again Attacking not giving up the body and then nice little step back here Creates some space on Adeli and sends that one in Not only 10 points in the second half for Fred Payne but four of four from the floor and really has been the one running the offense more than the point guards at this point And you cant blame him Donald Hanss Eight to shoot for Boston College Backing down trying to go for Taves It was tipped Got to go with two Taves was off Kind of forced it at the end of the timer Great job by Fitzpatrick keeping the hands low not going into that knowing the shot clock timer was expiring as well Adeli works it back for Falopa And now Fitzpatrick against Taves 10 to shoot Adelie against hand Adelai to his right Double team comes Adelie flips it up and in Mason Adeli finding an answered prayer to put New Haven back up too Payne again with a lob Hastings its out of bounds and possession to New Haven I mean talk about dancing right Look at this Just trying to create an opening Great defense by hand and nothing Adelai can do And even the helpside D from Luca and boom just a nice little kiss off the glass got to know where you are and you know theres players who just practice hitting that spin wherever they are on the court and seeing where they can and how much they they need to rotate it Thats just great moves great eyes by Adelai Nine to shoot Adeli spins right hand He got it Two buckets in a row for Mason Adeli the veteran grad student We talked about for BC somebody stepping up Now for New Haven somebody has to do the same And thats the really impressive one because a couple of times BC has counter punched back the nine nothing run in the first half Kane doing his work in the second half Hes up to 15 but New Haven to their credit with Adeli Couple of buckets to stem the tide for the moment Its a twopoint game right now 1239 to go in the second half Pasha against Hastings And now Fitzpatrick driving and hes fouled by Forte Again it feels like now both teams understand what they have to do to attack the opposing defenses is for Boston College They try to attack that paint generate chances inside While for New Haven its its really just opening up that threepoint shot attack the inside and then kick it out Get those open looks from beyond the arc Adelai from the corner Five to shoot Adelai got another three New Haven buckets in a row for Mason Adelide Another player that brings experience and leadership Donalds Tan thought about it then was trying to go inside for Capi and the foul is called a tug of the jersey against New Haven Thats the third foul on Tristan Berth Eight in total And we talked about getting more scoring for New Haven He has provided that here in the second half Fred Payne a little strong from three So Asamotto back in there for Boston College Kappy as well Earl Grant trying to find answers on the offensive end along with what Payne is doing But its New Haven by four points right now Under 12 minutes to go in the second half Here is George spinning George is fouled And I like that for BC They put Payne now on Adeli and and George to try to get him to slow him down a bit And you can just see the great defense by Payne It just reaches a little bit there at the end to get called for the foul but most part doing a great job keeping George in front of him Its the first foul on Fred Payne Jamie George makes New Haven seven of seven from the foul line today He has 12 points I feel like the first half it was Pasha and George Now youre seeing Adeli And now whos going to step up and join Adeli I told you with George it was really a thought New Haven It was really key to bring him back after a really solid year last year They thought that his game could translate to the division one level but just to see him come out and do it right 14 against Yukon 15 against Penn State 17 against LOL is season high 16 against Delaware State Those are all the D1 games Forte for three is no good offensive rebound though for Bone Capy who goes up and under and draws the foul Thats just a great move on Tristan Perth Gapki who knew immediately he wanted to try to get to that left side try to get it off the glass able to draw the foul Almost a threepoint play but too much spin on it Well go to the line for two That is the fourth foul on Tristan Birth Thats a new Even team that does have some size Weve seen a couple players check in that and interesting enough theyre leaving him in the game right now with 11 minutes to go Holding probably knowing that he has fall on the bench Couple other players he can rely on Earth who averages about 12 minutes a game So this really as you said more about giving some of those big guys a spell Fivepoint game Capy makes one of two and then he is called for a foul up above the key First foul on Bowden Capy after the free throw gave him his first point So Pasha will check in now here for Birth Caleb Steer back in for Boston College Fivepoint game New Haven up on BC 1047 to go here in the second half Adalai bounce pass What a good look that doesnt go from Pasha So he had a couple of good looks here in the second half Just havent fallen at 69 Payne lobbed for Capis too high Jaden Hastings will come back in for BC If you go by the plus minus Hastings has been the best Eagle I mean obviously youd say cheering Fred Payne in a different way but plus minus Hastings plus 14 on the floor today Here is George George to the free throw line and he gives it up First option out there for New Haven Now they go to the second set Here is George spinning George is fouled And again its just New Haven not feeling like theyre being rushed They get these opportunities to attack the paint and its not out of control You know be good defense on a couple of occasions for Boston College Theyre tipping it away and not getting called for a foul But the way New Haven has attacked has allowed that threepoint shot to fall as well as its fallen here today They havent made one here in the second half 0 for five but you keep attacking the paint it creates opportunities George misses at the line The first miss from the foul line for New Haven today One of two for Najimi George whos up to 14 points His sixth time in double figures this year Fred Payne walks into a three Hes cheering got it Payne singlehandedly keeping Boston College in it Ties his career high with 18 points Just phenomenal half here for Fred Payne And again just doing it finding that open space taking his shots Hes feeling it confident George not one rattled in and out and Payne coming back for Boston College Hands off Asamoto the trailer Asam gets BC within one So its not just the scoring for Payne but its the play Yeah he is driving everything right now And interesting cuz Earl Grant has neither one of the Eagles point guards on the floor Hes trusting Payne to run the offense And Payne is doing a wonderful job of it at the moment as BC works its way back in New Haven looking for their first field goal in three minutes Adeli lost his footing And I love it Fred Payne just pointed down said My time my time And it is his time Keep going Fred Pay I mean talk about attacking keeping Boston College in it Hes put the Eagles on his shoulders and he needed to in a really significant way Fred Payne who had seven points against LSU he had at least 10 in his prior six games So the seventh time this year hes in double figures for the most part Hes been very good for Boston College this year And he hits Donald who is good from three And BC is back in front First points of the game for Donald and they couldnt have come at a bigger moment First lead for Boston College in this one Its an eight nothing run by BC to get them the lead 4846 Fitzpatrick driving and hes fouled on the floor before the shot Now if youre Ted Huddling how does your team respond Right How how do you get a response after this run for Boston College Youve been on the front foot throughout the entire game Now you face a deficit cheering So all the scoring that you talked about and then backto back assists as well for Fred Payne Free throw good after the foul on Oamoto It just felt like there was something at the end of the first half as Fitzpatrick makes the free throw that he knew that he had to do something and he comes in hits that threepointer makes 13point game a 10point game and then to start this second half goes right back to what was working for him in that first Hes not giving up the ball easily unless its a lob for Hastings whos fouled before he goes up with that shot Hastings to the line when you come back to Ki What a finish this has the potential to be Points here in the second half six of seven from the floor 18 points in total two assists four Fred Bane to go along with three rebounds as well in 26 minutes And again it was a tough game against LSU just seven points They didnt have the rhythm didnt find the shots So this is a great turnaround game And you talked about Earl Grant as the free throw goes there for Hastings Ear Grant talked about it He has the potential to have a breakout season and this could be that game that really allows him to come alive Well I think its showing you a couple of things right It its showing you the the and look we still have 8 minutes to go here but its showing you the mental piece of every team is different and you cant you know organically assign who the the guy is for lack of a better word It it has to happen organically And you see in this moment that was a that was a locker room I would imagine after that first half was like All right somebodys got to go figure this out And to Fred Paynes credit its been him But then from the basketball side of it as first fits Patrick for three is no good Its about having Fred Pay play point guard and and that in itself has been the biggest difference here in the last four or five minutes Yeah great ball control and like that in and out that time on another good look But again it it creates a good look Eric Its not like hes contested on that He had the pick and roll It created the little shed off and enough space where hes hit some shots here tonight So good look and and now six of eight here in the second half Bob lo inside Pasha gives it off for George Balopa again whos open Its Fitzpatrick who is short from three Little bit of pressure on from Hastings That does enough to affect the shot New Haven has not made a shot from the floor in over five minutes Thats allowed BC to come back They hold the lead of one right now Pay to the basket No good there And a rebound for George 637 to go Balopa Right back for George And now New Haven can run their offense The driving Fitzpatrick is blocked by Asamod Stayed with that play really well And now Asamod on the run Stripped to the end and out of bounds It will stay here with BC 622 to go in this second half Shows you how dangerous Oamoto can be right He can grab a rebound and just run the floor all the way down Sophomore from Lynn Massachusetts And well Fred Payne is going to get a nice ovation here as he heads to the bench But take a look here Great defense Youre just in between trees You dont want to put that up Youve got 69 and 68 over you Asamot Thats a two and its good Jason Boston College leads by three Seven points for the BC sophomore Couple of good shots for Austin Saw one early on and then that one Great rhythm New Havens done so much well today but the offense has got to come right now A drive by Briggs and he is fouled going through the paint I think BC realizes thats what New music Havens plan is right now Just attack the paint So theyre not cheating to the outside once they penetrate that defense So for New Haven youve got to start mixing in some fake passes some pump fakes get BC in the air and create some openings Free throw is good First points of the game for Kenny Briggs the senior played at U Albany last year Charleston Southern for a game before that Then Indian Hills Community College Couple of free throws for the senior Adelide comes back in New Haven still within one 601 to go in this second half Going to see a lot of the offense getting into set plays here late on high quality shots especially in a close contest whistle away from the ball and was trying to fight through the screen but Jimmy George just didnt allow him to to work his way through and going to get called to the foul His first Both teams are in the bonus at this point with 544 remaining in regulation How about Hastings Yeah Pasha thought there was a lane violation so he didnt even go up with Hastings Hastings just had an easy dunk put back Five points for Jaden Hastings and a timeout by New Haven The shot about 50 seconds ago of game time and ruled that it was a three not a two music So thats why Boston College is now up by four 5450 our score with 533 to go in this second half New Haven on offense again They have not made a shot from the floor in over 6 and 12 minutes Theyve missed five straight Thats turned over But Donalds hand falling back Stepped out of bounds So look as much as all is positive for New Haven you give a lot of credit for me in this game I mean if they cant find a way to score its you know theyre obviously not going to be able to get back from this fourpoint deficit Yeah And again credit to BC defense The bigs have done a great job in the paint protecting and creating turnovers and closing out Weve seen Hastings with a couple blocks and just a couple of good strips on the defensive end by Payne as well Theyve been held to 17 points in this second half after 33 in half number one Falopa kicks and they get a blocking foul against Boston College and Luca Taves Kathy Tay just kind of tried to draw it fell backward and then took Felopa out I think if Philopa didnt trip on Luca there then maybe you let the play on But you can see here just try to pull it back And then right there is where the foul got called So if he doesnt take him down then maybe its okay you play on But now you got free throw chances And to the credit of New Haven they have hit their free throws today And its why even though they havent made much from the floor here in the second half they are hanging in this game They are 14 for 15 at the foul line Still havent scored from the floor in now almost 7 minutes So BC up by three with 5 minutes left This is that crunch time that Earl France talked about so much Donalds hand for three Hes made two big threepointers in the second half BC with its largest lead today 5751 They have made six of their last eight from the floor while New Haven has gone cold George no Hastings the rebound Bad time for New Haven Again we talked about trying to find threepoint shots Dont want to shoot it behind your own teammate And with the BC defender closing in you still want to find high quality shots And New Haven is 0 for9 from three in the second half Han looking for an outlet Nine to shoot for Hastings Hastings kicks Luca Taves is no good Would have been huge though It would have changed the momentum here inside of Connie Would have been a huge shot But now New Haven with another chance Even with that miss BC seven threes in this second half What a massive difference and part of the reason they have come back to take the lead 5751 You see the shooting numbers in the third or in second half I mean its just its been massive and that thats been such a talking point for this Boston College team this year That threepoint shot coming into play today 28 just under eight threes made per game But obviously theres the Donald Han part of it specifically but just as a group its felt like its been much more quality shot selected threepointers in this second half Its now back to back games cuz it happened in the second half of LSU as well where they found better threepoint shots and went five of 10 in that second half as well Asamot getting a lot of time here late in the game Hastings a tip but it was on the rim Earl Grant thinks it was coming off on the near side but Earl Grants going to think about maybe asking to challenge this Says No not all right And I think thats correct It was It was close but did look in real time like it was still slightly on the rim So New Haven has not made a shot from the floor folks in almost 9 minutes Theyve hit their free throws to their credit 16 of 18 But can they find some offense here late Its still just a fourpoint game George seven to shoot George against hand Good defensive effort from Donald H Just forced them back deep enough under the basket music that it was such a tough look for George And then the helpside D George really had nowhere to go 3 minutes left Forte in Forte drives and is fouled applause I think Jabri Fitzpatrick has a argument here Hes a little upset but foul is called And lets go back to this defense by hand Youre going to see him come over and not just allow George to get to the spot And then again forces him in deep arms up doesnt jump keeps his feet at bay Thats the type of defense you want to see inside the paint To their credit Boston College 10 for 14 from the foul line That ends a little twominute scoreless drought for the Eagles New Haven just four of 17 from the floor overall in this second half This game is still right there but they have to find some offense here in short order Can they do it Fitzpatrick can he do it He did JABRI FITZPATRICK Now its about the defense right We talked about a game of runs early on Can they go on a little bit of a run here after that big shot by Fitzpatrick They ruled out a two on the floor So its still a threepoint game Asamod cannot answer 223 to go They may take a look at that as well Fitzpatrick driving Fitzpatrick scores Its a onepoint game again Thats huge Thats huge for Fitzpatrick Looked like he may have put too much on it but it just died down on the rim after going home Columbia team out of the Ivy League You play Penn State at home I mean this is a team thats going to music go through ups and downs and this is one of those games that can really be a big turning point for recruiting for the future And I think the point is just you know theyve there were a few moments this game could have just kind of been done the other way And New Haven to their credit has stayed in Now all of a sudden DCs the team 3 minutes without a make from the floor So back to Taves running the offense Heres Donald Tans Eight to shoot Hands falling away No But an offensive rebound for Hastings He goes UP STRONG AND IS BLOCKED FOLLOWUP CHANCE NO but a foul applause Yeah Philippo over the back Thats great initial defense by Pasha and I thought Falopa did well until that just extended hand went over the back there Youre going to see it here A great attack by hand Just couldnt get a quality shot off But look at that interior work just going back up and drawing the foul Hastings makes the first free throw That foul was the third on Falopa So just something to watch there Not crazy yet but Fitzpatrick with three Falopa with three The lead is back to three Seven points for Jaden Hastings Looks like theres going to be a time If we have a fivepoint lead can we get it to 10 If we have a 10point lead can we get it to 13 Theyre up three right now with 142 to go in this second half from Kanti Forum Its Patrick Pasha was so good in that first half Hes on it now Adelai 13 to shoot Valopa goes for Fitzpatrick against Taves Six to shoot for New Haven Got to go Threepointer Fitzpatrick No but an offensive rebound And a foul is on Taves If thats Taves its five So Luca Taves I think he was shooting too Yeah Luca Taves fouls out of this game with 118 to go Both teams look like theyre going to try to use it as a mini timeout The official is over Maybe Im not sure if theyre looking at whether it was a shooting foul or not He sees in the double bonus so it shouldnt matter So maybe they were just checking on the fouls But Luca Taves thats his fifth He fouls out 12 points or Luca Taves Nine of those came in the first half So its a threepoint game and more free throws here Stefano Falopa the junior cheering came in six of seven on the year and hes now four for five at the line today But you had mentioned this point Eric is the free throws have really kept New Haven in it here in the second half through moments of missing shots But youre right especially New Haven cuz it was what it was nine minutes I guess y without a make from the floor They have four guys in double figures now as Fopa makes both of those He has 10 Its a onepoint game 108 to go Boston College and New Haven down to the wire at Kanti Fred Payne for Forte And now its Donald Hans Eight to shoot Hand pull UP JUMPER HANDS GOT IT Big time shot for Donald BC back to a threepoint edge Huge shot Han was looking for it Got to his spot Nice release Nice little fade to create some separation as well New Haven does have one more timeout if they need it 40 seconds to go in the game 14 to shoot for the Chargers Adeli and they will take the timeout 364 to go 12 to shoot Into the back court Adeli Where does New Haven go when they need a bucket here Down by three Five to shoot Adeli Threepointer over Hastings No good Good defense by Boston College I dont think that was the look Pasha on the peel off He kind of comes back out He is wide open for that second Watch here Look hes open right there You spun around Fred Payne That was the idea Got to dish that off I mean it was a quality look right He still gets it over the defender Still gets it on rim Couldnt quite see it And so now Donald Tan at the foul line Crucial one to make it a two possession game Cannot hit the front end That last foul was on George by the way and makes that one So he gets the one he needed Fourpoint game 248 to go Remember New Haven does not have a timeout Fitzpatrick 18 left in the game Fitzpatrick cheering will go to the foul line with 175 to go second personal foul team And yeah you like it You if youre New Haven youre not forcing up a three in a bad one Definitely dont need to force yet Thats unforte Its his second And Ted Hoting basically using that first free throw as a timeout for his team besides the free throw shooter because remember he does not have any got two at the foul line Fitzpatrick Pretty impressive Eight for eight from the strike You see gets it in and a quick foul recorded by Nimi George Its quick Its just one less than a second off the clock there So BC is now 13 for9 at the foul line Donald Tanned 1 for3 His free throws have been better recently after a tough start to the year Had been 27 of 32 in his last six after 14 of 27 to start Made one of two the last time This time makes the front end And now this can get it again to a twopossession game 10 points for Donalds hand All of them in the second half Got both 11 for Donald Tans 6561 Fitzpatrick going right in Fitzpatrick Quick bucket Fitzpatrick with 16 Eagles have to inbound again and again Its Donald Tan whos quickly fouled by Nimi George 23 That is the fourth foul against George Just good move They pulled this off Yeah Fitzpatrick he he has great movement Once he gets in hes able to be shifty and maneuver that ball again and you get the quick fouls you still have time Maybe a missed free throw Still a one possession game And Ham again makes the front end So hes done his job at the line here Well see if he can complete it one more time to get this to a fourpoint game once again He does Good work by Donald Dan down the stretch here at the line again No timeouts for New Haven Down by four Fitzpatrick is fouled by hand And again Fitzpatrick knew where to go Right Hes going right at Donald H Chargers So again Fitzpatrick who has been so steady down the stretch but misses the front end applause cheering His first miss from the line in nine tries this afternoon Now the question is do you try to miss it here keep possession back or do you make the free throw and still try to play that long game 76 to go Fitzpatrick screaming Short rebound though Got to go to the corner Just two seconds left GEORGE HOY NOT ENOUGH TIME BC holds off New Haven What a wonderful effort by the New Haven Chargers in their first D1 season But BC does enough down
