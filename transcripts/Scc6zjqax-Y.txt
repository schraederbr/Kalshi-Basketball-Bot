those things Five and six Florida State center circle and the NLES they win the tip right to left on your television McGee has the basketball Kobe McGee this Florida State team 9769 loss to Dayton on Tuesday night in the state of Ohio A game that was 4231 at halftime Early shot by the nullles goes out of bounds And Aria whats been happening the last few games and we kind of talked about it and thats what Luke L is talking about 40 points in the paint a night by opponents for Florida State the last three games and 19 points in transition points and hes just got to shut that down defensively Starting lineup for the Delta Devils Punch Holmes James Sams and MZ Musa and Zayn The big man there on your screen Number 10 with the ball Michael James He is the star for Mississippi Valley State averaging nearly 21 points per game He turns the basketball over Somerville on the catch McGee ball rotation McCrae lets it fry and he knocks it down from that left corner Robert McCrae McGee Somerville Jones and Steam The starting lineup Its been McCrae whos led Florida State in scoring north of 14 points per game on the year 16 points per game over the last four closing in on 1300 in his career Delri Holmes has the ball into the corner Three ball Yes the response from the Delta Devils That was Patrick Punch knocking it down Patrick Punch can shoot the ball Hes probably the second best scoreer on this team tonight for Mississippi Valley State McGee bounce pass down low to State Jones tries his hand in a triple That ones too strong Rebound collected by the Delta Devils but they throw it away right back to Florida State McCrae right corner on the wing Triple is good Kobe McGee has been really shooting the basketball at a high clip over the last five games And hes capable He did it when he was before he transferred from Drexel but youre right 39 these last five games Hes really knocking it down deep hit three of them against Dayton on Tuesday night McGee into the scoring book with three Nulls by three Trying to force turnovers on the drive The shot no foul called Lamont Sams headed to the line And McGee if he can set his feet you can see right there he can do it all night long Hes just in rhythm every time he shoots that three Hes the hardest working guy out here as far as getting his jump shots up But I give Steen the hard worker But McGee can shoot it McGees talking to associate head coach Jim Moran as Sans to the line First free throw knocks it down Lamont Sam 69 graduate transfer playing in his fourth school averaging Nearly eight points per game and four rebounds Its a welltraveled squad for Mississippi Valley State Might only have eight players available here tonight The Delta Devils team out of the swack who has only one victory on the year Split the free throws Nolles by two McGee who just hit the three Ball fake attack his own defense from Mississippi Valley State Steen control back door was looking for McGee Threw it away Deflected Transition opportunity Poked from behind Nullles create a turnover Jones leaves his fate in the game Ball rotation Somerville triple Thats off to the left whistle and a foul on the Delta Devils Somervilles another one thats shooting the ball really well recently Arya 41 from three Yeah hes done a nice job And to your point Jacob hes hit two or more threes eight times this season and hes hit at least one in every single game for Florida State They brought Somerville from UMass Low where he was the rookie of the year in the America East Hes done a nice job for Florida State right Been the most consistent deep threat theyve had so far in the early portion of the year Youre right about that Hes at 10th in the ACC at 24 threes a game for Florida State and with him and the other perimeter shooters You got McGee out there Le Jay Jones that can shoot it McCrae can shoot it Even Stes capable of knocking it down but theyve got a good perimeter shooting lineup out there tonight And if they move the ball like they did on that last possession theyre good Its like shooting ducks on a pond out there for those guys Someville hits all three See a Florida State team that does want to rip it from beyond the arc Second in the country only to Charleston Southern in attempts per game This is something Florida State really worked on today in a spirited shoot around Got after fullourt pressure in traffic McCrae trying to be a little too cute And Luke Ls expression when that happens summed it up as too cute But youre right that was one of the most live shootounds Ive been to in quite some time They were going full on full sweat contact Create the turnover off a deflection McCrae McGee spot up shooter left and short offensive rebound Somerville Jones on the baseline reversal McCrae three That one rattles out Steen one of the best offensive rebounders in the country pulls it down A third chance Somerville That ones too strong And now a fourth opportunity And guess who Mr Hustle Alex Ste creates a foul from Mississippi Valley State I think they got Musa Imzane on the hold there He had Steam totally clamped down so he couldnt get off the floor to grab that rebound And as you noted he can corral some offensive loose balls Something Luke Lau told his team today as they circled after the shoot around They said Dont quit on your team Dont quit on your yourself Were not going to quit on you Its been a tough stretch as James fouled on the drive Will that be in the act of shooting or on the floor The game was back there Sorry about that Ara But James the Meridian Community College transfer junior here for Mississippi Valley State is an absolute scoring machine Hes like their true threat Hes a high volume shooter So hes going to drop points Hes right at 21 points a game but usually hes jacking threes from deep cheering but hell take it to the rim also as hes just showed us He knocks down the first of two Had 32 points in a game in College Station at Texas AM earlier this season You see the numbers and hes already received some accolades in the slack A true bucket getter and I think one of the players in the conference you got to keep an eye on throughout the year No question But the problem is hes such a big bucket getter His cheering value to them their success is totally dependent upon how many points he puts on the board As Jacob mentioned the leading scorer for Mississippi Valley State Michael James the Junior They put him at 61 Are you But Id put him more like 510 Probably more accurate Ball rotation around the zone McGee fires away off to the left Rebound in the corner Pulled down by Somerville Now Cam Miles whos checked into the game He buries the triple Dont be counting that shooter out either the freshman can absolutely knock it down from deep himself Luke La called him fearless Cam Miles whos had an excellent year attacking the rim from beyond the arc has had some struggles but thats a good start for the freshman from Chicago Hes so quick with the ball and can just get wherever he wants to Really can so comfortable driving by people Told him earlier today I said Hey man you look confident as he got after the basketball he said Im from Shy Town To coaching Luke LS and Luke had that same situation as a senior where coach Hamilton and our staff had to get him together and tell him how he needed to grab the bull by the horns and be a leader and take control verbally and not just do it on the floor Nice back door cut for two points for the Delta Devils How much of a difference does it make when the teams are player you know its so much smoother and Cam Miles is always smooth going to the rim even when he gets fouled but cuz thats who youre with You and as Luke LS talked about you hold your teammates accountable and he just breaks him down that crossover dribble and draws that contact off MZ getting right at the rim I love the way these guys attack and thats one of the things Coach L talks about is go to the rim until they stop you And right there MZ cant stop him get there MCs got slow feet a little bit for a big man playing at this level Cam Miles hits the first of two free throws Its a Florida State team that needs a couple of guys who can break down ball excuse me defenders off the ball and on the ball to be able to get downhill towards the rim Miles might fit that profile for Florida State as he continues to grow Youre spot on with that Arya because because the bigs of Florida State are not as big as the bigs theyre going to face on big as a lot You know the post players are are not quite as tall as what theyre going to face in the ACC As Miles gets that second one theyre going to have to take advantage of getting big men out of position You draw them out of position by penetration When they help then you give it to your post player for the weak side which Steen is a machine at playing short corner crashing to the glass Couple of free throws from Miles Nolles Extend the lead to seven Heres James working against Swinten into the ball game Looking for help Four on the clock He just turns fires it almost banked it in Long rebound Swinton pushed up ahead Miles on the attack Hes fouled And James got it That was a bit excessive on both ends but veteran crews I know Tim Clocky personally and we were just chatting before the game His father was a bigtime official and director of officials for the ACC at one point But Tim was saying theyve got a lot of good young officials And one of the things the young officials dont understand is how to communicate with players And thats exactly what Tim just said He said you know James Michael James dont be doing that Were not going to take that tonight Yeah early on especially Phil Coington Jr as you mentioned Tim Clardy and Ben Stur the officials here tonight Nice flush off the miss from Maloo Hey they need more they need more of that out of Valier Hes got to finish He He has a tendency to want to lay it up there softly but you got to get the basket And no better way than jamming it home Perhaps some early confidence for Maloop the sophomore 10point advantage for the NL Theyve been flying around on defense and create another turnover foul on MF on MVSU off the rebound Aar just crashes behind them And look at Cam Miles reaction baby Thats the thing that Luke was talking about Coach L was talking about D This team still believes in each other Even though theyve lost some games they have not turned their backs on myself Cam Miles response right there after missing a free throw away from the ball Offensive foul to get to their seasons average nightly So George Ivory takes him out Gives him a chance for a breather He does have two early fouls Michael James the leading scoreer with two fouls Wiggins into the game for Florida State Maloop on the catch to the corner Swinton his three ball No Somerville offensive rebound Ball is loose Maluks got it underneath the basket An intercepted pass was taken away by Punch He was about to fall out of bounds Ara so he did the best he could to try to save it and get it in but not a bad play by Aar Tough for him to get the turnover Chance Sutton has the basketball into the game from Dallas Texas The junior rotates it over to Xavon Barnett Sutton turning and working against Wiggins Forces it up No good Strong rebound by Swinton Into the hands of Miles Wiggins Catch and shoot Three Too strong Rebound collected by Mississippi Valley State Punch has it Here comes the trap foul on the NLES Thatll be on Somerville George Ivory the head coach with the Delta Devils in his fifth year in the Valley Its the first ever meeting between the two schools And Coach Ivory was at Arkansas Pine Bluff who took over for Lindseay Hunter former NBA star with the Detroit Pistons Its been a tough go through five years They have less than 10 wins in those five years Its a proud program that has made two NCAA tournaments this millennium and has three postseason trips right with an NIT as well Its just hard you know in todays world where kids can transfer players can transfer immediately You cant keep anyone Id be shocked if James is back next year You may not be able to transfer to the ACC but you can transfer to the OBVC You know its an upgrade and its what kids are looking for Thats a fair point a whistle away from the vault and a foul on the Delta Devils is all George Ivory can do is look on to his team who has already fouled seven times So we havent reached eight minutes So the NOS are in the bonus for the rest of the half Its almost a foul a possession Theyre going to the monitor to make sure its not more than just a common foul And as you weve talked about it earlier and you said it with them coming up short on some guys tonight and leaving home probably their best defensive player and their their best athlete Daniel Mayfield not here tonight So thats its frustrating for Mississippi Valley State in the position theyre in against a full roster They may be looking at the old NBA kickout flop here Which Right Exactly That leg coming out No contact You cant do that I think all they changed really was who the foul was on It was on five chance Either way Miles will shoot the one and one for a siminal team looking for some momentum Just some optimism as they take on Mississippi Valley State and JU Jacksonville University on Monday Luke LS telling us who remembers back with Golden State right Steph Clay Draymond said The year after we won the world title in the NBA finals it was right before co And we lost something like 10 games in a row Nobody feels bad for you No ones coming to save you 15 Are you a bigger stretch than you could like I I remember that stretch You know we were keeping up with it and it was tough man And and to come back the next year and bounce right back cheering And theres the defense Luke LZ is looking for And you know hes working on some defense and he told us earlier in the season he wanted to trap and speed the game up but he wants he wants the recovery on defense right You got to do your rotations Its right here Good rotation on this trap Not just a one guy over there You got two guys trying to pin him in Offensive foul going the other way Aar Maluke is almost about to become a professional moving screen guy He gets one about every game Hes still young Hes a Hes a sophomore but hes really a freshman because he reclassified his senior year of high school to get here at Florida State So you cant really hold it Hes still learning the game Corner three there Not going to go Its going to go out of bounds and itll be Florida State B you from adversity Its like its about life you know its a game is teaches you everything about growing up as a man and thats what he wants these guys to learn and he music learned that like we talked about just a minute ago He learned that at Golden State and the funny thing is he was a defensive coordinator for Florida State for Golden State and Luke couldnt guard a shadow in college Swen on the catch around the zone Miles three ball count it Big shot there for Cam Miles Hes got a couple of triples cheering Miles with 11 He leads Florida State in all scores to that right corner The response thats not going to fall from punch Rebound collected by Florida State Miles has had the hot hand The freshman eyes a three to McCrae Back to Miles Crosscourt Wiggins His corner three off to the right Steen doing what Alex Steen does Rips down another Oboard Hes going to the line He is so tough and just goes through the player and anything he needs to go through teammate or opponent to try to get that rebound And Wiggins in the corner still struggling a little bit from deep but Steens in there giving every ounce of energy hes got And hes been nursing that little injury thats thats hurt his mobility and limited his aggressiveness but hes obviously got it back tonight almost four offensive rebounds a game and that leads the ACC top 25 in the country Theres his family Panama Citys finest I drove in to the game tonight and I saw a bunch of people out in the parking lot parking lot having a tailgate and I saw the steam on the back of somebodys shirt I was like that must be his family coming over from Panama City And good work by the camera folks drawing them in for us his sister Ashley there on the screen Hoops and track star at Arnold High School as well a biomedical engineering student at Georgia Tech On the reverse Nice That was Chance Sutton the junior from Dallas Hes more of a defender but hey dont leave him open Hell cut back door on you Miles turns to Wiggins His pass intercepted and falling down losing the ball out of bounds was Barnett They are going to say last touch by Florida State Theyre actually going to call a foul McCrae running along beside of him Bumped him right about the time he was about to make his cut creating that contact McCrae will pick up some cheap fouls on the perimeter Thats one of his deficiencies Hes such a distributor and a facilitator for the team You love him out there but he has a tendency to overdefend at times kind of sloppily with his hands He was one of five nullles who fouled out on Tuesday night at Dayton Id have tried to foul out too No 47 free throw attempts for the Flyers in that game They hit 40 of them That That was a crazy stab They had 21 extra points at the free throw line Its like thats unbelievable Another turnover from the Delta Devils Thatll be their seventh It is a Florida State team top five in the country in turnovers forced on the defensive side An MVSU team that turns the ball over amongst the most in college basketball this season FSU leads by 15 Wiggins backs down his defender Turnaround jumper and its pure midrange Jay from Chanty Wiggins The transfer from Clemson He loves Kevin Durant and thats a Kevin Durant style move But I like to see him getting in closer to the rim to get some confidence and see that ball go through the net Itll help that deep outside jumper fall a little easier for him And 14 points against Houston in the HTown Classic against Kelvin Samsons Cougars Swinton his three is good An improving threepoint shot for AJ Swintson and he knocks it down Swint really is more known for his athleticism but you nailed it Hes working on that per perimeter jumper 299 Sams wants it himself and nearly missed it all That might have grazed the front iron McCrae working against Sams Attacks the middle of that zone Somerville open triple Thats good I like the ball movement McCrae got inside Even though he bobbled the ball still could have got the shot up but kicking it out to his teammate And Coach Ivory wants to kick it to his team And that was highlighted by 17 assists against Alorn State in the season opener He really put himself on the map in college basketball at this level He got out of the gates early on that But hes also had two other games with 11 assists He is a big time facilitator Youre right And he tied for the lead in assists per game for the ACC And his companion there is Trey Donaldson a Tallahassee native just down at Miami No doubt about that But song the drive does it himself Coast to coast from the freshman huh The Frenchman freshman baby He is coming along We talked about him at shootaround today on how hes developing his game Frenetic pace nulls causing turnovers Finger roll from McGee Thats some of that Take it to the rim till they stop you Thats a motto that LS has got Kobe McGee not really a guy known for putting it on the floor area but they give you the lane Go on in there and get that layup Fifth assist for Robert McCrae The fifth And Ansleys point earlier McCrae has done it not just vocally with leadership but hes done it on the court scoring the basketball had 29 points against the Florida Gator in that contest averaging north of 16 a game in his last four Hes done it in multiple ways on the offensive end but defensively theyre working on it right Ball defense on ball defense staying in front of his man is a foul will take us to a media timeout 36 to9 Nolles on top of the Delta Double in threes made per game only trailing Louisville in that category McCrae nearly played safety to try and pick it off Couldnt get to it as he goes down James has the ball An old team thats hit eight threes in every single game Theres a whistle on Is it on Bong It is That is Florida States seventh team foul So it should be a oneonone And it is Bill Cington right there He had him kind of wrapped up from behind and we got Robert McCrae on the screen right there you know he was a football player too growing up and and really good and kind of had to make a decision but he he attributes that to helping his toughness was his football experience Michael James has been in double figures every game so far this year for Mississippi Valley State and he got in foul trouble early which has kind of hurt them holding them at nine points No one else out there put the ball in the net What if you like the way the Florida States defended them And theyve done a good job You know they are rotating Theres more effort on defense And thats one of the things coach L is talking about He needs out of these guys is their effort and focus Tries to pull the midrange Jay himself in transition You can see James just trying to get going in this basketball game He is a high volume guy Hes going to shoot it when he has it and get his own The song from Paris nearly traveled was able to keep his pivot foot works at the top of this two3 zone Wiggins left corner under 10 on the shot clock Nolles turn it over Easy pass chanty Throw it to the top Dont try to throw it across the floor Theres too many arms in the way defensively Seventh turnover from Florida State That has been an area that needs improvement Perloop Clax over the last three or four games They had 20 turnovers against the Dayton Flyers Anthony Grants defense known at multiple stops for creating that pressure with the fullcourt traps Yes hes cheering he did it at Alabama learned it at Florida under Billy Donovan and cutting back door Dale Kendrick Holmes with the finish That was big time there from the junior from Pine Bluff Arkansas Highlight real play from Holmes McCrae pulls a three Count it not a facilitator only Hes been phenomenal for Florida State so far this year Been up and down at times right scoring the basketball but hes been consistent One thing he hasnt been is selfish with it Thats the key Its like he doesnt force shots doesnt worry about padding his stats when things arent going good Strong move to the bucket and patience from Barnett leads to two Great job Barnett backing down Somerville kind of got him on the floor really with the contact and finished McCrae no look pass ball movement Somerville fires a three rattles out And Jacob what do you want to see from both of these teams Final five minutes of the half Well to play hard right You need You dont want to coast in defensively You want to get back Both teams need to get back on defense better Neither one of them are truly hustling back on defense and as people are attacking the rim theyre either getting fouled or scoring and its happening on both sides right now So Id like to see them pick up their pace Now its a hard thing for Mississippi Valley State Theyre shorthanded tonight Theyre shorthanded every night music but theyre definitely shorthanded tonight So the pace of Florida State wears them down as you see Xavon Barnett about to get his free throws up To your point five guys are out unavailable for Mississippi Valley State And coach Ivorys group cheering only played eight in their last game against Tarlton State So far tonight like theyve played another eight in this one Xavon Barnett is cheering not a great free throw shooter So lets see cheering Hes got a good looking shot though Knock that one down Hey how about it This averages 44 Thats why I was kind of concerned Ari was eight of 18 coming in Knocked down those two Thatll help the average now baby There you go 395 Its been all Florida State in this one Somerville on the right wing No look pass Wiggins flushes there again Once again great pass by Somerville He penetrated sucking that zone to And when they helped up Somerville did what youre supposed to do Shoot it down to the guy on the short corner Four points for Wiggins Ball thrown away Was it last touched by Florida State Was there a deflection There was not Itll belong to the NLES As Wiggins an ACC competitor Jacob they really do need him to be a presence at least somewhat inside And thats what he needs to bring He needs to score at whatever they give him If its short corner take it If its out deep take it But just show your leadership That experience he had at Clemson going to the Elite 8 contributing on that team like he did They need that from Chanty Wiggins The song finds himself alone for three and he makes him pay The Frenchman folks I love saying that But the Frenchman baby he came in they were concerned about his outside shooting and hes really developing into a threepoint shooter Calling the Parisian as well played for the U19 France national team in the Fever World Cup during the summer in Switzerland stepping on the line Itll be another turnover there for the Delta to back here at the top and theyll break for the holidays Come back ACC play begins and it is a doozy for FSU right out of the gate in a Atlantic Coast Conference that has rebounded well from the last couple of years Done really well in nonconference play Everyone reloaded in the league as best they could to get ready and not have what happened the last couple of years especially last year Wiggins one of the ACC transfers knocks it down and one counted And Arya we were just talking about Wiggins in the timeout off air that he needs to keep doing what hes doing and get inside and score And Im loving it Hes struggling with his jumper a little bit but here he is going in the paint with selling that pump fake with his shoulders and getting the third foul on James Thats a crucial blow for Mississippi Valley State But for Wiggins his mother is a Missouri State Hall of Fame His dad played at Witchah State in the early 90s You know family huh Big time basketball family Two good schools Witchah State folks Thats some hooping out there Now shout out to the Wiggins family On the turn there Oh someone tipped it in Was it a null Was it friendly fire Looked looked like a white uni to me baby It counts all the same for the Delta Devils Miles dribbled it out of bounds Last touch by Anull Little bit of a force by Miles He was trying to turn the corner He had Kobe McGee wide open in the far corner but hes had such success Miles had as penetration Hes probably just trying to get what hes doing but I know where hes coming from If he gets in he can still pitch it back out to McGee Two and a half to play in this opening stanza Florida State leads by 30 4717 Sams fade away Baseline jumper No rebound Wiggins Siminals want a run Trigger the break McGee puts the ball on the deck Reach around and a foul calleds Its the bonus for Florida State So McGee will be at the line I like the bringing the ball up the floor and kicking it not putting your head down like a bulldozer and trying to get to the rim They closed it off with that zone and Wiggins did the smart thing and kicked it out McGee trying to be unselfish on the pass he would he could have got to the rim Obviously coming in as McGee knocks down the first expected to be a lopsided score It was a 40point spread If you look at the Vegas odds what have you liked from what Florida States done Have you noticed anything that theyve improved upon over the last couple of games Well they look better offensively and and and its more about like on their face like they feel better about how theyre playing offensively and they are giving better effort on defense like coach L talked about and their focus of rotating properly Hes getting some of what he wants Hes not going to think its perfect like no coach but they are giving more defense Theyre not giving up transition points like they have been which has been a crucial boy for them and points in the paint Theyve kind of stopped that too 4917 Couple free throws from McGee underneath the basket Terrific defense from Maloo Forces Chance Sutton out of bounds One of the things down low on the baseline is your best friend is the baseline On defense use that as another defender because you can pin him in Its like a trap And thats what Aalier Maloop just did had him pinned down He couldnt go anywhere and he stepped out of bounds McGee probed that baseline kick out In the end McCrae leaves it short from beyond the arc Chased down by Sams and the Delta Devils will have it 90 seconds to play in the half MVSU the turnover their 14th ball thrown ahead and a touchdown pass to McGee over the top Got to love it Catching like a wide receiver Florida State has made 56 of their field goals here in this first half They forced a ton of turnovers Now 15 first half turnovers for Mississippi Valley State And off the steel Cam just tosses it down and McGee in stride Great pass good point guards can throw those big long passes and and get you right in rhythm And Cam Miles is showing you what hes good at Thats running a point 11 points two assists Hes gotten to the free throw line six times McCrae probes inside the lane Crafty couldnt quite knock it down but the whistle will send him to the line Slow to get up Arya but you know 44 seconds he gets to go chill in the locker room get some Gatorade Im sure theres some fuels and snacks in the snack bar walking into the locker room Likely Powerade here Ara You know I love me some Gatorade personally but Power Aid you know sponsorship I think youre right I think the Power Aid is the move Whats your favorite Power Aid flavor Oh Im the orange and the yellow Im simple man You know like cant go wrong with that before knocks down the first You know the Heres an insider tip You know when and Luke Luke used to be the one the first to test it Like when you make the Gatorade or the Powerade you put two packs in the cooler instead of one and put the water in and it gives it way more flavor You dont get that when you go to the I have taste tested the Power Aid mix that they have over there in the cooler Its pristine Yes you should have it at Dickauser Stadium with Link Jareds baseball team I promise you it is a science Im coming to test it cheering Youre more than welcome Another turnover And Im grabbing a mic and throwing some spitting some game with you up there Come on over 5217 Florida State has forced 16 turnovers Well they actually said it was out on Florida State Looked like it was out off a player in green Delta doubles wont complain They missed the shot Clock is off Nolles can hold for the final possession Not something you hear every day when youre talking about this offense but Swinton showing us that offense jumping up there and ripping that rebound down McCrae with the basketball He handles the rock 10 seconds on the clock 98 McGee 76 drive Baseline feed Terrific find and a foul called Maloo had sealed off Terrific positioning Hell go to the line Good ball movement Did exactly what he needed to do Maloo put that guy up on his backside spins around goes short corner and then McGee with a pass And its hard to finish when they when they hack it from behind Maluca terrific story of South Sudin descent whose parents escaping war able to come to the United States where Maloo starred in Long Island played a little bit in the state of Pennsylvania as well over a seven foot wingspan for him You know hes talked about adversity himself and he talked about like I know what its like to be a refugee I was a refugee and and such a success story for a guy to be out here at this level playing hoops in the ACC Sams at the horn cant music connect And after 20 minutes of basketball around campus when the holiday break is there because you can drive without traffic and parking problems But they laughter need some traffic and parking problems out here on the floor Get it because thats what Florida State wants is disruption and causing a problem for Mississippi Valley State parking that ball in the net Oh man you dont see that every day Kevin Harland would yell out wedgie right now I queued that bad boy up but you know um and thats their best score Thats the kind of game theyre having Clean look Yep Is that your best Bill Rafrey impression No I can get deep Ali there it is That is a vicious throw down ripped out of the sky from McCrae And thats a nice impression OF HOW TO GO BACK DOOR on the zone and bring it down big fella And really its the little fella as the point guard Robert McCrae I think Rob McCrae shows you once a game the hops that he possesses Some flashy sneakers too tonight Elite athleticism McGee to McCrae Jones finds himself all alone Two strong offensive rebound merchant Alex De had another one but lost it out of bounds If they want to jump in a two3 zone all night JUST COME BACKSIDE THROW IT UP THERE and let the guy go get it and throw it home And no better person to do it when its your point guard dunking it They got Somerville Two minutes hands Delri trying to put it on the floor and get to the rim Minute 15 into this second half Somerville who shot the ball well for Florida State this year That was his calling card Hes gotten to the free throw line a little bit nearing 20 attempts with three of them here tonight Did a nice job of that at UMass LOL last season Terrific ball rotation led to an open three Oh and some friendly fire from the NLES Steen and McCrae converging on the basketball Itll stay the Mississippi Valley State Now coach Louz probably would like to see these guys come out here and put the pedal to the metal in the first five minutes and not linger And the pedal to the metal already but just you want to come out and just make a presence Let them know youre here Foul on McCrae getting a little bit handsy And this time of year Jacob you coached two different conferences at the highest levels This time of year is tough right to get the focus of your team especially after exams are done Theyre moving into the holidays But for Florida State I dont think anything needs to get their attention especially the way theyve played over the last five games Theyve got a lot to work on here even without school in session I think your biggest thing was they scheduled that game like a few days too early because coming out of the coming out of exams its kind of a little bit of a gauntlet there You know they should have got UMass They were favored in that game and had the lead for a while But then the Dayton game thats a buzzsaw game where its hard to go up in there and get that game no matter when you play And it if they were playing right now I think you get a different focus out of Florida State coming off the exam fog so to speak of where it holds you down Sams physical drive there after the offensive rebound And the Ns got to get it right in a hurry You got two opportunities won tonight taking care of business against a swack foe And then you take on JU on Monday who lost to FloridaM the other night here in Tallahassee Speaking of JU itll be a homecoming of sorts a reunion I should say rather for Rob McCrae But then you got to get it right because you got Carolina Duke backto back to start ACC play right co coach Ls inaugural season here in the ACC and they said Hey were just going to give you two hammers early you know but hes hes dealt with that before when he was a player having to play both those teams back to back So he knows how to prepare for those games and what to tell those gentlemen in the locker room Theyve just got to listen and do what he says just like hes telling with Jay Jones right now what he wants to tell him Got Cameron and Kadan Boozer coming into Tallahassee for Duke John Shy has another juggernaut as Steam stays with it Finger rolls it in Couple opportunities for the big man Hes persistent every day You get what you get out of steam He gives you full effort and his effort is rebounding and hustle But you said it thats really like one of the hardest matchups for Florida State because theyre their deficiency really is a really solid post defender that can defend a high level post Theyve got solid post players but defending as you just said Mr Boozer whos coming down from Durham Goodness gracious hes lighting everybody up HAS Carlos Boozer already been out of the league that long that hes got an 18yearold twin two 18yearold sons playing for Duke Are you kidding me And theyre just as good if not better than dad Turnover here MCCRAE HAS THE HOPS OH MAN ASSAULT And who started that play Steam jumped the passing lane Got that ball loose for McCrae to get the dunk Committing harm against the rim Rob McCrae has got some serious hops Hes into double figures now with 11 tied with Cam Miles for the team lead screaming And in the open floor hell pass it but hell also send that in straight to the bottom of the net Elite athleticism Arya Just what we talked about McGee steps into a three back iron Got a clean look He usually knocks those down especially over the last five games Jacob told you earlier nearly 40 for a guy whos known for shooting the ball Reaches in that time and a foul as he swiped across the arms of Sutton Pretty good offense there by Mississippi Valley Penetration got in past the defense and when the help came gave it to the open teammate drawing the foul Hes got to knock him down at the free throw line Now if youre chance suck you got to take advantage of your opportunities cheering Leaves the first one short Not a ton of opportunities on the year Jacob Just four of them coming in He had knock hit the first three of the four Heres his second Bricks them both and out of bounds Michael James last to touch it Its been a quiet night for James Just three points for the junior averaging 21 a game And folks its not a fluke He scored 32 against Texas AM 23 against Kansas State Five different times hes hit at least three threes and hes been the best player on the team and one of the best in the conference so far for the swag Bass reloads that one off to the left and here is James all the way to the bucket himself and beats the pack to the rim Three nos on his tail He outran them to the rim Thats you can see right there his elite scoring ability Wiggins quick trigger three You bet Got some feels early as we talked about getting some baskets in close even a dunk Now that jumper feels a lot smoother for Chanty Wiggins Chanty had a game with 15 points earlier this season coming against the Georgia Bulldogs where he hit a couple of threes in that one Opened the season with 22 against Alorn Came out of the gates everybody fired him Part of the reason he transferred to Florida State is There you go Theres some craftiness from Michael James Part of the reason Wiggins came to Tallahassee was to play in this system as Bong physical drive and hes fouled Believe thats also going to take us to our really want to emphasize hes getting from his team tonight No doubt its come through the entire roster 33 bench points as well for FSU after north of 30 against Dayton So theyre getting some contributions from the entire roster But like Luke said going into halftime with Ansley there courtside he said Hey Im not happy with every possession and were going to work on that at halftime So no coach is thrilled with the 40 minutes Its hard to get a perfect game I mean the nine turnovers in this game Most of them coming in the first half Another one there though for the Delta Devils Thats an area you want to make sure you clean up A lot of them selfinflicted against a Mississippi Valley State team that does not force a lot of turnovers coming in on the year on the defensive side but theyve shot the ball well right Nine of 24 38 You got to check that box They played good defense as Wiggins not able to connect And a strong first half has them in cruise control And the focus is now stay focused Youve showed you can focus stay focused and do what we want to do Dont turn this into an individual workout and start trying to get your own And one of the things WS talks about is this team works together So well see what happens Have the elbow Sams looks to work against Wiggins One on the shot clock Got to hurry out the horn and it grazes the front iron Good defense from Florida State Wiggins into the lane with the left hand Hes fouled and hell go to the line Great job Wiggins getting in the middle kind of planting and getting control of his body with the twostep Takes that contact Hes going to go to the free throw line try to cash in And thats kind of the things that weve talked about with coach LS and his effort tonight and his focus from his team is getting to the rim and concentrating and making the play Hes got 10 points in double figures Hes been quiet over the last couple of games has Wiggins but you talked about the calming influence that he brings and the experience he gains playing for Brad Brownell at Clemson right get to an Elite 8 get backtoback ACC seasons where you near almost 35 ACC wins between the two seasons How do you hope that that can help Florida State in a positive way as they move into conference play Well hopefully he will have the confidence he should have Johnson because he was successful Hes had success here and hes been missing some shots lately but hes having a good night offensively And so this he can build on Hes got another opportunity on Monday night against Jacksonville to get his offense in rhythm because like youve mentioned the Carolina Duke on the road to Carolina and then Duke here right after Christmas An interesting sound on Wiggins is a tie up See if Florida State can find a way to have the ball They do Great effort from Swinton Leads to a wideopen three from Miles Offensive rebound Maloo Bang steps into a triple of his own Thats off to the right and the smallest Mississippi Valley defender Michael James rips it down James now with seven points and two rebounds but Wiggins had connected on 18 consecutive free throws prior to the miss you saw a moment ago There you go Thats a big time shot And you see what Michael James is capable of he can shoot it and hes just got that that savvy man who back in the day all the players were coming out of Mississippi and no one would know who they were but and now with the world exposed basketball kids are going to school everywhere but and speaking of the world and kids coming from everywhere to Bassan the Frenchman but he is not afraid to pull the trigger Michael James and that little step back clear a little space such hops on that He is all about it baby Hes now in to double figures with 10 points So thats double figures in every game for Michael James Hes got six 20point games on the year 35 was the season high in a game he hit eight threes in the contest We talked about what he did against Texas AM where he hit seven threes in that contest on his way to 32 points I was talking to their coaching staff and the Delta Doubles were saying hes a gym rat Hes kind of the heartbeat of this group Oh a near throw down there from Maloo And that leads to a finger roll from James And such talk about effort and focus Thats what you saw right there from Mississippi Valley Grab that rebound and take off to the races 6427 Wiggins lost it on the way up Itll go out of bounds Itll belong to Mississippi Valley State If Im gambling Arya hes Michael James is going to get his 21 Like hes going to score some baskets As you as you said hes done it at Kansas State Hes done it at Texas AM Hes dropped buckets on some good teams And a slow start has led to nine points though in the second half for James Growing into this confident player that hes been all year long right Theres a foul that frustrates coach LS Somerville kind of getting that ticky tack foul out on the perimeter because hes trying to knock the ball loose Just get in front You know he talked about that today at shoot around two Ariel where he said I just want him to get in front of their man get down and stop them Trust your teammates to help you on the help Florida States length able to lead to a transition opportunity and Wiggins sticks it off Good look by the big Clemson transfer staying gathered to finish One of his best transition scores He leads Florida State with 13 6627 Barnett probes the Nulls defense Gets it over to punch inside Reverse layup there with a right hand Hiro Gama was in a wrestling match with Maloo They got switched off Hes at the high post rolled down Merry Christmas with the basket Luke got tied up in there with Irogama No whistle Now the Delta Devils on the attack Swinton grabbed the rim and so it should be a goal Ted and it is basket interference 6629 under 12 approach hes had to take right at the college level You realize at some point youre not coaching the top 1 of people who ever picked up the basketball when youre in the NBA You got a lot of talented kids though on this team that you can mold Its almost like having a ball of clay that youve got to find a way to turn into something pretty special Yeah and thats something special on how Steam just got nailed with a little you know butt screen trying to like turn around and they caught him on a foul on Michael James But youre right about that Arya Its its so many things that you have people dont realize these guys theyre theyre theyre young men theyre players and they still growing and got to deal with adversity in life and and being successful and and not making shots and not being able to defend at times is how do you fix that Thats the coachs job Be a season long pursuit right of being able to find its its like those moments Its life man because good coaches can have to mentor you the whole way Like you know its got its not easy Luke Claus got mentored all the way down to graduation You know he was he as a player he struggled with things Had a great career And speaking of the guy mentoring him you just saw him on the screen right there Coach Leonard Hamilton That was coach Hamilton not just Doug Manheimr I promise he was hiding Yeah Doug There he is The goat Coach Ham They got to name this court after him Let me tell you what this is his program What he did for the ACC and what he did for Florida State especially and and the ACC is do done a special on him Its going to air in March I think late April I mean late February but its going to be worth watching folks You and I walked by him at the same time at halftime and you kept going He looked at me He goes You keeping an eye on Jacob I said Always Good dude man Hes still looking out for you too all these years later Hey he said the blessing in my wedding He So I guess thats why were successful As genuine a human being as youll find not just in the game of basketball but in life McCrae boy he hung in the air looked like he was going to be able to connect but Jones he corrals and buries the three Le Jones gets into the act He knows how to connect from deep Knock it down Le Double digit threes now for Florida State Theyve hit 10 of them second in the ACC in threes made per game And the frustration as a coach is you have this great offensive possession Le Jones knocking it down and then you come back down on defense and the bench is all fired up everybodys ready You get back on defense and you foul Like you got to put possession on possession Thats the thing the focus and effort from Luke LS stacking good possessions offensively and defensively Jacob Im Im curious How do you get more out of a guy like Le Jones if youre Florida State He has shown flashes of being an impact player in the ACC right He hit those 10 threes a school record for Florida State in a game Hes shown some athleticism strong drives and theyve come a little bit inconsistently for him here in Tallahassee So heres what Ill say to that Every one of these guys that have transferred to Florida State they in theory transferred up there from McCrae ups from McCrae but theyve transferred up So these guys are all in a new role Theyre in a leadership role Even if youre not the leader as in the point guard youre a leader as a senior So theyve all are in a learning curve and a learning process in a new program thats got new pillars and new cultures getting laid every day As you said a minute ago it is a seasonl long effort and its a seasonlong effort to stop penetration from Michael James cuz that young man can score from all levels Yeah you and I were talking about it at shootaround today and coach LS Michael Flight Coach Gillian really the entire staff working on protecting that paint right They stopped practice a couple of times He also worked with Dennis Gates at Missouri Hes got a lot of experience Hes a good asset for Luke Lash on his staff especially with those NBA guys Hes got a really good experienced college guy with him Really worked on trying to guard off the dribble as the initial defender and thats what started a lot of it right You get blown by by the initial ball handler that creates helpside defense and the gaps open and thats where Florida States defense has faltered here over the last five or six games Yes the rotation the help defense to be there to help your teammate Its hard to sell out and defend if your rotations arent there to help you Jones another three That one clanged off to the right Rebound by the Delta Devils Jones has had now hit a three in six consecutive contests with the one he hit a moment ago They come in double figures in three straight including 14 against Dayton on Tuesday night Just three points here against Mississippi Valley State And were talking about that defense area right there was really good rotation by Florida State to keep the drive out not let anyone penetrate and make them throw the ball around the perimeter and chuck up a bad shot and get a team rebound basically with it bouncing out of bounds Approaching the 8minute mark here of the second half 7134 shot off Count it and one And thats the transition defense Hes got 11 points Five of six from the free throw line two or three from deep and had some really solid assists to go with that Its not a huge loss If youre going to lose someone it needs to be a guard You cant lose a post player right now Florida State they dont have but two or three down there Miles he cant hit from three Another offensive rebound and the seas parted there for Cam Miles His first points of the second half Hes got that banged up wrist You and I noticed it earlier You kind of called it out He had some black tape on earlier He obviously got retaped at halftime cuz now hes in there with some white tape on his hand Up until that shot Florida State was shooting just 29 in the second half As Jacob mentioned defensively also giving up 50 to Mississippi Valley State Theyre eight of 16 from the floor here in the second half So something to build on I think if youre the Delta Devils and Coach Ivory but if youre Florida State thats a cause for concern And you talked about the effort the focus Just like we said Lukes keys just like our keys is effort and focus And were not seeing it right now And its I dont want to be in there watching film tomorrow with coach LS and his staff because you know theyve done some good things but theyre not doing it consistently And thats what theyve got to get dialed in And thats a dowed in deep three from AJ Swinton How about that Thats his second of the game for AJ Swinton who has been a bit of an energy spark for Florida State Got a start earlier this season couple games ago against UMass over there in Sunrise Florida down in South Florida Had a couple good plays up in Dayton on Tuesday Sure did didnt it James is three No offensive rebound here Ogama kicks it out Holmes and the Delta Devils Have a second opportunity That is their seventh offensive rebound Miles darts in there near steel Itll stay with Mississippi Valley State Hes so quick shooting those gaps Always looking to try to get that deflection Back door cut there for Holmes Did everything but finish and then he committed a foul Maluts quietly having a good night whether its in the stat sheet or not but hes doing good things down low on defense and on the glass Hes made some major strides in his game especially on his outside shot Was rewarded with his first three of his career against Dayton That happening on Tuesday late in the contest He had talked about how he wants to improve from beyond the arc as Miles too strong on a three ball and a foul on Maluke trying to position himself away from the shot the big sevenfooter with the four rebounds three of them on offense Thats thats where you really can tell whether your where your big man makes an impact like Steam does pretty consistently by leading the league But that offensive rebound when a guy makes offensive rebounds it really stands out because you know it just keeps the possession alive and gives you another opportunity cheering Mood showed some promise right last season too as Sams his free throws good game against Carolina He had seven points had eight and four rebounds against Virginia against that packline defense up in Charlottesville So he showed you flashes of what the physicality cheering the length and the athleticism combo can be when it all comes together We talked about molding Clay and he feels like a project for FSU that Luke LS can really turn into an NBA big and hes got a good opportunity but hes still so young and got so much to learn And talk about another young player Bang who as hes you can just see him getting more rhythm and the reps of this season as the freshman from overtime elite is showing us knocking these jumpers down tonight His comfortability attacking the rim Swintons already got a couple of threes that one too strong Wiggins chases the ball down in the back court Heres Basant who comes from that French national team system and you see hallmarks of Vincent Cole is sweating off to the left Longtime France national team coach really taught defense right and you see guys like Rudy Gobar and Yabusle and all the different guys that play in FIA they gave the US a run for its money for the gold medal if not for Steph Currys heroics but it starts with playing hard on the defensive side Victor Wmanana really emphasizes that point as well And so bas lot of work left to do but the effort the intensity the length the defense something you can build upon Yeah And thats one of the things thats really thats the thing about international play is and NBA players talk about it is you got to play defense up there What Because everyones playing defense and feeding it When youre in those international competitions its a great experience Sams tried a deep three from NBA range Second chance on the offensive rebound at the rim Big time block Itll be Florida States ball Was that Swinton who got his hands on it and pinned the ball underneath the backboard Its almost a little bit of a both Is it a block or did the backboard get him But good job with that deflection and just pushed it up under that the pad to kick it down Thats worth the replay It could have been off Swinton with the block Under five to play in this one Strong first half as the NLES in cruise control Basak on the drive Lays it up Count it and one Hes French but a little English on that ball Right on Q as were queuing up the Frenchman Hes showing us his game on the floor by the defense And like you said Arya look at that team effort Cam Miles what a teammate Now this is like the third or fourth time tonight And you got AJ Swinton in the background But the way Cam Miles celebrates for his teammate success And they love this guy from Paris France Bassan knocks it down Luke LaS on Bong said hes our croissant That was the first opening press conference after the nulls beat Alorn State and I havent been able to get that out of my head Every time he makes a bucket is just croissant by Luke LS describing his youngster from France at a loss for words That is wonderful But the guy thats got a lot of words tonight is Cam Miles He is everywhere Hes played really well hasnt he shown that in spurts and you need you need a secondary ball handler you know like you cant just be Robert McCrae That is terrific ball movement into a three from Wiggins and the bench loves it Look at that Youve got three of your starters right there celebrating Thats what you need And you want good effort out of these guys They got to play through the kinks WHOA GET IT OUT of here baby Sh Mohamd sending that back where it came from quite literally into the hands of James Midrange jumper Oh thats nice He says Hey I dont care Shy Mohamd Im going to shoot it right over you Michael James is fearless You look down at this box score Hes got 18 points as Mohamad throws it down out of the sky And who gave it to him Out of the sky Cam Miles with the lob over the top Miles now with three assists in this one NL have shared the basketball well Did range Nope And Somerville and the NLS out on the break Bass strong to the rim with a left hand He reverses it home Brassant with the basket That works well Tom Bisong into double figures with 10 points And the response on the jumper from Mississippi Valley State Its a new careerh high for Tomas Bong as Miles Show you a flash there to the bucket Hes left it short 10 points for Bassong New career high Just a freshman Sams Mohamd to block party for Sha Mohamd A party of one Bang again tried to angle it in Mohamd on the offensive rebound and then Basson guilty of a foul Mohamd right there I thought he had him Another dunk but I will tell you hes giving us some good minutes right now on this TV monitor with the block Get it out of here big fella And hey you better keep up WITH ME CUZ CAM Miles can IM THROWING IT DOWN BENCH POINTS Florida State has brought the heat from the entire roster 51 of their 86 points have come off the bench Thats a good sign for Luke LSs squad He needs everyone contributing and thats a huge sign for Luke Lops and his squad as theyre creeping up on the ACC schedule thats just around the corner But and you hit on it man Theres a lot of guys Maluke having a good night Bang Wiggins waking up with the 16 hes got Its good to get this offensive rhythm and get moving a little bit after theyve had some speed bumps Whats been the area of growth you think the NLES have taken the biggest step in at least tonight in these 40 minutes Well seeing the ball go to the basket a little bit for some of these guys which is growth for them individually but also their defense is better and their rotation on defense has improved Mohamd you can count Hoop and Bahar Sean Mohamd a lift off the bench and they need more of that lift from Mohamd Hes going to have to give them something in the post coast Hes doing it tonight Hes done a couple good plays and heres another one to go on top Just get through the contact and finish up there And now part of effort and focus is to knock the free throw down He does that Hes at his fourth school and the nullles needed a late ad right this summer to find a big man They go and get Shawn Mohamd from UMass That was his last stop Hes given the null some rim protection as youve seen tonight Hes been a lob threat Still trying to figure out some parts of the offensive and defensive system as James is fouled on the drive But a team that doesnt have a ton of usable bigs down low right now in terms of in the paint Mohhamd might fit that mold Well there used back in the day you would talk about junior college players when they transferred in because that was really your transfer When you had a junior college player transfer even a hyped up junior college player you never got a lot of production out of them until Christmas really cuz they had to play through the system practice through the system and kind of learn their way around Well hes got pretty much a brand new roster besides Aar Maluke you know and AJ Swinton as far as contributors So hes got all a bunch of new guys that are having to learn his system and learn what he wants along with Aar Maluke and AJ Swinton So Florida State is developing their roster finding themselves in all positions and its about the time things should start to come together here between now and January You need Mohamd and Maluke right both to be able to give you something down low Wiggins can give you a presence as well as Mohhamd there You see what hes capable of That was vicious Oh my goodness just murdered the rim Hes got athleticism And who threw him that pass over the top Cam Miles Under two to play Maloop stays with it FIRES THE THREE YES SIR FROM WAY DOWNTOWN The big man with the celebration Look at the bench I love the fired up bench Just patting their teammates on the back from distance baby Response triple Mississippi Valley State Xavon Barnett averaging five a game Hes into double figures with 10 Florida States hit seven of their last nine from the floor Miles makes it eight to 10 on the blow by cheering Great defense on the fullourt pressure Miles heat check Too strong Why not cheering And Miles he he apologizes for the bad play right there But that one a bad play Thats a bad play right there But a good bad one over the top Mohamd Look at that little soft leap and then staying with it controlling his body to reel that thing in Mohamds got an upside and hes going to have to turn that switch on and get us moving But if we got some activity going on out on the floor right now Couple technicals on each team assessed See the Nles can get to the century mark here tonight Only a couple possessions left Have to be probably nearly perfect but 96 48 Big first half picked it up in the second half in the final 10 minutes Really it was the final seven minutes or so for Florida State Thats a foul on the floor I think the bonus is coming for Mississippi Valley State Luke LS isnt going to judge Florida State on just the score line alone Theres still some areas he wants to see his team clean up moving into Monday night And its hard to get a perfect game out of this style of play tonight with a team thats shorthanded Theyre kind of playing a different game than youve seen on the film but also its just it cheering gets chippy at times One of two for Barnett One last possession potentially for Florida State Maloo three ball in the air Left and short raise the front eye cheering Six second differential between the game clock and the shot clock Swinton picks up turnover number 26 for Mississippi Valley State here tonight Well see if Luke LS calls off the dogs He does And here on this Friday night in December Florida State will snap a fivegame losing skit They take care of business against Mississippi Valley State 96 49 Florida music State back in the win column And we talked about it Arya Its a little bit of a getright game for Florida State and they were able to get some things
