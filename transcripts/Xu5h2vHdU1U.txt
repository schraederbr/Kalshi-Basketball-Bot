on the road tonight Virginia Tech has never played here at Stanford the wall and r no jump up and no surprise the 49 in vertical wins it and the hokes will have the first possession Rex Steiner number seven in the starting lineup Ben Hammond out their leading point guard who had eight assists in the wind as a Rex Steiner turnover Hammond has a bad foot so Rex Steiner gets the start tonight Stanfords Cardinal starting lineup by chis oar is going to start today and this is his fifth start of the Season hell join Blakes Aral the big man Reno and oiah cers whos improved his scoring as of late thats Blakes with the ball the former Duke blev back door ARA leads it for Reno who lays it in and Stanfords on the board unselfish play Dave great interior pass and Stanfords at their best when they can get assists the hes will start Tyler Johnson the defensive specialist re Steiner Jaden shoot Toby lawall and mizal potit who had the game winner off here but the game winner threepoint play against Miami on Saturday well now hes going to have to go over a sevenfooter in Maxim REO not easy raino downtown now Uptown and that ones no good well dont be surprised to take him have him take three fre he can shoot it shoot leaves it for theall theall lays it in and the hokes are on the board oh thats what they do too theyre going to try to get out a little bit in transition get some easy baskets on Stanford before they set their defense back to Rau jump Hook off the wall with the bll defense Music po thought better of it back to Rex Steiner Reiner got caught in the air and a turnover by Virginia Tech sellers thought about it blaks jumper good well Stanford will get out and run too Dave if they can they can rebound the basketball you dont get a lot of Second Chance opportunities so Stanford not afraid to push Applause Rex Steiner theyre going to have to keep their eyes on him hes a pretty good midrange shooter hes an high assist guy too so hes an allpurpose guy with the basketball sers in the corner back to Aral shot clock down to seven sers has to go he does Applause good defensive possession by the hokes they did a nice job finishing the shot against the shot Club shoot pass it too low Here Comes oara oara called for an offensive foul and so Chism Oar ran him over but we talked about Maxim R know in the open I mean this guy is all everything for Kyle Smith well he does it all dayve but hes really skilled with the basketball you know hes great space hes a pretty good ball hander a high assist guy as well at times but hes got the ability to knock down thre so when youve got that kind of range as a sevenfooter you you got your hands full heres whats scary last year he was the most improved player in the pack 12w and hes only gotten better now I covered him last year we used to say that now hes doing it all over again in the ACC no less the wall lays it in well Cal Smiths not happy that the hokes have gotten to the rim you know he doesnt mind them shooting from the perimeter challenging shots but Hokies have gotten to the point blank to the to the rim theall the most athletic guy that Virginia Tech has ever had didnt start playing basketball till he was 16 grew up in London turnover by Stanford Applause were talking about Toby lall I thought this might be a dunk it it wasnt a dunk he ends up laying it in but Toby lall is is a guy that picked up basketball at 16 Ben he had grown up playing London soccer I said when did you realize you could jump cuz hes got a 49in vertical he goes well I just started playing basketball and then when I jumped up I was higher up than anybody yeah I think thats pretty indication that told him he could jump higher than anybody thats a giveaway Dave right there but it its remarkable and again youre youre coming uh you know from London England and just remarkable because most of those guys play soccer they dont play basketball early Johnson inside curls everything but out the sevenfooter Patrick wesler in number five trying to wrestle it away but didnt well Talis teray nice hustle keep that ball alive but Stanford when they play their best basketball day theyre theyre really a good defensive team they they make it tough on Applause you Talis two rays in for Kyle Smith number three lot of contact underneath but Virginia Tech clears it here comes Jaden shoot now the sevenfooter calling for it inside and the left does go so wesler on the board yeah give H credit they they isolated the mismatch and went right inside Mike young excellent play call you surprised Ben right now that Maxim re knows on the bench already well its early I mean you know hes going to play a lot of minutes there thats for sure sers Applause off I think K Smith and his staff I like to see the Cardinals attack the rim a little more theyve got an advantage in there if they can use it wesler inside tied up stolen he got it back then he tipped it and an over and back on Virginia Tech back violation and REO will come right back in Ben Bron so you still have your coaching chops its 84 early back to Maples in the M did you know that Geicos whole 15 minutes thing that came from me really my first idea was in one quarter of an hour your savings will Tower o over you figuratively speaking but thats not caty is it its not going to swim about in your brain so I thought what about 15 minutes 15 Serendipity Geico 15 minutes could save you 15 or more on car insurance its 10 ft one shot makes you a sup for 24 Music Music 84 Virginia Tech leading stamping the ACC opener here at Maples Pavilion Max Reno is a guy Ben Bron that has improved every single year we mentioned last year the most improved player in the Pack 12 yeah Dave those are numbers I mean hes increased his production every single year hes played and now hes doing it the ACC so hes put time in and you know I know as folks are up watching right now 3 in the morning in France and and uh you know I had a chance to meet them and uh just theyre delighted with his progress and his career that hes had here at Stanford Stanford has not scored in 3 minutes and 30 seconds Benny geler in now number five goes right to Reno he draws the double team passes it inside to Aiden camman who couldnt handle it no that was just a really a good look and thats got to be a catch and a finish right there wesler and Reno you got seven foot on seven foot inside the post Tyler Johnson spinning inside draws the foul count it and hell have a chance for a threepoint play for the h thats a great look inside against Jaylen Blakes who by the way is their top Ace defensively so thats a big time score but heres a post up heres the spin move off contact when you players plays you and and you know hes has got his back to you Dave you got to you got to Gap a little bit you cant show him your body because when he feels your body hell spin off you but you know youre talking about maxing Reno and you know where is he improved hes improved in every category he can knock down threes very well he can score it hes really a good passer you can see what he can do hes got great hands wall is off and the ball goes off of Ray hys are on an eight nothing run as Virginia Tech Subs out the wall and wesler yeah theyre theyre on a run Dave I think St Stanfords become a little too uh you you know fell in love a little bit too much with the outside shot they theyre a team that can go down low the hokes are not going to challenge you they only block one shot a game so theyre going to try to stay out of foul trouble you can get something inside if you just stay patient and you go there Ben Burnham former College of Charleston standout number 13 in for Mike Music young as is Rodney Brown Jr his first shot is off great second effort and he draws the foul yeah Stanford having a problem getting clean rebounds theyve been tipping the ball defensively and you know you dont want to tip it on the defensive end its okay on the offensive end Stanford got to go grab with two and then theyre Off to the Races but give the hes credit Dave theyre really putting pressure on Sanford theyre taking to the rim po as game winner the other day and over 20 points but yet get on the board early now hes calling for it they dont give it to him Brown takes it instead only one on the clock and Virginia Tech does not get a shot off well thats great defense I think Stanford say enough I mean we we got to get a stop and they got one they made it awfully tough and you mention po not getting some looks early not easy to go over Maxim Reno so uh good stop Ben giler in the lineup a guy that can give him spark plug type minutes hes got he can steal he can assist a good addition for the Cals uh I me for the Stanford Cardinal uh to their team Stanford hasnt scored in over five minutes Reno lobs it in for Cam and bad pass and agar wall saves it that shot clock reset and it should have Dave thats thats they going to have to look at that yeah because they said it should have been a reset yeah and and well lets see did it hit the rim I dont believe so so I think theyre going to say Well theyre going to look at it uh the the offs can go to see if theres a reset on this clock because theres no way if it if it didnt that they got 30 seconds so and then he said it did so that that was so Stanford will keep it yeah thats good call and that was not a shot yeah that was not a shot no but the pass off the rim is it counts and so you reload and uh Stanford knows that theyre good uh good lawyers on the floor out there for Stanford Tony btia doing a nice job with the call there yeah know he got it Music right working with Clare Aubry and Roger a good crew veteran crew Ru with five on the clock rainbow jumper no good and yeah cleared by the H Hs doing a good job keeping R away from the rim potit trying to go at the bigger Reno the left hand hook no good hes going over a lot of size there well hes not used to that now you got Maxim Reno 7 foot 7 foot one and hes got hes long too Virginia Tech playing great defense thats Evan Stinson whos just checked in his first shot is off yeah Stanford very tight from the perimeter Dave theyre theyre not shooting the ball the way they have have not scored an over 6 minutes and 30 seconds shoot meanwhile long three no good yeah they usually create some pretty good shots going inside Reno and hes such a good passer out of the double uh but yokis doing a good job pushing Maxim Reno away from the Applause basket camon up and down and that is a traveling violation we will take a timeout scoring a premium Stanford hasnt scored in over 7 minutes well be Music back as a kid I fell in love with basketball but early in my career my world began to close in it was my first migraine and it hit hard I had to dig deep and remember you dont face challenges Alone by seeking help I stopped migraine from stopping me because true support is is knowing someones got your back talk to a doctor about migraine today at fiser for allcom yeah I mean the thing is people like Geico because its just easy bundling for example youve got car insurance here and home insurance here why not put them together save even more some things are better together is they like um tea and Crump hits you would bundle just anything like say a porcupine in a balloon factory now that be a mess I mean for starters por famously no good in a team said Geico save even more when you bundle home and car insurance heres Saturdays ACC Network basketball triple header Clemson host Florida State at little John to start us off at two Eastern and then its North Carolina and NC State squaring off in Raleigh and finally Virginia Tech taking on Cal should be a great afternoon and evening of Hoops on the ACC Network Ill be at that Virginia Tech Cal game your old stomping grounds with Jared hos will get to see the hokes one more time yeah itll be a good uh good game and Mike young will take his Guys across the bay there a little bit Virginia Tech continues to roll right now 11 nothing run after Ben Burnham Bears the shot well they got you know they were able to get penetration in a pitch and and got a wide open looking three theyre doing a really nice job on Reno theyre pushing him way off the block Dave hes having to come way out on the threepoint line to get some touches Cardinals missed their last six shots have not scored in over seven minutes now the shot clock down to four no good and a nice job of Stinson trying to get the rebound and he was pushed underneath so the ball will stay with Stanford you know Dave when youre struggling you got a couple of you know you cant just will the ball to go in sometimes youre just the balls not going down but you got to do things like get the ball to the foul get to the foul line draw some files get inside and I think you can look for stford trying to get a couple easy ones and at least attack in the paint and get rewarded by getting some free throws I mean you want to go down to Reno down low dont you but theyre going to go to Oar well thats a good look I I like the strategy you go to aaro hes really good at drawing fouls and then he passed the ball out of what really wasnt a double team he got to got rid of it a little earlier I think hes theyre theyre looking at the pressure being a little greater than it is but a little bit opening uh opening game Jitters in the league Dave in my opinion we mentioned the first ever ACC game here Maples Pavilion historic I mean thats an historic uh Landmark game here Jaden young number three Off the Bench floater off the glass young counts it but an offensive foul thats a great play by Benny giler because that was about to be a 130 run and some separation but watch Benny geler that sees it coming hes set he takes it and thats just a great textbook charge Dave and unlike the NBA that that hoops no good even though he released it way before the contact yeah well thats that you know college you still get credit so uh big play in and the Cardinal need it they need a spark and thats a spark right Music there AAR no good yeah he was there and just hurting himself again I think he could have gotten to the line and and an n one if he takes his time Dave H is though doing a great job of pressure defense Kyle Smith just looked at one of his assistants and said what do we have to do to get a hoop Ben Burnham for three well and hes got to use his timeout does thats a smart time out you dont wait for the TV timeout you got to write the you got to write the wrong right here Dave its a 14 to0 run 164 all hokeys right now honey but the gains are pumping dad is mommy a finance bro she switched careers to make money for your weddings oh the Asian market is blowing up hey who wants shots huh shots of milk the right money moves arent as aggressive as you think I was born with a fire inside but psoriasis dous my flame until I got clearer skin with Bim zelic you could say Im back only BM zelix targets and blocks il17a plus F to calm inflammation most people got 100 clear skin some after the first dose serious side effects like suicidal thoughts and behavior infections and lowered ability to fight them liver problems and inflammatory bowel disease have occurred tell your doctor if these happen or worsen or fevers chills muscle aches or off occur or youve had a vaccine or plan to before starting get checked for infections tuberculosis and liver problems start to get yourself back with Bim zelix ask your dermatologist about Bim zelix today when youre down 16 to4 you cant give up open threes why was re Steiner so open here coach well he they overextended on the health you youre coming off a ball screen here it is ball screen takes place and theres just two guys jump you dont want two guys to jump and then leave a step back wide open three and those are the kind of shots the Virginia H Tech Hokies are getting and thats one reason that Kyle Smith calls a timeout and says guys we got to get ourselves going shots are going to fall but defensively weve got to be better it was actually Ben Burnham who hit the three he has two so I dont want to take away one of Ben Burnhams thre been a Super Sub here Off the Bench meanwhile Stanford has bigger problems they have not scored until then Reno ending a drought of 8 minutes and 43 second and whats different Dave he had two feet in the paint thats a post up coming out of the timeout designed play by Kyle Smith textbook way to post up thats Rex Steiner no good R over with a rebound yeah its going to be a recipe for I think success if you can get to the rim now as bad a run as that was you score here its single digits no they theyre theyre fortunate we talked about that during the breakday but watch Maxim raino weve said this before his left hand arguably better than his right hell score more often with his left than he does his right got great touch hes going to get some inside looks if he can get both feet in the paint Thats where hed like to post Music up breaks perfect thats a much needed basket but again theyre getting better ball movement better spacing and now Virginia Tech is having to give Maxim REO some attention on the Block you dont score for eight minutes youre only down seven def def def def Applause def off the Hokies yeah thats better defense you see Jaylen Blakes just hounding you know as a Defender he gets in your grill and he challenges up and thats a tough shot but Jaylen Blakes has done that all season long now if youre Stanford I think you go right back and you see if you can get Reno some touches in the paint Ager wall for three he missed Maxim Maxim had again a post up position uh guy in his back he just happened to miss him Rodney Brown Jr going against sers Now Toby Lal whos been quiet for a Applause while the wall defended well yeah two good possessions by the Cardinal backto back stops Applause that was a good look yeah could have couldnt got it he probably if he had that one all over again Dave he could have gotten all the way the rim again hurt himself H himself just a little Music bit Burnham left open and Burnham hits another three hes got three of them yeah you might want to mark down where burum is on the floor because he is scorching the cardinal three for three from Beyond The Ark sers beautiful move he got hit and count the Applause hoop great job of sellers moving without the ball but Burnhams been a a sore point for the Stanford Cardinal shooting the ball yeah hes been open hes been deadly has not missed a shot I mean hes just knocks it down from three but Maxine Rena with the wrap around into Sellers and a chance now for a threepoint 360 dipy D beautiful night in Palo Alto is Virginia Tech lead Stanford in an ACC battle 623 left in the first half and look at Burnham hes made every threepointer he shot hes got nine points Stanford is five of 17 the field so Burnham Burnhams a oneman wrecking crew and no surprise I mean Dave hes shooting about 45 from three so if youre going to leave him open hes going to make half the shots he takes from there Burnham was a great player at the College of Charleston average 12 points a game there last year scored 19 versus Alabama in the first round of the NCA tournament for College of Charleston hes got some big chops deadly deadly shooter cant leave him alone the wall no Music good yeah Donovan young in the lineup now they have a new player from from Stanford only even played in two games yeah the Freshman from Pascal Washington but KY Smith trying to mix things up as Blake gets hurt yeah and I you know you say well guy hasnt played very much now hes in in in the lineup but I you know were not a practice every day and you see some things in practice plus youre trying to make a statement with your team add some energy to your team and and put some new new blood in the lineup but Jaylen Blakes has done this pretty much all year when theyve been in some trouble he really has had you know an eye for the basket he gets to the rim and he get to the foul line so look for Jaylen Blakes to to attack the rim a little bit more than he has been and Ben back to Young hes taken one shot and he made it a three yeah three so hes yeah hes not afraid to put it up here but hes only had the opportunity so sometimes all players need Dave opportunities they let them let them go from there after all of the droughts and all of the wow its still a sixpoint game yeah two Applause Music possessions shoots got to shoot it he does agall runs it down yeah love The Possession Ryan Aral was a very good defense good challenge standing his feet sers tried to get it to Reno and they misconnected no I think I think Maxim thought for sure oziah was going to go up because he had a clear rim for the basket just a little too unselfish and if he had any criticism about oziah sers it would be it Dave I mean hes an unselfish player but in that case you got to take it up and if you miss it Maxine Maxs it down still hit this he getting a tip Music in Burn him again he hasnt missed yet hes still perfect now one thing you have to do when hes on the floor you cannot go for shot fakes shot fake the lift fake go up in the air what does he do he waits for you to come down burries his four3 burnam with 12 Stanford with 13 agall tough leaner over shoot that is a good shot I mean because hes scoring it over a smaller Defender hes got range but Stanfords challenge has been on this end they theyve got to get stops get back in this game and someone needs to identify number 13 poti knocked down Reno and then had the easy dunk well I thought there was some contact officials had another idea they said play on uh much like the NBA like get up were not calling that and you dont mind Dave as long as that call goes both ways Pos first hoop of the game yeah theyre fronting raino in Music there lakes no good Aral up Virginia Tech saves it the Freshman young cant do it sellers try to tip and Tech finally comes down with well they had two point blank shots at The Rim tips and kind of ran into each other but they were on the on the glass hard Johnson called for the offensive Applause foul so far Ben Burnham has been a oneman wrecking crew for Virginia Tech yeah you can play him if you could to stay on the floor and challenge him hes just too tough I mean hes knocking down threes from the Corner hes knocking down threes from the top of the key you leave him open he knows what to do Music Music all right Taylor and Michael thank you very much 2415 Virginia Tech and Ben Burnham whos got 12 of the 24 leading Stanford in the very first ACC game played here at Rosco Maples Pavilion I can assure you in that timeout his number was circled numerous times Blakes all the way to the hoop yeah another design play coming out of the timeout no mistaking where they want that ball to go they want Jaylen Blakes to attack the rim poti wants it down low they get it to him and the flip goes off the glass and potit has a chance for a threepoint play just like the gamewinner he hit the other day yeah watch the entry pass Dave I mean that pass was Picture Perfect over the outstretched hand you pass it away from the defense he catches maintains his back his contact and and absorbs contact and scores and what a tremendous finish by the big fell potit had the game winner threepoint play against Miami on Saturday this a danger area of the half uh Dave you dont want to go down more than double digits at at the halftime Reno for three burn him everywhere getting the offensive rebound or the defensive rebound his first Miss hes human Ben BR yeah I was going to say if that goes in I call out call the police Reno great catch and finish Id like to see Max REO do that more Dave because hes a very agile player he should rim run if he Rim runs thats there for him that opportunity will present itself time and time again Reno has six the lead is seven Brown got REO in the air went under him Blakes comes down with it sers pump fake to free himself the three is good yeah how about Jaylen Blakes he had Reno on One Wing and sers on his other wing and he decided to go to sers for the wide openen three nice pumping two possession games defense defense defense def def def potit with the jump hook hes so good around the basket I mean hes good a quick timeout uh kind of a hockey change here oh it looks like maybe by Mike young yeah Virginia Tech with a quick timeout back for the final minute 19 in a moment heres Sundays ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header featuring three top 20 teams number 14 Duke takes on Virginia at noon Eastern then 19th rank North Carolina host BC followed by number 13 Georgia Tekken we cap today with Miami and Syracuse all on the ACC Network sellers just hit one sers picks another out by Jaylen Blakes thats telepathy again out of the timeout sellers getting open and the veteran finding his teammate a one possession game under a minute to play and blaks almost with a steal Now Dave basketballs such a momentum game and you know Stanford was within an eyelash going down big at the half but they just were able to turn it back around theyd like nothing better to get a stop here and maybe play for the last shot of the half would be huge go back to Virginia not even the best team in KY Smith done a nice job this team that it didnt seem you know you can learn a lot from looking at a bench and you know this from your coaching days seemed no panic when they went eight minutes without a hoop no but they have a lot of faith in Kyle and his staff and thats a veteran staff with him uh there was no Panic and you can its the last thing you can do when things arent going your way David put your head down panic and and and get your players to to lack confidence an illegal screen on Virginia Tech Patrick wesler was moving yeah and I give Jaylen Blakes credit because he took that contact youve got to try to fight over screens if you lay on a screen David youre not going to get that he did not lay on the screen he F over the top and the screen was moving great call by the official CLA auy Stanford has made three shots in a row a chance here to tie it up Reno agarwall with the tip gives sellers a new chance yeah lets see if they recognize that they can they can well they can wind it down theyre not going to get the last shot of the after they can wind the clock down maybe make a short clock for hokei and an offensive foul on Stanford yeah and the officials are consistent I didnt always think that on the sideline but I tell you from this seat you can see it that was a great call that was the right call now youre the hokeys you can play for the last shot and Stanfords going to have to come up with the a solid defensive do you do that if youre Mike young do you wait for the last shot oh I I I yeah you got to go youve got only 19 seconds to go so if youre Stanford you got to avoid fouling and you dont want to give up an offensive rebound but you also want to know where Ben Burnham is number 13 please Circle his number dont give him any more looks shot clock irrelevant 8 seconds left in the half two one brown lets the defender fly by and knocks it down great look by Rodney Brown the Cal transfer and what does Kyle Smith do coach to get Maxim REO going in the second half he had six you know they want to get him to the basket I think hes got to get some touches create some uh scoring opportunities you know hes hes really so good with either hand down there but Jaylen Blakes is also the guy that thats when they need a basket they put the ball in his hands and you know what they did that on the opening possession because theres so much attention on Maxim REO when Reno has that attention they let Blakes go to work and he just drew a foul Blakes played a limited role for Duke last season uh but currently sixth in this league in assist good free throw shooter and a good leader yeah what I like about Jaylen Blakes weve watched him all year Dave hes hes really good at pressuring the ball hes a hes a phenomenal uh Defender he plays a lot of minutes so hes got to watch his foul total but hes so good at getting to the basket hes hes attacks the rim he can find people on the floor as he did oiah sers gave him some really good looks for some wide open threes so he he plays the allpurpose game and hes really stepped his game up since his years at du and great at getting fouled to shot 89 free throw fourth best in the country yeah hes going to have to continue to do that this half if they have hopes of climbing back in this one a threepoint Tech lead Rex Steiner Rises up and hits yeah I think those are the shots again that you look at Kyle Smith he just doesnt like you know his teams right now their ability to give up some pretty good looks Stanfords a good defensive team but theyve given up some open shots today raino for three and maybe he will heat up well he looked to the scoreboard he looked to the student section he said its about time but he can do that make no mistake uh Dave he is a phenomenal threepoint shooter if you give him the an open look potit right over Reno yeah he kind of let him go to his strong right hand you know I think if youre going to play potit you cant let him go strong hes good to his right sers already feels like a little bit better intensity in this second half yeah I think both teams have loosened up they both teams are tight to start the game poti with a rare outside jump shot well Stanford will give him that sh as opposed to giving him anything at the Music rim raino backto back threes for the sevenfooter yeah hes given his stent section A little threepoint logo there to say Im back and he is too scared SC lall quickly ahead of everybody yeah no great first stepd what he did to make that play so hard to guard is he caught the ball the move for a young player you know dont wait on the pass you see you have an opportunity to catch it on the move that created the space Lakes draws the foul we mentioned how good he is at getting to the free throw line here he goes again but what about the big seven footer from France well you have to go out to guard Maxim Reno when Renos on the perimeter you cant get there late Dave hes too good a shooter hes knocked down that shot all year long but then when you come out and guard him he can get to the rim and hes theres the maxim Reno reaction hes so good with the students here and the crowd hes he loves to play G play the game you know we Ive met his parents who are delightful uh great people who have come out here and watch him on a couple of occasions who are watching now at 400 am in Paris yeah theyre not missing this I said do you guys tape that they said no were going to get up there live and I dont blame them you this is exciting for them but their son is a big time player obviously hes going to be playing at the next level but uh they need him Stanford does to step up in this game to get back in this game and regain the lead Jaylen got caught with his hands in the cookie jar he thought that was all ball uh you know but thats what he does hes got a hes a magnet at the ball Dave wherever the ball is you got to protect it because jayen Blakes will get his hands in the ball now here comes Benny geler to spell Jaylen Blakes because you dont want to lose your your star player uh to fouls no and hes got three fouls so you know if youre Kyle Smith theres just two and a half minutes have expired how long you keep bles on the back well youll keep him there through the next TV timeout probably and see if he can survive uh I I always felt you can keep guys on the bench if the game was close if it starts separating you get them back in the game Music Ros had the hot hand but he desperately wants the ball on the Block agar wall had it Stripped by Rodney Brown and Brown is found by giler getting back to that point when you had a player Ben when you were coaching and they had three fouls there was no set rule is it a field no you looked at score Dave if if again if you were losing ground in this score was creeping away you had to put him back in the game if the game was close you could afford to keep him next to you but not for long you want him back in the game hes just affects the game too much but general rule of thumb uh give him a little break dont let him pick up his quick fourth he does that youre in deep deep uh you know what Rex diner off the screen from po yeah good possession by Stanford nice challenge up clean defensive Music rebound agar wall now good pass out of the double by Reno agal just couldnt knock it down wide Applause open the wall blocked from behind by Aral but they called him for the foul aall thought he got it clean well and La I was very fortunate that could have been a push off going the other way too F was allowing and electing them to play a little bit this half so Toby the wall will go to the free throw line 74 free throw shooting lets be honest most of this guys shots are dunks 42 of his shots are done hes a human highlight film and and you know when you can go almost 50 Ines think about that thats thats getting up there da Saturday night at 8 Eastern after our mens basketball triple header right here on the ACC Network in the ESPN app the nothing but Ned will break down the day in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every mens game and look ahead at the best match ups on the schedule for the coming week now the Cardinal put in uh you know there some Shooters on the floor obviously you know you need an extra shooter if you can around Reno because if they double him team which they have done and they will do you got to put some Shooters around there to space the floor and create some driving angles as well Ben burnam back in he had 12 in the first half on four five shooting all from three Music Benny gerer with a nice move Benny giler did that for the Cardinal early in the season until he went down with some injuries ear during the stretch but Benny giler can can play and hes going to need to step up in Jaylen Blakes his Music absence Rodney Applause Brown and that brings us to our first TV timeout the Cardinal back in this game its a onepoint tilt at Maples if you find yourself in a box that can no longer contain you its time to find a bigger box find your next level at army civilian careerscom I was born with a fire inside but psoriasis dous my flame until I got clearer skin with Bim zelics you could say Im

onepoint win over Miami 8685 Ben Hammond not playing tonight injured his foot in that game left the game came back had the gamewinning assist but not playing tonight so hes out and then Tyler Johnson now with three fouls how does this affect the H well first of all lets put this in perspective Dave you know even with their starter out theyre 162 against Stanford Off the Bench so theyre getting a tremendous uh tremendous uh production Off the Bench and you know as I we joked about during the break players dont care when you you got guys out they want opportunities a play Ben Burnham only averages 19 minutes uh David hes already got 13 log right now and 13 valuable minutes so players are going to make make a uh theyre going to make the adjustment here are the hes now extending for some full CT pressure see if they can get Stanford to play on a short clock geler gets it over the timeline but you asking about some adjustments now the Stanfords going have to make some adjustments without Jaylen Blakes REO double teamed immediately no theyve got to get it in and out of there tells gerer to get out of there only five on the clock where knows got to do something he does and it gets it to go yeah he does more than something Dave he scores it maybe almost draws a foul thats a great look making something out of nothing May was guarded single covered and now you got Stanford looking to play a little bit now uh see if they can keep the hes on the perimeter Stanford with their first lead since it was 4 to2 two minutes into the game wesler went down hard hes trying to draw a foul giler with the extra pass Stanford on a roll young with the three how about Benny giler giving up an open three which he could hit to get his teammate Donovan young to stay perfect on the year from three young doesnt shoot a lot when he does it goes in oh I like his percentages 100 on the year Rex Steiner yeah thats thats a great defensive possession by Stanford but but watch Maxim Renault and how much attention he gets he throw it in they double from the Baseline side thats an really an abnormal coverage usually comes from the middle but now youre single covered too late he can do too much hes too agile goes off the glass and scores a great individual play by Maxim Reno Stanford on a seven nothing run made their last three shots Reno nice pump fit got wesler in the air didnt leaves it underneath sers lays it in Stanford up 44 38 and Maxim REO showing you his versatility Dave they have to guard him at the three he puts it on the deck and he finds a cutting his Zellers for a twopoint a g of a game of drought stford at a 9minute drop TCH missed their last five and now turnover Traveler thats a good call by Tony Padilla but watch Maxim Reno and how dangerous he is you know hes just not an inside player hes just not a shooter he can put it on the deck but here he is the pump fake the dry avoids the charge and keeps his head up and finds oiah sellers for the two almost unselfish he could have shot that one too Ben he was close n he he was thinking dunk Dave Ive been around him thats a bad thats a tough turnover Burnham makes his first two point point shot of the day yeah well thats a thats an unfortunate turnover because Stanford had some momentum and those things kill your momentum uncharacteristic turnover just a giveaway right in front of Applause us but you know you talked about the level of play and the level of play its turned up this half I think both teams shaking a little early uh you know game Jitters and now both teams are playing at a much higher Pace the pace is picked up Evans The Freshman for Kyle Smith back in Reno had it knocked off his leg Yeah great defense I mean when the ball goes into Maxim Reno you dont have two guys there Dave you had three guys around him and theyre just wailing their hands trying to claw it out of there if he gets the ball down there thats almost a quadruple team because you got the Baseline as a fourth Defender so you got to make sure you feed him somewhere in the middle of the floor not coughin corner he didnt agree with that call by Tony P Im pretty sure there was some French being spoken right there yeah some things we didnt really my son speaks friend hell have to interpret later for me poti took a long time but drops a great patience really good patience on the follow through in the Finish Stanford by two raino for Music three poti goes right at the big man but the left wont go yeah that was a better challenge Maxim Reno went straight up with his wingspan made him shoot over the top Reno back toback threes that one off also you can read Kyle Smiths body language hes saying hey guys lets not fall in love with the three lets get that ball back on the Block and get some easy looks Reno three rebounds shy of his 12th double double Applause and a foul underneath on Virginia Tech well take a break Stanford is heated up the Cardinal lead by two at Music home Cardinal lead by two 4442 were at Maples Pavilion but were on Tara Vander court and there is Tara Vander the threetime national champ theall of Famer the woman who retired with more wins than anyone in the history of college basketball men or women one of the best coaches that ever play I mean you know youre good when the court has your name on it no its amazing you know and shes shes humble shes unassuming she doesnt want to draw too much attention to her current staff but make no mistake her accomplishments are are very distinguished and many Blakes back in and fouled down below you know shes been a coaching colleague and a friend for many years Dave she used to come by my practices I wouldnt let Coach Montgomery come by but but I wouldnt let Tara come by uh Mike had enough good players I didnt want to make it easier to scout us Blakes in the corner no good and camon jump ball The Possession goes to the hokes well theyre putting uh Cayman back in the game you know Aiden Cayman camon can really affect you defensively hes long hes almost 7 feet so they want to get a little B more of a presence but Jaylen Blakes back in the game with three hes got to be careful young Off the Mark came in with the rebound Stanford back in one of their shooting droughts again three minutes sers hands the drought and hes done that for the Cardinal All Year Dave hes given them big shots hes a guy that can create space get his own shot thats a big time basket sellers in double digits with 13 the Stanford lead is four Music Applause Look Out Below Toby of the well well you know when he gives you the eyebrow fake you got to stay down that was a Head and Shoulder fake soon as you bite uh youre in some Music trouble you ever heard of a 49 in vertical lead Ive heard of crazy stuff like David Thompson no thats thats off the sh Reno you know Dave he practices that shot every game he stays out here if you were to come watch him an hour and a half two hours before the game he practices that that shot religiously you can see why he puts it in during the game 10 in the second half he has Music 16 LEL is flying above the rim back to back well you cant guard him at The Rim Dave youre going to have to go over the rim and not many people can go up there thats the thats Uncharted Territory thats frying in the FL flying in the friendly Skies 12 for lall 42 of his shots are dunks Burnham timed the block perfectly on sers sers thought he had a sure two big time defensive Music play Burnham left alone The Defenders thought he was going to pass and we tied again at 48 well the Hokies had done a good job all game of shot faking pass faking to draw the the cardinal into the passing lanes and and challenging shots and I think Kyle Smith wants to call a timeout hes not going to wait for the TV timeout he wants to make sure that they they get some things under order here but look at the the way that goes up and just plays high above the rims 49 in my Music goodness there we go touchdown the Irish have done it Ohio State overwhelming what an alltime classic the college football playoff semifinals begin tomorrow and continue Friday who you got in the final Ohio State I theyre pretty good team Dave its hard to go against them they theyve been on fire looked very good against Oregon yes they did they dominated tied at 48 here 835 left Stanford a different team in the second half half blaks way off the mark from three yeah its not I think the shot that they wanted coming out of that timeout young got fouled got the hoop to go and hell have a chance for a threepoint play yeah thats a great isolation move with no help in the middle of the floor thats just a great finish and one opportunity look at this theres the catch the knife through the middle no help and youre to the rim chance to get it threepoint play and you know Kyle Smith so desperately trying to stop momentum Dave call it a timeout you say why you call it you know its you have a TV timeout coming but you cant wait for momentum to change I mean you have to stop it if you dont stop it sometimes you become a victim of it well get another TV timeout at the next whistle under the 8 Minute Mark Reno how do you leave him so wide open and thats another no no because hes done that that all year long and he was too comfortable I mean all the time in the world like Ben Burnham and you got to know the Scouting Report tells you hes can knock that shot down I know youd rather him shoot threes than take it and Hammer home shots at The Rim but he was too open Stanford regains the lead Lu oh my goodness a reverse alyu yeah I dont think he even saw the basket his head was in the rim number one number two he dunked it behind his head reverse Style Reverse dunk that was spectacular Music Young The Freshman says I got a highlight too yeah dont forget about me big fella he said I I got some hops now and hes fired up see if the stford Cardinal can follow his Music lead burn him inside second effort good now great second effort I mean he got it blocked but he stayed with his own shot you know if you get your shot blocked you know its getting blocked youre the one guy that can can gather it up and score it for thats a big time play by Ben Ben Applause Burnham yeah Jaylen Blakes not quite back in Rhythm Dave I think sitting on the bench has that effect on you sometimes you lose the Rhythm you had when you went out the wall now Maxim Ray knows Sky High for that nobody up and knows clouds sellers in the corner he knocks down the three hes so calm on his threepoint attempts I mean theres really not a lot of emotion he just goes up catches it he leaves the spot comes down the same spot Picture Perfect three point sellers with 16 and now coach Mike young says Ive seen enough Im theyre not going to wait for any TV timeouts but lets KOB l i mean Ben this in real time this kind of floored me no I I cant believe that I mean and he might have been foul on the play but uh you better get out there and know where hes at cuz he is a threat to the rim throw it up Lal will throw it down Music of Music Music were super excited about the first gymnastics meet of the season on the ACC Network Friday night at 9 Eastern well have the quad meet with Clemson NC State Arizona and Michigan which is the first of three quad meets this meeting this weekend in Oklahoma the team will be competing in four skills bars beam Vault and Flor Mike young 98 wins at Virginia Tech won 299 in 17 years at wford and led them to the tournament five times uh the guy can coach no hes done a great job Seth Greenberg and I caught up yesterday and Seth just really phrased him the job hes done this year I mean 12 of their scoring is not his back and theyre still getting the job done in competing every game Music poti goes right at Reno well thats a tough shot right in the grill of Maxim Reno tied at 56 yeah both you know really both centers showing their ability to use their off hand uh thats a good lesson for young players use use your off hand both hands Reno clears out the side so he can go right at poti the jump hook no good the tip no good the second tip is Good by Young yeah Diamond young is given his team a real lift today but how about the Cardinal on the offensive glass and thats the luxury of Maxim Renault he goes up to score you have two three Defenders on them theres going to be offensive rebounding opportunities if you crash Donovan Young The Freshman has given them a lot of quality minutes yeah and heres the look you see theres two Defenders on them and now theres an open man so theres the tip and now youre trying to box out but youre just playing scrambled defense this the Cardinals really taking advantage their ability to crash the offensive glass for some extra Second Chance points have one of those feelings coach we might have a last possession game yeah you dont want you dont want to have to be on the defensive end of this one uh both teams really showing you some their ability potit and Reno Reno did a nice job of keeping his feet Lex Steiner no good Reno with the board and Sanford fortunate after securing the defensive rebound that they were able to reload and get a stop but now if youre Stanford you know Reno is going to going to try to get his hands in the ball with screening and getting some touches here but gayen blanks has been a little quiet although hes been sitting most of this half Reno now with his 12th double double of the Season it leads the nation agal took the bump a nice delay move and well go to the free throw line well he saw he had an opening he was motioning for maxim REO to give him a ball screen the def defense was late to get there Dave so he just put his head down and got into the paint really good job agal only has two points but he does have four assists as he goes to the free throw line yeah its been a hard game to separate from here I mean Virginia Tech was able to separate heres Saturdays ACC Network basketball triple header Clemson host Florida State at little John to start us off at two Eastern and then North Carolina and NC State s off in Ry and finally Virginia Tech takes on Cal should be a great afternoon of evening Hoops on the ACC Network Im excited uh you know you mentioned this Dave uh ACC basketball thats new to the Bay Area and so uh first ever game so uh its been a good one its been a great a great Music contest Blakes almost had the Steal Rob to PO defended nicely That Picture Perfect Defense by Ryan Agarwal he fronted the block and he just went up skyed up and stole the pass Stanford sellers again now Jah ss better take Jaylen Blakes out to lunch hes found him about three four times now for some good looking shots heres a threepointer you see the penetration the stop on a dime the fif pass and the Dagger by sellers second half performers Toby Lal the high flyer four in the first half 10 in the second Maxim Reno the sevenfooter from Paris six in the first half 13 in the second already with another double double his 12th of the Season well Dave great players show you their influence and impact on the game and these two players have certainly done that this half theyve stepped up big time this is Stanfords largest lead Applause seven def def defense defense defense defense defense def defense young Rises up two flat raino with another rebound thats a good defensive stance by the Cardinal day they got a really good stop they got a good challenge and they cleaned up the defensive the Miss so great job giving themselves an opportunity to extend this lead REO double team kicks it all the way across Court agal no good young The Freshman with the offensive rebound a huge rebound maxing REO with the double even triple team he finds guys and they do a good job of rotating the ball Blakes draws the contact nobody better at getting to the free throw line now what he does Dave is hes really good at at angling he doesnt go splush into you he goes across your body so youve got to take a piece of him with you and thats why hes able to draw the fouls really really good point for young players you dont go Square you kind of go and you Glide and uh he does a good job of getting his Defender kind of putting him in jail as they say hes five of six from the free throw line tonight heres Sundays ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header featuring three top 20 teams number 14 Duke takes on Virginia at noon Eastern the 19th rank North Carolina host BC followed by number 13 Georgia teeken Lille and weap today with Miami and Syracuse a 90 Stanford run 6556 VK needs to do something on this possession young off lall above everybody and then he landed on blanks yeah thats thats a good call Dave because he went up clean for the rebound and the defender came Underneath Him and rooted him out and so the fans arent going to like it but thats the right call we can see it I I mean and what an offensive rebound look at the you talk about skying I mean look at that yeah you can see him moving under thats the right call four fouls on Brees but how hard is it to keep away from the rim hes its an impossible task hes just he plays High Above the Rim young all kinds of conf attacked and lays it in yeah referees letting him play a little bit but thats good now heres an area Stanfords got to worry about because its a twopossession game they cannot relax here they need to have good offensive POS possessions where they get good looks to the Music basket Young The Freshman back out to Music sers off the foot and for Keeps it well theyre going to want to review this which they can under two minutes a new rule I like it uh might reverse the call its got to be overwhelming evidence but its also a free timeout I like the review call I think teams are smart to use it and while theyre reviewing it much needed timeout and it is free one but heres the play yeah it looks like it was pretty clear off Virginia Tech yeah but I I like the review and as I mentioned Mike young getting a little B bit of a an opportunity to get his guys there and Coach his team down the stretch and what a great job hes done but you know lets not go to sleep on what Kyle Smith has done because his team was in trouble they were down double digits and hes brought his team all the way back had to use some timeouts had to put some guys in the game that havent played very much this year Donovan young for one whos just had an outstanding performance uh and hes had to play with Jaylen Blakes on the bench so uh the former Pack 12 coach of the year last year uh no secret to success Kyle Smith hes hes been around hes a veteran Coach and hes havt earn it this has not been an easy game for him I like the fact too we talked about Reno only six in the first half man I feel like he didnt force it in the second Music half in the back hes a smart player but he you know he he did let the game come to him and uh its showing off its showing up right now but if youre uh you know your Virginia Tech you want to see if you can get a stop here then close the gap go Blakes no good got the shot off Stanford gets a fresh 20 a huge offensive tip back thats what youre taught to do tip it out and it worked to Perfection now a brand new shot clock Jaylen Blakes sure with the basketball they try to whittle a clock down Reno thats going to be short but it went right to Aral he missed it Young The Freshman tried to tip it Stanford backtoback offensive rebound I like Ryan Aral hes hes so slippery hes long hes hes hes rangy and he knows where to go Dave hes got a great radar for the ball but those are really huge offensive rebounds the one thing you cant do if youre Virginia Tech right now is give Stanford a second no and I think they were leaking out a little bit you know theyre playing again with a man down they got some interesting combinations out uh theyre theyre giving you a game effort but theyre having to play with combination theyre probably not used to playing with you know with their point guard out right now if youre Stanford the last thing you want to do is foul stop the clock uh and give up an opportunity for Virginia Tech to get back in this game uh with a a short a stop clock and a free throws agall four for four from the free throw line and they havent been close hes hes steady Stanford up by nine only a minute Music left agal was they tried the lob to lual and he was he was too far away but he got fouled yeah and again thats a good Target because hes so tough to play down there he goes up Above the Rim youre not youre not going to keep him company Im sorry hes hes up there flying by himself hes flying solo and so thats a smart play his teammates know that they throw to the rim nobody else can go up there and get it so now heres what the hes want to do they they want to stop the clock and climb back in this game with over a minute to play plenty of time the W made both s throws and thats the Jinx now two for three I didnt say Applause it second one good 15 for lall and heres a press plenty of time back in this game if youre Stanford you must secure the ball you got the the the jump ball arrow take a jump ball get tied up sers breaks the double team gets it to BLS young smartly pulls it out really smart play by is seldom used Donovan young here comes the double team and flakes his foul yeah you have to stop and play the foul game now not enough possessions but you know youve got to say really give Stanford Credit I mean theyre playing against a really fired up Hoke Squad that gave Stanford everything they wanted the first half they were down deep uh double digits and theyve come back and theyve done that you know with jayen Blakes and fou troubles come back now to give his team some much needed baskets Maxim Reno great second half by him oiah sers uh theyve got some theyve got some balance on this team the Cardinals do Blakes has 15 points he has six assists now 16 points thats the jayen Blakes that that Stanford knows Virginia Tech got a shoot impressive comeback by Stanford after that terrible first half drop no and that you know they theyve earned this one nothing easy about this playing the hokes hes have been game they they put forth a great effort but stford just a better second Applause half Burnham no good on the release and another rebound by Renault and then the foul by Jason shoot on Blakes and Blakes will go back to the free throw line we mentioned this earlier and I think its worth mentioning again Dave thats youre talking about a hoke team that that only returned 12 of their scoring now many teams in the country thats thats about as low a percentage as you can have yet Mike young has put a competitive team on the floor and he had the you know he had the lead for a good portion of this game so thats a building block for his team and hell get his starting point guard back hopefully uh you know to come back so uh this is you know this is still a statement game and uh a game you can build on but now they got to go back across the bay and play Cal whos going to be hungry as well uh no rest stops in this league for sure Blakes game impressive when you think he played a lot of it with three and four fouls no he showed a lot of patience good discipline in the second half R yeah theyll let this go out been dominating the rebound but this is a hard earned Victory by the Stanford Cardinal and they can take this into Saturdays matchup obviously with Virginia but uh good good second half by the Cardinal it was their half an impressive comeback win by the Stanford Cardinal Ben Braun I think this Stanford
