10 moments away from the start of our game lets take a look at our starting lineups presented by your local Toyota dealers Boston College and their record on the season 8 and 10 Jaden Zachary doubledigit score for this team as well along with the Langford brothers are for North Carolina and Hubert Davis Caleb love top threepoint shooter on the team and he is part of the Toyota starting lineup for North Carolina and they own the opening tip in the white and blue Boston College and traveling maroon and gold in time not because Im a center but I think its going to be a great matchup inside between Armando baycat and then youve got a guy from Boston College Quentin posts coming back from an early season foot surgery good defensive stand early for BC Ashton Langford brings it up to the Eagles this is post against bacon trying to back his way in into the paint setting up shot well defended by bacon it just sat on that left shoulder and posted and he they were given to all kinds of room to turn back but he didnt want to go that way thank God try to return their favorite opposed around him high off the glass attacked away running around from the double team which was coming low thank you BC is two and five at conference player they do not have a win yet away from Chestnut Hill Zachary in tight bacon tried to wrestle it away and is off of North Carolina listen to the team Boston College that really struggles neither team has really built around the threepoint shot North Carolina scores with their pace of play DC is going to have to manufacture some offense in this game tonight Eagles last played Saturday that was at home against Wake Forest losing 8563 they made nine threes in that game well above their season average shot clock is down to seven Zachary just inside the line the box out it came to post he had a chance fight for the loose ball ripped away by RJ Davis and liaro favors Boston College post had an easy shot right there but it was low he brought the guards into play and allowed Davis to tie him up just couldnt get a handle on it right there Eagles hustle back on defense Carolina going under the screens theyre getting the shooter letting them prove themselves from the outside BC is getting some decent looks and Nance puts it on the floor baycott for the 126 Tar Heels Mass gets a nice kind bounce hes back after missing time with the uh with the sore back start for him and you know you got a guy coming back off an injury its good to start him while hes loose from pregame warmups back injury for Nance at Pitt and missed the last three games Coast trying to back it on down against Bangkok he finally turned the way that bacon was seeding to him but he couldnt finish they bounce it inside to bank out against two Defenders here that Ashton Lankford reached in heres the look you see it sitting on that left shoulder because thats the way post wants to turn and he had a great angle to the basket just could not finish decide for the team high in points and that win at Louisville on Saturday for North Carolina and Armando Bay copter first true Road victory of the season Jacob has to kick it out its too high Davis couldnt go up the ladder to get it and a turnover for North Carolina you know its interesting Tom I mean theyre coming with the double team with number 11 Ashton Langford if you watch that hes coming low and really bacon has turned away from it thats just a wild pass across Court the Eagles have missed all five of their shot chances so far the first half these two uh we talked about beforehand that these two had an ugly shooting game here last year shot clock down to six Earl Grant very high on him and uh you know this this team has had some injury issues too theyre starting guys are healthy but theyre not quite in top game shape around post score of the basket they have really been emphasizing Bay cut early on in this game trying to get him touches good seal right there Music foreign Music on the season for Bangkok tapped out he retrieves it thats got Nance keeping that alive raycott only played a minute in that game against Virginia he responded strong fashion against Louisville with a double double his tenth of the year thats broken up Zachary Carolinas been a little casual with the basketball here in the first four minutes close against Nance thumbs up short he was having a tough tough time finishing so far early Davis on the run through three Defenders this is next preball a couple of Threes for Pete Nance graduate student transfer from Northwestern who shoots 34 from Beyond The Arc of the season and thats just an extra bonus as he gets if he gets that dialed in and uh you know BC continuing trying to get something going inside cannot find the basket driving low post was ready defensively trying to get that second foul on him Lankford against Bay cut wants a drive Tamar Langford really nobody stopped to dribble up the up the court guy somebodys got to meet him free throw line extend to try to slow him down he was running downhill Davis what a drive by Lankford as he challenged bayka trailing to play it was kind of a weird deal that Steph Curry and Baker were arm in arm walking up the floor got five rebounds so far in the first half low straight away its offline and he has really been struggling from before in the last five games last six nine to 37 and three coming in sorrow Grant his second season as the BC coach they won two games at the ACC tournament a season ago got to the quarters that one got the post maybe off the fingertips of Bangkok he just baked hot they were going to wobble over the top baycot mistined his jump and maybe thats you know the good thing for Post finally convert something inside despite the early struggling shooting for foster College its a twopoint game four minutes in six minutes in rather down to 14 left and a half shot clock at six for North Carolina love Music post was in there may have deflected it a good late Health a little risky though pose the catch and the basket from Ashton Langford challenge is the shot on one end just beat everybody down the floor it was a great look ahead by BC the Eagles have tied it up Music all the way in for the rim Bender well you know theyre I think theyre theyre really struggling to figure out how to come over and double Bay pack post looked like he was expecting some help but you know rather than pick up a silly second foul just let him go in that Mondo Bangkok fourth in the conference in scoring 174 points per game second in rebounding almost 11 per game coming up against North Carolina the hustle from Quinton post made the play defensively got down the other end and Watch Out Below number five Chapman at home Earl Grant talked about Boston College controlling the tempo in this game I think the pain threshold would be about 70 points he wants to keep something underneath that and for North Carolina Hubert Davis said his team is sharing the ball really well now to this point two assists three turnovers theyve been a little Slappy with the ball but Pete Nance a couple of Threes makes life a lot easier Tom met here in Chapel Hill last season January 26th it was a win for Hubert Davis and the Tar Heels 5847 North Carolina as a team in that game shot 29 percent it is the only time in the history of basketball here but they shot less than 30 percent and won the game well and youre saying at home how can that be well Boston College shot 21 for the game exactly substitutions bacon has gone to the North Carolina bench post to the Boston College bench they come with four points theyve got another nice match up with Nance and vickerstaff he leads his team in threepoint shooting 45 in the room Madison trying to get around love Falling Away deep in the shot clock Applause out leaky black is an asset on the backboard and hes got the ability to carry the ball out on the dribble leaky black playing his 141st Career College basketball game this evening against the Eagles man its time to the other side not the desired result after canning two threepointers earlier just testing it out maybe hes a little bit better on the left side of the floor Zachary tractor jump it off North Carolina edlow and you know really for bicker staff he would have been better holding the ball and taking a three second rather because if you try to make that play thats the first pass to a fast break okay the Love is in the Box Score over 16 points per game Applause hes made 34 threes on the season the lead this Carolina Club Zachary in a congested area its not a problem no but hes the guy that I think they want to try to drive off the line hes a very good threepoint shooter with the team in scoring in the loss Saturday at home against Wake Forest with 14 points for Zachary trying to produce a turnover foul along the Baseline it was a driving puff Johnson I love making his way all the way to the rim and then Zachary does it for Buster here has five rebounds tonight already Mike and I believe this to be true he never lost the game in Cameron Indoor Stadium Music 40 so bakot in pursuit of that rebounding record Music its got his fingerprints all over the record books in fact hes just one double double away like we told you Billy Cunningham the day Smith Hall of Famer has 60 career double doubles bacon with 59 Billy C did that in probably about 80 games and double figure rebounds as well the kangaroo kid is unbelievable athlete betcot is back into the lineup 66 times in his career hes gone for doubledigit rebounds that is the school record also climbing the list in career points will continue to document baycotts Ascension as Johnson converts from the freethrow line thats his first point of the game lets see what bay pack can do uh post not out on the floor right now so hes got a big size advantage on the offensive end foreign Applause Music Applause Carolina lead Applause giving him a lot of latitude on the offensive end threepointer is all net and that is a huge lift to Carolinas offense when hes knocking down threes a little bit of a Tipping Point here early in this game Tom its just lead as a game in the first half for North Carolina picker staff trying to go around Bangkok Langford got the defender in the air and a foul is called Ted Valentine Clarence Armstrong and Matt otter officiating our game program told us the shoot around today weve got to worry about what Boston College does well were trying to overcome some early shooting struggles in this one Mike you know it was interesting time I thought that both teams really focused in on their own stuff as far as you know running things being crisp in their execution and Earl Grant the one thing they talked about in the half court especially is not letting North Carolinas cars run downhill which in the half court may happen BC trying to snap a threegame losing streak they do have a couple of wins at ACC play a home against Notre Dame and they also wanted home against Virginia Tech and late December in overtime 7065 and now Four Points Langford they had a close loss on January 7th at home Mike for BC against Duke by a single point after losing Atkins earlier this season for the Eagles Applause foreign shoots pretty nice defense that time that Babcock couldnt get anything going inside against a smaller player its the Midway part of the first half Jake and Zachary misses Eagles try to keep it alive it goes out of bounds and we stay at this end of the floor Applause who came flying in Mike 21 in maroon and Pena also in the neighborhood thats it undersized but very active theyre getting off the floor quickly retaining possession theyve had some long possessions down here have not had much to show for it was trying to escape some defensive pressure on the sideline DC keeps it Music Applause North Carolina is working on a 10game home winning streak 80 in the season well Grants team trying to disrupt that prior to his arrival in 2020 BC David Chapel Hill Land one Music a lone victory in the last 15 meetings speak with a shot clock from Lankford slightly off balance baycott fights for it with McLaughlin locked and gets the foul for BC missed the first of our ACC double header really good game following us after this its going to be a you know its going to be a big test Clemson breaks into the national rankings this year for the first time how did they take that on the road how do they handle that responsibility one of three teams in the ACC along with Miami and Virginia ranking the top 25 Miami had a claw back to win the game against Syracuse last night after losing in overtime on Saturday against NC State and thats a turnover from North Carolina its fourth of the first half but Trimble who got the it was more of a shot I think but they want him to be aggressive offensively he has not been a part of the offense much in the Latin League Play Applause looking for help and he throws it right to the North Carolina bench 7 54 to go in the first half Boston College and North Carroll provided by Armando baykai nice job on the glass as he always does theyve really featured him in this game early on they want to get him some Touches at an easy dunk right there and a great follow right here and Tom we talked about Louisville he had a doubledouble in the first half he is closing in on that right now six points eight rebounds baycott seeking his 60th career DoubleDouble now should he get one tonight he would still Trail the GMan he double doubles in a Duke uniform somehow I think hes going to go past that other names from Clemson who told you Billy Cunningham has the record here at North Carolina with 60 Tim Duncan leads the way in the ACC 87 double doubles followed by Ralph Simpson with 84 yeah I dont I dont think he can get on the podium I think hed get to third place an amazing run by this Tar Heel program season ago from first year head coach Hubert Davis all the way to the national title game had to beat Duke at the end of the regular season and at the Final Four to get to that Championship matchup against Kansas thats amazing theres some of those names you talked about her from a while ago those numbers have stood up for a long time not too long ago G man well yeah yeah by the way it has not scored Mike hes PCs leading scorer this season Applause its a good size matchup for North Carolina this is back to the starting lineup for Boston College first working his way and shot clocks down to eight poked Away by baycot hello the half court has been a struggle for DC love Fox and rattles out he needs to get some easy baskets one of six right now we talked about his shooting struggles theyve continued Applause Caleb love missed all seven of his threepoint tries against Louisville that snapped the streak a 45 straight games with at least one made three for lunch bounces off for Ashton Langford Johnson trying to get around post stood his ground ball out of bounds and it will stay with the Tar Heels Ted Valentine yeah it was a pretty good defense post and not again trying to avoid that second foul and Earl Grant gave him some time off the court I think he really would like to get him into the second half with just one foul Tar Heels have won three of their last four as they return home where they are 80 this season three and Owen conference play Davis from threepoint real estate RJ Davis and thats been a half of their made field goals from behind the arc half of their attempts as well Davis second on the team with 33 made threes for the Junior from White Plains New York first basket of the game for RJ Davis a league Bay see him be a little bit more aggressive I like his game so far hes got Nance matched up on him hes faced him that time got a really nice jump shot in Rhythm Prince alike with four points for the freshman Davis was driving post defending Applause so hes missing all that time with a broken foot so again his you know the injuries okay but his conditioning still has to catch up senior from Amsterdam and Netherlands inside a 10 on the shot clock Zachary trying to post it up on Davis who commits the foul well and thats the thing you know aside from post the BC has been trying to run their guards into the post which is not a bad idea especially you know with the Langford brothers and Zachary is a solid body going up against Davis and guards do not like to guard in the low box Tom so you know would you play a good way to pick up fouls and thats now two fouls on RJ Davis Applause Jaden Zachary the sophomore Salem Wisconsin standing at the free throw line for Boston College told you about that win at home against Notre Dame one of two ACC wins Zachary another game by 18 points in that winning effort thats the next destination for BC theyre going to South Bend for Saturday to take on the Irish really surprised that Notre Dames League record so far with all those grad students back and uh lachesky coming back again for a fifth year the Irish just one and six in conference play Mike Applause Nance was doubled weak side Applause trying to get his back up on the Square underneath the backboard out of bounds and its North Carolina ball lets see how North Carolinas offense operates without Davis on the floor he got loved at the point now theyve got a pretty big team out there lets see how they get organized baycotts got nine rebounds in the first half or inside of five minutes to go and black wants to call a timeout and theyve had a issue with sideline uh out of bounds plays and uh you know something they worked on today and they were just very casual getting into that play and Huber Davis is very upset with this squad right now Music Davis trying to light a fire under his team had some words of encouragement at the shoot around back to 2020 the Eagles taking out the Tar Heels 7170 Jared Hamilton grew up in the Charlotte area Carolina fan LED BC with 18 points in the gamewinning free throws Cole Anthony missed the three at the buzzer the Eagles snapped a 12game losing streak to the Tar Heels dating back to 2000s and they celebrated here at the Smith Center Roy Williams has been a fixture since retiring enjoying his view of things and uh just about at every road game as well thank you playing on Roy Williams court at the Dean Smith Center 903 career wins five national championships between those two names so baycott able to clean up the mess thats eight points and ten rebounds I would say Mike I feel pretty good about Baker getting double double number 60 for his career Applause post forcing the issue right in the face of Nance and six points per post yep good take for him he found the range uh earlier right now this this pays this score favors BC seventh all time we go inside of four minutes North Carolina has dominated this series recently winning 14 of the last 15 or 20 and six against BC another rebound fake cop gives love a chance Nance with the onehanded forward he got pushed in the back a league Bay so the foul against Boston College eight points 11 rebounds North Carolina in front of Boston College 347 to go first half as we take a look around the league and coaches and Milestones thats the theme so far Mike and Tony Bennett sneaking up he wants to get into that 400 win the club as well Leonard Hamilton uh doing a brad Brownell getting there this year had a big win against Duke at home over the weekend in a very Stern test right after us this evening at Wake Forest coach Hamilton also got career win number 600 with Georgia Tech visiting a week ago its one of only five coaches in the ACC to get to that number at their respective schools of course thats Bangkok thats 10 points and that is the first half DoubleDouble yeah good quick find he had great position on posters and easy conversion close from the entry bounces out Applause so that is number 60 the time for the school record with Billy Cunningham and thats I mean we talked about it thats not for the last two games thats for the last two first half yeah that hes had double doubles picked up his first personal foul just a moment ago bangkoks five of seven from the floor the rest of the team is five of 20 shootings what that does is just it speaks to consistency and you know getting out there and you know its nice when a coach can sit there and pencil in a double double for a game from a guy last season in the tournament Run for the finals Mike baycott had 99 rebounds postseason School record now granted they played six games but it was all over the class well and but the reason BC is within shouting distance post having a nice game in his own right even hes got eight points for rebounds straight away DeMarco done had a fabulous game against Louisville and uh good to see him getting off to a quick start 14 points in that game of seven from the floor and he came off The Benchmark to play 26 minutes against the Cardinals and winning on the road Zachary Springs free done getting hung up on the screen that time good movement without the basketball looked like McLaughlin on the feed so were cutting Jaden Zachary you know hes listed at 62 and thats probably generous but he is not afraid to be inside love flying through the rim and he lays it in hes got four see thats what he needs to do right you know just you know for the foreseeable future make three or four layups and then build your way back out to build up that confidence inside now Mike you talked about his struggles from the floor against Louisville on the road just three of 14 for Caleb love there is two of nine in this game and has missed all four of his threepoint attempts and in this stretch hes got to run the team too post thinking about a three Kelly missed underway for North Carolina and black thank you hit the deck post with the uh foul away for a minute heres the look and theyre just you know I he should be in The Scouting Report from there but thats just good movement without the basketball for Zachary and then here it is a good back cut youve got sides attack the rim post was lifted so there was no shot blocker inside for Don who made that three a moment ago the 14 points of Louisville first time in his career to get the double digits pull this off hes on the weak side rips it down and it knocked away McLachlan made the play theyre going to call Zachary for the foul hes been some pretty good defense North Carolina getting on the offensive the class though getting multiple possessions nine offensive rebounds for North Carolina so far Applause Tar Heels into the bonus with done at the free throw line youve got first Miss just a function he was only five of six on the season so hasnt had enough reps there to get comfortable his teammate Armando baycott 12 rebounds 14 points in the first half showing no ill effects of that injury to his ankle very early in the game against Virginia in fact just in the first minute yeah and Zachary comes back and answers and you know what I saw that injury and I saw the way that bacon was helped off the floor I thought it surprised me and it says a lot about him that he was back the very next game I thought it was gonna be out for a while yeah a loss at Virginia 6558 followed up by the Louisville win Here Comes Zachary again streaking down the lane and putting it in 10 points in the first half for Zachary yeah and this is exactly what BC needed to you know not let North Carolina stretch out the lead going into half theyve had a nice little spurt here Applause black out of the corner Bickerstaff up for the board hes had some big rebounding nights hes very very good at undersized but on the glass so the Eagles have taken the timeout Zachary with the 10 points he is the leading scorer Quentin post had has eight tonight well if things continue and thats a big if but you know were looking at a game in the 60s right now which is exactly what Earl Grant talked about you know if this thing got into the 80s he didnt think his Squad would be able to keep pace and I agree with him Applause 79 seconds to go in this first half the Langford Brothers need to show up in the second half Ashton Langford oh of three so far Applause Makai Ashton Lankford is the leading scorer for this BC team over 12 points per game coming up after Russ check your local listings game and time in your area number 19 Clemson into the top 25 were defeated in conference play 70 and on a sevengame winning streak against Wake Forest which has not lost at home this season for Steve Ford thats coming up nine Eastern check your local listings a 20point win in Clemson South Carolina earlier this season for the Tigers when the teams met foreign Applause game knocked out of bounds Carolina ball 65 on the clock BC has left a few more than a few points on the floor with some easy layups inside they have not converted 38 shooting in the first half Boston College 39 North Carolina love stumbles got tangled up with McLaughlin and thats not actually a bad foul the all right now that does put them in the 11 so there will be free throws second on Devin McLaughlin Richard freshman for Washington Earl Grant in his second season was the head coach at the College of Charleston with the NCAA tournament with that program and 2018 Advance turns around and shoots 3126 will be the halftime lead but Jayden Zachary and his teammates might get encouraged hanging in there with the Tar Heels oh absolutely I think this is uh you know we talked about a great pace for them North Carolina has been bothered by some turnovers they really rely on obviously them and Langford has not scored in the game oh three so far only three field goal attempts College only attempted two threepointers missed a boat North Carolina five of 14 on three corners they have the ball crank up the second half Capitol Hill North Carolina it was a noticeable dropoff too in the efficiency with Davis off the floor for North Carolina he needs to stay on and number five picks up right where he left off 12 points in the game Armando Baker already with his 60th DoubleDouble for his career to tie the Carolina record theyre going to call big for the foul heres the look just great spin no double team help coming from the Baseline like it was in the first half so he had a great angle to the basket second foul picked up by bacock has his 11th DoubleDouble of the season for the senior from Richmond Virginia Langford rattles that one in um the Junior from Worcester Massachusetts now with six points in the game for BC neither one of them really been aggressive that was only the third field goal to test in the game for him love launching foreign Applause take that shot seven points for love his first three of the game and 162nd three of his career and thats post calculating the angle hes got 10 and hes being aggressive I mean hes attacking Bay Cod he got an early foul on him in this half he wants to pick up a second one black they caught against post count the basket well and the one who makes that happen leaky black at six eight getting on the offensive glass its a very very long tall front line that North Carolina has out there which is finishing right through the play post now with three personals Bay caught up to 15 points after the free throw to go along with his 13 rebounds Carolina by nine this is again BC has had the answer for uh these it looks like North Carolina is going to stretch the lead out lets see what they do with this possession defending secondary post with the tip okay Davis is going to be his third foul and what he did he got hung up inside on post posted rolled in he was right in front and I think post make it two free throws out of this foreign Applause my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism and a whole lot of getgo one of two from post hes at 11 points for BC he and Zachary doubledigit scores Bay cop leads the way with 15 the only Tar Heels to get the double figure so far Davis tried to drop it to Nance passing tight quarters out of bounds and Eagle basketball just really I mean Davis was too close to Nance to make that post Play Good active hands defensively for Applause Music so that last foul that was originally given to RJ Davis has been switched to Nance Music from North Carolina so Davis the two personals the move against big good aggressive move no double team coming from North Carolina and bacon kind of gave him room inside that time didnt want to pick up a second foul here early in the second half 13 points now for post remember hes missed 13 games this season for the eagles with a foot injury Davis wreak gathers and hits the three Applause crowd wanted a foul on post who showed really hard out on that screen which is what they worked in the shoot around today Davis we talked about it hes really been finding the range in the last 10 games Mikeys two for two on threepointers Ashton Lankford on the feed from post and that foul is against Davis itll be his third heres a look you see the you know and then just late getting there by Ashton Langford Davis just taking the extra dribble getting some space to shoot the ball with that third foul it doesnt look like Huber Davis is making a move to substitute for him Applause Davis whos made a couple of Threes out of the seven made in total for North Carolina right on their season average for threes in a game and now Makai Ashton Lankford his first point of the game comes with the 1646 mark of the second half and lets see too if BC keeps going to that play to try to put some pressure on Davis defend both langfords can get into the paint and score his guards Kai Ashton Lankford closing in on a thousand points for his career both at Providence and Boston College needs 14 now for a thousand with those two free throws his first points of the evening Nicole Grant talked about the fact that the team that he had working this summer was not the team that he had to start the season because of injuries hes starting to look a little bit more like what he had collected out of bounds North Carolina basketball both teams right now Mike shooting 43 in the game big improvement from the last time they played here this season ago the both teams were in the 20s and Carolina won it back they won both meetings last season between the teams shot clock is inside a tent Crux it over Davis calm the Lane Aston Langford recovered Zachary out ahead using the body to shield from the defender black comes in and grabs it and he was too interested in drawing contact instead of finishing RJ Davis fivepoint swing all at PACE of play Ashton Langford long distance three attempts Applause and then theyre going to get a jump ball and its going to be BC Ball but trying to blow the roof off the Smith Center fans almost went bananas GMan on that last three attempt by RJ Davis we were going to wear those outfits its a good thing we didnt that would have been embarrassing yeah I just think we thought we had an original idea but uh a little bit of a calculated Risk by Earl Grant that time not he was close to calling a timeout to stop that run if Davis had hit that three he would have been it would have forced his hand for sure but he was able to get to the under 16 media timeout and to jump off so lets see how they execute out of that time out in this possession so Grant spent some time in the ACC over Brad Brownell as an assistant coach of Clemson taking over at the College of Charleston and now Boston College in his second season file against North Carolina Music well you want to stay tuned for the fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer just to show you the respect that Zacharys gotten defensively theyve got leaky black on him hes about six inches taller and of course to follow us from WinstonSalem the doubleheader tonight nice left hand eight points their guards have done a nice job in the low post good answer Langford Jr the younger brother Applause black tried to flip it inside it was knocked away Miss Brockton anticipation off the glass just the turnover black guy caught without a dribble trying to Lazy one hand pass and that leads to two points and all of a sudden now the crowd has to reenergize Applause bickerstaffs first points of the night that look at that defensive stance what Earl Grant how about the 46 year old from North Charleston South Carolina Mikey played at division two Georgia College and by the way I like the shirt I like the coach I do too sorry Im a little Im a little old school but I like that nice matching sneakers as well and this and this run happened with posts hes coming back into the game but it happened with a smaller lineup out there 13 points for post to defend against bacon those two guys are really talking going at it and theres a conversation right now and they need to be separated well the thing that posts cant afford is a double technical right here to get his fourth personal foul hes got four on that play and uh just very physical inside hes gotta hes got to understand what his foul situation is Applause Zachary poked it away into the North Carolina bench and its a good thing they got that tip out and uh were gonna leave the uh the post they were going to go right at him and try to pick up that Fifth and he is not a darling with the North Carolina fans right now physical aggressive play between him and bacon on the inside jump Scott Davis 11 points as you can see Hubert Davis staying with him with those three fouls thats so important to this team Applause RJ Davis approaching his average on the season 162 points per game vicker staff defended by bacon knocks it away to Black Davis has the last eight points for North Carolina Applause wow this is what the big man has to do he was anticipating the double team and if youre leaky black just follow that guy right in have your hands ready and you get a threepoint play opportunity out here how about the graduate student thats thats two college careers Concord North Carolina 41 games amazing 68 from the line cannot finish off the old school threepoint play Ashton Langford slightly off the mark maycock gobbles it up 14 rebounds done Baseline looking for Johnson and itll stay with North Carolina I think DeMarco Gunn would have been uh better served to try to get that up it looked like he was in a pretty good position to convert to the left John who missed five games this season with a hand injury hes got four points tonight for Carolina bench Davis directs some traffic 10 on the shot clock foreign accelerating good take in his defender on his hip the whole way in so a good decision to go right to the rim hes got four points is he hanging in there with North Carolina Applause s calling for the ball on the Block Davis puts it and hits it big lift yet you know Bank Ive got more touches when post was in the game than when hes getting started by a smaller Defender but Davidson has been brilliant from the perimeter 14 points for Davis Christian Langford High degree of difficulty around baycott Applause black could not handle the pass a little bit high and out of bounds and thats what happens when a guard doesnt lead the fast break Johnson not a little out of control with the turnover in transition North Carolinas early season struggles were well documented to Tumble out of the top 25 but returning to saw the play We asked Rupert Davis about that he said maybe it was a good experience for this club early on Mike well he also said hed like to go 400 and learn from that experience too that wouldnt be such a bad thing but come to think of it yeah like for junior put on the brakes lost the handle Victor stop is there for PC thats a basketball family right there his uncle the head coach of the Cleveland Cavaliers grandfather Bernie and hes 12th in the conference and rebounds yeah 63 so talk about him undersized but knows for the ball so the foul against North Carolina and Armando big tops via Hunter Tyson and the Clemson Tigers Mike trying to stay perfect at ACC play that was a huge get for Brad Brownell for him to come back this year its such a leader you know double double for him the threepoint shooting and uh you know I think in this game too PJ Hall may be a big factor for Clemson uh you know hes hes had some inquiry issues the uh the dislocated knee and uh coming back from that but hes had some big ingame plays for that club ball had 26 points in the win against Duke on Saturday hes had a terrific year Tyree Appleby Monsanto and three here its the Eagles and the Tar Heels 5243 Applause Langford Jr Armando Baker okay Margie Davis is down he got popped on that play yeah RJ Davis who has 14 points on his four of five on threepointers thanks for looking it was just he was in the vicinity of baycat today a second was also there and baycott was kind of pointing at thickerstaff after the rebound his 15th of the game Davis appears to be okay and hell bring it up for North Carolina how about Davis Mike 11th of the last 13 points out of the Tar Heels thank God his improved shooting come out he had a hand injury early in the season really struggling but its found the range Applause black cannot find a range and theyre gonna theyll let him shoot theyd prefer to have him shoot of anybody on the floor quick release from Zachary Applause entry to Bangkok with a turnaround wow how did he figure that one out broke out the protractor and hit it off the glass with very little angle to work with but this is where he just does his work early look he gets two feet in the paint trying to catch great Point Blank Range beautiful position really nothing to Bickerstaff could do 17 points for Bangkok right on his season average stay at 17 15 boards as well whistle on the player first on Johnson he gets the foul for North Carolina Music so baked out with his 17 points went past Mitch cup when the alltime scoring list here at North Carolina is that year round today it was great to see him another manager down the road can you see with those answers to stay within shouting distance great move by Victor staff with two his grandfather was the first ever coach of the Charlotte Bobcats back in her 405 Bernie out of bounds BC ball those are the things I mean you know when Hubert Davis talked about the turnovers the empty possessions and just really harping on his team on defense every possession locking in Applause Zachary missed blackhead the board PC yet to make a three in this game Eagles want to run might have the numerical Advantage great passing and a chance from Boston College and Pena thats what happens when you shoot a corner jump shot especially from the Baseline tough to get it you got to have a couple Defenders back that was a great Break by BC Applause Applause shot clocks at five Chase way over biggerstaff the bay cut shot did not hit the rim Johnson came over the top of the board and got fouled heres the look you see again and this is Zachary leading everything they got four guys out great touch pass really nice finish by Pena Applause picked up his second foul I think theyre gonna look and see if that foul happened after the shot clock s shot was very late in the shot clock Johnson came over the top on the miss that I I believe Mike did not hit the rim and thats thats been a big big factor for North Carolina 13 Second Chance points in this game Music you are the referees arm went up well after the shot clock expired Applause Ted Valentine and Clarence Armstrong are at the monitor Clarence Armstrong was the one who made the call you saw his arm go up Music so while the officials deliberate heres the Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina upcoming schedule for the Tar Heels so theyll theyll run into the wolf pack Mike on Saturday right here at the Smith Center yeah big rivalry game Interstate rivalry game and then you have to travel and play that zone up at Syracuse which is having a very good League schedule Pitt all of a sudden becomes a very tough game and then at Cameron Indoor on February 4th and then you have to go to Wake Forest that is a tough run partner you dont have the just everybody is in the top third of the conference right there recordwise Applause its our heels are four and three in conference play and so the foul was committed prior to the shot clock Johnson got the double digits the home win January 7th against the Irish or far from the floor Johnson with just a single point so far and over three from the floor still more kills being intended to before we put it back in play with 903 to go and I dont think were ready quite yet hurry surprised over the bench getting a little uh extra rest well Dunn wanted to go to the freethrow line and take the free throws and Johnson said its my turn foreign Applause 65 on the season for Johnson at the line jaycat leads the game with 17 points and 15 rebounds imagine Huber Davis just trying to get him a quick blow underneath to get underneath the eight minute mark baycott has scored in double digits in every game Mike except the Virginia game where he had to leave with the ankle injury in the first minute of the play seven times this season he scored 20 or more BC still within Striking Distance 8 45 to go and rolling Pena Applause hes trying to factor in the second half give me some good point four points he had that nice Gunk off the break earlier BC has not LED in this game the North Carolina in front all the way Applause and answered a couple of early threepointers in this game working the interior does not get the roll Madsen the clearance well good well give Vickers that a little some extra credit he is hanging away inside oneonone he was playing fake out earlier now hes got Nance to deal with tough pass the catch for Bickerstaff fights for it

back in with uh four personal fouls shot clock to 10 for post taking it right at Nancy goals old school was that a sky hook yeah he really got Nance buried who took him a few dribbles to get inside might have gotten away with a little bit of the travel but uh its a little bit different going against Nance inside as opposed to baycot 15 points now for post the Eagles have cut it to five nickel Caroline is led by as many as 11 BC has a chance with a three to cut it to two they have not made a three in the game Mike their own profile whats the difference North Carolina with nine made threes posts midrange he got it post rip and ropes for the Eagles and its a threepoint game yeah were getting into a little bit of a nervous zone for North Carolina but how about how about post Applause love let the defender go by e a tough shot for taking that situation the offense isnt working real well early long three for a guy whos not shooting the ball well in general 17 points for post season High gets it inside to Zachary one point game 80 BC run how about the high low to Zachary inside nobody below the freethrow line and post makes the play Applause what happened to that 11 point lead for Carolina DC is going to challenge them with the zone right now shot clocked out of six RJ Davis poked around a league Bay in front of the Carolina bench Davis there too the officials consult and theyll award the ball to the Tar Heels Applause North Carolina knocked back on their heels a little bit right now not great body language out there they got to post it right into it the ball hasnt even been entered yet they caught back in for North Carolina with his DoubleDouble with 17 points and 15 boards career high earlier this season against James Madison 23 rebounds Armando Bay cop love stepping back hes behind the line hey well the one thing throughout it all he is a big shot maker will never really be a high percentage guy asking Langford cut off by black shot clock is at five post

Caleb love he was trying to set up bacon for the alley oop got a bet and laid it in 12 points for low post got it from Ashton Lankford fumbled it out of bounds it is off of North Carolina Ill tell you what Earl Grants showing a lot of confidence in his team not calling a timeout right there letting him play through this possession nine seconds on the shot clock Music BC had closed the Gap to one havent scored since Aston Langford misses in tight and thats the rebound oh Point Blank Range in that layup with Kai Ashton Langford Mike is one of eight from the floor got beat by Davis post recovered post got a piece of him and thats number five crowd letting him hear it but uh hes hes played a very very nice game for BC tonight and I think theyve got some good things to look forward to him as he gets his conditioning back from that injury Mike youre right this is just the sixth game of the season season High 17 points program told us hes hes crawling right now you got to crawl before you walk and the league Bay is walking right now but hes gonna you know hes hes also going to get into safety and this this went beyond physical kind of early on got really chippy between the two of them his credit I mean post Never Back Down Music nice nice to see kind of a classic five matchup download Tom well I can see that action post to the bench with the five personals 17 points leading the way for Boston College he also had five rebounds Davis is at the freethrow line for North Carolina post play 20 minutes and his best production this season in limited action right in here straight in we should again we talked about it earlier North Carolina three guys averaging 16 or more points last time it happened Mitch cup check Walter Davis and Phil Ford did it twice two years in a row and Davis now has 16 points with those free throws right under the season average of 162 Applause instead Zachary recovers with six on the shot clock offensive foul right in front of Ted Valentine and love had the position uh just fabulous emotion here in the Smith Center theyre waiting to explode and Huber Davis loves the great d ude consistently you didnt care if hes over 12 hes going to take shots and make plays love is five of 13 on the evening and 12 points Music Boston College certainly still in this game Mike with 341 to go but consider this the last time BC did not make a three you have to go back to 2009 November 28th at Providence right now Boston College over six would be on the other thats you know its its tough sledding in todays game to not have that in Your Arsenal and uh you know we talked about it most of their scoring does come from two but uh you know they theyre shooting percentage at this half has really saved them 54 he was only average about five made threes per game theyve got zero tonight on the road in Chapel Hill foreign Applause game with 320 to go that he would have signed up for that travel Applause dont forget coming up after us great for us Clemson Tigers best start in school history at ACC play 70 in 70 years North Carolina trying to stay undefeated 80 to start the ninth they won 14 in the last 15 against BC Zachary thats a tough one Mike hes made big plays all night long a little quiet in the second half with 14 points for him North Carolina has also dominated the series as ACC opponents leading 185 against the Eagles lead by six they still lead by six two possession game 240 to go back to Lankford racing right down the middle I think thats going to be on Nance Applause okay so Ashton Lankford Mike the struggle tonight from the Floor Just One of eight doing what he can trying to get to the freethrow line and even though more attempts theyve outscored North Carolina there nine of ten and uh thats they need to really make this game ugly in the last two and a half minutes time see if they can get to the free throw line slow some things down Trip Away 82 on the season from the line Makai Ashton Lankford the graduate student from Worcester Massachusetts Applause struggled against Wake Forest as well on Saturday just two of seven on threepointers but he has a couple of free throws and now has six points its a fourpoint game two and a half to go from the Smith Center Applause make up the catch turned into bigger staff contact was made its just the way he plays inside that BC has not been able to double team him effectively he always seems to be turning away from the double team to score you know with post out of the ball game hes over matched inside but battling post falling out with 17 points Bangkok now with 18 and you know at 66 percent for him Tom it may not be the worst thing if youve got some fouls to ways to put him on the line not let him have a threepoint play foreign Applause two minutes in change to go in regulation for junior tough pass to Zachary whats the head of the black loves elevates and scores Houston Lankford races back to the other end and he lays it in he has been Fearless in North Carolina getting a taste of how they play thought they might have BC might have been rushing a little bit on that transition BC refusing to go away Applause look Carolinas won six of the last seven at home against the Eagles looking for three bounces out had the position might have been a push from behind like for junior yeah tomorrow Langford third on Langford Jr 19 points for Baytown as he stands at the freethrow line double bonus now for the rest of the game 20 points now for Bay cut 47 for the freethrow line and for junior kind of dance his way in against black cut off initially he
