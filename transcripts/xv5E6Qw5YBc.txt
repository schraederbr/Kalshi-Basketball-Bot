22 points quickness can convert from offense to defense sees the floor very very well had six assists in the win against Georgia Renault to flip the basketball up in the air shes officiating tonight with Ted Valentine and Lamar Simpson Utah Valley in the black Wake Forest in the gray game three of the season for the Demon Deacons theyre trying to get to 30 regardless of whether its a winner or loss both these teams will be on a plane to Montego Bay Jamaica tomorrow morning Music Indian lovely Meanwhile were here in WinstonSalem thats not a bad place to beat us Wake Forest gets to stop the Deeks a 12point win over Fairfield a 10point win Over Georgia this past Friday night inside Andrew Carr hes been the early offense in both games and he cant convert on the Dukes first possession tonight going inside Carrs been shooting from the perimeter goes inside tries to work inside where they have a size event this is a very Scrappy Utah Valley basketball team Woodbury misses his first look but on the second chance its Latrey darthur getting it to go twonothing Wolverine starts with a very good athletes got length at 64 a veteran player had a couple double figure games already this season Thai Appleby as quick as they come but Off the Mark Utah Valleys two and one they lost their opening night game at a very good Utah State team and theyve won two straight since blowing out Western Colorado and then edging The Lumberjacks of Northern Arizona this past Saturday a game in which this Wolverines team had nine blocks and six steals they were really active defensively Music step outside and also can put the ball in the floor for the midrange jumper hell be an interesting matchup today its definitely a rim protector Ted Valentine gives an early uh lecture to Aziz Bandago and Davey and Bradford the two seven Footers and itll stay the same way with Wake Forest T Wake Forest head coach Steve Forbes right on the go Deeks hashtag near the Baseline for his entire coaching career he enters tonight exactly 200 games above 500 Stan hes 331 up 131 down its a lot of games passing a lot of games very effective four nothing as Caesar Tim Caesar drains the jumper two seizures for me weve played in Coastal Carolina good athlete got the length at 69 will make that midrange shot foreign watch this deflection goes right into Caesars hands not afraid to take that little 10 12 foot Baseline jump shot so good start for the Wolverines out of the western Athletic Conference they began the transition to the division one level back in 2003 Applause thatll be very interesting to wait for us six four six five players in Utah Valley go outside or as well ends Steve Forbes might need an early timeout its seven nothing after the three ball from darthur Arthur comes in having made five threepointers knocked down three and theyre in against Northern Arizona on Saturday has got that length we mentioned a guy about six four long arms pretty solid Defender hes a knock down Shooters you just saw now six of his last ten from threepoint range and a reaching foul called on the Senegalese sophomore Aziz bandego whos been a revelation for Utah Valley transfer from Akron who uh didnt score a whole much in his time in the MidAmerican Conference but he has been a double double machine so far for the Wolverine hes got that lint thats an illadvised file for him trying to pick up a foul 18 20 feet away from the basket but he runs the floor really well as we said can finish around the rim hes got nice hands they use him in the offense a lot at the top he makes him passes on Baseline touch Ted Valentine taking a long conversation with the scorers table theyre changing the foul foul from Bandago to Caesar interesting so no fouls on the seven footer Applebee for three and theres the seven footer sky in the crowd for the board seven nothing Wolverines looking for more that would have made a 10zip a Reload from darthur in and out bentango makes it nine nothing and Steve Forbes has seen enough quick timeout we talked about this team six four six five then youve got the seven footer they can get off the floor very very quickly catches the ball in Rhythm finishes with the balance up nice start for the Wolverines immediately Forbes sending a couple Subs to the scores table cam Hildreth and Zach Keller coming in but check out the work in the glass a second chance opportunity and just not a good match up that time with Appleby versus the sevenfooter this goes right over the top of him kept the ball up strong and finished strong well thanks Steve Forbes knew as much as anybody this was not going to be an easy game tonight Utah Valley won 20 ball games a year ago only picked seventh in the western Athletic Conference preseason poll but they returned eight guys including seven of the top eight scorers from a team that won 20 last year coached by the guy that helped to end Tim Duncans wake for his career Mark Madsen who is the star for Stanford Tim Duncans last game as the Deke was a second round matchup in Tucson against freshman Mark Madsen in the Stanford Cardinal so he knows something about beating Wake Forest Williamson cant connect Keller on the glass throws it right to Woodbury that killer young athletic freshman from Colorado Im going to try to front inside on the big Appleby Williamson and Carr stay on the floor for Wake with a freshman Keller and the sophomore hell drip Off the Bench no good that time for Caesar and Carr grabs the Miss how to be very careful that if you Wake Forest thats too good a shot for Caesar about 10 to 12 feet just turned around and faced up Carr the Delaware transfer going to work on Caesar Lake Forest is chilly like the weather here in WinstonSalem today its Wolverines ball and now Jenna Reynolds changing the call Wake Forest will keep it comes out of bounds toss the fall off the Wake Forest player nice looked at Time by car just trying to body him up shot goes short you can see hes kind of Towing the line and he touches right there good overall from Renault and her second year officiating ACC mens basketball the Steal the tip Taj small back in his home state cant get it to go Smalls from Durham played at word of God Academy Applause hes got a bunch of fans in the stands from here in North Carolina and Keller just lost his footing but theres a reason for that foul is going I think on Justin Harmon no its on Tim Caesar and thats the second pal on Caesar and Keller is going to get us up Bobby Clinton The Freshman from Sweden checking in for the first time thats not a good sign right there not at all not at all Clinton gives you some length at six nine and also also some athleticism this may be a better matchup on the defensive end for Wake Forest deacons are looking for some offense right now Appleby has been a microwave guy throughout his career Hildreth amongst the trees gets Wake Forest on the board Ill tell you right now I mean this could be a cam Hilder type ball game because he can move he can post up hell go inside and do some of the dirty work and hes going to have to play some solid defense on the score they really havent talked about much number four in Woodbury Hildreth averaging seven boards a game through the first couple so active so strong in the post nice shot darthur over car going glass darthur has a quick seven so Arthur had 14 against Western Colorado just kind of over matches guards gets inside the paint just elevation scores Applause Music Scouting Report well planned by Mark madsens Wolverines they were right on car now Clinton on the drive cant finish Taj small with a skip to his step woodburys pass tipped and picked Applebee for Williamson down by car Appleby offensive foul Applause no doubt about that one first on Appleby and a fantastic start for the Wolverines a bench hes off to a hot start as are the Utah Valley Wolverines and Wake Forest is chilly Stan looter well theyve had a couple looks at the rim and they missed some shots closed bank but Utah Valley is forced to Tempo theyre getting some great looks on that 90 run to start the basketball game doctors so far with seven points space shoot and looking for a lot of back cuts try to get some oneonone matchups also look for a little bit of a twoman game from time to time Tim Fuller Ethan Potter both into the game for Utah Valley they run a play for the North Carolina native and small cannot connect another good look for Utah Valley we forces just settled in and get your shot cam Hildreth and its tipped up and in I think Carr deserves credit for the deuce are using that lift between inside position able to score now what the problem is youve got to find a way to get some stops so were in the basketball game but you dont want to allow Utah Valley to get any type of offensive rhythm Woodbury I left rebound battled four and Carr escaped with it and hes fouled by Fuller Music shot goes up youre battling for it gotta grab it gotta go up and grab it Fuller almost had it couldnt get it bumps car on the way out good hustle play by Wake Forest car its not like Utah Valley Shooting the lights out theyre five for 14 36 percent just one of five from three Music knocks in his fourth three of the season I really like his versatility after the Mage basket Wake Forest Jordan little two two one gets to steal Bacchus didnt shoot around earlier today and Ty Appleby will get to the free throw line for the dates trying to find a way to pick up the tempo a little bit to Wake Forest Appleby gets a really nice knock down look and then after you make the basket apply some threequarter cord pressure and you get a steal out of it thousand Blaze kneeled BYU transfer Appleby had eight points against Fairfield then erupted for 22 against Georgia coach Forbes the stat stuffer 2266 against the Bulldogs on Friday night two years at Cleveland State two years at Florida and now a couple free throws four wake fourth all of a sudden its a twopoint game because you were watching him he can change the engine quickly has great Visions a good assist guy and the ability to be explosive and score the basketball ask Steve Forbes earlier today whos the fastest guy on your team from end to end without hesitation said Applebees oh no of course thats not close Applause much better defense much better defensive matchups now for week four vforce 25 wins a season to go hands to the quarterfinals of the NIT ACC coach of the year clock winding down forced to Fire and no iron thats a shot clock violation as Neil could not get it to the rim much better perimeter defense last few possessions for Wake Forest not allowed to enter the offense without allowed me to get to drive that time a desperation shot doesnt go in Applebee to the basket ties the game go he gets a chance to turn the corner theyre very few to be able to stop him they block him at The Rim but you wont get him on the floor great quickness great vision foreign pressure Wolverines break it Taj small air balls one shot clock didnt reset small same spot same result and a foul in the rebound action and itll be Wake Forest ball watch out we turn the corner and two Defenders just split some very easy gets inside he gets to lay up rebounding foul again I think thats on Fullers gonna be a second yeah foreign Valley getting shot shots not falling but Wake Forest doing a good job of banging on the glass getting good on top of the back well speaking of shots not falling damari Monsanto has checked into the game hes a guy that Steve Forbes would love to get going we saw the type of offensive check guy he can be a season ago Appleby kicks in cars too strong and the fouls on Hildreth battling with Neil for the rebound talk about Monsanto and got a knocked down 34 threes last season he had to make the three skilled for the Republic for that from that Achilles but hes a God he can get caught in a hurry Music drive and kick in and out from three combine two of 13 from Beyond The Arc Appleby a little hesitation does a little pirouette then draws contact and Arthur will pick up the foul sending Appleby to the line after a timeout Wake Forest has right of the ship after falling behind nine nothing 11 up here in Winston gone here in the first half every time you watch a Wake Forest game all season long the broadcasters will be talking about wake forests success in the transfer portal after alondis Williams and Jake leravia among others last year this quartet comes to WinstonSalem and weve seen Appleby in Carr make an early impact tonight and Bradfords a transfer from Kansas State and you know havent seen so far in this evening but uh good size there you got the Rookie of the Year as your San Antonio Steve Forbes because of that history of being a Juco coach he understands how to kind of move rosters when youre looking for the right fit of student athlete not only for Wake Forest but for this team and uh last year they hit gold I think youll do the same thing I I really like watching car play and I think everybodys going to fall in love with Applebee six points for Appleby Andrew Carrs got five points and six rebounds eight minutes hes still out there on the floor as his Apple doing with Hildreth Monsanto and another talented freshman Bobby Clinton transfers which will be a common storyline I think this year oh yeah seven footer from Senegal Aziz Bandago hands off darthurs have a hot hand an explosive move to the cup and we all get around the side of the top and there goes again is a nice passer at the pass in the back foot Cuts us a little rub screen going downhill there snaps an 110 Wake Forest run nine points for darthur Carr takes it takes it slams it wow wow didnt take a long time Head and Shoulder fake one dribble big fella finishing strongly like that you like that Music trying to dribble through a crowd and Utah Valley fortunate not to give up a three on nun break the other way Woodbury silence so far this basketball game this time Applebys got the assignment Justin Harmon Chicago Kid cant finish another rebound for Carr hes got 77 boards Monsanto gives it up its deflected and stay with should stay with Wake Forest Washington seven Head and Shoulder fake right there gets in there puts it in there Bam gets yourself everybody watching this is a big fella this is the transfer were talking about 610 takes it to the hole gets you another basket the officials missed the call its going to be Utah Valley ball Music 221 has been very effective for Wake Forest Utah Valley continues to try to contribute to the double team Arthur pull up Clinton rebound thats exactly what you want to do forced him into his shot maybe they wanted a bad angle didnt go inside and score Marsh for the good look cant convert Matthew Marsh didnt play on Friday his first minute since the opener last Monday Monsanto rebounds the miss theyll drift ahead Monsanto Murrays his first three of the Season we were wondering when that first three would fall it just did he had a great look hes an excellent cant just shoot guy and with his size able to look over the defense and knock down a shot its now a 162 run for the Wake Forest Demon Deacons capped by the Monsanto three Coliseum after 10 minutes and 14 seconds of basketball weve seen two significant runs Utah Valley open 112 and since then its all Demon Deacons and its good to see damari Monsanto knock down his first shot off off a defensive play Evan and you just get it in transition he spots up and like you said you know weve been waiting for this and when he erupts its going to be a good thing if youre a Wake Forest fan a great looking 66 been slowed by that injury from a year ago but man he can get it and thats thats got to give him a lot of confidence streaky Shooters The socon Freshman of the year two years ago at ETSU back to the 221 theyll direct them trying to trap it and drop right back into something surprising woodburys not trying to either take someone oneonone Music in the basket taking two shots both from threes missed them both sets up darthur extra pass cam Alford doesnt get the bounds and another good rebound for cam Hildreth wakes doing a really good job of trying to double him up take Woodberry out of his shooting area and make someone else beat you well he checked for tamari Monsanto you can get a streaky reel take the next shot its true five minutes to play in the half and thats an and one chance for Justin Harmon Music Justin Harmon played at Barton Community College Edge about 16 points a game recognized the mismatch puts it to the floor quickly uses the left hand kisses off the glass possible threepoint play Barton Community College was a stop on the Steep Sports seaforce Journey exactly coach there in the mid late 90s for three seasons almost got really nice size and six floors got the link in the building not a bad Applause experience cant give them some score and that really kind of takes up the slack but youre not getting from Craig Woodbury so after Marsh picks up the foul Armin converts the threepoint play half court trap here Music you like the change of pace defensively for the Wolverine I like you for both teams Hildreth dribbling through the defense sets up Monsanto who throws it away and thats why you change the defenses and you give them a different look youll rust he got ball in the corner someone not accustomed to be there trying to get the reversal not ready he throws it out of bounds great defensive change that time by Mark Vance and a quick hook for Monsanto after the bad pass Lucas Taylor back in the game the sophomore from Raleigh oh nice Cut Woodbury finds him well that opportunitys been there a lot because they have such an open floor and theres not a rim protector really in the ball game for Wake Forest so the back cuts are going to be there this time theyre able to capitalize five points for Harmon couple assists now for Trey Woodbury Music against the Zone again Hildreth has it deep gets it back in the corner gotta split it its almost got to pull the trigger its Lucas Taylor in and out tip no Woodbury hes got the rebound and now the Wolverines have a chance to retake the lead Music Applause Music Williamson down kicks it out and takes it Arthur buries it what a game on the Trey darker hes got 12 first half points but at the other end March throws down the alleyoop nice first points of the season for Matthew Marsh one of the two British sophomores on this Wake Forest roster Woodberry nope Fandango saves it to Clinton Damian Williamson slices past the defense and scores and maybe thatll get him going a good job pissing the ball down the floor spits the defender once again and elevates and scores told you we were gonna have a good game tonight Woodbury nope theyre not really finding his comfort spot he would not get anything I tried to post up the last couple possessions its not able to elevate the score over the store or Wake Forest Defender Damian Williamson only has two points Applause Bobby Clinton looking for his offense rebound Bandago Music Music Armin gets it back out still 13 to shoot Fandango get a touch using the high ball screen action Woodbury deep three hes now over five Music long stretch of uninterrupted ball Hildreth going to work against a smaller Alfred like this Hill Drift all blocked Hildreth wanted goaltending want to pass ahead offered to Woodbury the big guy gets the defensive play the block shot on one end leaves a transition basket on the other bendegos 11th block of the year you see the length of the seven footer from Senegal Mark Madsen went to Senegal to meet his parents to talk to his youth coach to help bring him to Orem Utah Clinton to Marsh no missed opportunity there Music Harmon circles the wagon sets up the shot Marsh has the rebound youre starting to feel a little tired now without a whistle yeah I tell you what see it in the shots shots are not not strong jumpers a lot of them are hope jumpers hope I can get it there Lucas Taylor that was a hope shot yeah Wolverines three guys sitting at the scorers table theyve been sitting there for about two and a half minutes now Applause Music were still yet to take the under eight time out nice pass darthur gets his own rebound and gets fouled theres the whistle darthur got 12 points hes looking for more after the break two first half threes for Utah Valley Matthew Marsh gets his first points of the year with the play in half number one the deacons with a couple wins over teams wearing red in week one beating the Stags by a dozen beating the Bulldogs by 10 its an interesting game on Friday night Stan Wick was up 20 times in the first half Bulldogs fought their way back wake extended a lead again it was a tough team to put away credit to coach white and his troops but uh 10 point win over an SEC team week one of the Season not too shabby thats a very impressive win because of the fact theres another Power five Conference Team hed win and we look at the end of the season that that win like that against a team like that can definitely help you last year right at the doorstep of going to the ncaas and not being able to get there and one of the problems maybe will Sprint the schedule in November December one of two at the line for darthur all right now lets see what are we gonna get well wait for us try to isolate something for Applebee we got Applebee and Williams sin back in the game Appleby around it out nice little look Music Bradford off the screen and rolled off Katie McClanahan into the game for Utah Valley for the first time I plan to handle Lefty is a good spot shooter foreign take a look at it immediately Wolverines by five we got a great look off the reversal at the top of the key car after his counterpart went for the Steal sets up Monsanto three more there you go three and a half for damari Monsanto hes moved to basketball get your shooter ready in a great position with his hands and footwork just stepped right into that three Music back outside McClanahan Apple do with a hand in his face Music Monsanto rebounds the Driving Miss 103 to play in this entertaining first half Williamson quick release nothing but now oh you said it having a quick release found this spot in the corner caught the basketball and in Rhythm and you talk about what rhythm is one motion knocks down jumper quick 60 run on a couple of triples from Monsanto and Williamson and now Utah Valley forced to take a timeout McClanahan was trapped two and a half to play and half number one first ever meeting but then you see what latrae darthur has done 13 points almost matching the offensive output from the rest of his Wolverines yeah a kid from outside of Dallas Denton Texas played junior college ball for a couple years at McCook actually attended uh Hargrave up in Chatham Virginia for a year and just a good athlete at six four six five and can run the floor as we see can knock down some threes already had a couple in the northern Arizona Game and hes become the only person really thats been the offensive threat so far in this ball game for Utah Valley diving roller blocked by Bradford Fuller had a good location but he could not get it on the rim pick and roll not gonna get a better play head shoulder fake were just too slow getting there good Wake Forest defense three Defenders around the ball and play without fouling how many uptakes do you need if youre Fuller right there one up faking and power dunk Woodbury and thats an offensive foul extending his legs out on Appleby after the release Woodbury cant believe it and this was right in front of Teddy Valentine so you know hes right on top of this call today I want to clarify something I said going into the break okay and it was the first ever meeting between the Wolverines and the deacons as you see oh yeah oh ow first ever meeting between Utah Valley Wake Forest Demon Deacons defeated the Michigan Wolverines in the 2000 ACC Big Ten challenge at the Chrysler Center in Ann Arbor hey that was the final year of the Dave Odom era I believe youre right Monsanto at 12 to shoot wake by one an entertaining first half Woodbury rebounds the Miss from Monsanto Music Spacey look at look at the rooms for the cutters you got to be a very solid owned ball Defender and youve got to talk and communicate to be a good help side Defender as well Justin Harmon baited Davey and Bradford into that contact the first foul on Bradford Mildreds come back in so has Bandago for the Wolverines Music only rotation guy not back from last year for Utah Valley it was a twotime whack Defensive Player of the Year fardas AMAC whos now at Texas Tech Applause Music McClanahan kicks it Woodbury has not found the range but this will stay with Utah Valley last Touch by Bradford so says Teddy Valentine on the Baseline yeah new shot clock for Utah Valley another really good look for Woodbury Music preseason all whack performer has led his team in scoring so far this season its five for eight from behind the yard the last couple games hes over four from three so far tonight pretty good look roll doesnt go and wave off the bucket for offensive interference Fandango is a split second too soon yeah but you can see what the strategys been most of the night for Utah Valley trying to post up to guards and watch this just right there thats a good call its a very good call and great camera work its a stationary camera set up but somebody had to make sure they didnt move thats the best one we got that was Stan luter that disrespected our talented human camera Folk s he knocks it away Utah Valley ball see see been away from me too long on a second and a half differential between the game and shot clock here I wonder if Utah Valley will look for the last shot then 2827 for a while neither team has scored about two and a half minutes Im done both teams started cold Wake Forest heated up to try to get back hey good to pick some roll action on the drive is finished Justin Harmon stares down Andrew Carr Williamson to beat the buzzer draws the foul to blocking foul two and a half seconds to go oh my goodness Applause watch Justin harmless pick and roll goes right down Main Street Flushing it on somebody oh my goodness car got a piece of it yeah he got a piece of didnt get enough over there watch this boom thats my favorite camera guy thank you camera guy Laughter Justin Harmon six points oh my goodness did you see what I just did its a heck of a reaction there right there Applause Windy City windmill right there yeah Williamson has a chance to get a much softer two at the line to retake the lead Applause foreign excellent free throw shooter today is davians 125th game playing college basketball not including exhibitions I know Damien can remember every game I imagine weve ever played every single game thats special here we go no fouls wake by one that didnt beat the buzzer Music a first half that included four ties and seven lead changes one of these teams will get their third win of the Season tonight both are headed to Jamaica tomorrow its the Deeks by one of the break the transfer from Delaware Stan give me a couple of keys to the second half for both teams team can knock down some jump shots put your defensive influence on other teams going to have a great chance to win this game remember what we just said about the layup opportunities one thing interesting too Utah Valley is out outscoring into paint 1412 only a small margin but they only need one basket Wake Forest looking in the paint to the Big Man car perseveres gets his own rebound car no Bradford third chance fouled Mark Manson wondering wheres the three second call this shot by The Bigs of Wake Forest to kind of use their size and continue to get rebound after rebound gotta finish there shell put Bradford to the freethrow line you know but again that thats what you got to do if you Wake Forest you just got to kind of find a way to dominate inside Bradford only a 60 free throw shooter four of eight to start this year but uh look good there yeah also from that Im really referring to more thats what it did at Kansas State two different games for Bradford he was oh for one from the floor in game number one finished with three points anyways five for five in the Georgia game 11 points four rebounds against the Bulldog goes one of two there deacons by a pair 30 seconds into the second half will gonna guard with Barry to start the position off Aziz Bandago working on Bradford and hell get two free throws Bradford picks up his second foul this is what you like out of Bandago as a big tried to set the move up to go across the lane couldnt get it Bradford did a really nice job of turning him back to the Baseline side and then he just took his time took his time gathered drop step goes inside creates some contactants going in and goes into the freethrow line not a bad free throw shooter so far this year 75 percent disease Bandago seven feet tall no one in the nation in college basketball had more double doubles than Aziz did in week one he was one of the 22 players across the country that had two double doubles in the first week of the Season that includes three ACC players one and I looked him up so you didnt have to it was BCs TJ Bickerstaff keep going it was Dukes Kyle phillipowski keep going and it was Notre Dames Nate lashesky all had double doubles two double doubles bandagos the other one and Ill tell you what Bandago is going to get a lot of double doubles this season because again he does something that that you really like to say out of your bigs hes got good hands and he can make free throws 31 all Appleby cant connect seventh rebound for Bandago and Utah Valley looking to retake the lead Woodbury job by car to stop that initial Drive great position inside but Caesar struggled with the catch still tend to shoot Woodbury quick release short rebound Taylor Music Applause Music Appleby to Williamson Damian Williamson got a piece of it Harmon with a clean block we talked about it early on harmans a very good leader in 64 physical okay just enough for that basketball and a very very comfortable confident Utah Valley team now swinging the ball inside out looking for the open guy Caesars three would not stay Ill tell you Stan neither of these teams are in a great offensive Rhythm tonight really not but I think he can see that theyre both wellcoached teams that run good stuff play hard defense I mean Steve Forbes said after the Georgia game that the first half defensively about as good as they can play in terms of pick and roll coverage held the Bulldogs 22 first half points we reactive very active hands moving feet in the right place and then they made some shots both of these teams are playing very hard but theyre not shots on fault a few shots Paul is gonna even really open up the game even more so seven Footers have been going at it since the opening tip Woodbury no with the lane just cleared out for Caesar to throw it down and theres a tangle up under the basket Carr and Bandago going for the rebound and seven to tall and car at 611 and a lot of elbows and legs and knees Watchers drive there you can see just bodies just flying look what I found Caesar with the stuff oh goodness Fandango car colliding no call easy two for Caesar on the stick back postal Carolina transfer Williams keeps his dribble to Taylor Bradford gets away with a little colder and lays it in power basketball man flop warning oh theres no warning anymore thats immediate Grade B technical foul watch this again huh there was certainly contact yeah certainly sold it it was it was the flailing of the arms yeah yeah and I think got the T at the end Music all right bunny yeah like I said no warning anymore its immediate technical foul theyll shoot one and then pick up play where they just left off Ill be able to shoot the free throw now five for five from the line tonight and 19 of 20 from the freethrow line on the young season I I really like Applebee and see now with with the freethrow being made youll get a chance to set the pressure up but this is where Wake Forest had a lot of success in this ball game early with the 221 pressure back to man or back to a trap Woodbury to the corner darthur three more problem with trapping that that far away from the baskets youve got to be able to rotate and find the open guide when that ball is kicked to the strong side they did a great job of penetrating and is right there it knocks down the three hes got 16 points three triples and the Wolverines back in front Taylor not a guy whos looking for his offense much so far this season Williamson on the other hand a little out of control a little off balance and the foul is on Davey and Bradford his third cam Hildreth and Zach Keller coming back in thats good news for Keller who got dinged up after just one minute of play off the bench in the first half good to see Keller back on the floor next couple times down for Wake Forest lets see if they try to go with some quick hits try to get this offense moving a little bit its got to be a little more freeflowing sitting back and playing against this Utah Valley defense and anything that goes into the lane the big fellows coming up and contesting the shot or in some cases getting a hand on the drive pass this is what they do well spacing look for cuts on the weak side theres your doubles harming up high Fandango slams it in nice execution by the Wolverines run the ball from one side to the other triple Drive throw it up to the big guy hell flush it six points nine rebounds for Aziz Bandago the sophomore from Senegal Hill Drift circumnavigate the lane and itll be Utah Valley ball Applause plenty of highlights tonight from the visitors from Orem Utah Aziz Bandago look out down under Music we talked about Aziz bandango Ive been his ability to catch the basketball have good hands watch him at the top of the key there see hes in all that action theres a drag double screen the dribble hand up he just rolls right to the basket and you lose sight of him for a second and his ability to elevate it seven feet tall catches it and finishes nice half court execution that time by Utah Valley and Wake Forest has got to be able to defend the roller and also put pressure on the Bass from the top deacons trailing by four Utah Valley for a signature win now this is a team that beat BYU and Washington a year ago Music I went over BYU meant a lot it was over their former coach Mark cope deep Three Wood very short rebound finds Hill Drift third board for cam after a career high on the glass 11 on Friday against Georgia big possession for Wake Forest you need to get this crowd excited as well as their team nice movement right there look for driver and kick wheres Williamson in the corner Andrew Carr going to work oneonone Carr doubled goes up anyway and its defended well by Tim Caesar I never got his footwork like he wanted and then when he had to shoot across his body a nice easy block stay in position wait for the ball to go up good block by Caesar Music Harmon passed up the three gets closer missed it short Andrew Carr just grabbed rebound number 10 got seven points to go with him I like this Applebee to the bucket yeah thats what I was talking about a few minutes ago Evan being able to get some quicker tempo take the ball down make make Utah Valley defend you and when they stop the basketball youve got Shooters open on the perimeter straight away triple wont go Fandango deflects the rebound and finds Appleby collision with Harmon but no whistle Appleby explodes and hes swatted Caesar and a technical foul on Aziz bandego assessed by Ted Valentine for what Im not sure the second personal on Bandago the call now they called it on Caesar okay just third theres the block maybe he said something after the SWAT it certainly didnt look at Appleby yeah hes looking at Fandango they announced Caesar Im looking at a monitor here just to maybe pushed him or something after after the balls in the basket uh well have to get it well make a note of this possibly a little bit of that momentum swing Applebees now seven for seven from the line deacons are 10 of 11 as a team Utah Valleys four for four from the strike oh Wake Forest shooting over 30 free throws a game through their first two games Music battle for that loose ball Carr touched it while he was straddling the line so its Utah Valley ball right between the week grab it where is he yeah hes out last touched by the Utah Valley but uh car touched it when he was out at the other end reball wont fall for small hasnt been the night Tosh small dreamed of coming back to his home state hes over six Zach Keller nope Music hes now one for five from three on the season I feel like this is gonna be a grinder all the way to the Finish Line thinking the same thing darthur has had the hot hand all night Music career high for him with 18 and again getting a great shot inside the paint area Music third from Denton Texas the a Guyer High School Hargrave Military Academy McCook Community College and now to Utah Valley Appleby rise and Fire Hildreth finds the rebound Williamson to the bucket Fandango says get out wow small back outside Harmon and now darthur gets a touch see now with the ball out the top see how lets see how open the lane is you get free to make cuts trying to Triple drive or go back to side Fandango power dribble no tip no Hildreth the other way the two teams locked into the defensive end Ill tell you man I really are Appleby Williamson Music Arthur the other way all the way tipped home by Harman just attacked car was off balance new Harmon was there on the weak side to get the tip in nine points for Harmon Geeks havent scored in over two minutes wake just one of its last nine from the floor performing all over Williamson right now once he gets rid of the basketball his old job not to let him get it back Applebees Jimmys past the defender creates contact and has a chance for a threepoint play that was sweet

the threepoint play that last possession hes now eight for eight from the line keep in mind Darth are doing the last dead ball picked up his third foul so to keep in mind as this game goes on he has been their primary scorer today Bill drift puts wake back in front I said this the other week you gotta have a guy like Hildreth on your team its not afraid to go inside mix it up in score can knock down a jumper and well play some defense every teams got to have a cam Hildreth on it big basket for him Music 10 to shoot Monsanto battling defensively but Justin Harmon was too good match up inside and this is where theyve had a lot of success tonight Evan just kind of pounding and pounding and backing people inside and trying to elevate over them had 12 lead changes in the game Music Utah Valley jumped out nine nothing but then Wake Forest went on a 162 run to answer Monsanto doesnt get the bounce oh Keller comes up with a pick and then throws it away Montana wasnt expecting it and Utah Valley gets the easy two conversion from offense to defense back to offensive you make the steal get the score Big Time play by Utah Valley you cant be killed with the basketball right now were under 10 minutes into the fourth quarter of this game indeed Appleby lost it but a whistle and a foul Tom Blaze kneeled Blaze Neals one of those guys to transfer and transferring from BYU a season ago good solid athlete at 61 just got kind of caught in the mix not quick enough there are very few people I think youre gonna see this year theyre going to be quick enough in the open court to guard Tyree Appleby perfect no more from the line Appleby with just a second Miss of the year and 24 attempts Music Andrew Carr Damian Williamson back in Music I havent mentioned this tonight but uh Steve Forbes after the game on Friday against Georgia talked about he needed to have peanut butter and jelly on the floor together referring to Appleby and Williamson I think Williamson is peanut butter and Applebees jelly but Im not positive about that thank you well its a good combination whatever Applause so well see peanut butter and jelly out there defensively for the Deeks Utah Valley by three tough turnaround jumper wont go but the rebound finds neildew that hurts Music Second Chance opportunity on what should have been a sure rebound by the Deeks first points of the night for kneeled Music deacons have not made a three in the second half Hildreth comes up short all right he got fouled Music cam Alfred got a break there left his feet without knowing where it was going and fortunate to find somebody look at the spacing out of Utah Valley theyre moving the basketball making wait for us to defend not only the ball but great help side space step back three oh Hildreth had the rebound lost it saves it under his own bucket Williamson on the floor gets it to Appleby Appleby to the corner Clinton foreign place was ready to erupt on that great Hustle said its the Utah Valley contingent chanting air ball over in their little pocket in the arena so they brought about a thousand fans of people coming thousands of 100 fans came in big difference had a one and a zero in it but he brought a lot of peoples what Im saying oh theyre theyre fitting for the big upset in ACC country they got a fivepoint lead with a fivepoint lead on the road here in WinstonSalem and on the offense for the Deeks has not been incredibly crisp at any point tonight but you see in the second half its even cooler than the first Music 60 Run for the Wolverines Music deacons havent scored in three minutes and its Utah Valley ball Music Forest playing A team out of the western Athletic Conference for the first time since Stan was in college in 1977 no College in 1970 arent you a little bit Music step back jumper two no matter where I was I can tell you what that was good offense after a timeout my goodness Music 15 for Justin Harmon okay so youre down seven now this is when youve got to execute If You Wake Forest run your best stuff get some stops Apple beat a car and the foul car with a free throw could give himself his first Wake Forest double double and remember early in the game Carr had to one dribble dunk top this time he caught the ball a little more tentative going inside make sure you catch it and go up strong youre gonna get contact now for the possible threepoint play 10 points 10 rebounds for Andrew Carr Harmon picked up his second personal switch thats what you gotta do if you Wake Forest that was a huge possession heres your trap with two guard front peanut butter and jelly with the trout itll stay with Utah Valley Harmons got to do a better job recognizing the Trap coming from that was a really nice job of Wake Forest running him right down the sideline got him to the timeline picked the ball up fortunately for Utah Valley was a deflection Applause seven minutes to play Music to the corner Taj small not his night kept Alive by Alford and he trips over Williamson will be davians first doctor might have been some contact on the rebound before Williamson tripped small on the bay on the bottom but Second Chance opportunities and in the ability now with 6 54 to go to make your free throws make every possession count would be crucial for both teams big fella back Music Applause Music Applause Neil gets it to pandego guarded by car Applause seven to shoot Harmon has car in a switch step back three rebound Clinton nice job defensively there by Carr Applebee to Williamson Music pushing the ball down the floor we just talked about it giving yourself a really quick look on the execution gets the shot we got a ball game just like that seven point lead cut to one great recognition Williamson in the corner ready to survive when able to answer Alfred no rebound tipped Alfred tracks down it again six minutes to play Applause Matt Williamson three was the first three of the second half four Wake Forest on the drive and a foul sending Alfred to the line Applause a lot of this that of Utah Valley scoring on the perimeter and taking previous shots without their main threepoint shooter in Woodbury hes getting ready to check back in the game with the 2000 again Wake Forest did a great job that time long rebound pushing the ball in transition finding the score and you saw a little enthusiasm saw the momentum into place but then again a half court shot missed tip back gives you a second chance then he go to the freethrow line yeah Alfred from Indianapolis is that quite a journey from John Logan College to Alabama a m and now to Orem Utah with the Wolverines put some numbers up when I was down in the Alabama game also first points of the night from the freethrow line for Alfred this is a team in Utah Valley only a threegame sample size were shooting 75 percent from the line Wake Forest 72 something to keep in mind his final 5 45 of the ball game both teams have been excellent from the line tonight Appleby find some daylight gets it to cart and hes turned away wow Aziz Bandago with a big time rejection Music Mark that if they go on to win this basketball game Woodbury Fandango battles for the board but Carr comes up with his 11th pushing Pantego Music Six Points 11 rebounds three blocks outside jumper wouldnt go and a oneman fast break for Justin Harman cant finish Applebee the other way Music Hill drip oh what a spin move wont go with a foul as Woodbury Applause partially tipped that finger roll from Hildreth in win you get the block by the big fellow on one end watch this guys will spin move gets his hand on him right there almost tipped it in oh so close two free throws for cam Hildreth on a sequence that was under five minutes to play Applause Music Hildreth had 14 against Fairfield Music Georgia to go with his 11 rebounds and uh two free throws there give him six tonight time out on the floor 455 to play it has been active remember the name Justin Harmon you see the numbers Utah valleys had the lead the majority of the night nearly 21 minutes theyve been in front Geeks have been ahead for about nine minutes the game has been tied for about five minutes weve had a dozen lead changes and we got a one point game the Trap region foul Appleby number two on Tyree 16 foul so side out next one will put Utah Valley in the single bonus its unclear Dan whether these teams were sharing an airplane tomorrow theyre both playing commercial Down To Jamaica they might be in a same airplane tomorrow morning and uh oh intense battle tonight three from the corner wouldnt go and a foul in the rebound action against Wake Forest yeah Applause well if I won you know I might be wrong but if he beat me aint no way Im getting on the plane wait Im sorry Im sorry Music I was on Hildreth his second one and one here Ford Fandango Applause you said earlier as a seven footer really nice stroke at the freethrow line going into the damage 75 percent very impressed with him athletically defensively as a rim protector no question about that those without saying Wolverines remain perfect from the freethrow line and at times hes blocked shots hes kept them in play as opposed to trying to swat him in the third row Bill Russell blocks question Andrew Carr wide open set up well by Hildreth but Pantego secures his 13th rebound looking High Bandago tip no and then Carr got a lot of ball but a little wrist said Lamar Simpson in the foul against Wake Forest Andrew Carr Fandango got caught with the rim on the initial pass oh and played defense because gets up there a little too high cant finish it theres a arm there theres another arm there and you see the wrist yeah you see it you got foul like two or three times on the plate and thats what youve got to do if you Wake Forest you stop him from finishing the play and feed a big guy youll be strong and you make free throws fantego finally missed a free throw tonight first Miss of the night from the line for the Wolverines he makes the adjustment a little too much on that time kind of beautiful Applause makes the adjustment well hes got nine points 13 rebounds Mark Madsen the Mad Dog as he was called in Stamford won a couple NBA titles in the early 2000s as a member of the Lakers Applebee Nifty move draws contact is it on Bandago yes its only the second personal though on Aziz Bandago wake Trails by four half will be shooting two on the other side Music the ball around the ACC Louisville with its third consecutive one point loss to start the season falling against half State tonight Cardinals head to Maui for the Maui invitation on their next matchup Syracuse has its handful with Colgate the Raiders looking for a second straight win over the orange dating back a couple of years Duke Kansas later tonight Stan and the Champions classic Kentucky with a fourpoint lead on Michigan State in the second half of the first game from Indianapolis tonight Applause Tyree Appleby to the line brings Wake Forest within threes got one more shot and we are coming down to winning time here at the Joel Coliseum okay nice fruit yeah 16 for Tyree Appleby okay you wait for us you got to settle in right now allow one shot if anything be a good rebounding yeah never mind Justin Harmon as if no Defenders were there to stop him put him off the bounce no help siding thats one thing that uh Utah Valleys done a really good job of the United spacing the floor and allowing for cutters High 17 for harm and Hildreth missed it but tipped out Williamson free car with a loose ball spins kicks Hildreth great job by car to be under control inside getting forced a shot it could have been blocked knew he had a shooter on the wing heels with I told you you gotta have a guy like that and catch and score watch this Evan theres a split right there you gotta score on one in hes had a nice game thats a bad boy Army watch this inside outside knocking it down how many times have we gone to break tonight and come back and said one point game feels like virtually every time out yes we have or how about the last few minutes a key possession big triple for cam Hildreth a rainbow swish Wolverines by one with a basketball under three to play pick and roll First Look for the low block and get it Applause Off the Mark pendejo has his 14th rebound I told you Woodbury be one for 12 you probably wouldnt think the Wolverines would have a onepoint lead with two and a half to go no question about it clock issue Ted Valentine and Lamar Simpson meeting at the scores table hes going to give a free timeout to the Wolverines so Ill get a chance to draw something up here 229 to go for the moment 11 on the clock foreign did that last shot hit the rim I thought I did I thought it did front iron well theres an interesting Quirk to the fact that this game is technically a part of the Jamaica tournament that these two teams are competing in but theyre in different divisions Wake Forest is in the Jersey Mikes Jamaica classic in the Montego Bay division while the Wolverines are in the Rose Hall division both good places to be Utah Valley will take on Morgan State on Friday and then either Green Bay or Queens okay three hit the rim yeah I thought it did yeah yeah Ricochet I think they appropriately reset the shot clock to 20 but that could be what theyre checking Wake Forest will take on LaSalle on Friday and then either Georgetown or Loyola Marymount on Sunday its a two oclock game for Wake Forest on Friday and I was told if Wake loses on Friday theyll play at noon on Sunday if they win on Friday itll be a 2 30 game on Sunday afternoon Georgetown finally got a win a long losing streak that sounds odd to say about Georgetown I think they lost a knocked off Copper State last week our good friend Juan Dixon Copland States beating a bunch of folks good conference is good Derek Carter the athletic director is a really good friend of mine and they travel and they play they played Charlotte uh I think the night before they played Georgetown but uh Here We Go There You Go Utah Valleys got Morgan State Oregon State you know I played in the semifinals on the meac tournament last year Queens got their first win last week as a D1 program one of the newest members of division one knocked off knocked off Marshall Utah Valley is just about three miles from BYU yeah those games are rowdy affairs so Utah Tech which used to be Dixie State was the last night particular play wash and watch that camera exactly who it was it was late watching ball games and then you know about a good basketball in Utah BYU Utah Weber State so the clock still says 229 with 11 minutes with 11 on the shot clock I should say 11 seconds so that was a long review to basically confirm that it was uh well we said it was right all right Wolverines ball so you got that free time out like you said so you got a chance to run something if you wait for us its just a chance to rest theyll be ready to play good defense Woodbury with 10 Wolverines by one darthur offensive foul number four on the tray said played good defense and the guy has been doing it on both ends as Tyree Appleby watches defensive position you see just a little bit of a nudge just a little bit but he got him just enough just enough for the whistle to blow deacons looking to take their first lead in quite a while patience its driving angles Hildreth kicks it Carr sticks it big time shot by Parr again created off the dribble by hildred Carr whos really been a knock down shooter especially the top of the key had a good look he Bears it Applause Utah Valley on the offensive glass Fandango cant convert Carr has his 13th rebound Applebees Blake slows it down Steve Forbes wants to run the tomahawk play Music space car is going to pop out its going to be ball screen twoman game action driving and kick car a couple chances to shoot takes it right at Fandango no whistle answers straight up Applause just over a minute to play Woodbury just one for 12 from the field takes it anyway and scores timely got in the middle of the lane Evan got his shoulders square that time went up strong nice defense by Wake Forest better shot by Woodbury his second bucket of the night ties it at 59 Tyree Appleby lost his dribble Clinton into Hildreth 11 to shoot tries helldrift puts his head down stolen by Harmon game clock shot clock just about in sync about a second or two differential timeout Utah Valley wolverines have a chance to win it here at the Joel Coliseum Music after this time out each team will have one timeout remaining neither side has a vow to give however Wake Forest if they fell on the floor itd be one and one for the Wolverines Utah Valley foul to be two shots for the Deeks who do you go to heres Dan Harmon darthur Woodbury or the big guy Bandago I lit Harmon I mean excuse me I let Woodbury beat my initiatory offense and then I looked for something off the side the back side the screen to reversal for a Harman Arthur to get the elevation I wouldnt be afraid of getting Bendigo in the basketball situation up top just get the ball up top that means that youre going to have some space youre gonna have some driving and cut in the areas what youve got to do if you wait for us youve got to play smart passing lanes and be available for help side Defenders they float a pass inside contest every shot go up straight up and down dont file a threepoint shooter its Harmon darker Woodbury kneeled and Fandango for Utah Valley Appleby Williamson Hildreth Clinton and Carr for Wake Forest all right here we go about a two second differential game and shot clock yeah Ill start your offense Wolverines looking for a win over an ACC foe Woodbury no rebound Appleby that time two seconds Appleby to Clinton he didnt get it off he missed it anyway and weve got overtime Music frantic final sequence Woodbury got a good look Clinton was in a good spot but he couldnt get it off maybe a step outside where he would have been comfortable great job I told you Applebee can push it down might have wanted to pull right there good on selfish play clickman not enough time to get the finish well play five more Music what a game Music and a couple interesting observations from that last sequence from the Wake Forest perspective Bobby Clinton is a freshman its his third college basketball game hell learn time score situation exactly but that passed by Appleby was absolutely the right play you know what it reminded me of a guy that played here last year making a clutch late pass in a game named Alanis Williams yeah well I it was a good decision and I wouldnt have been mad if he had pulled up right in the paint and taken the midrange jumper either but again it was a good decision and just got to be able to catch it and finish it not sure had he been able to score the basket would it have counted but a good look on both sides and um you know this is this is the kind of game this has been all night long lets just go and play five more minutes eight ties 13 lead changes see when Applebys on the floor how he could change the dimensions of the ball game in the end and pushing it you know you know ability to elevate and also play some really good defense its going to be a pleasure watching him play and the Big Time shot a moment ago to three by car only 19 total turnovers in the game nine for Utah Valley 10 for Wake Forest Wolverines get the first possession in overtime Applause Applebees playing with three fouls Williamson with one bill drift and Carr both have two Harmon Applause in front Music hes got 19 dartharts got four fouls if youre keeping score at home for Utah Valley Music score at home kudos to you thats impressive clean strip there and saved by Harman thought the ball may have caught the Baseline it didnt keep playing the whistle blows Fandango over to Harman carp takes him in a switch tipped off Applebys hands great ball and it will be Wake Forest ball Appleby got the deflection it nicked darthur on the way by long arms being athletic we talked about planet passing wins this is what were talking about watch it just get the hand out there hed make the play goes off the arm the Utah Valley player darthos Minicon in the overtime Music car chase air ball Clinton throws it right to blaze Neal nailed found Music Neil does not been to the line tonight hes five for five from the stripes so far this season playing a lot of big moments for this Utah Valley team he started 49 of the 54 games he played the last couple years but Off the Bench the first four this year asked Mark Matson about that a shoot around today and he said its all about the depth we are the deepest team weve ever had Applause two for two at the line for Neil he gives him some leadership being a senior and also the ability to guard a lot of different positions so here we go four straight for the Wolverines to begin the overtime Williamson back to Hildreth Bobby Clinton getting some trust from his head coach out of the floor in the overtime Appleby off balance no rebound for Blaze kneeled again space theory is a good look contested jump shot to Doug Falls Second Chance theyll get it now if the Utah Valley you run some clock and you try to make Wake Forest defend all sides of the court from one sideline to the other move them around and see if you can get it dry or a postcard open man in the corner Harmon cant connect rebound Appleby had a wide open shot Applebee turns on the burner sluck free throws for Wake Forest with 251 on the clock fifth on darthur 18 points in 35 minutes for Latrey darthur who was impressive tonight fun to watch hell be a spectator the rest of the way Music no one else in the game currently has more than three personal fouls Apple Music all right is the leading scorer for Wake Forest tonight hes got 17 car has 13 points 13 rebounds 10 for Davey and Williamson You Wake Forest near you extend the pressure but you play solid you dont have to gamble right now youre just down possession theres a lot of time in this basketball game what a swing yeah open three that was missing the other end could have been a seven point game all of a sudden its back to two story of the night largest lead for Utah Valley was nine in the opening minutes that pass caught precariously and the Wolverines turn it over so careless pass to initiate the offense and he passes bad everything is thrown off watch this gets away from him and you just got to do a good job of keeping him play the ball goes off the black shirt sure did last Touch by Harmon Jenner Reno right there Appleby cant reach against him cannot reach against Applebee will make you pay the car against Fandango use the rim to Shield the shot blocker thats exactly what he did what a smart play in the post by car shielded big guy couldnt block it if he did he was going to foul him we got us a tie ball game 63 all two minutes in the overtime Applause Music Harmon on the drive clean hit Woodbury cant connect and Williamson has it not sure I think Carr got a piece of that Wake Forest trying to remain undefeated and head to Jamaica at 30 Andrew Carr rebound Woodbury one thing I think we know now thats his spot top of the key right in front just a little strong a buck 15 to go shall we play two Ill play as long as it takes to get a winner Woodbury halfway down Bandago the rebound clean Block Clinton Bandago stays with it Fandango Applause timeout Utah Valley 58 seconds remaining in overtime 63 all in the overtime Utah Valley and Wake Forest tied for the ninth time tonight weve had 14 lead changes weve had so many momentum swinging moments and itll be Wolverines ball after Mark Madsen took the time out what do you expect with 15 on the shot clock heres Dan luter well theyve had a lot of success just moving the basketball getting in some isolations trying to post players up I dont think youd try anything different maybe some type of twoman game Woodbury steel trying to get off the snide I looked for him always as a perimeter score but Ill tell you what the big guy the big guy the big guy has been dominant tonight youre talking about bandagos the little guy for Wake Forest thats leading the way Tyree Appleby hes only three of 13 from the field but hes 12 of 14 from the line look how quick he gets inside the paint defense on roller skates a taxi not afraid to go inside recognizes the open person finds him gets a shot his speed his court awareness his ability to get inside a Defender is going to play positive for Wake Forest this season I like me some Tyree Appleby now 187 rebounds hes also got six assists for the second straight game compared that pass that he made at the end of regulation to something Alanis Williams would have done or solandus led the ACC in scoring and assists a year ago to name the ACC player of the year what a marvelous player the biggest difference between this years team and last years team and look its very early last years Wake Forest basketball team was unique in that the two best players in the team were also the two best passers on the team yeah yeah and this team theres a lot of great oneonone individual Talent it feels like theyre still learning that cohesive chemistry maybe a little older player too yeah a little more a little more season and your card yeah Music it doesnt matter now spot throw in Im not gonna guard the passer Woodbury looking Woodbury just barely gets it in near Mid Court tracked by Neil Music Applause Fandango sets the screen Hildreth rolls with him Harmon all the way to the bucket missed it Manson wanted a foul he didnt get one Appleby back outside for Hildreth Wake Forest no thought of a two for one 15 to shoot 30 in the overtime period Appleby Scoops it up oh no he didnt timeout called by Steve Forbes no real need to rush because Appleby had the basketball he headed in the middle of the floor and started working down the lane and then you want to highlight shot you want the highlighter Ill give it to you in just a second maybe maybe I wont give it to you but here you go watch this watch this now inside under control under control up and under thats the hard shot when you plant horse in the backyard try to beat your brother beat your cousin throw it off the glass spin underneath got it get a little dab from a teammate watch this one more time defend it How You Gonna Stop Me you stopped it one time couldnt stop it up under off the glass count it Tyrell Applebees Im just trying to tell you Mr Applebees a bad man its hard to believe fandangos have multiple highlight reel swats tonight could you get that one it was too low of a release yeah and what do you do with a shot blocker well you wouldnt know you need block shot well we do a shot blocker you bring it to the shooter you bring it right at him cant get to it cant react quick enough all right get that blocking shots in Wake by two 255 to go the way it works Dan is I ask the questions and you answer the question Im sorry okay all right well heres go Laughter pressure on the ball hildreths on Woodbury fans of the Joel Coliseum on their feet 15 seconds shot clock off Woodbury pounding the dribble but stationary right now wood bearing makes a move takes it three seconds left time out Wake Forest 65 all on the gutty jumper from Trey Woodbury thought you needed some movement thought the offense was bogging down a little bit Woodberry said you dont really understand because Im a bad man too count going down has spacing gets the elevation a little separation looks does a really nice job of defend didnt name him during the corner didnt really give him a good look you got to make that shot off balance he knew it was going in all the time so Wake Forest has to go the length of the floor because they still havent changed the rule to advance the ball like they did in womens college basketball to mirror the NBA in the WNBA had a great night three for 17 but Woodbury with a clutch jumper there and you know Stan just to mention one thing that I talked about with someone before the game off the air Music just a little personal anecdote eight years ago today I was in Honolulu Hawaii as the radio guy for the High Point University mens basketball team with Stephanie Safford did not make the trip but uh he was listening from afar High Point defeated Cal State Bakersfield that day 100 to 99 in four overtimes the craziest game Ive ever called with love to replicate that tonight eight years to the day Laughter all right but itd be fun if Wake Forest wanted here too okay 33 for the dinks Mildred to inbound okay we will be in Williamson cars at the bottom of the place hes in the paint wake with in Matthew wake was working on a play like this earlier today so do you Matthew Marsh coming to the top of the king he makes the catch he gets into Appleby good luck there you go Wake Forest wins it in the buzzer Tyree Appleby and the Deep stay perfect on their way to Jamaica the officials are sending both teams back to their benches thinking there may be a few tenths of a second left on the clock Music but it shoot around this afternoon Wake Forest was working on this Bryce Drew Valparaiso like pass the big man catching is the top of the key and Matthew Marsh said the back screen and you threw it on what did we just say you saw the play run you were talking about where did where you had car hes got great hands catches a nice pass right there see theres the rub congestion right there Marsh got the ball and you just catch it and toss it to the shooter follow it out and thats a great look it looks easy but its hard to execute you got to make certain that you catch it and youve got to be ready to shoot it an excellent call look Appleby knocks it down looks like there might be 023 left lets take a look and see if the top of the screen yeah yeah about 03 Maybe if that this is a great play and Marsh had to do a great job of catching it and coming down and making the pass cant boblet you cant waste any time in that situation how about uh Matthew Marsh picking up his first career assist yeah on that play can they come at a better time its a big Target at 71 yeah 71 and a 610 guy and then on the same kind of screen action I think theyre gonna put 410 14 oclock I think thats what well have which uh which means you can catch and shoot take a look at the clock at the top ball goes through look at the Wake bench as well youre laughing yeah you allow for human ear head five years the official time left yep you have time to make a catch and a shoot so what you got is probably Woodbury Justin Harmon youve got a big feeding a little he can run the Baseline Utah Valley looking for a prayer Woodbury did he get it off doesnt matter Wake Forest wins wow Music 68 Wolverines 65 Wake Forest and Utah Valley should play more often telling you Ill take the trip to warm Ill tell you this is a very well coached team Utah Valley and Wake Forest did everything they had to do at the end of this basketball game to stay in it and then to win it great call by coach Forbes and his staff better execution you get the w what a game Tyree Appleby wow with a signature moment early in his Wake Forest career Music he can open the season with three straight at home none of them are easy but they escape to Jamaica with a 30 record the Utah Valley drops to two and two no shame tonight with the empress heck of a ball game thanks for joining us Applebys three with point four to go is the winner Deacons taking
