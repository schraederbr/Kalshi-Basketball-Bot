home white there officials Clarence Armstrong Justin Porterfield and Kellen Milner we tip it up here inside the watsco center itll be Notre Dame with the first possession John what are you looking for offensively out of the Fighting Irish tonight well I think you got to start with an urgency its hard to bring urgency when its a bit of a sleepy crowd were aware of that its tough to bring urgency when youre playing against opponent who hasnt found a way to win in conference play so youve got to be urgent purposeful with cuts to start not will get up a ton of shots on the outside but inside is shrewbury with his first shot Off the Mark and Miami will limit them to one and done thats been the key for the Hurricanes giving up a lot of rebounds on this 10 game losing streak theyre trying to limit The Possession for Notre Dame tonight well its something you got to continue to work on if youre going to switch a lot when you switch a lot you get out of position its something they have to continue to work at getting better at Brandon Johnson will give it up with 10 seconds on the shot clock first offensive possession here for Miami Jalil Bea The Freshman from Pennsylvania hes got to get it up one second step back three So Tay Davis will bring it up into the front court for Notre Dame shrewbury they want him to get up more shots and hes off the mark wouldnt you love that as a coach yeah I never heard Music that maybe its cuz I didnt play for my dad and thats not what it is I Im not saying that to be critical there is Cleveland throwing it down with two hands Matthew Cleveland the senior from Atlanta hes a leading score for Miami if youre Miami too like its been hard to create good shot opportunities you just have to make plays so so think less about what you need to do and how crafty you need to be to create scoring opportunities just go out make plays be free Tate Davis in the missing in close tipped around and its matako keeping the possession alive for the Fighting Irish here is Marcus Burton has not taken a shot yet here tonight and in the passing Lane deflected by Cleveland interim head coach is Bill Courtney he is looking for his first win as an interim took over after Jim Lena stepped down midseason thats tough I I just want to say Music just want to say thats not easy for players its not easy for coaches the amount of work you have to put in to lose is no different than the amount of work you put in to win back door and Johnson will be fouled they called the whistle on Bren Shrewsberry his first Notre Dame head coach in his second season is his dad Micah Shrewsberry came over from Penn State I mean this is just one of the top level talented coaches in all of college basketball hes a development guy and you do have to spend time with him to to reach your potential and I like the way hes recruiting hes bringing in a young group next year youve got some experienced guys around them I think theyre headed in the right direction you can tell theres a lot of young pieces that are getting a lot of experience this year for Notre Dame I think the biggest piece is finishing the season with hope so you can keep those young pieces this his kid his sky hook he likes to play inside and its Miami with a 4 nothing lead not is a lot better defensively when they can get themselves set so you start making some shots get yourself set on the defensive end theyre not going to gamble too much theyre not going to take too many chances but in position theyre solid defensively noted aame 0 for four to start this game lets see if Burton can get him on track alaka with a full head of steam comes to a stop two feet and he puts noted aim on the board good execution really spacing out the defense and thats what you want to do I mean really widen out your screens and and have room for that tight curl once again they try to go inside to kid hes been getting double teamed a lot this season but only sending one Johnson pullup jumper and its Miami with a 62 lead its a good start for Miami theyre patient theyre playing with good Poise and defensively theyve been able to get stops and rebounds and and get out and run we still have not seen Burton get a shot off yet this is K Davis Off the Mark but its cleaned up by keeva ji inside was one of the things we talked about with Michael Shrewsberry was was having that guy that can space the floor and sometimes its going to be Shrewsberry on the floor spacing out hes threepoint shooter but but Burton can do that as well and playing four on four is certainly Advantage offense Cleveland is a guy who can light it up but he gives it up to kid and he cant handle it turnover so we in the break Zone timeout here in Miami its the hurricanes with an early twopoint lead Music believe that things can fall off that quickly but I think given the the just immense changes in the game thats how its going to go I mean you could have a team look great one year and the following year just fall off the face of the earth now that being said the struggles actually make this a better job for the next guy nobody wants to come over following a final four shot clock at seven for Notre Dame inside Julian roer Off the Bench Davis midrange and he left it short but to your point with the transfer portal you can completely remake A Team season to the next look you can go from stinky to really good overnight stinky yeah I you know its Grated you watch a lot of Moana I got kids we played five minutes here in Miami and the C hurricanes have showed some urgency but Johnsons three missing everything and if youre Miami thats what you want right when you have a streak you just have to have that hope and show up and be prepared every night you have to show up and be prepared but you also have to free yourselves a little bit I mean you cant carry this you have to understand as players you carry it with you youre defined by your outcome as an athlete and and theres a lot of weight on these guys to perform so youve got to find a way to be free and just let loose you see Miami they are closing out hard on the threepoint Shooters Burton lets it Fly short Off the Mark and Notre D with the offensive rebound shrewbury another chance nothing but nylon first three of the game for Notre Dame such a a rhythm high percentage shot when youre able to step into it that like that like those offensive rebounds that get kicked out and youre stepping into the shot its a really high percentage three you know there are metrics out there that track that stuff and every coach will tell you its the best look you get Cleveland with a hand in his face too strong Shrewsbury with the board not d start this game three of 10 from the floor was that deflected shuberry doesnt matter tracking it Applause down Burton trying to set up his man crossover pullup jumper and Cleveland snatches it down in transition this is where Cleveland is dangerous but a jump ball is called good defense by Julian roer second how going a jump ball if he ends up getting the shot off right he didnt come down with it I dont really lets see I like just let him like okay hes that yeah but like he gets it up let I think were really quick with jump balls thats thats my point okay I can see that one play play it on a little bit like Balls on the floor give it a second lets see if they get the ball Cleveland rattles in the J and Miami retakes the lead think a lot of what Miami is getting right now is based on their defense theyre theyre developing some confidence being able to defend they done a great job on Burton really shading everything his way constantini was open inside he was calling for it but a kick ball as a shot clock will reset thats a name you had to practice right Ive seen him play before when he was at TLS yeah yeah we had him a very nice young man he from Ukraine I remember talking to him when the war first started and what that and how that has impacted him and he was talking about how being around his team at Tulsa and being around basketball has helped him take his mind off of it its funny how many times have you said that like a a we had this guy here now hes here that has been one of the biggest challenges as a broadcaster is not only following the players but figuring out what they do differently for each different team its Sir mohamd with a little English on that one Notre Dame with a onepoint lead thats the the climate we live in right yeah you make an impact at one level you can step it up the next season its likely there will be options yes here comes the quick double and Notre Dame with the steal theyve got numbers a four on two break Burton letting it Fly got it thats the first time tonight weve really seen a little rhythm and a flow created by Notre D and it starts with what they did defensively theyre team that typically youll see double in the post and its almost if theyre SC scramble makes them better St McCrae spinning in the lane tipped out of bounds itll stay with Miami its all set up by the double but its not the guys that are doubling that create the play Its the guys off the ball that are reading what the other offensive players where theyre going to cut where the open lines are youre going to take that away with a good anticipation Cleveland curling and hes been hot to start this game hes got six points for Miami now hes dangerous I mean open floor hes dangerous if theres a gap in the defense hes going to attack but hes got a great midrange game too how about that midrange game we do not see that very often anymore because of analytics theres a few guys that still do it really well and when they do it they have success I dont know why weve shied away from it at this level Miami is in this one to start its a twopoint lead for Notre Dame well be Music back e ACC Big 12 big Monday double header on ESPN First up its Pittsburgh playing host of Virginia at 7 Eastern then we got number three Iowa State in Kansas taking on number 11 The Jayhawks at Allen Fieldhouse that is a monster match up in the Big 12 3 and 11 for now right like the fragility of winning in college basketball is wild I mean for Kansas State to just blow out Iowa State you never would have seen that coming and then the comeback from who by the way Baylor is starting to really figure it out they got some young guys now once once they figure out how to really play use one another communicate thats where you become good but again the key is finishing the season with good hope so they can get a lot of those guys back 21 points down Baylor coming back to win that game but you let a team hang around and they can do some damage thats what Miami is doing right now hanging around in this first half Cleveland with two Defenders on him o Watch Out Below as Kyrie Hy was undercut and he is fouled Matthew Clevelands one of those guys where he gets places right and you got to be careful you got to close gaps before he puts the ball on the floor because once he does hes an experienced Savvy guy it eventually brings multiple Defenders not just the help side but other Defenders who feel the risk they all flock to the basketball here his first free throw off the mark that was just his sixth free throw of the Season some guys getting some extra playing time Miami without a few players tonight and when youre struggling that also means opportunity for some ball just like right just if you get the opportunity go ball caution to the wind be Fearless Miamis been digging in defensively to start this game no easy shots so far for for Notre Dame kesn thats a tough one but the offensive board to Roper the second nothing on the inside for Notre D there goes Roper of the paint kick out three ball J got it at 610 he can hit that outside shot that was really good stuff offensively where you start to learn how you can attack they show like a 32 but they stay with Cutters youve got to just be able to beat your man off the bounce draw defense and helps side and play looking for the foul no whistle was jayen Music Applause Blackman Davis penetrating that pump fake got his man in the air and he finishes something Michel Shrewsbury does really well as a coach I mean he he plays Advantage Basketball and I think thats going to to give him an edge going forward thats the way you coach going forward when you got a new team a new group youve got to identify what your advantage is and figure out how to play to it Mi trying to identify a mismatch on this end of the floor ston McCrae his shot off the side of the rim under 10 minutes to play in this first half in Miami Dame came out to a slow shooting start starting to pick it up with this sixpoint lead you can just see the the lack of depth for Miami hurts them theyre completely different group when they have to go to the bench the start was strong for Miami loo thought about it now puts it on the deck jump stop free throw jumper off the mark and its tipped out of bounds off Music miam I like the space here we talked about how you can space the floor jas a good shooter from three doesnt get a ton but if you have another spacer means youre going to have open driving lanes and I think Davis is one of those guys if he gets the right matchup thats where Michael Shrewsberry is going to really call for him to attack off the inbound Davis looking to attack and he throws it down Notre Dame on a 123 run opening up their biggest lead of the game I really think a big part of it is this the second group for Miami the start was really strong defensively they were communicating on the offensive end they were looking to attack now this groups trying to figure it out ly kid back on the floor trying to bang inside Off the Mark with his left Music hand thir Dame has so many shooters that you got to respect the entire threepoint line the problem is they dont have enough drivers which means help sides in position Off the Mark and its snatched down by Johnson they set very well spaced but the defense is not really concerned with guys off the ball and the L close out kid with a pass the corner Schwarz his three Off the Mark Davis trying to back down his man little touch pass too a little too much dribble from kesn and he loses it Miami with numbers two on One Touch passed inside and kid throws it down a little too much dribble but its really indecision right the second you have to stop and think youre beat and offensively they had good things going Michael Shrewsberry called him into a quick screen where you got the matchup you wanted but they werent able to attack it three ball in the way shrewbury man that is is a sweet looking stroke his second three tonight its just pure and what you have to do is the defender is not allow him to get his feet right or feet set or his shot preparation prepared right you you cant let him walk into a shot if he can get it off its a good look State McCrae with an open look and Miami still without a three tonight 0 for six from downtown shrewbury hes starting to feel it he is starting to feel it in Miami his third three tonight and a timeout hurricane shot preparation is well before you get the ball and if you watch Shrewsberry step into it its because hes ready for it hes ready for it before he even gets it good footwork pure stroke yeah you might want to get out there and run him off the line to ARA a homecoming like no other how special is this Arkansas Kentucky tonight on ESPN so the big question what kind of reception will Coach Cal receive when he comes back into rup tonight at 900 pm Eastern look hes going to get booed by some some people are going to appreciate what he did but the thing is like once you move on youre gone right so much for that lifetime contract right but like its just like they kind of ran him out of town anyway and then theyre going to boo him when he takes another job its just its just Sports man were not asking for people to be rational kid inside finishing off hes got six with Cleveland back on the floor it looks like this is the unit that Miami is best offensively look Clevelands got to pay 40 minutes thats a lot to ask but theyre a far better team when hes on the floor defensively too hon and its Cleveland with the board he is so athletic so long at 6 Music s think the key is I I said before he gets places he can get where he wants to go and not a lot of space that thats a gift theres an art to that look at chuku give it off three ball and theres the first three of the night for Miami it comes from Brandon Johnson theyre going to get those open looks on a throwback with Matthew Cleveland on the same side cuz theyre not going to leave Cleveland Clevelands just a threat to go off at any moment so he he has that gravity theres Logan Imes Off the Bench inside Burton off the deck poked away but theyre going to call the reach in on uku see Jai has that shot on the short roll and the short roll is like midrange for Bigs its there all the time help defense comes over to take the hard roll away from the basket the second pop guys have gotten better and they switch everything anyway but the short rolls there youve got to be able to develop a 10 12T jump shot or turn and face it attack off sh thought about it had an opening Im spinning dealing and gets the roll as he says come on lets go look it was a nice finish it was a nice offensive play but reality is it was a nice offensive possession they really spaced it moved it east to west got the defense chasing and attacked who little miscommunication and another turnover like the take is what we look at you know so we say oh wow what a move it was it was a really pretty move but the move only happens if the offense is spaced well the move only happens if the ball moves east to west and get the defense chasing the play you create ISO opportunities are which are playmaking opportunities with good spacing and good ball Music movement inside constan dinovski gets the double team trying to fight out of it plenty of time on the shot clock at Music 11 and H has his pocket pick uku throws it down there is plenty of and flight out of Miami here in this first half and theyve done a really good job taking Burton out of it right the second he puts it on the floor theyre really getting up in him and you get a foul there and thats what its been they theyve been very conscious of where hes at at all times a little concerned with some of the junk defenses as we saw on their iPad earlier today we got a nice shot of that and its part of the junk defense is youre never going to get left so at times you have to figure out how to be a good decoy junk defense to find that Run and Jump I mean its changed its not a box in one triangle and two anymore its a face guard at times its its switching up taking taking any sort of three opportunities away its a number of things its its not what it used to be I think it used to be hey theyre going to run a box in one on your a triangle two no its the unpredictable its on a ball screen were going to play it flat and then the next time were going to run and jump you its switching things up and keeping you off balance so Nikita kantowski will go to the free throw line and shoot two for Notre Applause Dame how about some womens hoop Sunday afternoon we got an exciting ACC slate on ESPN 2 Hannah hgo and number three Notre Dame are in Louisville to take on the Cardinals coverage begins at noon Eastern I think one of the best junk defenses out there its a good match up smoke minut wait a minute wait a minute somebody opened the door that did not hit anything sometimes those stick with you a little bit you know its bad enough when like theres a big crowd theyre yelling airball but like as a shooter it just kind of stick like what did I do you better know what you did like oh went off the wrong fingertip thats okay you can move on Cleveland oneonone matchup and thats good d by Alo just like his ability to get shots off he he can create his own shot thats what makes him so dangerous but if youre NBA Scout you want to see if he can guard you know he can score now he is here defensively on shrewbury sherbury with some space left it Applause short the lead is eight from Miami for excuse me for no to name with just over three minutes to play in this first half and thats swiped Away by Sir muhamad I think the concept of guarding is far more than just can you cover the basketball can you take shots away you know ultimate is like do you have good instincts on the defensive end to to shorten your Closeouts throwing it up top and Cleveland takes a look at Burton as he throws it on his head and Burton smiling sometimes you know I was on the wrong side of that one and Burtons all right with it and this is a group you said it coming out of that last time out like this is the group youve got to be able to roll with and really its whatever group has Matthew Cleveland on the floor he hes got to play 40 minutes shb now Miami starting to put together some stops down by six Cleveland a little too much dribble Burton hes got numbers Little Euro Step with the finger roll okay that was that nice that was it was there was a thing years a couple years ago the jelly fam you remember the jelly fam none of them were any good but its been enough time I could say that Cleveland catch and shoot all right all right Clevelands in double figures with 11 and Miami is only down five we talked about him in the open for a reason he we said he can go for 30 on any given night particularly if you let him he can get to the rim he can shoot it he can get offensive rebounds you can put him in the post hes been dangerous tonight and hes made his team better both sides of the Ballo with the blow by takes the bump gives it up Mohamed and he rattles in a three this just a slight indecision offensively and thats probably going to drive Micah Shrewsberry nuts right hes actually calling out the passes were on the coachs side the benchs side which we get to hear a lot more now problem is they can hear what were saying too weve been nice yeah we have been nice were good a good first half why is Matthew Cleveland not touching the ball that thats going to be the real question at least once in a possession a slow start for Burton two of seven from the floor hes got five points for Notre Dame going to his left now ducking in and He will draw the foul on Brandon Johnson Matthew Cleveland we we keep talking about him and for good reason theyre better when hes on the floor offensively and defensively hes a playmaker hes a highlight reel and as we said he can go for 30 on any given night this Miami team theyre in there with Matthew Clevelands on the floor Cleveland is unmissable on the floor and its both sides we show highlights and the highlights are typically offensive because it just looks better and it makes you feel like hes doing a lot more but its both sides of the floor his impact defensively is communication and length being in position to take driving Lanes away hes great in the open floor he gets into space in the half court he can shoot it hes got gravity so other guys are going to get open hes been terrific tonight theyre not the same team when hes not on the floor he is now 16 points away from 1500 in his career good thatll be quite an accomplishment and what he would tell you is hed rather be winning like I I dont say that lightly like as an athlete you are in so many ways defined by your outcome right did you win and are you an all are you an NBA allar right like that thats kind of the way it is so its really tough on these guys not winning games well one two2 full court press from Notre Dame under a minute to play here in this first half you think Cleveland needs a touch here hes got to hes got to be involved like he he brings defense with him you can run him off screens thats fine but the ball in his hands changes everything defensively CL trying to go oneonone here against Davis had his pocket picked here by Burton Burton bumps the defender but he blows the bunny and it is cleaned up by shrewbury final seconds here in this first half two seconds Schwarz leans in a three off the window and its Notre Dame with an 11point half time lead 3625 here in Miami look Notre Dame played a pretty solid first half I think Applause defensively Miami trying to trap here showing a little zone defense to start this second half look Z but theyve been staying with some Cutters particularly on Burton looks like Cleveland staying with Burton and a lot of communication off the ball little hybrid box in one action here Im actually trying to figure it out AO short and its Miami with the rebound to Jalil befa I think those are the best defenses the ones that you have to take a minute or two to figure out back door cut Johnson goes reverse but he cant finish you good Defense Forces some sort of reset meaning that the offense pulls it out and tries to figure out how to attack if you can force a reset youre going to defend better Notre Dame comes in tonight theyve won two in a row at Virginia and against Georgia Tech that was after a by week where coach shuber said he felt like he reset got rested and just reset this offense and he he was also reminded of the things he needs to improve upon by the friendly fans out there that somehow found his cell phone number we will get into that later on in the broadcast maruson finishes he had a tough first half it was two of eight but he gets the scoring started now in the second hes got eight I think he really if youre Marcus Burt youve got to really be patient and the patience is not about like picking your spots its feeling out the game you know you yourself as the best player on the floor have all the attention in The Scouting Report you have to be patient read the game figure out the best opportunities for you to attack and sometimes its taking yourself out of the play before kind of forcing the issue Music L kid Johnson midrange from the corner to strong and the rebound goes to Burton the biggest difference in Burton head coach Michael shrewbury told us from the first year now to this sophomore season hes just playing a lot more under control different speed letting the game come to him well thats the key different speed and its really different speeds where hes Chang in speeds hes changing direction a little bit more purposeful a good block by kid inside loed a with six on the shot clock now its taken away but Fe McDonalds all Amer you can see Can Fly And its cleaned up by Matthew Cleveland good start for Miami here just just hang in there right hang in there your defense establish create scoring opportunities particularly those in transition and a foul away from the ball as a loo I dont know hes talking himself or the W or something getting mumbled its crazy talk its good defense for Miami though I mean they have been far more locked in they were locked in to start the game and locked in to start this second half and and as many easy scoring opportunities as you can create youve got to capitalize Alo is one of those pieces that Notre Dame got in the portal transfer from pen providing some veteran leadership for this young team Burton now slicing and dicing his deep well and again its that patience and Poise its changing speeds changing directions just reading what the defense is doing are they are they helping up are they switching theyre going to stay pause the defense at attack they a pull up jumper falling away no good and a strong board by AO but it is tied up and a jump ball is called as Johnson got his hand in there its Miami ball you just watch watch Burt and you kind of just watch the eyes hes surveying far more calculating that he was as a freshman as a freshman you just kind of go all right what a did Im going to freeze the defense get him on my back and then kind of use my own teammate for a screen and get to the basket smart basketball by the way can I tell you I hate jump balls I dont you like using the word hate I hate jump balls stops play its just I dont know how to fix it you you got two hands on it you got toow I I know but the game is so fluid the Rhythm and the flow its just one of those things it just stops play and it drives me nuts it shouldnt its just its a reality of the game youth basketball oh my God the amount of jump balls its epic its torture youre in Miami you got to chill out youre right looking ahead to next Wednesdays ACC Network spend basketball double header feature number two duke it starts with Stanford Georgia Tech at 7 Eastern then Cooper flag and the Blue Devils host Cal at Cameron indor well Jala highly recruited fivestar top 10 recruit coming in from Philadelphia hasnt gone the way he has wanted to but I think talking to the coaching Z they feel like he has Shrugged off those outside expectations and now is letting the game come to him yeah no ones going to just show up there not many Cooper Flags out there and it worked out well where the roster creation for John Shire was brilliant it doesnt always work that way so youve got to go out and show what you could do whether its here or elsewhere theres a loo from the corner three Off the Mark but a good board inside and J cant finish in Applause close 11point lead for Notre Dame as theyre looking to push their win streak to three games here in Miami I think Betha should really study Matthew Cleveland too just the way he plays Beth skill set Johnson I dont know if thats a pass or what but kid said thank you very much give it it to him why not let see if that counts as ass South Beach mode so you are Im very giving right nower and a three Falls for Tay Davis theres his parents in attendance a lot of Notre Dame fans here in Miami at Watco Center weird why would they come to Miami right the same reason youre all giddy I excited yeah I dont know what I did to get this assignment but I will thank my bosses anytime I get a Miami game you know were up in bokeh tomorrow right thats right theres the driving Baseline dumps it off kid using that footwork and he finishes in close good things happening you got multiple guys but they and Cleveland can be your creators and if they get room to operate they can get where they want to go and its up to the bigs on those little dump down passes to catch and finish Davis now driving showing his versatility with the outside now finishing in close and thats where guy like with theya show their youth right on the catch not in a good guarding position theyre almost waiting for the action to get into a guarding position looking to get aggressive here in the second half drives into a double team good d by alako shot clocks at two leaning in is Johnson Music aos tough defensively he hes very Scrappy oh Davis he ran into the D there to draw the whistle and its Notre Dame with a 12point lead here in Miami well be back after this is a lesson in humility as good as you feel some people think you stink first off Michael Sher is one of the greatest guys you will meet in col basketball have a ofor when we met with him today we asked how did thatan get your pH number he said we are still investigating yeah switch carriers next thing you know you start getting spam calls you know refinance your mortgage Just You Better Block every number you get I think thats like its sad but its also hilarious and Im glad he can laugh at it too because its totally annoying well if its its online right you can block out social media kid finishes inside and cut the lead back to 10 but when someones hitting you up directly on your cell phone I also like the idea of like kind of peeling back the layers and going through the process of how that was acquired right like someone was able to acquire that number and then had the gall to send that text like hilar as if as if anyone has any idea what theyre talking about compared to these men who do this every single day and theyve made a life doing not just earned a living doing this their life has been in basketball and if youre going to send it at least put your name attached to it yeah Im telling you Music man I I it is it the way he read it too was funny the whole the holy s partk got me hes got something cooking here Notre Dame theyre back to 500 on the season looking to go 500 in confence play with a win here today Davis did I dont know that he beat the shot clock there bench is going nuts as Notre Dame gets another opportunity you know a lot of times its when its really loud Im not going to say thats the case here crowd does not like that one kesn off the mark and constantini its a third trip now for Notre Dame Burton stepping into one and its snatched down by Cleveland at 6 foot s he can get out and run rolls off the rim gets his own Miss and he puts it back in in Cleveland now leads the way with 15 he is really tough in transition and there are some guys who have always been good in transition hes one of them always been good in transition being able to get where he wants to go but when they changed the block charge rule it really opened the floor up a lot more I mean thats one where you would see someone just standing there by the rim taking it on the chest and and stopping play and making it boring and all that stuff theyve really fixed that and Clevelands one of the beneficiaries of that rule I mean look at Cleveland and kid what they have done compared to the rest of the team the lead is now cut down to single digits and when we talked to Micah Shrewsberry earlier today and now heres a steal uguk wo hey he said lets get this as Miamis trying to end a 10 game losing streak we talked about how dangerous that team can be right theyre a team of highlevel players welcome back inside the watsco center here in Miami one of the better point guards in hurricane history Angel Rodriguez born in Puerto Rico played at Kansas State then Miami from 2014 to 16 he was in the gym yesterday for practice not as a fan but he was on the floor hooping it up as part of the scout team and he was giving them the business so I asked him I said what was that all about he said Im still playing Im a pro I live in Miami they asked me to come back and see if I wanted to watch practice he said I want to actually play with the guys cuz hes getting ready for his season coming up in Puerto Rico but he also loves this program so much that he also wants to impart with wisdom to the young guys he said Ive been all over the world playing as a pro and he said I remember my second year as a professional playing in Israel I was on a losing team kind of like whats going on here at Miami and he said you have to understand things are not always easy and it can always be worse than what youre going through right now appreciate this and use this as preparation for life and how to dig out of a hard situation look the reality as a pro there youre in Israel and youre not winning youre not getting paid either thats not happening here great response out of the timeout for Notre day but youre right look the older guys its not just like the wisdom because I dont know how guys are prepared or will willing or even able to receive wisdom at this point you almost have to earn that if youre Angel Rodriguez by showing them how its done on the floor and I think hes able to do that Miami stting to find it too I look this game really found itself we we finally kind of come into a contest here but my brother does the same thing as this assist he likes to get out like demonstrate right and the slower you are the older you are the more impressive it is I think for these young guys credit to Angel Rodriguez he said he wants to be a coach one day after he finishes playing one of the better dudes you will meet in college basketball off the miss the rebound of AA Miami only down by six just over 11 minutes to play in the second half there goes Cleveland right by his man to the bucket the lead is down to Music Applause Music Applause four now the crowd they starting to get into it in Miami Burt makes his move off the mark and its Johnson with a rebound well Johnson did a good job of gapping there there goes Bea tried to dump it off and a block is called against Notre Dame Matthew Cleveland if if he faces up you got to know that he can rip through and get under the defender thats what he does he got under the defender the only thing you can do at that point is foul between Bea and Matthew Cleveland youve got two creators on the floor everythings got to go through them we will step aside Miami with momentum only down four Music e e e e Notre Dam head coach michah shrewbury he warned his guys about this game he said its similar to the situation they had last year against Louisville who was on a losing streak you have to they know they have hope going into every game he said the key is youve got to take their hope out early he said but if you get caught up in the weather you get caught up with being in my soaking up the atmosphere here he said you can let a team hang around and then youre in for a dog fight and that is whats happening right now look if you think its an issue for us like you got to think as players coming from South Bend you come down here you walk around you feel sun and you loosen up a little bit but hes absolutely right you have to and you have to do it in the beginning of the game you have to do it consistently throughout and then absolutely to start the second half youve got to do it they were not able to do it now were we got a ball game I saw that picture of you pool side in your prep for game it was Applause nice yours was better aaka with 10 on the shot clock for Notre Dame itll be Burton to try to bail out this possession hand in his face three goes thats over the arm of Matthew Cleveland that that was really good defense I I think as a whole the defense was locked in they communicated well a couple late switches but were fine with it Matthew Cleveland was there Cleveland makes the right pass but Johnson decides to put it on the deck Huga chuku wide open too strong tipped out Miami with a second chance heres Betha a step back three thats a deep one and heres a third opportunity for the Hurricanes thats a terrible shot Cleveland corner like thats what you have to eliminate if youre Miami like continue to get good looks continue to attack I mean you just dont need that triple step back from 30 and Im the guy that doesnt mind them just the moment you got to know the game you got to feel the game thats thats how you win games and thats how you lose games Burton trying to break down his man goes the spin move and ji couldnt get the handle on the footb uku look at that speed First Coast to Coast and Miamis back within three look chuku did a good job recognizing that Burton was on the floor so youve got numbers and typically the defense is going to take away the the advanced pass up the the wings wide open paint he attacked does this look like a team that has lost 10 games in a row Miami looking for their first win in the ACC this season here tonight Burton just goes by Bea his Runner thats sweet hes going to start to find his spots you know the last possession he just missed one at The Rim he can get where he wants to go and I think hes done a good job being patient to this point where now theyre going to ask more of them Cleveland to his left now gets to a strong arm kick out Johnson will take the wide open three theres the pretty offense from Miami its starting to click no Johnson had that shot last possession he turned it down Im glad he was shot ready and just didnt think too much about it just let it fly Applause Music Applause and Burton took an extra step when he traveled got Marcus Burton starting to find it by find it I just me like where is he going to get his good opportunities you know sometime late shot clock thats one thing but being able to break down the defense get inside for his help thats where he can really beat you and then this Miami team good action good spacing open looks knock down we got a ball game I dont know if D cuff said something we could not hear it but I know I know hes jealous I can tell you that as it should be here in Miami for the weekend and we got a good ball game here tonight just a twopoint lead for Notre Dame whatever Bristols a great place to be in the winter you really said that in a straight face I mean it it is youre right this is a little better hey man life could always be worse 10 on the shot clock for the Hurricanes trying to tie take the lead with this possession Johnson Baseline Drive and He will draw the whistle its funny how simple the game can be in this sense if you become the aggressor the opponent chases you and Miami the hope that weve talked about trying to take away their hope they have hope and theyve become the aggressor in this contest and its a completely different game when they are this Bill Courtney who is the interim head coach for Miami and after Jim Lena steep down midseason and he is trying to hold things together looking for his first win here at Miami as the interim head coach he had so much passion when I went to practice yesterday they were they were working on a drill where it was a two onone three on two four on three and he stopped the drill he said we need to get layups and better shots lets do it over and do it right and he is still locked in trying to get on the right side in the wind column youre right Crow crowd could into it you get the crowd hope too when you compete if youre Applause Miami shot clocks at four shrewbury gives it back to AO deep three ball and its tipped out of bounds will stay with Notre Dame I think they got it wrong too lets take another look at this yeah thats they got it Applause wrong active hands in the passing L its a different Miami team than weve seen over the past few weeks Davis in the paint his Flo ear no good Miami their coaching staff says the biggest struggle has been getting them to play together as a team but they are coming together here tonight Cleveland cut off Baseline here comes the double team somebodys open itll be UGA chuku now drives into the paint gets it back Cleveland the shot clocks at Four showing his patient and hes still hits the jumper as Miami takes their first lead here in the second Applause half miscommunication and ugat chukus got numbers one on two and heels fouled by Burton comes a point in the game too where you got one team trying to manufacture offense in Notre a and on the other one theyre just operating theyre just playing this is a tough shot but hes got the advantage over the top and hes got that midrange game and the shortest guy on the bench is saying too small thats awesome just a ear drive at home the things I pay attention to why it is always fun to call a game I zero John crisen Im John shrien I had zero court Vision as a player but I see everything as an analyst and most of the time its the things that have nothing to do with the game here chuku gives Miami a fourpoint lead how did this game shift like this its really simple one team became the aggressor and its likely due to the fact that they had hope their defense has been really good I like what theyve done to just limit Burton run guys off the threepoint line Force tough shots and then get out run and be the aggressor on the offensive end Davis drag that pivot for there theres a travel I mean if you just do one thing and just follow team energy like like I feel like theres an energy right like New York style energy where people say oh New Yorks got an energy about it well what is that its hard to Define but you feel it you can feel it between the teams theres one team playing with a good energy the other TW teams try to figure it out my excuse me Notre Dame had a 13point lead 3 minutes in into this second half Miami started to slowly chip away and now stop after stop its the Hurricanes up by four and theyre going to the free throw line defensively being locked in being disruptive by kind of switching things up talking about junk defense its been Matthew Cleveland staying on Marcus Burton show Zone stay with Cutters theres just a lot of things that disrupt your Rhythm and Notre Dame hasnt really been able to figure it Music out chuku missing the front end that one and one Miami on a N9 nothing run right Applause now Burton trying to put an end to it and he does go high off the glass its a tough finish and typically throughout the game someones been present to at least show and slow him down thats how he had a clean Applause line under five minutes to play in this second half Applause Music Applause schs badly misses out but its Johnson on the offensive glass an interesting lineup see where the offense comes from if it doesnt go through Cleveland Cleveland staying catch ready hes on the far side of the court on the wing right now Johnson with a hand in his face and its Miami trying to get to the 50 50 but a nice job by shrewbury getting on the deck its almost my one criticism of Matthew Cleveland is is not making a point to go get the ball Burtons dangerous pass stays with under Applause Dame Burton with 17 points to lead the way for the Fighting Irish and a reach and foul called against Schwarz what a ball game this is brewing into here in Miami Hurricanes up two thats brutal when you look at it it really is 20 straight games in the ACC 10 in one season is is as tough as it gets theres a lot to overcome and you got to think you just got to continue to build on this hope Davis out of the timeout throws it down what a set from Notre Dame you know one teams come out of some timeouts not an A and theyve executed well the other team just fell apart I mean no communication out of the Timeout on the defensive end and you give up an easy dunk when typically Miamis done a good job fighting in this one we got a ball game weve got energy in this place and a lot of Hope for Miami well its been a Tail of Two hals for Miami turned it over in the first half and then taken care of the Rock in the second and thats why were all tied at 57 all tied it and clearly upset about what they did coming out of the timeout kind of a reactionary time out considering the tight game situation well see if they need that one back kid with the hook and a foul is called as Notre Dame cant believe Music it l kid is kind of a throwback because he has that ability to play in the post when you dont see many true post players in college basketball no typically theyre theyre floating around the perimeter nowadays and picking pop whether they shoot 10 from three or or 50 from three our ESPN NBA Sunday double header starts in Phil he got Tyrese Maxi in the Sixers hosting Jason Tatum Jaylen Brown in the Celtics at six Eastern and The Grizzlies take on Giannis and the Bucks you can tune in on Sunday night Tyrese Max he is a great watch by the way great watch not a lot of dudes in the NBA play with his energy especially regular season time regular season now he goes one point lead for Miami as we approach three minutes to play here in this second half Burton with a bigger Johnson on him gives it up shot clock winding down again its at three tough fallway for a locko you know Johnson did a great job its something really small but these are the plays who win games when Burton gave it up Johnson didnt let him get it right back brilliant simple stuff heres kid on the Block goes to the spin move is left and left it short still think Cleveland needs to be involved more hell impact the end of the game he needs to be involved Burton hes got the mismatch now against kid they give it back to him kid at 61 going against Burton at 6 foot he will launch a three do you like that shot not particularly but they didnt know what they were doing so they settled late tried to run shuberry off to see if get somebody to commit created just enough space to get the shot off but its not the one you want chuku dumps it back to his big man and it rolls in for kid feel like Matthew Cleveland at times is just playing decoy no ones leaving him 15 points for kid now guarding the post as Cleveland takes it Applause away and a time out Miami as they want to talk it over to get a quality shot up by three dont go anywhere were back in just 30 seconds Music live first we are here at the U and this place is rocking right now you would not know they have lost 10 games in a row no good good for these people good for the kids on four good good for the coaching stats theyre putting it together at the right time I mean good execution Matthew Cleveland said it hes kind of playing decoy I dont know if I really like that but if youre able to get high quality shots so be it nobodys leaving Matthew Cleveland he will absolutely impact the rest of this game if you let him score that didnt even get a touch Miamis done a good job on on the other end defensively taking Marcus Burton out of it sometimes its been the switches really again its disruption through different approaches like sometimes its a switch sometimes its a big on them the guards on them sometimes they face guard Matthew Clevelands cover I I think the switching things up like that has been very disruptive its been a scoring drought for Notre Dame over two minutes since theyve scored and Miami up by three under 90 seconds to play in the regulation heres Cleveland off the handoff leaning in and that was good d by alako where do you go now if you Notre Dame its got to be through Marcus Burton but you got to use Shrewsberry Shrewsberry is your spacer you got to rely on the space he can create Michael Shrewsberry needs to get a good one and hes been trying to get the timeout and the reason why hes upset as a coach youre trying to get the timeout before you turn it over and I think thats why he was upset he didnt get it when he when he wanted it granted were right in front of him so he does get the timeout called both teams with one timeout remaining 106 to play you know we talked a lot about what this game means to Miami but how about what it means for Notre Dame theyve won their last two against Virginia and Georgia Tech this win would bring them to 500 here in the ACC no its its this season yes but its also kind of what youre building its its hope for next year with a good young class coming in its building upon what youve got guys that are going to get better and better as the season goes on but I feel like theres far more pressure on Notre aame than there is on Miami even in a close game situation and look Miamis had a lot of ugly ones some some real blowouts I get it its tough but theyve been fighting tonight their game plans been good theyve executed well at least well enough and now theyve got an opportunity to pull one out break the break the streak Mah shrewbury right in front of us after calling that time out lets see what he drew up for the Fighting Irish well theyve been good out of timeouts and Miami struggled on the defensive end under a minute to play Burton trying to go to work Blows By His man but he blows the tire and throws it out of bounds turnover and and that almost seems like the old Marcus Burton he was going too fast and you got to think in a situation like this you tend to revert to old plays he just got sped up a little too much out of control all right lets see if Miami can handle this full court pressure luko goes down no whistle kid to inbound and heres Mr reliable Matthew Cleveland gives it up ugu 10 on the shot clock Applause Schwarz a tough step back three tipped out of bound and its going to stay with Miami look at the hustle from ly kid theyre theyre going to look at it is that certainly what we do but ly kid really working on that possession he was in play is under he could have taken a shot earlier hes pretty open he ends up kicking it back out but it really worked to get himself back into rebounding position talk about the energy the the energy on the Miami side has been really good and you have to take into consideration all the variables theyre in right the struggles the not having your coach that you started the season with theres so much there that you just cant comprehend as to how challenging this is for everybody and then losing games I mean losing d games becomes kind of contagious you know winning games can be infectious its a good thing contagious bad but the thing that Miami staff continues to talk about will you show up with the effort on a nightly basis despite whats happening you know youre not really going to be defied by your circumstances in the end itll be how you handle and manage and fight through your circumstances and your realities and I give this Miami team a lot of credit I think they got the call right here if Im throw an opinion in there you think thats off Notre name yes there it is Music looks like a hand of chai yep what did we do in the 80s thats what I want to know just get everything wrong all the time cross confirm Miami basketball its like did people just come in off the streets too this place filled up I they feel like word got out theres a chance here guys guys look you you got to give these kids I cant say enough man God bless them for fighting Miamis got to get it in and they do to Schwarz Notre Dame looking to trap every opportunity and the foul will be given up and I like that play right you you trap as hard as you can to try to get the turnover but at some point you got a foul and kind of a good review for Miami theyre down to one time out they took that timeout just after the under four they gave up a basket called a quick one theyre down to one timeout they got a nice little break there on that review talk through things big free throw from uku makes this a two possession game The Freshman from Sugarland Texas getting a lot more playing time and he owes one of two fourpoint Applause game and a foul before the shot as Music Miami what the presence of Mind Marcus Burton seeing the fouls coming going for the shot believe Caitlyn Clark pulled that off for like a fourpoint play too if youre Notre AED you need a three here no you just need to score Applause quickly they get it into Applause Shrewsbury aako and he is bailed out with a foul that is a tough one I mean you got to know right youre up four the one thing you cant do is foul a threepoint shooter I dont know where it was where was the foul oh thatll eat your heart out thats if youre a Miami fan is that a ball dont lie moment right there is rased Wallace somewhere out there just streaming yep now if youre Miami you got to know your situation right you got one time out after this next free throw he misses both oh Lord Alo a 78 free throw shooter has missed the first two of three Miami communicating at the line the box out and he missed all three of them unbelievable turn of events wow now I really I dont think he got fouled on the shot but but to miss all Applause three now if youre my yeah you want to use these free throws right now you got to talk about yeah uku comes over just talk about what you need him to do be cautious of fouling prepoint Shooters Cleveland will go to the line his first free throw attempt of the night the other thing is if youre Miami you dont want to wait on the other side of the Court you you want to get up 34 Court not allow a clean drive or a long pass up the floor with the clock stop see bring a couple guards up just to show some token pressure if you want to call it that change directions take time off the clock and and right now you got to be talking about guys we have a timeout if we need a timeout we got one so the officials went to the monitor to check the clock and theyve added time back on theres now 11 seconds on the game clock what a game from Matthew Cleveland now leaves all scorers with 20 points and he has not forced it tonight no not at all if anything I I wish he did get up cant allow the roll sixpoint game Notre Dame needs a quick one corner ji with a three missing everything and thatll do it Miami will end a 10g game losing streak as interim head coach Bill Courtney gets his first win here at Miami 6357 over Notre aame
