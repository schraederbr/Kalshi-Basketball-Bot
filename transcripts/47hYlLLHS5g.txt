shot the ball well enough and picked up a giant win absolutely and when you consider the fact that they only scored 54 points and were able to win that shows the maturity of this North Carolina team and were underway as Miami wins the opening tip this is a battered and bruised Miami team down a couple of starters into this game its going to be straight uphill they may need a miracle and it might start with that guy nor Chad omir who comes in averaging 17 and 10 I can remember nor Chaz oms best game in a Miami uniform he scored 33 points at noted Dame and the game started exactly like this one did look out this could be a big performance for omir who is playing against another preseason First Team all ac they got down the lane Sweeping in cant connect Miami at 15 and 13 without the services of wuga poppler and Nigo Pac two starters they combined for almost 28 a game Cleveland going airborne cant hit it and Elliot could comes out of the pack with it to trigger the break and lets see whats up with RJ Davis in this game thats a great way to start as you look at the starting lineup for North Carolina and Davis was just one for 14 against Virginia so hes already equal that Bott locking up defensively heres the kick out for Cleveland long one coming for Miami and off the front of the iron that one fall for Watson Christian Watson getting a chance to start this game because of all the injuries Im still looking talking about the fact that RJ Davis answered your question you wanted to see whats up with RJ and he showed you really quickly yeah it took about 4 seconds averaging 21 points a game and the guy for both of our money is going to win Player of the Year in this conference despite a rough day on Saturday heres Ingram from the corner and cant hit it and its tapped to Cleveland Matthew Cleveland after a bout with food poisoning getting back in the lineup the last game but its just been a Dreadful Health situation for Jim Lena he just cant get a starting lineup on the floor day after day otherwise you really have to wonder what kind of year would have been for Miami yeah this Miami team had a lot of expectations coming into the season but this is now 11 games in ACC play where they have missed at least one starter in the starting lineup and unfortunately for the canes there actually two starters here tonight that wont make him start this game oh thats a time and thats ran from the corner and out he had a great day on Saturday at 18 points he hit six threes Ingram close and that wont drop big battle for the rebound and a save for the canes and here they come oh confidence right there for Bo Shores pulling up on the break man this is a young man who has played his way most likely to an all rookie performer in the ACC this season OB 40 from three is Ryan feeling it hes really shooting the ball a lot better lately lets talk about whos confident right now quarterback Ryan is the guy thats confident right now OB he is 14 of 27 in the last three games from Beyond the threepoint Arc and of course he was the leading scorer against Virginia with those six May threepoint fi go heel spans love the timing right as we close in on the NCAA tournament first the ACC tournament but theres George again you wonder why the NBA Scouts flood to the Arenas that hes playing in absolutely OB and you and I were on the call for when Miami went to Virginia and kesan George turned his ankle 3 minutes into that game Miss remaining 37 it was a bad performance and that started the losing streak for Miami but hes playing with a lot of confidence right now no omir with the rebound he gets 10 a game hes on the attack trying to drive it inside and a good stop there 1619 to play here in the first half the theme of the day could be the three be as a matter of fact all five field goals have been made from Beyond a threepoint Arc for both of these teams corack Ryan knocking one down and key Kean George knocking down his second three already to start the game hes got a world of talent upsides tremendous for George he had 16 against Georgia Tekken a loss on Applause Saturday L cadir banging banging on bot no did you see the difference between being 611 and being 67 North Shir just as strong as Armando Bott if not stronger but the length of Bott still is allowing him to defend that opportunity Brian open again at this time and tipped to Cleveland who wants to start a break here for Miami Miami just 6 and 11 in conference play hopes were so high this year but the injury bug has been devastating Davis working that Baseline what a quick step on the reverse a right by Matthew Cleveland but I love the fact that RJ Davis didnt fall in love with the three he recognized that there was no one there but behind Cleveland to help once he beat his man as a great offensive player youre never concerned about the guy in front of you is whos behind him to help Watson giv off for Bley Joseph gets himself an open look and its in and out rebound fought for and Pat Driscoll had the right call here it was a deflection definitely 157 to go here in the first half RJ Davis after a quick start after bad day on Saturday and for more lets toss it to Angel guys RJ Davis has been the tone Setter the floor General and the constant for the tar Hills this season and while we praise his ability to be a bucket we must also look at and acknowledge the work that he has put in to become the accs leading score he told me Ive been patient throughout my career this year it is his time and he didnt want to leave having any regrets of what could have been so in the summer he adopted 6 am M workouts with the manager he loved the results so much that he continues those workouts today yes even now when they had back to backs he said we change it to 9 this morning because of him wanting to balance being a student athlete he said after the Duke game he realized he was sped up now he understands the es and flows of the game when and where to attack guys hes prepared for the moment and hes owning it he absolutely is at RJ forgive me angel and one thing he did not say was that it was his team because it was fortunate when Armando Bott told Coach h hey Im recognizing this its RJs team now coach Davis told Aro wait it was never your team in the first place for you to give it to RJ how are you doing that this is our team little regifting there out the Baseline here Bon on the spin and pushed fouled here against Miami itll go against noo the 610 freshman see the bench for the Miami Hurricanes Nigel pack wiga poer both sitting in Street close and of course youre talking about 28 points per game missing but not just that the threat of Nigel pack shooting ability often opens up so many other things for his teammates got a great look cesy of Bon and North Carolina grabs the lead and Nigel pxs missed four straight games he missed one all of last year nor Chad oir missed only one game last year that was the Duke loss these two guys out a giant blow for Coach Lara the odd thing about Miami is they havent had a single sub get hurt all the starters well we dont want that to happen we dont want anyone getting hurt indeed the slam Theo getting three underneath the big freshman yeah nice job by benley Joseph attacking the paint getting into the lane and finding the wo and one thing about this Miami team regardless as to whos on the Flor theyre going to compete this team has not packed it in air Mill by Withers right to Bott though no reset of the shot clock of course its down to eight Davis who hit a quick shot goes Airborne for two more D has s RJ Davis attacking the paint and he has a great middle game thats one of the areas where hes improved his game of course always been able to shoot the three but what he does when defense run him off the threepoint line has been SP for this year Cleveland making a move denied by Bott who sealed him tend to get off a shot around the back Joseph heres George George backing away shot C down to four to the paint no rebound for Withers to trigger the break here for North Carolina OB but you hear the Ovation from the North Carolina faithful based upon the defensive style theyre going to say no basket and wave that off so no hoop as Bon took the shove in the back on his way to the 10 aoko second foul Jim ladega 740 career wins and since he came to Miami hes won know six or seven times combined at Duke and North Carolina nobodys won more on the road against those two than Jim Lena has up against Hubert Davis year number three at 21 points a game his star Davis averages rings the bell thats what Hubert average his senior year here for North Carolina I played against Hubert that year he was a bucket and that North Carolina team was amazing but of course it seems to be that all those Dean Smith North Carolina teams were amazing Iron and here comes Trimble with Applause itth Carolina trying to get on one of their patented runs so far Miami has kept them at Bay Ryan with a three Obie thats what Im interested to see how does Miami respond to those runs you know whats going to happen here in Chapel Hill but how does Miami respond when it does happen home going to work and the foul will go the other way thatll be against Miami and number one for NORAD jayen Withers has had this battle before the only thing is he did it in Louisville uniform a season ago now going up against NORAD oir and understands omir is going to play like a bull in a China shot just body in great guarding position takes the contact and goes down picking up the offensive F well hes seeking out contact all the time thats his game in the corner Withers to the Baseline a blocking foul thatll take us to a timeout 1156 to go here at Chapel Hill in the first half and atar heels by two were in the security business your reserves that Jim Lea had coming off the bench a season ago so with the injuries that theyve sustained this year now the guys coming off the bench and giving quality minutes are freshman and sophomore who havent played many minutes the swing to Ryan for a triple A big rebound there by Withers he earned that one the 69 gra out of Charlotte and we talk a lot about cormack ryant and especially Harrison Ingram but we forget often times about Jaylen WIS and what he has been to this North Carolina team he singlehandedly was one of the main reasons why they won the game against his former school and Louisville and there he is once again making a play just trying to box out and picks up the foul on AJ Casey getting possession back from North K on so its Carolina by for Casey picking up number one North Carolina only shot 32 on Saturday but they held Virginia to 28 including 177 in the first half but I thought the difference in the game down the stretch was the offensive rebounding that Carolina did particularly AR bad five and thats a staple of North Carolina basketball as is scoring quickly as Elliot K gets to the basket able to make an acrobatic shot but one of the things youre always going to see from North Carolina one they leave the ACC in rebounding but offensive rebounding as long as Armando Bott is on the floor is always going to be a tremendous threat foul off the play off the ball with 1053 left in the half willll go against Carolina coming up next on ESPN we will take you to Fort Worth Texas number 15 Baylor squaring off against TCU thats following our game here on ESPN foul on Seth tremble Taylor going down this weekend to a tough Houston team who is now entered number one in the country and of course anytime you think about Houston at number one and not that they havent been there before since but always takes me back to the F lamama Jama boy look at this and with a shot clock almost to zero George flipped it up there very casually and gets the basket you gun didnt fall very far spite a big loss they shouldnt they absolutely should not I mean again for them to drop down one and it wasnt like they got blown out by a bad team they got beat ex top the right team as well to win knocked around controlled by Miami Cleveland out of the pack with it wants to drive it all the way no North Carolina defending that 10 on the other end heres Ryan stepping in and finally a whistle there thatll go the other way thatll be against corat Bryan kesan George getting it done on both ends of the floor picking up the offensive foul stepping in front of corm Ryan but offense I ly going back to the days of ice a little bit of finger roll there but you got to get you got to get more Loft on that and a little more flick of the rist to make it the ican type nobody did it like George absolutely not Im not sure you know everyone wants to talk about today players are more skilled I dont think they have watched what guys in like George gerin were doing you you cant what Kareem Abdul Jabar was doing come on sky hook Julie serving I mean to be able to finger roll in the paint like that but that that is funny to me when you talk about guys are more skill than those those guys were certainly artists Joe B kicks out for Joseph nice fake to get himself open and sticks it drains a three Bley Joseph has stepped up significantly for this Miami team as of late becoming more of a scorer but when you play against the heels you have to get back defensive transition is so important they score within the first three to four seconds of the shot clock J Davis going off nine points early quite a recovery took just a few seconds short with his jump shot last time they met earlier this season Davis went off for 25 against Miami looking for bacot but thrown away right in the hands of Joe Bay heres George again around the back George wants to heave up a three got it hes having himself a time here Obie this is the first time he George has played in Chapel Hill and hes enjoying himself Angels got more on that absolutely hes playing free just going back to him being an international player from Switzerland he talked about the differences in life overseason now he said back home I had to wash my own clothes finding his own meals and finding different ways to equip his body for competition he said as a student athlete at Miami there are a few more hands on deck to make sure most of that checklist is handled coach slga said theres no secret why NBA Scouts are coming to see him perform hes smart he has a different level of maturity and overall Pro with everything he approaches guys were seeing it but Angel you lost me when you said wash his own he doesnt have to wash his own clothes anymore is that a is that a perk of being a a college athlete now I would say so I mean I I do not want to wash clothes at all and to go back home to think about it now is really scaring me so I would think so Ive been washing my own clothes for about 25 years 25 a a long long time thats all 25 cuz Ive been watching mine for over 30 so Im trying to figure out how that works and we need to stop whining heres Davis and that foul will be against North Carolina underneath theyre going to get Arondo Bott on that one and Obie I can tell you over the last four plus Seasons officials have told me time and time again Alando Bott is one of the most difficult players to officiate in college basketball because he is so physical and often times hes using his body not necessarily pushing but using his body to get in position to come up with those offensive rebounds Miami has lost six in a row as mentioned they are really beating up down two starters tonight but they are with North Carolina step for step here in the first half running into Bon at top screen look at Davis look at the speed on Davis and he cant hit it though kind of lost the handle as it rolled off that right palm and he will flick it out of bounds so it will be Miami ball and we go to timeout all tied up 199 Miami stay right there you know the wrong side of the bubble right now itll be back to you Kevin said thank you very much guys hardest working men in Show Business right there as we check out the ACC standings North Carolina 13 and three duke slipping one back Virginia with six losses Wake Forest with six but Wake Forest in the NCAA tournament Joel lardy says right now we say about time uh I believe that there will be six teams in ACC in the NCAA tournament when its all said and done I would agree but you know when you think about what the pit Panthers are doing but they have a huge test coming up this week at Clemson one of the areas where pit has been so successful theyre six and three on the road this year George lost the handle Davis there to scoop it Davis wants to attack great job defensively by Bley Joseph getting back and defending without fouling oh thats great Hand by do get up RJ Davis finishes I got to boo that one he can dunk it was anticlimactic yeah it was he can dunk but he has 11 points here in the first half oh we know he can score crowd wants to be a factor now here at Chapel Hill theyve got the heels off for three consecutive games beginning Tonight George will back it away now in gets the shot off but it doesnt touch anything he thought he got hit on the hit and no whistle Applause there see if bacock gets involved in the battle between omir and Bott has been a huge one today NORAD omir doing a great job three quarter fronting Armond Bott not allowing him to see any passing L Joseph tried to pull his way through and itll go the other way that foul will be against Miami OT kdo really nice D moment AG go yeah absolutely look at the great Hands by ellot kdo as Cleveland tries to sweep over you see and thats no contact there thats great Hands by Elliot Kad whos able to knock the basketball away six turnovers already for Miami where they have gotten so much better 19 assists only five turnovers again that lost at home to Georgia Tech and that was a area of the Miami struggle for the majority of the Season including tonight in 11 out of 18 ACC games Miamis had at least one starter out so far there at two and eight first 10 Sweeping in again its Davis RJ off to a tremendous start tonight RJ saying open lanes which he did not see at all against Virginia on Saturday Virginia of course playing in the pack line they shut off all those driving opportunities especially when youre at the top of the scir round and out that was in the cylinder 2319 North Carolina bot looking for room nice job there by Joseph to Spring free and steal it and a reach in foul by kdo thats the second or third turnover weve seen trying to get the basketball inside to Bott often times trying to force it inside and we have a womens basketball big Monday match up for you on ESPN 2 number 13 Colorado taking on number eight UCLA coverage begins at 9 Eastern at 600 Music Pacific Miami very much staying connected against all OD so far tonight they bet this guy o inside hes denied but Bott doing a great job defensively outside of the opening threepoint field goal having a hard time getting anything to go against Bott on the inside about bed around and picked up by obir Miami is a good enough shooting team they can hang around all night even with the injuries they hit 46 37 from three in a Timeout Jim ler wanted to talk it over but caus the timeout I think a lot of it also has to do he wants to get Kean George back on the Music floor life diabetes theres no slowing down each day is a unique pickups around college basketball and really North Carolinas had a couple of them in Ingram and Ryan oddly enough both of them spent time at Stanford Hunter Salis Saturday against Duke 29 he had one of the best games of the year in the ACC Joe jard going to Clemson hes made a big difference for a team thats going to the NCAA tournament he absolutely has and hes the guy thats the finisher for the Clemson Tigers where PJ Hall does everything else Joe the guy that finishes it just like Matthew Cleveland finishes a great find from Beyond The Arc that makes it a onepoint Game knocking down now the six threepoint field goal already in this game for Miami Davis a dribble down fires and yes great Touch 16 points for RJ well we knew that he wouldnt go one for 14 again and Miami defensively has not been great this year so I know this is a game where RJ Davis is kind of licking his chops recognizing he could have a big time performance Cleveland little teardrop no rebound by B comes in averaging 15 points 10 rebounds a game he has five so far in this one rich had omir with a personal Music foul and take a look at what he did on Saturday now just 12 points one for 14 shooting it and tonight already 7 for 11 but what was so impressive about RJ in that war for 14 performance even though it wasnt going well for him offensively he didnt force things he didnt get outside of character he didnt didnt take shots he shouldnt be taking he shared the basketball but because of his presence on the floor corm Ryan got a lot of open looks and knocked down six threes which was the Difference Maker between those two teams both teams Obi made 16 field goals the difference was Virginia only made a handful of Threes where cor M Ryan made six alone Davis one of the best foul Shooters in the country rying on the bench right now we had him after the game and tried to pry him loose on Duke and coming down the line and like what about Duke in that final showdown he said all Im thinking about is Monday night in Miami professional answer from a guy thats like 35 years old playing college basketball so no I wouldnt have expected anything different from my Gore M Bryan I love this young man great family got time to spend chance spend time with his father Mike mom rosemary who made the trip from Charlottesville down to watch the game on Monday night as well Joseph with a step back free got it that rattles on and Bley Joseph is confident right now OB hes hes one of those guys hes so competitive hes thinking to himself that the fact that hey okay no theres no Nigel pack theres no W po we still have a chance thats the way benley Joseph is built and hes going to give Miami everything he can a chance to win this game G slams it as he rolls to the iron his first basket tonight but Obie even though the Highlight was bots dump how about the 6 guard Joseph going over time to block it how about Miami 7even out of 11 from three tonight to stay in it down the lane Watson denied by Withers who went for the block kept him away from the basket Bon again turns to the basket but lost it and the crowd howling for a foul but no whistle and hes been raining triples theres another one and another one goes this time by omir but often times when youre out man that is the answer and youve got a number of guys on the floor from Miami weve seen it from omir benley Joseph as well as Matthew Cleveland theyve got a number of guys that can shoot the basketball for fre Kean George still on the bench as he gets up now at the end of the game Davis has the pass blocked and he kicked it out of play so it goes back over to the kanes we talked about how competitive Bley Joseph is even though hes 10 in short hes still going to try it however no avail against B all right Greenberg you know thats why you ask its absolutely a concern if you go back to the game against Virginia Reese beakman went into the paint scored over top of RJ Davis Elliot CAD multiple times is going to be a factor for North Carolina but thats the reason why Hubert Davis has step tremble on the floor right now guarding Kean J Jim L team right there step for step with North Carolina despite missing two starters tonight George is a big reason why the threepointer is a bigger reason theyre 8 out of 12 Miami from the threepoint line four different players have hit a triple they absolutely have but thats the reason why comes back in hubt Davis counters with Seth Trimble who although he may be shorter is stronger than kesan George and presents a different challenge defens omir hooks it up there no rebound picked off by Ingram you know watching coach L at practice today it would be very easy to kind of feel sorry for yourself youre down so many key players youve lost six in a row he was coaching the heck out of the thing at practice there was give No Quarter today as Ryan Slams on the breaks and drops in a short line OB there is no active coach in college basketball in division one that has coached more games than Jim Lara that number is now 1289 he has seen a little bit of everything hes seen the highs hes seen the lows hes not going to get out of character regardless as to who he has out there hes going to continue to coach his team and this is one of the reasons why this gentleman should be inducted into the Hall of Fame this year now in his second year on the ballot Z tremble with the foul pack out tonight naigel pack hes missing out four straight games have popper out as well ruga popper with a twisted ankle hes averaging 14 points a game also unable to go couldnt agree with you more about Jim lener he should have been in the big Hall of Fame a while ago well hes on the ballot this is now so Slam by Matthew Cleveland the second year for Coach Lara on the ballot this year and I dont think taking his team to the final four a season to go hurt his chances at all dont think so two different schools he is taken to the final four K Zips the pass to Ingram open oh think I beat everybody to it its knocked away from him so Carolina will have it Elliot kadoo has now thrown two pinpoint cross the body crosscourt passes to that corner one to cor M Ryan one to as we see Matthew Cleveland coming down the lane with the slam but the passing of K of K has been very impressive Rive oh nice strike on the inbounds to kadoo that was lightning quick and that time kdo moving without the basketball to underneath out of bounds thats a cardinal send on defense you got to take away the middle first never give up a layup Cleveland again really trying to take over offensively hes fouled on the floor said Ted Valentine 436 to go in the half and heres the next Super Tuesday college basketball double header coming away Mississippi State well take on number 16 Kentucky at 700 eastern time then itll be Texas and Texas Tech both games right here on ESPN and the app foul will be on corc Ryan number two Joseph with a crossover Scoops it in for two Hensley Joseph has been the offensive Catalyst as a wait for the Miami hurricanes eight points now for Joseph as hes knocked down a couple of Threes And also attacking the basket challenging The Bigs for North Carolina good back pass here for Davis got it his big half continues with 21 time for one more shot here from Miami before the break they get it in the hands of Matthew Cleveland for three no at the horn it does not go so at the break give Miami a whole lot of credit theyre only down by five and Miamis done it beyond the threepoint AR shot points Miami made only four twopoint shots and did not shoot a foul shot with all the time they spent outside and we saw on Saturday it was actually cor M Bryan who had 15 of North Carolinas first 26 points in that first half against Virginia so theyve seen that production before and youve seen this for RJ Davis gets an easy bucket in the pain so 23 for him already and this is the biggest lead tonight for North Carolina Miami coming out with outstanding energy they got it to this guy George quite a bit hell miss fire here that did not get to the rim I think am Bott got a piece of that one Bott has to get that basketball when he does it defensively and Sprints the floor with Kean George even though hes 68 hes a guard you got how to get bacock the basketball great recognition from poor M Ryan getting the ball inside Jim Lena hopping off that bench and immediately asking for a timeout North Carolina expands the lead 4132 opening seconds of the second Music half a typical Insurance quick timeout for Miami to start the second half because coach Lara said the concern for him in the second half was finding the balance between guarding the The Bigs in the paint for the tar Hills while also finding ways to slow down RJ Davis who had 21 in the first half he said he was Sensational he is setting the pace thats what we talked about at the top of the game but he said right now we just have to find a way and see if we have the depth on our bench to finish at The Rim but also finding ways to defend Miami just hit their ninth threepointer omir burying that one yeah omir hit his third threepoint field goal he hasnt been able to do much of anything on the inter against am bot but hes pick up a foul right here hes knock down three threes in this game already and we had opportunity in the timeout to watch Jim Lena at his best and again you see the smile has Bill Courtney laughing on the sideline again he understands what his team is going through its hard to win in this league in general but even more difficult when you dont have your full compliment of plan last year he had a great team took it all the way to the Final Four and they were a healthy team too incredibly so heres Ryan now a Clank away and the rebound to Miami back Ryan caught the grenade on that one OB shot clock going down you catch it you dont have much choice but to shoot it youll go for just go way down taking those shots didnt finish it but hes a load in there Ingram to Ryan Ingrams open he can nail that and its in and out North Carolinas had some really good open looks is Joseph and hell bury it as he knocks down a twopointer desley Joseph had a solid first half now in double figures with 10 points and North Carolina hasnt been able to separate from Miami we asked what would be the case when North Carolina made that run Miami has responded each time K the back door cut to L nice five from bot and a great screen no help allowing too to get the easy layup with Carolina head has been unable to break away from an injury riddled Miami team tonight the threepointer has kept the Hurricanes there omir trying to drive past Bott who bodies up on him and hell get Bott that was with six on the shot like his second foul Miami having lost six in a row they fell at Coral Gable Saturday to Georgia Tech one of the losses on the streak was to North Carolina two weeks ago that was a very tight game 7572 is the final that was a game where Nigel pack had 18 first half points is oh they went for the dunk through the foul so itll be Matthew Cleveland going to the line where he he makes 80 of his shots and Coach K and Roy Williams Rivals reunited tune in ACC Network thats coming up Wednesday really looking forward to that you just saw coach Williams in the hallway got a chance to talk to ooy outside of the hallway and thats a Wes Durham is actually interviewing both coach Williams and again we got to we got to pause for a second cuz Roy is up because I believe theres chicken on the line here on a Miss free throw not coming yet how about Coach William how about oh but no we got crumble cookies is not chicken it was chicken in the past but how about Roy Williams up on the other side cheering on with the students trying to get everybody cookies has always been a snacker from the corner cant hit it and a whistle and a foul here or they going to just separate these guys yeah but yeah thats a warning there from Ron Gro you know its the stuff that Roy couldnt do what he coached could he couldnt hop out of a huddle and start you know get everybody going about cookies let me tell you what else he couldnt do he couldnt sit down and do an interview with Coach K that wasnt going to happen either so the fact that we have Rivals re United coming up on Wednesday night West Durham interviewing both those Hall of Fame coaches who have done so much within this 8 mile radius of each other two of those Mount Rushmore guys heres omir straight on cant cash in and a foul on the deck we know somebody else who has an affinity for cookies my partner I mean you know Roy and I have shared a couple cookies you know I play for I played for my guy Roy Williams and we we both recognize I love for snack Roys more of a popcorn guy he hes hes more of a popcorn guy right there but you know Im a cookie guy and and you notice how I got caught on camera with the cookies but nobody mentions my partner a good thing too youre a lot slenderer than be in transition heres Ryan to the Baseline and oir with a foul 4338 North Carolina trying to shake Miami but not been able to do it and nor Shadow omir with foul number three though thats an important foul as Michael en noo gets up to check in for NORAD omir and Armando Bott hasnt been able to have much success offensively with omir on the floor Mir done a great job positionally guarding Bott but when you bring in the substitute thats where youre going to see Hubert Davis look to get Bott to basketball heres had a terrific individual season hes been the true star on the inbounds Ingram Kan tried to tip it couldnt get it Mak got a great look thats one hes going to be disappointed with later that he wasnt able to finish go and travel with it a turnover for Miami thats their eighth of the contest if youre just tuning in Miami without two starters tonight and not just any two starters ruga popper and Nigel pack who both average 14 points per game and are huge for Jim Lona unable to go because of injuries but not only is it that you dont have your guys in a starting lineup now youre bringing your reserves of putting them in the starting lineup so you have even less of a bench the bounce for bot working against George nice feed Ryan cant get it to go but he follows his missed for two and and give corack Ryan seven shot clock at 15 Davis trying to pry it free from George who said a really fine night the Freshman he dumps it off for noo Robinson no great defense once again by BOS switching out defending on the perimeter and once again this is where you got to get the basketball inside to the big guy you see his number you see that five he has to get it Bon wants the ball Kido on the spin got three rebound tipped out by Carolina 3538 the tar Hills in front of Miami and coming up on the other side of the break of first for knowledge when we return theres your biggy also a Tuskegee Airman I mean will you consider youre the first I mean 1936 youve got to be the first black player at many places but when you consider that and then also a Tuskegee Airman thats something type of resume to have of course the first black scholarship mens basketball player at the University of North Carolina my God Charles AKA Charlie Scott who is a spectacular performer such a great relationship with Smith here yeah 271 points per game thats all yeah Cleveland I think anybody who AES 271 would have a pretty good relationship with Dean Smith would say so but you know one of the things and I did a a story with Charlie Scott and he talked about danan Smith taking him to church on his official visit at the urging of Coach Smiths pastor and that was the Difference Maker thats what made him choose to come to the University of North Carolina over so many other schools yram will be headed the line little a threepoint play but we also have to mention Charles Scott as we watch Harrison Ingram go to work in the post where he was going to go believe it or not he was going to go play for Lefty Delle until that encounter and shout out to the late great Lefty Delle who passed recently the Hall of Famer but he had he said that he remembered having to make that call to Lefty telling them he was coming to the University of North Carolina and Lefty actually gave him his Blessing and said I think youre making a good decision and guess what he was right he was right he was absolutely right well North Carolina has opened up their biggest lead tonight 28 38 Miami has done really a heroic job in many respects not to overstate it but down two starters to hang in on this floor like this Cleveland with a baseline the scoop shot but no would have been a beauty but didnt fall yeah Miami responded for the majority of this game through these Carolina runs thats what we questioned but foul there as Withers took the hit foul against by Miami so RJ needing to average 212 to be the highest scoring season by a North Carolina guard since Charles Scott right now a 21 points a game on the nose and another thing they have in common both New Yorkers even though charot RJ Davis get a bucket as were talking about his scoring prow Charles Scott a New Yorker actually came to high school at laber prep here in the state of North Carolina which made him available to these North Carolina schools and he talked a lot about coming to the South was also a culture shot for him in the 60s thatll rattle in by Joseph as the threepointers keep coming and thats the way Miami can stay in this game thats how they weather the storm to this point is being able to knock down the three ball theyre going to need much more of that as North Carolina starting to find some Rhythm offens RJ with 25 by the way nearly poke three Ingram picks up goes airborne and its picked off Joseph with the theft Joseph another Music three hell get a second opportunity George thought about getting it right back up there 13 minutes to play oer looking in a pass and a foul on the floor with 8 seconds on the shot clock great decision by recognizing you got the 68 Kean George with RJ Davis trying to defend them in the post you want to give them an opportunity and thats the way you have to attack great scores youve got to make them defend on the other end of the floor you cant allow RJ Davis to conserve his energy and just play offense Daviss first foul and RJ going to get a break now both RJ and Armando Bott on the bench Hubert Davis has trusted his bench a lot more this season than in seasons past tremble back on the floor omir oh tipped again and another whistle and many more fouls here in the second half than we saw in the first half 1246 to play 9 point lead for Carolina we check it with Angel hey guys I was able to catch up with Harrison Ingram before the game and he just talked about how connected this team is he said we are both on and off the court of Brotherhood even in his first year he year here he said he has two best friends on the team I compared it to the game of Connect 4 he said yeah a lot like that but we can get Connect 4 in like four different directions trer Davis said a big part of their success is the buyin Harrison said that he is the light in the room because other people have the Buy in in the locker room as well he said when he was getting recruited they didnt talk about shots they didnt talk about money they talked about winning and everyone is bought into that connected with that yeah I referred to that you know recruiting Ingram as speed dating heres the second shot and he made it so no cookies yet but the North Carolina faithful catching a lot of heat on my phone right now about the three cookies in hand I want to make sure that everyone knows that you did eat one of those cookies though be and it was delicious Ryan cant connect from threepoint land but now I do understand why the The Crowd Goes Crazy especially how they get a hold of the cookies we had theyre done good heres Ryan try to Bull his way to the basket cant finish North Carolina has had many opportunities here to extend this lead omir has to get that youve got Bott on the bench Jaylen Washington trying to defend him and thats easy pickings for NORAD oir when he runs the floor that hard youve got to get him the basketball great decision by Bley Joseph and just like that this is a sixpoint ball game got to remember RJ Davis and Armando Bott sitting on the bench watching some of the reserves try to hold on to the lead taking aim at another double double leads to more boards but he has 14 over the top intended for Washington knocked Away by Miami the give for Cleveland and he lays it in and Miami sticking right there an eight nothing r eight turnovers from North Carina just like that Yuber Davis getting aond Bott back to the scores table will come into this game after the timeout and Miami right now they want to keep action going to see if they can cut into this lead even more Ingram Washington had the rebound in hand lost it Sav there along the Baseline by Miami three here would go a long way OB Bley Joseph is open on this corner kned Away by Ingram he got to it he stayed in bounds and hell lay it in he tipto that line but we highlighted Harrison Ingram and all that he does for this North Carolina team benley Joseph had a wide open threepoint field goal that Harrison Engel took away the opport and turn it into points on the other end George trying to answer checked out by Carolina 35 left and weve got a timeout a momentum changing play Miami had momentum until C the cobwebs we may have to send myy Mark into concussion protocol OB we got to make sure hes okay over there but hes scking in got the thumbs up there you go Mark will carry on hes a warrior Watson bounces up top omir will launch it and missfire there and it had not touched the iron so thats a shot clock violation Only thing would have been better if Mark had jumped up and yelled at Ted Valentine thats a charge you got to call that that would have made it the call come on Ted yes 5246 heres my guy TV Teddy Valentine yeah good crew here with Ted and Ron R and Pat Driscoll working our big Monday North Carolina has been working all night trying to break away from Miami they have been unable to do it the hurricanes have really been deadly beyond the threepoint line they made 10 out of 19 to stay connected and thats the way it has to be when youre under man we mentioned Miami playing without two starters Davis too strong this time benzley Joseph with another rebound opportunity to get out into transition and if youre Miami you want to see if you can score quickly before North Carolina gets back down but of course a great option has always been to get the ball in the hands ofir as well man as he talk when he wants to score it down there hes going to score it he has 13 well hes been able to use his advantage on the perimeter against Bott he hasnt had success against vott in the post but his threepoint shooting and driving off the bounce has given him great opportunity Davis again and he got hit as he attempted a threepointer so RJ is headed to the line and did he hurt that elbow looked like he did Back to omir omir off the bounce really looking as though hes going to go dribble handoff and then recognizing Bott trying to block the shot goes revers uses the glass very well and uses the rim as a screen to be able to keep Bott away from blocking the shot to get the Buckle benley Joseph with foul number four thats a big foul because benley Joseph is really been the Catalyst here for Miami in the second half but its not so bad when youre Jim Lena to put in kesan George when benley Joseph gets in foul TR right three for Davis and coming in next on ESPN we take it to Fort Worth Texas number 15 Baylor squaring off against TCU that is right around the corner number two for RJ hell sink that and another one coming 27 and Counting Obie if you look at Miamis lineup right now there are two guys who started the season as starters for the Hurricanes Matthew Cleveland North chadow there are three guys on the floor as they give up an offensive rebound on a Miss free throw by RJ Davis which is a rarity in itself thats a blocking foul against Miami but there are three guys that have had games where they didnt even wait jakai Robinson and Christian Watson have had games where they dont even get into throughout this season Kean George of course starting the season out coming off the bench hes grown as a player but thats exactly where coach laran and his staff have been throughout this season tremble drives L and draws the foul as well one of the best moves of the night for the 63 sophomore and he has the ability to slash to get to the paint but how about the kn nice SP from Elliot kadot catching kesan George with his back turned and his head turned allowing SE Trumble to get down hill get the bucket the harm and an opport I think weve determined that today you know I will work for snacks so get to hang out with Dicky V at the crib and have snacks watching basketball what could be better itll be trembled to the line here about 9 and a half to go he makes 63 of his file shots more from Wisconsin OB no let me tell you whats going to happen after the game when I walk out Seth Tribles going to be back over with his parents who are in the stands hes going to see me put his head down because he told me he was going to go dunk on somebody I thought he might that last one I thought he was going to and he knows that he has let me down even though he got a major threepoint for good 9 minutes to go to make up for it slapped away Carolina forcing the turnover Kad will lean in blocked by omir that was a great job defensively thats how you guard a two onone perfectly by NORAD omir he never allowed Elliot Kad to have a passing Lane to deliver the basketball to Armando Bok perfect to you see how he stays back and then at the last moment decides to block the shot taking away Bott and denying an opportunity for North Carolina we talk about momentum changing plays thats a huge one where North Carolina could have taken it to a double digit lead and now it opportunity for Miami to cut into this one Ingram picked up foul number three this is about the point in the game over and over tonight weve seen Miami hit a triple and crawl a little bit closer omir again lots of contact with bacon off the fake and a foul on Armando bot and his third and NORAD omir has recognized hes not going to score over top of Armando Bott Bott about 4 in taller has the wingspan but what he is recognizing is that he can get the pump a use his pump aake to get Bott into the air because hes going to try to block the shot and then does a great job using his body to lean in and OB I Im sorry I thought I saw Larry Brown in the STS on that one and again the Larry Brown if the Larry Brown is here on that last replay we showed I thought I saw Larry Brown Behind the basket and I need our our director Griff to make sure he gets a span of the section to make sure that that confirms that is the great Larry Brown another Hall of Famer in the building yeah so much royalty being told it is absolutely 100 true Davis gets a look from triple no sevenpoint game for Carolina Miami just will not go away and once again now this is a mismatch omir has to go quickly great job by CH Trimble itll stay on this end and rightfully so theres my guy Larry Brown they put him on the defensive end for North Carolina in the second half in the cookie section to make sure hes coaching them up from the end zone royalty all over the building weve got Roy Williams on one side and that is going to be North Carolina ball with 87 to go Larry still looks like a million bucks for many many years among NBA coaches ageless but how about the fact that hes back in the student section for North Carolina where he was 60 years ago when he attended the University of North Carolina as a point guard playing for the great Dean Smith whistle on the Baseline and Ted Valentine stepping in 806 to play there it is royalty indeed Robinson with his second foul and one and one time for nor Carolina and Im wondering if my guy re Wallace knows that Larry Brown is in town two people that red Wallace reveres more than anyone the great Dean Smith and Larry Brown who he won a NBA championship with with the Detroit Pistons and he Raves every time he talks about Larry Brown Im interested to know if she even knows that Coach Brown is in town well heck it hes right here in the arena it took us two hours exactly he kind of snuck in on us B CAU front rims that one rebound tipped out and it will be Miami ball both officials Ron Gro and Pat Driscoll were looking at each other and Pat made the call Huber Davis going to try to steal a few seconds right before the media timeout to get Armando Bott out of the the game allowing Jaylen Washington to come in and deal with NORAD Applause omir over here out of the double to Watson had a great look Applause did pble on the attack sucked away from behind by George so its out off Miami 58 to 50 as we come down the stretch we got basketball royalty in the stands all over the place here in Chapel Hill tonight and this ones still up for grabs five for 22 from the three in that game that games coming up top the hour back to you Obie keev thank you very much North Carolina with the ball on the inbounds Miamis come back to earth a little bit from three after scalding it 8 for 13 beyond the line in the first half to two for eight in the second half heres a long one Davis yes 30 on the nose now for RJ and Obie it was a Monday night when they were playing on this floor against Wake Forest we saw RJ Davis go for a career high 36 points he could be an even bigger night tonight Cleveland had it batted back to him little fortunate there omir got another good couldnt bury it but that was a different shot for omir he he questioned that shot its almost as whether he should have taken that or not that one didnt look as fluid as his other shots have North Carolinas been looking for the opening all night heres Davis again yes have they found that opening heres their biggest lead 14 33 points for RJ Davis as mentioned 36 his career high over here on the spin and hell lay it in and draw a contact to hell be head of the line looking for a threepoint play 64 52 our NBA Wednesday double header starts with the Pacers hosting Zion and the Pelicans at 730 Eastern then LeBron and the Lakers squaring off against the Clippers our coverage tips with NBA Countdown at seven amazing OB youve got the Pacers who Larry Brown coached and the Clippers who Larry Brown coached as well but one thing for certain theres only one coach in the history of basketball to win both an NCAA and NBA championship and it is that man right there Larry Brown so that is a major distinction to be the only one to have ever achieve that goal pass Z into Bott and omir will reach in and foul him and thats four nor Chad omir and some fouls are more valuable than others if youre North shadir and I know you do not want to see Armando Bott dunk that however its more important for you to be available for your team youve got to let that one go and try to preserve that foul 610 remaining and this game is not over a 12point lead absolutely can you can come back from that but omir picking up that fourth foul changes his aggressiveness throughout the remainder of this game jod makes 80 at the line 611 grad from Richmond miss the pair only one four from the line tonight though the door is not closed yet on the hurricanes with 6 minutes left everything running through number 15 goes to got it back underneath Watson connects great B from Bley Joseph whos also playing with four fouls so youve got two of the starters for my Amy in foul trouble and theyre two most important players at this stage of the game Ted for bot out off him out off Carolina and its going to be nine turnovers and thats probably the fourth turnover in this game where weve seen North Carolina trying to force the Bott you want to get him the basketball but You got to find the right ankle angle to be able to enter the basketball into the post Joseph turn fire swishes in the three just like that its a sevenpoint game Denley Joseph and nir trying to compete with those four fouls and this is where its tough for Miami on a defensive end of the floor Joseph of 17 at 16 Saturday against Georgia Tech theyre trying to find an answer with all these injuries angram putting a head down LS it up there no Bott will keep it alive bot should just go right at North Shadow Mir hes got four fouls you got to recognize that Davis knocked off bals hits it anyway Im not sure how he has tied his career high with 36 well will be one to 14 on Saturday you knew RJ Davis was going to respond but he may double his average here tonight this could be a 40 plus point game for RJ Davis he does not look like hes going to slow down anytime soon and this is still a game this is not a blowout so North Carolinas going to need his offense down the he wants another triple got it he got another one underneath George will kick outside George fighting for the rebound for the second effort so RJ Davis with 39 a new career high he has exploded tonight coming back here to Chapel Hill he has been Sensational omir will draw the foul before the shot with 348 to go and a 13point lead and as you see the RJ Davis show on display a new career high and hes hit seven threepointers RJ Davis has found his Groove here on his home floor the step back knocking down to three and we saw the Jordan shrug maybe a little bit to his Music teammate expresses his commitment to his journey and respect to his Heroes through ART the young puup looking into his reflection on the pond as more mature version of himself shows how he continues to find himself in understanding who he is also his foundation is standing for something and not being afraid to use his platform for change got that quote from civil rights activist Malcolm X he said that is my idol on there as well is a black panther he said the first black superhero TMC is also a big part of that the marathon continues going by the late nipy hustle so no the marathon is not finished for RJ Davis another career high for him at 39 he is sprinting full steam ahead to make some history of his own guys hes spectacular here tonight 14 out of 27 out of 10 from three in less than 31 minutes 39 points I tell you what the conversation as RJ will go to the free throw line with the chance to become the first player to score 40 in North Carolina uniform since March 12th of 2011 when Harrison Barnes as a freshman went for 40 against Clemson in the ACC tournament but after that one of 14 shooting performance RJs dad Bob called me from across the floor Cory come here I need to talk to you about RJs shooting performance he said oh Im on him hes going to be in that gym tomorrow thats 40 so he has tied the Smith Center record which was set by Tyler hbro 40 on February 15 of 06 and another foul shot coming so on the verge of a record setting night as well and there it is he has 41 John Madre our a stats guy has when you get to 41 points you got to flip the card over to get to that he just flipped it over for the first time and he was excited about that John was happy he got to use that other side of the card its been a long time the other side of the card its a big deal Joseph back out for or for three yes hes shown off his shooting touch throughout this night and hes much more confident in that release that first we saw one where he didnt seem confident shooting the basketball great find by Elliot Kad not getting AC cross thats a violation well the the it wasnt established in the front court so when you look at the shot clock and it says 20 of course 10 seconds have gone off but the basketball had not been caught by Ingram yet great job by the officiating crew keeping their eyes up recognizing that cuz difference once once a SE yeah it doesnt happen often well and you got to be able to determine the difference because they cant have caught the basketball yet once they catch it is already established so a violation 7262 Joseph launching got it and with the threepointers theyre hanging in thats 20 for Joseph and theyre not dead and right now the crowd encouraging to get in the car thats a turnover angram with the travel now heres my concern for North Carolina why is Harrison Ingram bringing the basketball up when youve got not only Elliot kadu whos as fast as anyone on on the floor but also RJ Davis a great ball handler and free throw shooter those are the guys that you want and you see kadu giving the basketball up to Ingram and Ingram traveling on that turning it over once again keeping Miami in this game B it away but whose basketball will it be Driscoll says it stays on this end with 305 to go Miami ball Jim Lenas Team without two star ERS tonight Nigel pack and Wugga popler didnt suit up for the game each of them averaging 14 points a game but theyve got major contributions from other guys 22 points out of their star nor chadow and 20 out of Joseph and thatll go the other way 304 to play thats the nice find and if Bley Joseph can keep this in bounds he would have had a easy layup but you see that right foot stepping on the Baseline another turnover or pressure here from Miami now this is what I want to see just get the basketball to RJ get out of his way allow him to make a play someone should be open when you got two guys guarding one youre going to play four on three on the backside Miami scrambling trying to stay in it RJ Davis a 41point game he slips oh dime got the pass free oh the timeout was called oh time outs and RJ fell on his own so it wasnt as though there was contact he went down on his own but had the presence of mind to drop a dime to Armando Bott and North Carolina called the timeout it looked like theyre about to get a slam done and we were about to have a sports in the top 10 play he goes there down on his own breaks his own ankles however drops the dime Mondos about to drop the hammer and all of a sudden theres a timeout call and we dont make Sports Center OB conversely RJ Davis is so good hes breaking his own ankles tonight 239 remaining North Carolina trying to gut one out here they certainly did that over the weekend at Virginia that was a rock fight Victory 54 to 44 place they hadnt won in a dozen years and they pulled it out on the road and I will tell you this with all that being said I believe look at cor M Bryan yelling for the timeout once he sees once he sees RJ go down calling for the timeout but I can tell you right now if you think about the wins for Hubert Davis this season who is now coaching in his 100th game as a North Carolina head coach Davis got it up there to beat the shot clock Trimble went for the save and could not if you think about the win I can guarantee you that Hubert Davis will say that that win on Saturday at Virginia where they scored 54 points was the most satisfying victory of this season based upon the maturity and the way he watched his team grow up he told us early in the day in shoot round thats not a the game that his team would have won the last couple of years but when they would not allow for North Carolina to score Carolina would not allow vir J score Joseph heating up a three bot battling for the rebound gets it to Davis as we approach the twominute Mark here Chapel Hill North Carolina leading the ACC by a full game over the Duke Blue Devils who fell to Wake Forest over the weekend and its been a night of nights for RJ Davis with 41 points as he dribbles at the logo shot clock to five and scrambling for that was Joseph trying to pick it free but its going to be North Carolina ball with almost no time to shoot it 39 oh when you got RJ Davis on your team 39 is a lot we watched North Carolina shoot around today shooting half court shots theyve also got a number of guys with this in their Arsenal got to say the way RJs shooting it hes within range right now right around midcourt Bott bouncing for Davis heres the shots great look and great execution by the heels to get that look with just 39 on the entry Cleveland to the right no and a foul Ted Valentine did blow the whistle with 140 shot and Davis picks up his second and the right decision by Matthew Cleveland hes got the size Advantage when you have RJ Davis guarding you put him on your back go to the post and try to take him to the rim not only to make him have to defend but also try to pick up another foul when a got this on a heater right now he good foul shooter makes 80 triple out and Kad back on the point guard for North Carolina and Cleveland with another one coming and another important free throw because if you make this Matthew Cleveland you have an opportunity to set up your pressure what North Carolina has struggled with here as of late a number of turnovers forced by Miamis four Court defense theres another one picked off George will turn and fire got it a threepointer yes its Applause 7270 folks inside the building in a bit of a State of Shock over the top for Ryan 118 to go and 11 nothing Run for the Applause canes they out upset screen Davis gives it up in the corner Ingram here it comes he cant hit it Ryan diving for it and cannot save it and its going to be Miami ball with one minute to play the hurricanes with a chance to take the lead here and give Jim lenan his staff a tremendous amount of credit we talked about they were going to compete regardless as to who was on the floor now Miami with an opportunity to tie or even take a lead with a threepoint field goal one minute remaining here at Carolina Miamis last lead was 9 to8 omir Joseph hes had a hot hand all night back for omir Bon guarding up he goes and he cant hit it rebounded by Davis but if youre Miami right here you dont have to foul theres enough time for you to guard you got to get a stop Huber Davis wants a time out to talk it over theres enough time to get a stop and get the basketball back going down to the other end and youll see truly what Hubert Davis thinks about his team and we know whos going to get the basketball is simply about how you get it amond Bott defending dad oir who almost got that one to go however it doesnt go down but still 363 seconds is an eternity in a one possession ball game yeah we look at the reset Miami has the all important possession arrow each side with a timeout coach ler was doing exactly what you were doing saying to his team no fouls you do not have to foul you dont have to foul because you have more than enough time to play this out theres a 17second difference so thats more than enough time if especially if you get a stop if Miami gets a stop most likely we will see coach El Callie timeout to get his team organized as to what he wants and they will go quick but the important part is what is what is Miamis been missing all year is that defensive prowess but Jim Lara is a defensive minded coach I would not be shocked if we saw him change his defense in some way or another and throw a wrinkle at North Carolina that maybe they havent seen thus far in this game in Miami what theyre missing tonight is the other part of the story and that is two huge players in popper and pack unable to play unable to dress for the game and if they come into Chapel Hill against is one of the best teams in the country and they have given North Carolina everything they can handle they have been burying shots over and over again from threepoint land to stay in it all night long OB there are people who actually left the building thinking that this game was over when North Carolina was up 13 that are now outside looking at the monitor you cant get back in they hating from outside the club OB right now theyre having to watch this game on a monitor to see how this one plays out and Miami has absolutely played this last 3 minutes plus as well as you possibly can the 110 run since the last media timeout bigon tying up the shoe I believe he had to switch shoes I think that was the difference Im color blind but he had the pink ones on earlier and now what color those on 363 seconds to play in the game North Carolina with the ball and leading by two as cormack Ryan will check it Applause in Davis outside the three nine to get off a shot and a whistle and thats what you dont want you dont want to send a 90 free throw shooter to the line without having to work for a bucket and jakai Robinson trying to do the job defensively however just a little overaggressive RJ Davis being tended Music to so he may be a little bloody tonight but unbowed 41 points for this man hes also 6 for seven at the line and shooting for North Carolina Music well hes doubled his average now 42 where his average dropped off a little bit he needed to get back to 215 and I think hes probably done that in a major way here tonight hes been spectacular going for 43 points in and out re Davis has it now you have to foul and youve got to foul RJ r is also an excellent foul shooter no foul yet trying to spin out of there you have to foul if youre Miami you cant continue to allow the clock to run down C with it they let it wind all the way down to 88 well they lost precious seconds now lets go back to this Obie NORAD omir has four fouls benley Joseph has four fouls jaki Robinson has four fouls thats why these guys didnt foul but you have to understand at that point that time is more valuable than you being on the floor you have to foul and give yourself a chance especially after you give up an offensive rebound on a free throw so this was a kick ball here never did get the foul and Jim LGA getting people into the line of who can foul so benley Joseph and NORAD oir both coming off the floor so that they can have foul immediately on the catch G to put it in over the top B and hell draw the foul by Cleveland 81 to go amondo a solid foul shooter 80 but only one of four on the evening so hasnt been a good free throw shooting day for Amando Bott has it RJ Davis has missed a couple which we dont rarely see from see from him this is two shots for Bott and the most important thing is just to get one out of this and make it a twopossession game and Miami will take a timeout and thatll be their last with 81 seconds remaining North Carolina trying to pick up their 22nd win I like that timeout by coach lar nean for two reasons one you ice Armando Bott a little more but secondly youre allowing your team to know what what they want to do on a miss or a make simply because you dont want to stop play and allow North Carolina to be able to get to set their defense but the story of this game has been RJ Davis who has been lights out started off the Game knocking down a three on the first offensive possession for North Carolina and he has not slowed down since attacking the back getting to The Rim finishing stepping back knocking down threes over much taller Defenders and when they needed them most RJ Davis got the job done doubling his average on the evening will be not only 21 but doubling up going to 42 hes had the night of nights for himself a career high I dont know what you were thinking coming into this game Miami having lost six in a row you know had every right to have their heads down two starters out of the lineup so many injuries this season to really submarine their season look what theyve done tonight well we know Jim Lena well so we knew they werent going to go away without a fight and Miami has absolutely put up a major fight here tonight but this just shows how good the ACC is it shows you a team that is 61 in the league can come into on into the home court of the team that is at the top of the league right now and make this a game without two of their starters it shows you the great teams the great coaches in this league and thats been a great example of that here this evening with Jim LGA staff yeah we look forward to the ACC tournament you and I will be there in Washington DC this year it begins March 12 running through the 16th so itll be Bott at the line with 81 seconds to play in the game and hes shooting two and that clangs off the timeout work he misses the first one now this is the important one right here Miami knows exactly what they want to do offensively off of a miss and they have to go they have to take a three Miami out of timeouts he missed the pair omir has it heres Joseph and a reach and a whistle of five seconds to go thats a great foul by Bott to slow down benley Joseph of course North Carolina cant get their defense set on that possession and with North Carolina being a such a great rebounding team you dont necessarily fear giving up the offensive rebound yeah bigot is filed out thats number five and with five seconds to left benley Joseph go Bley Joseph will go to the line but hu wants to get his entire team over to the sideline and take full advantage of this 30 seconds that he has for the substitution but if Im Hubert right now I want to make sure I get jayen Washington and maybe even Zaden High into the game to make sure we get this rebound Joseph a career high 21 points hes an 84 foul shooter another one on the way trying to make this a onepoint gain looks like Miamis going to try to make this free throw no they dont they Tred to miss it this the rebound to tremble and a foul 7371 that was missed intentionally you saw Matthew Cleveland them back way up to try to crash in to come up with the offensive rebound on that possession great job by Seth Trumble getting in the mix picking up that board I was shocked that we didnt see Hubert Davis go with a bigger lineup to secure that rebound recognizing that Miami was going to try to miss that free throw you can see the difference in the Arc of the shot for Bley Joseph he wanted to put that higher to give it a chance to bounce off the rim Seth Trimble doing a great job coming in and gring that rebound trible North Carolinas best on the ball Defender not a big score 63 at the line off the back iron and this door still open even if you make this free throw youre North Carolina Miami still can go down theyve shot the three extremely well all evening long they can still get a good look and weve got to also mentioned Matthew Cleveland has a number of game winners and game tires under his belt throughout his career yeah back in his days in Florida State Trimble with foul shot number Music two and miss the ball oh rebound knocked around and a whistle with 26 to go OB I go back to the shoot around before the Virginia game when Miami went to Virginia and Jim leega told his team not to practice bad habits and he was telling them that on free throw box outs and you see jayen Withers going right around kesan George on a free throw box out which will end up most likely sealing this game for North Carolina Bou number five for nor Chad omir who had such a strong game Bon of course out as well Jaylen Withers stepping in the 69 grad to grab a huge rebound and draw the foul the transfer from Louisville and how about North Carolina who makes more free throws than anyone in the ACC 18 free throws a game 10 of 19 from the free throw line Withers around 80 second half North Carolina just eight out of seven at the line threepoint game another one coming and the way this game is gone this hu Davis takes the timeout if jayen Withers makes this free throw I would back completely away line my team up on the sideline as crazy as this thing is gone you dont want to put yourself in a position to where you foul a threepoint shooter possibly give him four Hubert right now trying to figure out if hes going to foul or not lets check in with Kevin the studio Beach just want to remind our audience underway right now in the Big 12 it is Big Monday Baylor TCU currently about 3 minutes into the game they are tied that game again on ESPNU when we have a final in Chapel Hill well pick up the action from that game of the Big 12 back to you well 26 seconds away perhaps North Carolina with a threepoint lead at the foul line another free throw coming for Jaylen Withers Just made the first after AUM giant rebound North Carolina trying to squeeze out a hard cought victory over a Miami team that has really played a terrific game under really difficult circumstances Withers for number two they made the pair I completely get out of the way Hubert Davis telling his team dont foul Im not even contesting passes at this point you can have inbounded for Watson hell he it and cant hit it thats the ball game North Carolina wins it 7571 they beat Miami on a big Monday our player of the game without question RJ DAV
