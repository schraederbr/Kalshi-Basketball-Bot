tip and lets see if we do this again we are going to do it again a packed house of course man of the students ready to Roar you say when are they not but they are in particularly high volume here tonight and a welcome sign for the Blue Devils to be back home after two consecutive games on the road James will drive it lost the handle knocked away from ham in a turnover thats something the wol pack does well they can force turnovers will bounce that one but they going to turn it over on the line right back over to Duke now thats an early turnover for Michael oconnell who been 15 of his 18 games this season has had one or fewer turnovers so hes at his limit only turns it over once every 36 minutes per game and they turn it over less than any other team in the conference less than 10 per game they only had six on Saturday but they lost that game against SMU and a whistle and a tie up and a foul in the paint and immediately against NC State and Jaden Tay the 64th senior as he picks up number one capacity crowd here 9314 at Music Cameron and Duke to put it in play from the Applause Baseline wwatch hes going to go strong and up and out he just went in full attack mode and Obie you and I done a number of games here in this seems to be K malawat is the guy that normally breaks the seal on the basket theyre always looking for him but this one a little more conventional he was just an outlet on underneath out of bounds play but shows his ball handling ability to get the first Deuce Marcus Hill averaging 13 points a game a little too strong around it out rebound tipped malaw going down hard trying to save it but couldnt do it we watched the Blue Devils work on their underneath out of bounds play K malawat is just supposed to be the outlet however as Ben metal Brooks over plays it it gives malaw an ability to a lane to drive right through to get the first basket of the game o conell try to bounce it in does for Taylor he and Hill the only two to average double figures for NC State they have a lot of trouble scoring but that ones going to be swished in by styles on the money and one of the things you constantly see is everyone gets their Duke gets everyones best effort so we talked about the slump shooting for NC State but you see dant style knocking down the first three ball of the game for the pack K giving it up for James dke coming off a hard fought victory in Winston Salem on Saturday against W Forest poked away and the steal by NC State thatll be flipped up off the backboard no good by Taylor looking for a second effort and Hill has it knocked out of his hands and itll be Wolfpack ball Cooper flag with the turnover had seven turnovers against Wake Forest in the road game on Saturday but does get back defensively and affect the opportunity by Taylor not allowing him to have the easy look nice save by styles on the sideline that out the free jumper for okell and thats an area where Michael OK conell can actually help this wol pack team he can be more aggressive on the offensive end showing his ability to shoot the basketball flag will lifts cant connect on the first one Mala CH and no as middle Brooks takes down the rebound hes their top rebound only five a game c Hill shot down by Kipper on the spin Nifty move there off the window no middle Brooks kept it alive they swing for Taylor Taylors jumper and a rebound picked off by Tyrese Proctor Proctor had a tough shooting day on Saturday just two for 12 kiple wants the three in and out certainly the shot he wants got a good look on that possession ring it out and canle on the last time on this floor had a career high 25 points against Miami six of eight for three so hes happy to be back in the Comforts of Cameron flag back for Proctor flag averaging 20 a game and eight rebounds as well and one of the conferences top passers among the many skills that he possesses at the tender age of 18 cck there with the drive Airborne tough shot spun it up there no and numbers now for NC State Taylor leaning in flag got back and defended really well he kept that from turning into a layup and canle in the paints and hell draw the foul 1637 to go here in the first half but weve seen NC State with some Stout defense early and Kevin ke talk to us hes happy with their half court defense and the way that they played as of late its just been about their inability to make shots especially from three thats where theyve struggled and doing a good job to start this game off against the blo Devils especially to be in this building where Duke draw so much energy from their crowd yeah just a couple of early points the foul went Connell as kpp drains that one excellent foul shooter 85 and Mason Gillis into the game now for John shy is coming off a hugely important performance on Saturday against Wake Forest he was really money not just shooting the basketball he hadit a couple of huge shots but he calmed everybody down in a in a really tough environment and what John sh talked about was hes played in environments like that before youre talking about a young man who played over 140 games in college played a national championship a season ago so its not much thats going to Rattle a guy like Mason Gillis and he had three huge threes in that comp come back Victory on Saturday they sure did Ice waterer Applause Music there Paul mcneel into the game for the Wolfpack hes probably their best shooter wearing number two on the line and theyll turn it Applause over and their second turnover and again they had just six on Saturday against SMU even though they dropped that game tell you what you turn the other guy over 15 times and you only turn over yourself six times you usually win that game nine out of 10 times yeah and thats what the area of concern for Kevin ke because thats the key to their defense is turning to other teams over and getting out in transition finding those fast break points tipped out theyll keep it and weve got a timeout Duke off to a choppy start offensively 54 NC State and we welcome you to a big Monday thanks for being with us tonight here at Cameron Indoor Stadium Dave OBrien alongside my partner Cory Alexander and Myon medf as well the place packed to the gills as it always is 536 consecutive sellouts at Cameron indor the students are ready were ready and Duke has been nothing but ready theyre a perfect 9 and0 in conference play Cory theyve won 13 straight games theyve won 13 straight games and theyre ready let me tell you who else is ready OB its the m its the parents you can see Kelly flag as Cooper flag is getting it done on the floor Kelly who coached Cooper in travel basketball is still coaching from the sideline as she Taps her husband Ralph who also has spent a lot of time with his son on the floor and Kelly into the game standing up in the Huddle right now trying to make sure she can be an extension of John Shire on the bench into the game barely touches it right because they are into every second and and still coaching their son from the stands up there a couple of great folks from the state of Maine wonderful people John sh was talking about this at a shootaround today he said I got the greatest group of parents I have ever had ever had they are tremendous they actually root for the other players on the team he said Ive had Parents whove done that before but every every one of them does it now yeah we talk about Kelly flag but you also got to consider tajma gangba shes coached the game she coached at Georgetown recently left coaching Georgetown shes her son patch on the team then you think about of course Sher kiple as well as her husband Khan who both were great players at the college level you and here as well rooting on their son but one of the things that John sh talked about with his parents is they dont invade the privacy of this team they root for each other however they dont get in the inner sanctuary of what is helping this team be successful so a lot of stuff is clicking obviously for Duke just about everything is these days but that was a hardfought win that was a difficult win win on Saturday against Wake Forest Wake had him up against it the crowd was really in full throat they had a tremendous crowd there in Winston Salem but they pull it out in the end you know Cooper flag was terrific when he had to be down the stretch even though he did turn it over seven times Third Man on our crew tonight Myra beaf Myra what do you got you know John shy talked about Cooper Flags leadership hes concerned about the turnovers 15 in his last three games but he said he does all the right things and when your best player does all the right things it affects the entire culture of your program and he said that is coer flags greatest asset that hes a great leader on and off the court fellas 24 points s rebounds six assists the question tonight is can NC State do some of the things that weight did defensively to get in there against Cooper flag and try and Shake him up a little bit seven seven turnovers is seven turnovers yeah and Kevin ke SP play to us theyre going to go after him not just Cooper flag but theyre going to go after the Blue Devils because they have have to be able to turn Duke over and use those turnovers and turn him into points on the other end of the floor but you get a chance to see Cooper Flags number lead the ACC in scoring in conference play at 23 points per game field goal percentage is up threepoint field goal percentage is up and lets just also mention that he turned 18 just over a month ago so most of those games have been since his 18th birthday they say you become a man at age 18 he might have been one before but hes definitely showing hes grown up since Gillis cant hit out of the inbounds and and will pack have it theyll swing for Styles will drop that one in another one hes hit a couple of Threes early yeah dant Styles knocking down two threes and he struggles shooting the basketball as well but in the starting lineup he matches up with Cooper flag very well when you look at the the starting five on the floor J with the starting lineup brought to you by CDW Cooper flag 20 points a game kle getting 13 Proctor 11 defense has certainly marked this successive Duke though they can take that everywhere in an excellent passing team too thatll rattle home for flag as it drops in that was a pretty good job by mcneel not allowing Cooper flag to get past him however Cooper flag able to gather the basketball and knock down the jumper as we see the five on the floor for the wolf pack Paul mcneel getting early minutes the highly talented freshman for Kevin Keat starting to find his way into the rotation W pack does not have a proven Big Time score so ke is looking for any answer he can get as Huntley Hatfield scores that game in averaging eight points a game NC State looking a lot better offensively than they have been they really are and they look confident but we want one of the things you know about this is Duke is going to get everyones Best Shot guys often times make shots against Duke that they dont make in a normal game because they come in this is almost a Super Bowl for opposing team fires long range and nothing but net from threepoint L give him five early points Music so the pack by one oconnell off to Huntley Hatfield at 610 NC State is an experienced group everybody in their top seven in a rotation is a senior like that guy Huntley Hatfield or a graduate but a nice find by Paul mcneel Jr who had three assists last time out he was only one of five from the field but did distribute the basketball well and you see his passing to the young man who put up huge numbers in college I mean forgive me in high school three assists already again kipo off Target there malat crashing that glass and cant connect in close bu pack makes only 31 from threepoint land its actually worse than that in conf play at 29 it has been a season long problem that didnt have a year ago thats for sure they had Stars last year big time players in the clutch too Styles a dribble down got a good look and a foul with 1307 to go here in the first half both teams set on attacking the paint throughout this game but seeing K nipple in the Corner the great vision and then getting it on the interior to Brandon Hunley Hatfield for the easy dunk Paul mcneel with a nice delivery and Hunley ha with the Finish to give the W pack a threepoint edge here early unley hfield just committed his first Applause foul Duke with just the two losses by five to Kentucky and by three to Kansas heres flag up high wants to make a move Evans into the game rebounded downstairs by Guna lost it out it goes and back over to the pack so thatll be four turnovers for Duke we talk about the guys last year that went to the Final Four for burns for and diar and morcel and where they are right now and youre talking about goto guys guys that Keats does not have this year and hes still looking for that one hell take one of those guys back well hes had guys always that could go get a bucket DJ horn you go back to jel Jord or to Clon Smith hes always had a guy on the back court that could go get one when they needed it and thats the struggle for this team this year they havent really had that guy as they step up and knock down a another three as Trey Parker getting involved in the mix so the Freshman have made an impact already for the world pack with both par Trey Parker and Paul mcne Tapped Out unable to save that was Trey Parker whos usually a standout dunker they did call that a two by the way they will take a look at it the previous basket by Parker take a look Trey Parker thats going to be a three from fville North Carolina and you got to imagine an instate guy been waiting for his opportunity to be able to play against the Blue Devils on this floor you grow up hearing about it thinking about it chose NC State to play as a home games but of course looks forward to playing here at Cameron indor at least once a year that score is definitely going to change that wasnt that close his Dev is not close at all looking inside k Music Applause D had it knocked away right to the Coach K Court logo shot clock is expiring a heave and its a shot clock violation but Obi the pressure the Wolfpack have applied the pressure early theyve got Duke starting the offense 30 40 ft away from the basket and its work in their favor here early all the way to a fivepoint lead Music ball is brought to by Discover it pays to discover pays to hit those threepoint shots and NC State once they update the score will have hit three already it certainly hasnt been a strong point of the game it is so far tonight yeah what we thought was a fivepoint lead going into the timeout is actually now a sixpoint lead the wolf pack three of five from Beyond a threepoint Arc to start this game weve got to reiterate in their last two games they were at the 1221 by North Carolina state was scored a two on the floor during the timeout review it showed us a threepoint shot the score be is correct on the five of 34 in the last two games coming in so some great looks from Kevin Keat so far myin you got something on that yeah Kevin Keats was excited about the way his team played defense he said great defense were making it very hard on them he said avoid the long twos but maintain the defensive intensity he liked the way his team started foul here Duke by the way three baskets and five turnovers so the myON point about the defense causing Duke to turn it over the foul will go on Gung his first and NY State from the Baseline and how about this OB be Kevin Keats has already played 10 players in this game in the first8 minutes hes got 10 players is in the rotation so sending the message whoever defends and of course you can throw in a couple threes you can find some minutes tonight that was tayor who was 3 for 13 against SMU Saturday and 1 for seven from three this is an8 nothing run 189 inside for the 611 freshman GBA yeah gunba gives Duke an offensive punch he can absolutely score the basketball Young man really just getting his feet under him miss his entire senior year of high school in the beginning of this season but starting to become a factor for the blue do oh what a pretty shot by Parker high off the glass and Parker talking back to Mason Gillis telling he was too small then coming up with the pressure forcing to turnover Taylor cant hit it he was wide open but theyll get a second look heres Taylor again he swishes in another three who are these guys these are the guys that went to the Final Four a year ago OB you remember we watched the Wolfpack go to the offensive glass and come up with Second Chance opportunities push them to a nine game winning streak that got him to the Music four has come to Cameron indor and shot the lights out here so far in the first half on the threepointers five out of seven Duke is just one for seven they have reversed roles OB you have a number of guys on the roster for the Wolfpack that are from the state of North Carolina this is a bucket list to be able to come in here and play in this building the Wolfpack did not play here a season ago their matchup was in Raleigh at Lenovo Center so this is the first time that most of these guys have played in this uniform against the Blue Devils on this floor and they have taken it as such and making sure they dont take for granted this opportunity it look like theyve been invited theyre having a great time Cooper flag leans in for Music two and that was a basket Duke desperately needed NC State still up by 10 raining threes and hitting them Keats is going to go back to his bench hes got three guys ready to come in so hes really shuttling them in and out yeah the guys are coming in start his bch guys have been very productive to start this game hle ha Stripped by flag superer flag with a theft Proctor finds an open Lane kicks it out coner from the corner got it he nails at three hes got eight points so Duke with a response and how about this the pick by James hell swam it in Trey Parker was looking to his bench for instruction he fell asleep and James pouned and just like that the momentum has turned in favor of the Blue Devils another steal Proctor out in front Proctor lays it up he cant finish it g nipple came in strong and back out heres flag GLE off the great head Proctor is open too strong can it will knocked it away bash hit the deck great hustle flag R to the slam but no theres a foul how about this action and this pace since the timeout hudley Hatfield with his second foul Duke got a seven nothing run welcome to Cameron Indoor Stadium it only takes a quick spark for the Blue Devils to get going and it all happened kipler knocking down a three and then the seion James still for a dunk and the UNC warmup made maybe the Blue Devil is looking past this game to start it off however theyre awake and in it now well I give NC State a lot of credit the way they shot the basketball in the first 10 minutes can they keep that up rebound tapped around kle getler first another offensive rebound for the blue doubles kppa looking a shoot just about every time he touches it hes the hot hand how about this one B with an Airman thats not what they were looking for and Taylor will set it up now for the wolf pack the pace frenetic to put it mildly Hill went to the scoop shop and no the reverse One Drop In transition James while watch does not attempt to three there heres flag flag does but its round it out James has the rebound Tak Away by Middlebrooks and a foul on the play I tell you what B Middlebrooks did a very strong thing there if you take the basketball away from seon James he has it in both hands Ben Middlebrook showing some strength there cion James has his basketball well it was a little bit of a bounce off his chest there but Ben Middlebrooks taking it away and then ends up getting the foul from up way up here on the roof where we sit to call these Ganges looked as though he took that right out of seon James hands but a little fortunate balance for Middle Brooks on that one 2319 NC State Styles was cooking early hell drive it this time what a tough shot Confident by dant styles to start this game now we mentioned guys from the state of North Carolina however dant Styles been the first two years of his college career at the University of North Carolina so he played here every year for the first two now has opportunity to get back in this building in his last year as a basketball play no lot of Rim the style is eight points he came in averaging nine and they needed somebody to really explode oh the rejection Bok said not in Applause here now Connell dont do a lot of scoring only about seven points a game hes their distributor Taylor from three rebound comes out of bounds and back over to Duke exactly 7 minutes to go and this place really got cooking and really got loud another area of Dukes defensive prowess they defend the rim K malawat with a denial e Music and coming up next at ESPN Curtis Jones kesan Gilbert and number three Iowa State to take on Caleb love and Arizona should be a good one it absolutely should be OB kesan Gilbert Cale love Bo hailing from St Louis from the L those two guys played against each other in high school and now going to match up against each other on the big stage big Monday the stage doesnt get any bigger than that it certainly doesnt the pride of St Louis meanwhile back at Cameron indorf NC State came out firing hitting threes like they havent all season long and they had a lead as many as 12 points when it was 23 to 11 before Duke responded now the Blue Devils have the ball back heres Foster lets see if flag starts to get going but oh we look at the pressure how the wolf pack are forcing the blue doubl to catch the basketball much further out of the their comfort zone D Styles doing the job defensively on Cooper flag blocking the shot but not finishing the defensive play gets it back down stairs and this time its middle Brooks to swat it away yeah Ben midd Brooks who leads the ACC in shot blocking at 17 per game its the stat that Kevin ke does not like to hear about because that means hes getting way too many opportunities because the guards arent keeping the guys in front 18 on the shot clock just has to hurry canle off the inbounds it wont drop rebound tipped to Hill and here he comes Marcus Hill a wellrun break laid up and in by oconnell the two1 executed to Perfection Marcus Hill forcing tyres Proctor to commit drops it off with the easy layup kle switches it in hes got the shooting eye in this one he bounced back from zero points against Boston College shot the ball much better against Wake Forest he had 15 points a nine rebound and thats his spot OB he loves that corner he been successful with there multiple times already in this game styles feeling it two more they with d Styles is off to a great start in the first half and not only offensively but accepting the challenge going up against Cooper flag the front runner for ACC Player of the Year and right now dant Styles is winning that battle came in shooting only 30 from threepoint land he hit the first triple he was Off to the Races proor heavy traffic cant convert Bs hitting the deck as malat went down and Drew the foul Obie this is the way they teach it in practice this is a twoonone to Perfection you see how Marcus Hill forces Tyrese Proctor to commit stop the basketball and on the other end when you drive the basketball you have to rely on your Shooters to be in the corner Conan nipple finding a spot knocking down another three from the corner Kyle Ser the director of communication for Duke had a great note earlier today about canle that his greatgrandfather Bud Rose was the captain of the 193132 NC State basketball team and was an honorable allamerican honorable mention allamerican the first NC State player to claim National recognition so hes got NC State in his blood he absolutely has NC State in his blood and hes gotten off to a great start against Grandpas old team as have the Pat in this building now made six threes oh they only made five in their last two games combined and theyve taken 20 less attempts in this game thus far amazing look at this 3222 NC State and a whistle and its Duke with the cold hand other than canle Khans mom dant styles with a foul yeah theres Sherry whos the alltime lead leading score at Wisconsin Green Bay May you know and we googled her earlier and everything came up about the about Ks dad Khan II we didnt realize that Mom was the ball player in the family she made it clear she says hey you can find all kinds of stuff about my husband on Google but my jersey hangs in the Raptors at wiscons my my jersey up there just want everyone to know that too so James up top kis off the fake off the elbow no that wont fall so even the open looks just not going as often for Duke in this one and Blue Devils one of their last 11 from the field so the struggle for the Blue Devils has been on the offensive side which is rare oh nice pass bil Brooks in the kick out Styles they want him to shoot it shoot it he does and another three 13 points for dant Tes Styles averaging nine game coming in OB Ive always said that Im love shooting in this gym and when you come its a different dep perception playing at Cameron Indoor than it is in most Arenas that you play in because you dont have the huge backdrop that you see in the majority of the Arenas I believe that actually helps opposing teams coming in boy flag got a great look didnt he wide open missed it NC State playing with great confidence Music Applause Music Applause Taylor mle Brooks knocked Away by proor and now a scrum for that and a great job by Taylor to get to that first bbrooks down the lane going strong no and the whistle cion James Euro stepping his way in for two and great recognition by cion James to attack 101 was not looking to pass the basketball uses his strength to be able to get the bucket NC State heres the headline theyve taken 11 threes Cory theyve hit seven they have been one of the conferences worst shooting teams beyond the threepoint line but not tonight ble Brooks badley wants to get it up there cant stick it flag with the board and now Duke with their backs up against it here in the first half trailing 3524 flag nice dish downstairs for the stuff watch wide open nice find from Cooper flag at the top of the key you can see both Middlebrooks and styles intent on trying to stop Cooper flag keeping him away from the basket so what does he do make the right play give it up with an easy dump to K Malo 216 remaining NC State on top here at Cameron indor Music Applause it has been so far Kevin theres no question about that looking forward to you guys coming up at halftime 2 minutes 16 seconds before the break the largest deficit this season for was 14 at Louisville tonight so far 13 and when you consider the way the wack have been able to build this lead knocking down to three and thats one of the things that coaches have said about the Blue Devils they will give up good looks from from three you just have to take advantage of them and knock them down out and the pack have done that here tonight middle Brooks out of the double oconnell splits the defense and lays it in theyre also making a lot of smart decisions they really are and they started out turning the basketball over which is uncharacteristic of the wolf pack but since then have settled in and getting good looks on each and every time down the four and being able to capitalize on the Michael con we talked about OB he could be more aggressive five points for four for the field guy who came in averaging just seven Proctor on the drive five lays it in nobody stopped him Tyrese Proctor the 66 Jr from Australia but NC state has owned this first half as they look for a mammoth upset tonight in the ACC long way to go but a minute and 10 before halftime flag converging nearly got the theft Okana lost it and hes going to commit the foul the Collision after the theft thatll be his second personal and created by the trap at the top Cooper flag and Mason gild oh sorry we see the play earlier great ball Movement by the wolf pack finding dant Styles in the corner for one of the seven threes already made and thats the way that the Wolfpack have been able to have success sharing the basketball 10 assist on 14 May field goals early in this game and really taking a page out of the Blue Devils book Kevin ke talked to us about how great a passing team the Blue Devils are but their pressure has really taken Duke out of sharing the basketball s the first one so hell get another one Gillis The Graduate out of Newcastle Indiana long career at Purdue before coming here to Duke a very impactful 23 minutes on Saturday 116 rebounds and that veteran calming influence made a huge difference in that road wind at Wake Forest joh sh Raves about Mason Gillis look at him right now OB he comes in and hes playing the five position this guys a small forward coming in and he talked about being a gr transfer and being so selfless not concerned about anything other than success of the team shot clock inside 10 here for the pack Hill looking for some room to operate pulls up on James and cant stick it rebound comes out high and its Gillis to chase it down half a minute to Applause halftime 20 on a shot clock can nipples hit some long ones here in the first half hes got 10 to get a shot off and tipped by the Wolfpack and Duke will keep it here with 13 seconds before the break and the shot clock at seven but for the second consecutive game the Blue Devils will go into the halftime locker room down John sire said they need these type of tests they havent had many early entry here for flag the kick for Proctor and an out rebounded to James on the tip he lays it up and in hes hit on a play two hell be head of the line with six seconds to go and Duke closing the gap here the last couple of minutes and trying to take some momentum into that halftime locker room the offensive rebound by seon James the strength to be able to finish through contact an and one opportunity trying to cut it to four for the Blue Devils and looking for a stop with 6 seconds remaining here in the first half Hill with the foul is First and James connects for the threepoint play final seconds heres Taylor and a whistle before the shot and that was a foul to give for the Blue Devils so great job by tyres Proctor taking that away because that would have been a good look another look for three for the wolf pack who shot the basketball extremely well here in this first half and now they have 21 seconds to get one up pass in long one here by Parker Jor lot of iron but it dropped away but man did they hit a lot ofal freshman year wol pack with the ball to open up the second half here it sold out Cameron Andor Styles got him off and running with a big three hell step back and fire well short to open the second half Duke with a 13g game winning streak on the line N9 and0 in conference play heres flag trying to make a move and hell draw the foul lets go down to Byron you know I talked to John sh at halftime he said listen they came out and they were more prepared than we were and they were tougher than we were as well and he stopped me he said listen it comes down to guarding you have to be a player in this game you have to show who you are and you really have to amplify the defense thats where he is most concerned about what he saw in the first half fellas well when he talks about being more prepared of course hes taking accountability on himself with that one but we saw the Blue Devil mascot with the UNCC warmup on his headband is this a trap game where the Blue Devils I know John sires not but are the players thinking that NC State cant beat them coming into this building and comes up the loose ball and lean in for two and he was the one really reliable guy in the first half he absolutely was he was there spark on the offensive end the floor KH canle into the double figures with 11 points Applause okon gives up the dribble Marcus Hill 64 senior and a transfer from Bowling Green trying to weave his way inside his jumper no Duke looking for early momentum well they had it down the stretch of the first half they went on a seven nothing run right at the tail end to the first half kiple with another touch back off for flag averaging 20 canle again from the foul line got the pass away and out of play off the pack off the fingertips of middle Brooks and the shot clock sitting at six we check out the standings in the ACC Duke perfect Clemson 9 and one big battle tomorrow in L will wake for visiting big game for both those Applause Music Applause teams hill with a cross over into the paint back out for oconnell and that connects kiple heres James James looking for contact swatted out good job by Taylor to make sure that was nowhere near the rim and itll be D ball okono getting back and does a great job of jumping and going vertically if he tries to take that charge most likely its going to be two free throws for seon James a smart play by ok conell to get in the air and contest flag making the move hell draw the foul and dant Styles is trying to be physical with Cooper flag he was able to get away with it some in the first half but been called for two fouls already here to start the second half as Cooper flag will continue to try to attack getting downhill and styles has three for the Applause game yeah had halftime his teammate surrounded him Cooper flag and said get yourself going going Cooper get yourself going and he said this is what you want this kind of adversity just like that well and thats the way to respond Cooper flag is at its best when hes getting downhill and thats what hes tried to do to begin this second half already drawn two fouls on dant St and as soon as Styles has to check out he goes and gets a bucket tied at 37 Taylor draws the double Taylor getting it back on the drive he jumps to the corner shot clock down to one a he Bonnell fires that one out of play so Duke trying to take the lead for the first time since it was two nothing and the crazies have inserted themselves into the game as John shy encourages a second shot clock violation on the defensive end for the Blue Applause Devils goodle thought about it hell drive it the Fall Away got it and Duke is retaking the lead 3937 15 for kiple so since putting up that goose EG against Boston College hes been a different guy yeah cona nipple would score this first time since middle school he played the game and did not score Hill looking for a triple the sa goes back to flag flag on the attack SLS it down a two hand stuck leading the Duke Blue Devils back and now on top with his mom Sher in the stands and loving it tonight sh Sher absolutely loving it she shed the jacket shes got her Jersy on looking like shes ready to go hoop right now OB but shes saying that she taught her son everything that he knows of course the alltime leading score at the University of Wisconsin Green Bay mom could absolutely go get a bucket hey Duke scored the last seven points of the first half the first eight points of the second half so something is clicked here and thats a common occurrence weve seen that happen with the Blue Devils in stretch against noted aame and then Miami so theyve gone different halves with holding the opponent scoreless as well as continuing to go on extensive offensive run shot clock at three mcneel with a step back an excellent shooter cant drain it though and it never did get to the iron thats a shot clock violation and the third shck clock by e Music Music Applause John shy learned well didnt he you know when he was with coach K and those great teams of Coach K and the Hallmark was coming out of halftime just putting a hammer down those 5 minutes were deadly from sheski to sh the name has changed but the game has not they continue to do especially in this building OB that last 5 minutes of the first half the opening five minutes of the second half is normally where Duke separates himself from its opponent off the curl cant bury it and oconnell will have that one go out of play and the Wolf Pack will have possession here NC State scoreless over the last 6 minutes so Dukes defense which has been praised by pretty much every coach theyve come up against on display again here tonight at Cameron indor OB the Blue Devils are the only team in the country that average over 80 and give up less than 60 they have a plus 20 margin of Victory throughout the season and now trying to find a way to get some separation the great equalizer will be the threepoint shot which NC State did so well in the first half but missing an opportunity on that possession well they led by four at halftime now its 4137 Duke James slamming on the brakes off the window wont drop hell stay right here and our SEC ACCC super Tuesday double header on ESPN coming away number 12 Kentucky and number eight Tennessee off that war with auburn at 700 eastern and RJ Davis in North Carolina they in Pittsburgh squaring off against the Panthers huge game in Pittsburgh Cooper flag gets the double figures attacking the basket with the nice finger roll but Pittsburgh in need of a quality win four ACC losses already a great opportunity with North Carolina coming into their building M staying home got the deflection James comes up with a loose ball FL somehow caught that he goes there BN and draws the foul oh for a split second I thought maybe he was sizing up another spectacular dunp yeah well thats the power OB Cooper showing off that hes also got the Finesse as he gets to the rim and avoiding the Defenders with the beautiful finger roll as my man ice would say back in the day if you dont know that would be George Gering who made the finger roll even though everybody was doing it then it was such a skill but ice really made it his was beautiful it was absolutely poetry of most it was like snow down a Bamboo Leaf our producer Kim belt was a heck of a player in the day and one of the throws of his life was he took a charge on George but did George still get the finger roll is what Im trying to figure out 4437 the flag at the line very reliable there at 81 Obi weve often seen this coopa flag in the first half more a facilitator trying to execute what the coach is asking to be done in the second half gets into scoring mode hes had some big halves throughout his young career thus far and on the way to another one here Duke has put a chill on NC St shooting the ball they are over for eight make it on for nine uhoh bror up over for flag and no almost had a Cooper Loop there I like that Koopa Loop got a trademark that one my man not this time anyway got Kelly and Ralph out of this season though Grandma Grandad beside him Applause 4537 and flag will lace up a Applause shoe for those that dont know Im sure many do rest in peace to the late great Kobe Bryant as you see CP rocking his Kobes we are five years in one day past losing the legend that also played for of course the Great m sheski in the Olympics on the redeemed team winning a gold medal in 2008 and again in 2012 have you watched any of the piece that CNN is doing on him I didnt get to see much TV in English for the last four days youre youre in Paris loving the NBA over there but wait till you watch it its tremendous Im looking forward to it great Insight P up pop here by Parker one they desperately needed yeah first basket of the second half for the wolf pack and he has Applause seven flag with a screen kipple to the paint with a fallway oh they did everything right there except make the shot and NC State still hanging around despite the cold shooting in the second half another one on the way swished in This Time by Styles hes back in the game playing with the three fouls you and I were talking about during the commercial break when do you get him back in hes been your top scorer absolutely and you were calling for him to get back in the game you got to trust him with the three fouls but this is where he has to be smart on the defensive end the floor want to be physical but you got to be smart about it especially guard the Cooper flag 30 ft away from the basket c will drive and lost the hit of it draws the foul stops the clock with 1240 to go in a threepoint game and a foul on Parker and coming up on Thursday two more great womens basketball matchups for you number seven LSU and 13th ranked Oklahoma at seven then Iowa State takes on number 11 Kate should be another great night of womens college basketball as canle hits best fou shooter 85 and flag with a little bit of a rest its kayb Foster Mason Gillis checking to the game we talk with John Shire regarding Caleb Foster and trying to find a way to really get his confidence back Caleb Foster who started the season is the point guard for this Duke Blue Devil team seon James subsequently coming in and taking over that role but Caleb Foster is going to be a necessary rotation piece for these Blue Devils as they move forward and try to accomplish that goal of winning a national championship theyre going to need his production Styles can he lead the pack back in this one Parker making a move up and hits the shot say what Trey Parkers been confident OB he came in knocked down to three on his first shot in the first half and now backto back buckets for The Wack Trey Parker coming off the bench usually a thrilling dunk artist got about a million followers tough shot off off the window that wont drop for Applause foster 4744 so the pack with an opportunity to tie here and a foul here against Duke and the shove on cion James thatll be his second personal weve got a timeout 1151 to go still remaining close 4744 Applause Duke hey hey hey hey Music home of Jerry stockh House home Brandon Ingram who both have had great moments in Cameron indor trying to have his own great moment here to knock off the number two team in the country styles with 16 points already in this game also defending Cooper flag and the last time dant Styles was in this building OB he was part of the University of North Carolina team that ended coach Kays career here in this building NC State though in the first half putting on a shooting Clinic a foul here there were 7 out of 12 from the threepoint L just one out of six in the second half we were wondering coming into the second half would they cool off and they have onat will pick up his first foul unley Hatfield looking for the paint hell fall away and Miss Duke looking to build on a threepoint Advantage James gets downstairs and up and in and seon James is always going to have an advantage going up against smaller guards especially in transition just using his size and strength to overpower and get the bucket got a tough on Saturday one for six shooting it but his hoop here makes it 4944 Marcus Hill trying to get started with the scoop it wont drop but a foul and hell be headed to line with about 11 minutes to play seon James in transition with a significant height advantage and strength advantage over Marcus Hill able to get to his spot and just Elevate over the top and thats another advantage that the Blue Devils have theyre the tallest team in the country and so they dont have anyone other on the roster other than Spencer hovert at 58 but no one in the rotation under 65 and so you consider that guards are going to be bigger and have advantages often times they can just go to the block and get an easy one he a 68 foul shooter drains the first transfer from Bowling Green led the mack in scoring last year 21 points a game and flag back on after a Applause breather by the way the first foul shots of the game for NC State of course theyve been living outside beyond that threepoint line for a lot of it Bills best game was 23 against Florida state that was an overtime victory for the wolf pack and hes been their most reliable score throughout this season but Kevin Keats made it clear to us they dont have one guy that they can depend on to go get them 20 each and every night so they got to do it by Committee of course Marcus Hill going to have to be a large part of that yeah last year they had like three or four yes especially when you consider the inside outside combination of DJ horn and DJ burn just so much fun flag got it up off the window and it goes out of play shot clock of factor here down to nine Applause dke coming from behind on Saturday and attempting to do the same thing here at Applause home as they were down at halftime Gillis heres flag turn around with that shot clock winding down and its a violation and another great defensive stand by dant Tre Styles blocking Cooper Flags attempt at the shot clock buzzer and Styless doing everything he can to keep Cooper flag from getting into his comfort zone chesting here and then Walling up does have a handful of Coopers Jersey from the back but hey the Fishers cant see that they Shield it from all the big bodies in the paint well certainly was a foul on the replay a couple of different ways but heres a whistle Ron Gro calling for a foul 1021 to go and Duke leading at 4945 and this one theyll get on gunba his second and Sh shaking his head but John sh talked to us about hey it teams are going to be physical weve got a young team that going to feel like they can come in and beat us up thats where youve got guys like seon James like Mason Gillis to come in and provide the physicality on the Duke end of the floor to make sure that the young guys dont shy away from it with another foul and again playing with his chest but gangba trying to get back in position and Ben Middlebrooks falling out of bounds now if Middlebrook stays on his feet that probably doesnt get CAU Parker with a bounce here for Middlebrooks its got out of hand I thought in Auburn Tennessee on Saturday that looked more like a football game Taylor with a Fall Away sticks it big bucket from Jaden Taylor and hes another guy that can provide the offensive Bunch as you see the the r pack picking up 94 ft forcing Cooper flag to have to dribble 94 but still gets to a spot gets the foul and most importantly puts the fourth foul on dant Styles who will have to go take a seat smart play by Cooper flag taking advantage of the aggressiveness of of styles on the defensive Applause end just under 10 minutes to go Styles has been the Difference Maker Obi with him on the floor the wolf pack have been an advantage when he has to go sit down Cooper flag has had his way especially when when Styles got the three fouls at the beginning of the second half and Kevin Keats right now well hes going to get Brandon hutley Hatfield onto the floor theyre going to NC States going to go big right now the two bigs on the floor be interesting to see who takes the challenge of guarding Cooper flag defensively so styles to the bench that is a huge loss for the wol pack the way hes played tonight and its been flag and canle for the most part here for Duke 15 for Cooper flag tonight now with his 16 points Styles has to sit and another whistle those are starting to pile up theyre going to get Cooper flag for having it right arm wrapped around Brandon Huntley hfield and thats the way theyre going to go about it the wolf pack are going to try to post Cooper flag and make him defend watch Cooper flags right arm thats going to be the foul thats going to be called right there both hands around the waist of Huntley hfield as he tries to post see a lot of jerseys being grabbed lot of bumpy here Parker will lift it and hit it Trey Parker has been spectacular coming off the bench for the wolf pack now and double figures no only nine for Parker I thought he hit two threes no he has 12 oh okay my my iPad had an update yet a onepoint game and hes been a nonfactor offensively at times this year not tonight coer flag looking to answer yes and a foul as well absolutely drained it OB if freshman stayed in school we will be talking about the future of the ACC on one end of the floor The Freshman Trey Parker going to work on the other end Cooper flag knocking down the three and the contact as we see two freshman going at it here in a big time ACC matchup however I dont think this freshmans going to be in school next year drops that in for a fourpoint play many believe hes the best player in America joh broom would have something to say about that at Auburn I believe he would have so but look look at John sire going Zone again we saw this against Wake Forest and now the Blue Devils going into a Zone defensively and Brooks and it forces a turnover flag around the back Cooper flag heting up commanding it out of the double finds an open man and James shot clock at 15 plenty of Music time flag again on Hill pulls up and pops and knocks it down hes starting to take over the game he started taking over the game the first possession of the second half when he drew a foul on dant Styles and now with Styles having to watch Cooper the flag is having his way and a timeout kin Kats in the wolf pack Cooper flag has been the story of the second half with 16 OB they try to tell me Coupe doesnt have a handle the behind the back the pull up in the midrange knocks it down 16 second half points for Cooper flag his dad Ralph loves the action here H facilitating in the first half responsible for 20 of the 35 points for the Blue Devils with his passing a little bit of scoring but in the second half he started dominating going to work getting downhill attacking the rim 15 of Dukes 28 second half points accounted for scoring the basketball and of course another highlight finish for Cooper flag as he continues to dominate second half of games first half Five Points already 16 second half points and OB Ive got the feeling hes not quite finished yet well you know I know you admire this about him that ability to sense what needs to be done if if its the pass or its the rebound in this case a whole lot of scoring to bring them back and take the lead and a rejection by flag it went out of play 11 on the shot clock and that two at 12 blocks per game he is 10th in the ACC in Block shots which makes a perfect quintet of all the major statistical categories hes in the top 10 in the ACC OB unbelievable three times the player of the week in the conference seven times the Rookie of the week lets make it eight he was named Co rookie of the week today Co of the week today and a third straight 20o Applause game 57 to 15 50 dke heres k malawat for James oh got one on kiple passed up an opportunity one pass up this one but cant hit it I thought he should have taken the three at the top he had enough space to be able to get a good look with Marcus Hill had to help in transition looking for the three and that a rattle home for Parker I tell you what its been an impressive performance for Parker knocking down his third three of the evening and hes been big for the Wolfpack especially in the second half he got their first basket of the second half after a scoring drought and its continued to stay hot 15 Applause points flag on the move again a drive but a foul boy hes just got that look in his eye doesnt he and that was really a double screen in two NC State players running into each other as K and malawat they were was fighting to try to set the screen for Cooper and by not allowing malawat to run and set the screen two NC State players actually ran into each other creating an opportunity for Cooper to get downhill unley Hatfield with his third and Cooper flag to shoot the Freshman from Newport Maine coming up 247 rebounds six assists on Saturday at wake four and coming up this Saturday ACC Network a triple header FSU and BC start us off at two thats followed by Virginia Tech and Virginia the Commonwealth clash and then SMU hosting Stanford to cap the night thats a big game Stanford playing great basketball SMU and Stanford both in the top third of the ACC in their inaugural year so both those teams playing really good basketball and in itation to be able to get an at large bid if they dont win the ACC tournament Parker wants to get it downstairs nice pass but no conversion there but a whistle to unley Hatfield unable to make the basket but takes the hit 634 left NC State not quitting on this one and the competition for Cooper flag for ACC player of the year would be this gentleman right here Maxim REO averaging 20 A2 points per game and 117 those are Kim Belton numbers you kidding me at Stanford putting up a double double 16 double doubles first nationally and playing very good Basketball Stanford with some quality wins in the first year in ACC Under head coach Kyle Smith and you consider the the back and forth cross country trips they made she maybe should get an extra win just for that alone and they will be here at Cameron indor on February 15 de mhm well be here for that one well have that one on ESPN actually on ABC and that one will drop in for Huntley Hatfield who has six this is still a fourpoint game oh yeah NC States not going away give Trey Parker a lot of credit for that hes been the guy keeping them in the Applause game James looking to penet poked away Taylor got a hand on it heres Styles back in there trying to lay it up and in I love it D Styles attacking the basket didnt settle kicking it out Demarcus Hill for a three recognizing it would be tough for a Defender to take a charge or stop him at The Rim gets a bucket to cut it to two styles with 18 and a timeout John shy this is a twopoint game with about 6 minutes to go NC State with another comeback and they have closed the Gap again Music and Cameron indors still up for grabs NC State 10 out of 20 from the threepoint line they have been awful quite frankly from the threepoint line this season not tonight Cooper flag in the second half 18 points trying to lead Duke to a 14th consecutive win but they are in for a fight they absolutely are open in the first half it was Khan kiple the second half is Cooper flag the two freshman have combined for 40 of Dukes 59 points that is outmatching right now the combination of dant Tre Styles and Trey Parker on the other side of NC State who have 33 of their 57 so its going to be interesting to see who else can find someone that steps up in this game and NC state has defeated Duke two of the last three times they have played including the ACC tournament the NCAA tournament last spring the role for for James both slam it down great execution out of the timeout for the Blue Devils really a ghost screen by seon James as two Defenders go with the shooter in K can nipple allowing James to get the easy bucket Parker looking for the entry fee James comes over commits the foul 532 on the clock and cion James with f him of three NC state has lost four straights six of their last seven OB look at the screen its really a go screen theres no screen there just touch and go but because youve got to pay so much attention to Khan canle a shooter both Defenders go his Direction allowing seion James to get the easy slip and the dunp Brandon Hunley Hatfield at the line BR makes 75 andc stayed his third school hes also spent time at Tennessee and Louisville 610 senior with another one on the Applause way he drops in the pair twopoint game Proctor in Applause midcourt try to shake Taylor heres Applause flag flag commanding it the scoop around it out the tip wont drop a strong effort defensively by drre Styles not allowing Cooper flag to get to his Comer spot Styles lines it up that Miss badly and a whistle and a foul here against NC State and Kevin Keats is outraged as the that basketball goes off of seon James out of bounds but its going to be a foul called on Huntley Hatfield thats going to be his fourth with just under five minutes to go the see seon James and Huntley Hatfield colliding oh I believe that is cion James tripping over Mason Gillis boy I think you might be right and the call goes against NC State when it should not have yeah that was tripping over his own teammate now there was a collision between the two but I dont believe action is under review its going to be interesting to see as they look at this and then what theyre looking at is both seon James and Brandon Hunley Hatfield Collide what theyre looking at is is there anything extra from C from Brandon Huntley hfield in the middle of that lane as the two come together does he give a little a little bit extra because the foul if theres a foul its on Mason Gillis thats who actually clipped seon James now theyre looking to see if there was something extra but I can completely understand Kevin Keat being incensed about that basketball being rewarded to the Blue Devils because it absolutely went off of seon James stick with a common foul here Ron Grover Lee Cassell and Bill Covington Jr are officials tonight and so Duke to shoot itll be a one and one and James to the line 74 there and working on an 11point game the grb out of Sugar Hill Georgia and OB he did not have a great game at Wake Forest but John Shire said even though he didnt play well was a happy as anyone on his team in the locker room afterwards we see the foul trouble building up for the Wolfpack dant Styles whos been absolutely fantastic here tonight with four fouls as well as Brandon Huntley happy NC State played a terrific game and still very much alive in this one can they make the shots down the stretch they made so many of them Applause tonight Styles and Parker have been a huge hunk of the offense Hill getting down low and two points for a ham and a whistle thats his game OB Marcus Hill loves to get downhill and this time gets to the basket Shields off seon James and then collects the contact to get the foul as you see him get to the other side of the basket watch him stop immediately and then go up the contact from James allows him to get the bucket opportunity for the am one to the displeasure of John Shire but Kevin ke absolutely loves it James fourth Applause foul he 68 at the line they can make this a onepoint game he does 6362 well not many Envision this tonight Duke a heavy favorite as spectacular as they have been particularly in conference play James theight flag wants it hes on Styles he takes him to the paint and lost it but a bump and a foul but theyre going to get Taylor thats not going to go on Applause Music Styles K malawat takes a hit to the stomach and lost his lunch on the floor yes he did so we have an official timeout with 421 to go and a onepoint game Huntley Hatfield in the back oh theres no contact nothing there so I think weve showed you enough of that and were going to check in with the studio here it is 6362 Duke by one so down the stretch without a key big man absolutely malas gone to the locker room and OB this team already playing without Malik Brown who is their best defensive fiveman and now playing without common malat on the floor Pat gunga stepping into the lineup big minutes for the freshman in a crucial spot in a very close game a onepoint game here John Shire said that was without Malik Brown they were going to find out a lot about their team and especially about their young players we will absolutely see over the remaining 421 of this game some good news for Duke before the game Malik Brown did go through some of the drills and he warmed up no intention for him to play thats going to be some time yet but he is getting closer and this was him earlier tonight so he is making progress to get back to the rotation yeah still hasnt really been able to participate in the 51 five action and practice but is closer and John sh said just from a a mental standpoint its better for see him go through warmups and be on the bench with your uniform on in comparison to being over there in Street Clos so Duke on top by a point and for tonights game checkin brought to you by All State we look at that upcoming schedule and right now with dreams of running the table in the conference dreams of 20 and0 but they have a serious battle tonight which was not really anticipated unless you look at the recent history and frankly as you pointed out a couple of times where NC state has broken their hearts and they did it twice last year and John Shire has made it very clear that they need these type of tests not every game is going to be a blowout they have to go through these type of tests lets check in with the studio Applause Music Applause Kev thank you very much and the game you we talking about Arizona and Iowa State on ESPNU as we come down the stretch 421 to play itll be Cooper flag at the line so the Blue Devil shorthanded here in these last four minutes plus OB and as I go off topic how great does it sound to hear Andrea Carters voice in the studio knowing that she grew up with us thats thats little CIS you know and now seeing her in the big time sitting in the studio we miss her off we we absolutely miss her we absolutely miss her but seeing her grow on to do big things with Seth and casy in studio great hands with those two so 412 to go 6562 Duke Blue Devils Back In The Zone defensively had Success With It on a number of possessions earlier in the second half John Shire going back to it resulting in a turnover once again works again it worked against Wake Forest even though he only went to it he surprised his own team on Saturday for 4 minutes but those 4 and a2 minutes whereat were not on was not on the floor now with Pat GBA in the game they normally go to the zone and use him at the center of that zone to force him to not have to switch out or screen to roll action fle set the screen for James he keeps on rolling rebound tipped and poked out piple with another up shot knocks down to two hes got to he it up there and it got off the backboard not to the iron so a shot clock violation and the Cameron crazys tried to let K canle know that the shot clock was going down you can hear everyone in the building saying shoot can nipple finally recognizing it but not able to get his legs under him to get a clean look and an official timeout come here come Music here something happened with the Cameron crazies over there oh everybody is okay but a stop and play we have had a player gets sick to his stomach and now a fan having some sort of an issue likely to be one of the students over there in the student section obviously and yeah it looks like the young lady has passed out here and they are taking her away wow and you just hope she is okay prayers for the young lady seen a little bit of everything in this second half wishing her well so 3 and 12 minutes to go and NC State within three and Kevin Keats and Company have come into to Cameron indor and stuck right with the Duke Blue Devils in fact at halftime NC state had the lead by three 37 of 34 they were shooting the lights out seven out of 12 from threepoint land Duke was three for 16 Duke defensively back into the Zone but its not in normal Zone you see how far the wings Cooper flag con nipple out that middle is going to be open that hung on the yard and wouldnt drop and its tipped out seon James unable to gather that rebound but when you watch this Zone look at how far Cooper flag and kiple are similar to of course your arm Syracuse with Jim beheim Zone where its not a two3 its really you show your length we talked about Duke being the tallest team in the country they absolutely have great length on the wings and showing it making it look as though very little is open against the Zone the pack can tie it up here Taylor Hill jumps into the paint he cant connect and saving it Proctor on the Baseline and hell dra a foul as NC State tried to bat it away and commits a personal with 301 to go and that personal goes against Marcus Hill number two on Hill Tyrese Proctor doing his great bouncing act but how about Khan kipple pulling his leg to keep him in bounds I tell you what there are High basketball IQs plays and then theres Next Level that was Next Level by Khan kiple as he smiles about it but that was an extremely smart Play Its A Little Help from your friends man that would be that would be almost a tush push in football right that wouldnt that be similar to something like that making sure you get across the line I heard that about 62 times yesterday I didnt expect it from you but youre right no one of two there for Proctor it was NC States 10th team fou by the way three on1 to go and a fourpoint lead remember NC state has lost their hot hand to fouls D Tre Styles fouled out several minutes ago so if theyre going to do it theyre going to do it out half and now tipped off by Duke and Kevin Kats now trying to get his best shooting lineup on the floor so taking Marcus Hill out whos not much of a threat from Beyond the threepoint Arc getting Bryce herd in the mix as well as keeping the hot hand of Trey Parker on the floor thir the second youngest player in the conference behind Cooper flag those two guys were teammates a couple seasons ago at my jumper off Target Taylor couldnt hit that time flag had it knocked away and then Applause recouped FL making a move to his left spins left and it goes thats one creative shot well the impressive part was keeping his pivot foot down of course officials are looking to make that call anything that looks awkward theyre going to call it does a great job keeping his pivar foot on the floor coer flag with 27 the pack needs an answer under two minutes to go entry pass up and in great execution getting the ball to the short Corner then Brandon Huntley haffield carving out some space in the middle of the lane Cooper flag keeping that left foot down does not pick it up before he leaves to shoot the basketball its all legit with the left hand hes able to finish over a smaller Defender 25 for C forgive me 27 now for Cooper on the night as he continues to stack up numbers in the biggest game for the Blue Devils 27 points so game after game the story being written about Cooper flag is hes finding a way to lead Duke to victories very different ways often times but putting up a lot of points and on his way to maybe a 30point game we shall see and six college basketball games will highlight our ESPN schedule on Saturday two of them are Sonic Blockbusters Cooper flag and number two Duke hosting North Carolina at 630 and at Coach Cal returning to rup Arena leading Arkansas against number 12 Kentucky thats 13 hours of college basketball all starting for the college game day crew at 10 am to get you ready for the day I dont know if at tops last Saturday with all those overtime games which I think was a record or tied a record was incredible Saturday of basketball well and and thats just time of year thats what youre going to get the ACC the SEC youre going to have so many different great matchups the Big 12 of course will be involved and but this time of year its about college basketball and getting the best out of each and every one of these teams as they start to make their race towards March look at our reset now Nei side with a foul to give and Duke has the timeouts remaining NC state has none left with a minute 55 and right now of course each and every possession becomes extremely critical for the Blue Devils its going to be about handling the basketball you know the Wolfpack are going to come at them 94 ft full core pressure seeing if they can get a turnover first but the Wolfpack have been Stout defensively in the half court but having to do it without dant Tre Styles who is their best defender on Cooper flag can run on a baseline looking for help in for flag then mil Brooks cant pressure Cooper flag 94 ft the way that dant styles did and Kevin kees knows theyre going to put the basketball in the hands of flag especially late in game to allow him to be the facilitator Duke is getting everybodys best shot in the conference arent they yeah they absolutely are at NC State came in with maybe one of their better performance of the season on the road tonight flag drives a clock winding down got the pass off and up and in by gun I thought he was going to shoot it thats two freshman OB and not only did everyone think he was going to shoot it pat GBA did not he knew and more importantly never took the basketball down shot it as soon as it hit his hands soft hands soft finish from gunba and a big make big assist as well from flag Parker okon and they going to throw that one away its going to be tipped OB pick and roll action and you see Cooper flag rejecting it but going up dropping it off but how about the smart play by gunga he never brings it down he just finishes right in his shooting pocket as dant Tre Styles whos had a great evening can only watch Duke to check it in for kiple up ahead proor 52 seconds left and bror will hold it hes the guy you want at the free throw line for the Blue Devils so hell just hold on to the basketball wont risk giving it up its either he or canle you want to send to the line at this stage Duke has been tremendous at the line it made 20 of 22 91 Cooper flag has made 10 of those 20 for the Blue Devils as he continues to just SC it on in second halves of games his aggressiveness goes up to a different Applause level talking about a different level right Kevin Keats that may be out of the coaching box Im not sure however trying to get as he had coach Snell all up trying to get Michael conell to foul Tyrese proor and a successful foul proor only makes one of two still a three possession game 7164 Parker The Zone cating NC State valuable seconds on the offensive end Parker has to launch a long one cant hit it off the back iron and its flaged with a rebound and they will reach and foul with 292 to go this was some fight tonight it absolutely has been give the Wolfpack a tremendous amount of credit and I know Kevin ke is not looking for moral victories but this is something to build on when you come into this building and play this well this is the type of effort you should be able to carry over into later and thats something Im sure coach Kei will talk to his team about and for John shy this is simply about building theyre going to have to win these games and theyre not going to be blowouts this is two shots but for the second consecutive game the Blue Devils have had to come out of a halftime deficit and be able to come out and win in the second half of games and theyve been able to do so behind their spectacular freshman in Cooper flag you know Boston College gave him a very tough half at Chestnut Hill Wake Forest gave him a very tough game on Saturday a close one and NC State came out firing Applause tonight Parker off to oconnell in the corner herd will now drive and scooping around and out it goes kipo will draw the foul 13 seconds left how about Patrick gumba going over each and every one of his coaches dapping him up they love the effort from The Freshman big man as John shy and his entire staff excited they knew once Malik Brown was injured they were going to need Patrick Gumble to step in he absolutely did so with K malawat leaving the floor with 421 remaining Gung was stepped up and made big plays for this team on both ends of the floor play 21 minutes on Saturday two tell you what we have had a full menu of stuff in this one havent we we absolutely have Parker will fall away and it will not drop and the final seconds tick away another hardfought victory for the dup Blue Devils who have now won 14 consecutive games and are 10 and0 in the ACC and set of
