knocks down his first three Has not been scoring of late Good sign by him to knock down the first shot cheering Agger Wall on the inside cheering there The Hurricane starting five It was Dante Allen who was in the starting lineup for Donaldson over the weekend Now they start together and its true Washingtons turn to try and provide that bench boost Jayl Lucas team not particularly deep so just trying to shake up the starting lineup to get more off the bench Yeah you you get stuck sometimes with his starting group They were never a deep team I think he found himself at times once he got in the ACC play where his offense got stagnant when he tried to rest the starters and looking to have a goto guy when he goes to his bench Is why true Washington not starting this game Shot clock ticks down to 10 Donaldson splits the double team into the paint The floater falls Donaldsons got all five for Miami to start Again so much for the struggles We welcome those who just watched a thrilling finish between Florida State and Cal Our Wednesday night ACC double header continues from Coral Gables Jay Alter Randolph Childress with you Miami out to a five nothing lead All five points courtesy Trey Donaldson And thats no surprise Randolph the senior point guard Hes been the heartbeat of this Hurricanes program all season long And when he goes Jay hes playing well Theyre just extremely difficult to beat Really good point guard plays two ways defensively as well and really active with his hands and hes gotten off to a fast start here And Donaldson came off the bench Saturday in the win against Syracuse 16 points off the bench and now first year head coach Jay Lucas going with true Washington off the bench today Just trying to rotate the normal starters through as they try and look for more bench production at ACC play Stolen away by Stanford The Cardinal a team that have been excellent away from home Five and one record trying to keep their winning ways going on the road tonight One thing Don Young is going to have to hes going to need some help guarding Malik Ray Newu on the side of the post right now Hes guarding him on the perimeter which means hes got to help out on these ball screens Shot clock ticks down to 10 Heres Renu Double team comes in Renu trying to spin through it Tangled up Feeds it underneath An easy two Dante Allen off a great feed from Renu I think Monique Ray knew got away with a travel there but great pass He saw the double team coming He got to come quick cheering See here Jay hes turns right into the double team coming from the baseline I thought he shuffled his feet Great cut there by Allen and the find there by Relique Reu Thats why hes such a difficult match up there He sets the ball screen he forces you to switch it and then he just punishes your guards inside his ability to post up cheering Stanford has struggled to find their offensive rhythm on the road tonight Still looking for their first basket Two and a half minutes gone by 0 for three from the floor Cory hes been instant offense this season and thats why he has been there offense and hes a guy I think he was letting the game come to him Stanford struggling to start and hes like All right give me the ball Get out of the way They dont want to rely on that but sometimes you just have to when youre playing with such a gifted player like he is Purdue the immediate answer So smooth Gets it that deep you forget about it Just loves to turn over that right shoulder so far here early Stanford doesnt have an answer for him Donovan Young lost the handle Spills out to Allen Up ahead Henderson He flies to the rim Missed it cheering Both of these times will teams will look to push in transition when they can turn it over but that can lead to turnovers as we just saw And a foul called Henderson Hes not shy Hell put his head down and drive Jeremy Dent Smith called for the foul Couple of turnovers early by Stanford here And its allowing Miami they got to in transition They cant set their defense And you got to corral Malik Renu Hes just too talented of a player Hes going to force you to switch with his ball When he sets a ball screen you got to switch it because of his ability to pick and pop And when you have a smaller guard on youve got to help double team him in the post Three early turnovers for Sanford Donaldson gets it to drop Trey Donaldson what a spark hes been Hes got seven of Miamis 11 to start Yeah Jay he had missed a shot here early And again talked about the difference when Miami wins and loses Hes a big part of that Their wins Kick to the corner Good look from three Its good Stanford needed it and Ryan Agarwal delivers Agawal with his feet set there Henderson into the paint Battles in and out Did not drop Itll stay Miami basketball underneath their own hoop But the home team Hurricanes have started strong with Stanford in town Early 115 lead rim 7 seconds on the shot clock Nobody could corral that basketball A ball had WD40 on it laughter Nobody can hold it To Renu fires the three drills it Malik Renu Thats why such a tough matchup Jay His ability to do that When you try to corral him in the paint he can pick and pop And theyve shown you early what happens when you switch smaller guards on He just takes you right inside Good look from three And Benny Geler drains it The senior who had a buzzer beater to beat St Louis earlier this year Hes come up with some clutch shots all season long He has been Its just just really an underrated player A heck of a story Shooting over 40 from behind a threepoint line cheering Both of these teams like to turn misses into quick shots Geler right on Q there but missfires And Miami not shy the other way The two of the best teams in all of college basketball turning defense into offense The trailer Cammon floats it back out to Geler and Stanford settles it down Packager wall says not for long Offensive rebound Camman squeezes it through Stanford getting good looks on that possession Just cant finish him They have And Cams got to do a job better job I think looking to score Hes got at the rim a couple of times and hes just passed it away I think hes got to look to finish a couple opportunities at the rim I mean here does a great job crashing the offensive glass and he goes up quickly Those are guards to have him bent in Got to be able to finish that time there D unable to capitalize point blank range at the rim We talked about paint points because we know Miami is going to put so much pressure on the rim When you get those opportunities you got to take advantage of it Yeah Miami 16 and four five2 at ACC play Good bounceback win at Syracuse on Saturday after backto back losses cheering A brand new roster under a first year head coach They fared well well to date Got to keep winning games like this one to stay in the projected NCAA tournament field Great tank for two True Washington coming off the bench tonight making an impact Great offensive play there but Stanford there changed their defense Gave it a man look a zone look Im sorry And then Miami runs their zone offense Stanford changes to a manto man but unable to guard the dribble Then Smith high off the window for two Hes picked up the slack with Chisum Carr being out losing his 14 points a game Jeremy Denton Smith has been the guy picking up the scoring Now can they find somebody to help score inside as Miami is just youve got to get back and set your defense against Miami Theyre trying to score in the first six seconds Its so difficult Randolph when you lose your second leading scorer in Akara Like you said its just youre not going to replace him like for like Its got to be by committee And its easier said than done going against Jay Lucas first year head coach of the Canes of this Miami defense Yeah Jays done a heck of a job here I asked him today Where is this team Where you thought theyd be He said Were right where we are right now You know I thought wed be right there competing right around the fourth or fifth spot when the season started Well the only game that if youre a Miami fan youd want back is the loss here at home to Florida State But a rivalry game and a Seminals team thats played a lot better as of late including a win earlier tonight against Cal Donaldson The hesitation and the drive Scoop to the hoop Trey Donaldson Hes got nine Jay you got to start with the rebound Were going to have to take a look at that again Sheldon Henderson jumps up over everyone in the paint snatches it and pushes the break Flying to the rim AJ Roi Maybe hes the guy that steps up for Aara And you were talking about Aquar Hes a difficult guy to replace for cheering them because he allowed them so much with his versatility Anderson cant connect on a three but a foul called against Miami on the rebound Theres Chisum Aakbara coming in from Harvard And look 14 points per game Big for them on the glass as well Its not just the scoring No no no Its its they need multiple guys Youre talking about bodywise He has Donovan Youngs body but hes able to play the three and able to play the four He just changes everything And that was a big piece for Cal Smith and the Cardinals that they just no one player one no one player can replace right now Shot clock down to seven Oori great ball fake leads to a good look from three Missed it up ahead Donaldson ORy in a foot race Trey Donaldson How about the balance and the body control Hes got 11 of Miamis 22 and the Hurricanes lead by 10 Timeout Stanford Yeah this is all the Stanford guys at defensive end of four Bua Corey can shoot the three and be the first guy back music No team is better in transition than the Miami Hurricane music big and strong and he loves that that jump hook Pull up pop Washington no good Follows his own miss Keeps it alive Stolen away Stanford very active hands defensively Weve seen that early Theyre trying to keep a body in front of the basketball and everybody else is help Theyre active with their hands getting deflections and tips Something theyre going to have to do if they want to stay in this ball game So Cory the blow by splits two It doesnt rim in Left it just short Everything but the finish Purdue passes out of the double team finds Washington who miss fires from three Great job there by Stanford just putting a body on the body Something Kyle Smith talked to us about again You got to get physical on your blockouts Miamis going to the glass Oh Cory this time does finish it at the rim Is there anybody in the ACC who can get to the rim on command like the freshman I think he is quick as anyone in college basketball And you heard me tell Jay Lucas the day of shoot around I said Hey you dont have anybody that can simulate his speed And thats what happens You get out there and he draws fouls because he gets on you so quick at the and at the rim Your bigs come over late and they cant do anything but foul Donaldson the three No good I think this is where I Buuka Cory can control this game Stay in ball screens force these bigs to defend you AT THE THREEPOINT LINE NOTHING BUT THE BOTTOM of the net Benny Geler cuts the lead in half because Jay opportunities like that are going to present itself If he draws two and gets off it Stanford has the shooting ability cheering to give anybody issues and especially this Miami team Stanford on a seven nothing run Renew an opportunity to end that from the free throw line Miami falling into a scoring drought of nearly three minutes Its allowed Stanford to claw back Theyve knocked down a couple of threes here Jay Vinnie Gila got him going early here and theyre going to have to make I think at least 10 threes to pull off the upset They just dont have enough in the inside to score Another monster quadruple header on Saturday right here on ACC Network It starts at noon with Pit at Clemson then North Carolina at Georgia Tech After that itll be you and me at Miami right here in Coral Gables as they take on Cal on Stanford and Cals turn to swing down to Florida and do the Florida State Miami swing Good for us to get out of the north come down and throw out a little bit here in the south Well would help if your uh golf clubs laughter came Uh dont even mention that trip Well talk about that Lost in translation here Dont talk about that Dont talk about that Im still salty right now laughter Miami a fourpoint lead Hurricanes led by as many as 11 Trey Don accepting the challenge here picking up a Cory Not many teams do it As you see though theyre going to run a lot of ball screens And Donaldson has the turnover Donaldson through traffic for two the steal and the score Theyre expecting the ball screen there That was a quick turnover there by Buco Cory Again you cant give Live all turnovers against Miami Well Kyle Smith Stanfords head coach has let his freshman play through mistakes Feels like it takes the pressure off if you know youre going to stay on the floor when you make those freshman errors See there he just initiates the contact there and hes just a strongly physical guard He gets his shoulders into and Donaldson already has 13 points tonight to Okores four So a little senior versus music freshman point guard battle emerging The officials have stopped play Theyve come over and said theres been a coachs challenge So Jay Lucas thinks it should be Miami basketball Well get the call when we come back Hurricanes up six Daggerwall finds Jeremy Den Smith Pull up pop Missed him Follows his own miss though Keeps the possession alive Leads to a three and of course the freshman of Cory delivers His first three Unlikely to be his last though one of the top scorers at all of college basketball You can see why Cant give him dare shots I tell you that You got to get out and guard him And Miamis been a little sloppy with some of these passes and they paid for it Okorei through contact No call I dont know how that isnt a foul as Okorei hammered on his way to the rim Still gets the dunk to go Incredible here Habuka Cororey knocks down the three and the next possession there just catches it and goes up showing you the bounce he has and theres a lot of contact at the end of that Henderson had his body on him but no problem for Ibuka Okorei who continues to be a highlight reel every time he takes the floor for Stanford And whats funny is talking to his head coach Kyle Smith He was not recruited as a scorer coming out of Brewster Academy Loved his defense loved his intensity but had to encourage him to score And hard to imagine when you put 36 points up on North Carolina Youre 11th in the nation at just under 22 points per game And looks like it comes so naturally for him but really had to be coached Well it its it matters when you pick the right school in the right situation Kyle Smith giving him so much confidence and allowing him to play and learn through his mistakes Its one of the more underrated things you need to look for when youre looking at recruiting and schools and making that decision is somebody thats going to allow you to grow and he is flourishing under Cal Smith and the Cardinals Whats been said throughout this college basketball season just feels like its one of the best freshman classes in recent memory And you know when you have players like Camboozer and AJ Deansa the Okoris and the Hendersons can be lost Shelton Henderson at the line right now for Miami They have proven they belong playing big minutes at this level Henderson one of two at the line Renew offensive rebound swatted away by Jeremy Den Smith Itll stay Miami basketball Kanes up four Stanford now running their zone Theyre keeping Rahosi and the bigs in the front line Miamis dangerous against the zone Flashing someone there in a high low game Stanford is packing it in on that back line Raosi is almost underneath the rim Letting the guards just match up on the perimeter and just f for themselves They want to keep a big on the big shot clock down to two Doat heaves it No good And thats a shot clock violation So the switch to zone paying off on that possession slows the pace down Miami does Miami wants this game in the 80s and 90s if they can And this game they started out with that type of game getting in the passing lane pushing tempo on misses Stanfords trying to reel them back in to slow the game down Ibuka Cororey has the last five points for Stanford GETS IT HERE ONEHANDED JAM OH I CORY ON A RACK attack with the last seven points for the Cardinals all in spectacular fashion Hes made three baskets in a row A personal seven nothing run ended by who else but Lee Renu When you need a basket Renu delivers here You defend well for nearly 25 seconds and all of a sudden a back door cut Bua Cory just showing you I got a little bounce in these legs as well And then on the other end is just really difficult to guard Almost impossible on the move when he catches it ability to finish in traffic finish over defenders and just punishes the smaller guys Renu has 11 as he completes the and one Donaldson and Renu have 24 of Miamis 31 What a dynamic duo theyve been not just tonight but all season long for this Hurricanes team Oh Cory hes feeling it right now That was a heat check Might have forced it I think he threw it That was contact He was expecting to get the whistle He hadnt got one today I think he needs to be conscious of that and cheering getting that paint play off two feet But his ability to get in the paint I dont think keep him out of there So much speed So shifty Donaldson Shot clock ticks down to five Trey Donaldson finds Renu Missed it this time Long rebound Jeremy Den Smith fires the three Got it Great possession there by Stanford Gave Miami a dose of their own medicine Push tempo on the miss Get you in cross matchups that time No one matched up with Jeremy Den Smith and he they paid for it Well Stanford started slow just four of their first 15 but theyve knocked down seven of their last 10 cheering Randolph you said the magic number for the visiting team Cardinal was 10 made threes Theyre halfway there with five in this first half Yeah theyre going to have to have a great shooting night from behind the threepoint line and their way of controlling the paint It wont be inside the way Renique Renu dominates for Miami Theyre going to have to do it with Ibuka cheering McCory and these guards kind of getting downhill getting in the paint like this forcing rotation Hes got to take care of the basketball Great eyes TR Washington to pick it off feeds to Henderson who will get two at the line They are out of the blocks as fast as anyone You cannot turn the basketball over Kyle Smiths going to tell his guys just get it to the rim At least we have a chance to set our defense in transition The offense transition after a turnover They are out Got to get back Henderson playing so much confidence that has grown and developed throughout his freshman year You take a look at the first 10 games the last 10 games and he just continues to blossom Numbers have gone up in the ACC play shooting 63 from the field and 40 from behind at the threepoint line Confidence is there and as I said before I think he controls the ceiling of this Miami team You know theyre good But they know they have a big two If he can join that group and become a consistent and make it a big three Miami is going to be a tough out for anyone Miami has led since tip off Samford not going away though A travel there against Roi Thats great defense there by Alunus there Thats paying attention to the scouting report Raosi drives it middle but you know he wants to get back over that right shoulder shoot that lefty hook Alto did a great job putting his body on him not letting him get back forcing a turnover Johnson the drive rejected on his way to the rim Henderson ripped it away Somehow got the shot up as well Thats where this game is going to be paid played and thats where Stanfords got to do a better job Theyve got to answer the physicality against the Miami front line Oh weve told you all night long these are two teams squarely on the NCAA tournament music bubble Well hear from ESPN brackettologist Joe Lonardi when we come back music Hes four and two in quad one Wins against Louisville at Virginia Tech North Carolina and St Louis Another quad one opportunity tonight They have trailed throughout this first half Its Miami that took an early lead led by as many as 11 but Stanford has stayed within striking distance and theyve grown into this game The Cardinal playing a lot better offensively now than when they started this game Well a lot of it again Jay as I Cory theyre running him off that middle ball screen and hes getting it and painted If hes not getting the assist hes getting a hockey assist And its forcing the Miami defense to be spread out and theyre chasing closeouts and opportunities like that on a shot fake Agal is at the free throw line shooting free throws now One of two from the line Long rebound though bounces out Stanford stays on possession This is Benny Geler Hands off IO Cororey one of the top scorers at all of college basketball Calling for it back Shot clock down to three Geler has to heave it Fading away and he hits it as the shot clock sounds Thats just a guy you trust there Benny Geler is a shot maker Hes earned the trust of Kyle Smith Theyre doing a really good job of staying between the ball and the basket This possession here Donaldson kick out Henderson a three Missed it cheering Stanford with an opportunity to take their first lead of the night Cardinals made eight of their last 12 shots Really in a good offensive rhythm now after a very slow beginning This is the issue with Stanford Someone else has got to make a play Its not name Cory right now Or maybe he just keeps making them Good pass there Grant cant connect Oh Cororey got a hand in there to swipe it away from Donaldson Crosscourt pass finds Geler Geler trying to shake free Oh Cororey through contact No call Itll stay Stanford basketball Ball underneath their own hoop Iuko Corys got to find a way to stay off the ground But hes leaving his feet in the air Hes not going to win that battle if he gets that deep So his athleticism and speed just play off two and find teammates Great pass Great out of bounds play and it delivers Stanford their first lead of the night This zone this matchup zones given Miami Fitz cheering doing a really good job of keeping their guard All the guards are switching everything on the perimeter Theyre keeping it big in the paint so he can stay matched up on Ernest U in perfect position for the follow flush But everything but the finish for U Miami in a 2 and 12 minute scoring drought Its allowed Stanford to go in front for the first time tonight Grant a deep three Got it Timeout Miami Stanford a fourpoint lead a huge three All the momentum with the visiting Cardinal music And I think thats going to be a difficult ask came in at the three at the free throw line having to guard Malik Reu off the dribble Renu has been Mr consistent in all 21 games Miami has played this season He has been in double digit points Knocks them both down from the free throw line Expect Miami to extend their pressure now They theyre showing a 221 Will they go back to a zone or go back to manto man Stanford trailed by as many as 11 in this first half Shift shifted the momentum and now taking the lead with the basketball under 45 seconds left to play in this opening 20 minutes Watch the corners against this zone Daggerwall lines up the three and it rattles in MIGHT HAVE TOUCHED EVERY PART of the rim but it counts all the same Stanford in front by five Difficult team to play zone against because they dont score in interior but their front line guys really shoot it well And Grants out there and you got to throw away his numbers to get his percentages Hes a really good threepoint shooter 7 seconds for Miami Allen a three Missed it Half court heave not off in time but Stanford holds Miami without a field goal in the final five and a half minutes of that first half And Stanford heads into the locker room with a fivepoint lead Should be a fun second half Until then lets get you to the studio with Taylor and Dennis Scott music seconds got a couple of free throws during that stretch but it really allowed Stanford to take control Cardinal been an excellent road team this season five and one away from home in search of a fifth quad one win tonight Theyre also doing a better job Jay of putting a body in Miami not letting them run Miamis going to the offensive glass All you have to do is get in front of them and youll get rebounds Renu passes out of the double team Allen everything but the finish and Ernest Uday fouled again as he collects an offensive rebound Thats why I say youve got to guards have got to help All five guys got to get involved and get on the glass Thats a difficult ask for any guard on the weak side is why as a guard you better try to keep the ball in front because you dont want to have a blowby and then have to rotate over and block that guy out Renew draws the foul So thats three fouls against Stanford in the opening minute of this second half That could play a big factor late Kyle Smith doesnt like the officiating He think his guys have gotten hit a bunch on their drives but that was a lot of contact there Well in the first half youd have to say objectively Stanford got a tough whistle Well that depends on who you ask I think if I asked Jay Lucas that I dont think he I dont think he would say it was objective Miami has attempted 12 free throws tonight to Stanfords two Renu one of two at the line Nearly another offensive rebound Coori finally ripped it away Okori just goes up with it Left it short and another big rebound by Uday He has made his presence known HENDERSON ONEHANDED SLAM Shelton Henderson hammers it home Bad defensive transition by Stanford there U has the rebound Your guard shaking around swiping at the basketball Youve got to get back and make this Miami defense play against five guys Oh Cory the immediate answer Count it Plus the foul I mean look at this He goes up gets the rebound The guards got to get back You know Trey Henderson outlets gives it to Shelton Henderson and he knows what to do with it And here in the other end Jay I tell you I I just dont think you can keep him out Youve got to corral him and do the best you can at keeping him out the paint He just his speed You just cant you cant prepare for it I mean its just so elite over New and Donaldson have 27 of Miamis 38 Its really been those two Henderson misses the three follows his own miss keeps it alive Can Allen capitalize Kick to the corner Donaldson say foot was on the line Turnover Miamis got to get another guy to make a shot Now heres the infamous baseline step out of bounds Jay always say if you catch it ready to shoot you wont do that Predetermined youre going to drive and more times than not youre going to turn it over Stepping out of bounds cheering shot clock down to seven Oki turns it over Allen read the passing lanes perfectly floated into Renew Double team Stanford saying this should be reviewed and it should be Stanford basketball and Kyle Smith says lets do it It sure looked like it from our view I thought it was off of Ray News hands and multiple players tell you that most coaches will go to the bench now and see if they can get somebody on an iPad Kyle Smith didnt even look back at his bench something he saw live Certainly his players were emphatic about it trying to get the ball back on a coachs challenge leading by seven The shot clock reset there for Stanford This would be a fifth quad one win for the Cardinal Lot of basketball left though Good defense Henderson all over Aorei there Great job by Shelton Henderson again using his length We talked about the speed of Ibuka Aorei You got a guy with the length Shelton Henderson he can give him space and have a late contest and in that case come across with a late block Jay Lucas is on the court trying to get an explanation on why the shot clock reset on that Uday block cuz it didnt seem like Miami ever had possession of the basketball Well I thought U picked it up and then had it stripped from his hand So I think thats why it reset Theyre taking a look at it now Bird Smith over at the monitor Lets take a look That was on the block after that by Uday Yeah this is the block in question See I thought he possessed it and then had it stripped and thats ultimately what the officials decide But Im with you on that second look Absolutely the right call Cory just cheering saves what should have could have been a back court Two seconds on the timer Heaves it up and connects Jay that is a massive play because the officials were not in position to see that ball was a half quarter not back court violation and unable to make the call because they couldnt see it And I Cory with a incredible shot Lets see He saved it I thought Can you go back to that wet bounce right there Looked like it hit the line I dont know I thought he saved him Man hes hes fun to watch Matter of fun to watch And he turns it into two 16 points Babuka Cororey leading all scorers tonight Donaldson leaves it off for U He lost the handle That goes off Stanford last Should be Miami ball And it is 7 seconds on the timer So Stanford starting to separate on the road Theyve opened up a 9point lead 1555 remaining Attention music students get ready for another exciting preseason baseball event you wont want to miss Step up to the plate at the Student Home Run Derby on Monday February 2nd starting at 530 pm Show off your power The top three sluggers will take home prizes and pizza will be provided We hope to see you there There are three empanadas on the line tonight Kings fans if Miami scores 80 points or more is giving you all three empanadas If the king score 80 keep an eye out for your email to get your free empanadas Thank you Thank you Hey hey hey Hamford a 2511 sustained run in the last 12 minutes of game action going back to the end of the first half and its a Bua Aorei doing a bua oy things in Coral Gables Jay he was in music a slump coming into this He was 4 of 25 coming into the night and he is back Hes getting to his spots His speed is giving Miami fits Hes getting in the paint and when hes knocking down jump shots theres nobody that can stay in front of him Stanford up nine in the drivers seat out of the timeout Washington cant connect on the three and a frustration foul called against Henderson Stanfords doing a great job Jay They cor Theyre taking away the known right Theyre corelling Donaldson Theyre trying to bring as much help to Malik Reu Those guys were hurting them early Since then theyve made the adjustments and said Hey were going to make the other three guys try to score and beat us And one thing Miami has struggled with throughout this season is in the half court Theyre best at doing this turning defense into offense The steal and the score for true Washington Yeah hes only played 10 minutes into this game and were talking about a really good twoway guard and now Bua Corore is out of the game I think if youre Miami you apply pressure like this and turn it up try to get on a run How long can you leave him out If youre head coach Kyle Smith step back three No good It will be Miami basketball Its still a sevenpoint game To answer your question I I think were out of a few possessions Well he comes right back in laughter They took too long inbounding the ball Yeah No you know what happens with that too is coaches decide hey Im going to take you out And when theres a TV time out thats your rest And when that comes so you only miss maybe a minute of game time and get yourself about four or five minutes of rest Brun through contact rolls around the rim does not drop And the officials have let those guys play in the paint A lot of contact there Den Smith the drive layup no good Offensive rebound leads to two and a chance for a threepoint play Aiden Came Lucas has the dilemma in his hands Then Smith gets in the paint and his dilemma is he wants to play Malik Rayu at the five but Ernest U is such a force on the glass You take him out you lose rebounding And now the size of Stanford starting to become a problem Yeah Stanford 13 second chance points Head coach Kyle Smith told us right before tip off our key today rebound the basketball They have done so successfully and theyve turned it into 13 second chance points Theyre going to spread him out in the zone here And this lineup is better on the offensive end But can they make shots from three contested three and its a foul call Aiden Camman closing out on the freshman Tee Malovich that hell go to the line to shoot three Yeah Teemos a shooter Thats what he does Got to allow him space to come down and hes clearly bumped there Malovich two huge threes off the bench of the win over the weekend against Syracuse So that was on the scouting report You got to get a hand in his face and too much contact that time though 0 for two from the free throw line failing to capitalize I think Miami has to extend their pressure They want to get back in this game This current lineups really good against the zone Jay He misses all three Donaldson trying to bail him out He cant connect and Miami cant buy a bucket right now Lob No finish there for Roi lost it in the air So if youre Miami you only have five points this entire second half How do you get this offense going Randolph one it has to start on the defensive end of the floor Even there that was more of a mistake in the past They werent back They werent matched up And right now theyre allowing their offense to affect their defense The zone is giving them problems They got to move the basketball And someones got to step up and make shots cuz theyre daring someone not named Renew and Donaldson to beat him Washington draws a foul Well I said it a moment ago Miami if you have one negative against them this season maybe too reliant on the transition defense into offense getting turnovers and cashing it in on the other end in the half court Theyve had long stretches throughout games this season where they just dry up offensively Theyre not a great shooting team Jay Theyre just not And its why theyre so efficient in scoring and pace and play whereas Stanford shoots it really well from behind the threepoint line Malovitz atones for the three free throw misses with a big three there Thats a big shot for a team thats been struggling to find another score But the downside Jay of playing Malik Reu at the at the five But now hes susceptible to foul trouble because he has to anchor your paint And thats his third foul Rud comes in Well we said it a second ago How long could Stanford afford McCory on the bench How long can Jay Lucas afford Renew on the bench Well if he can hes going to try to do as much offense defense I think with Ernest Suday and Renu at the four at the four and five Cory draws contact on the drive Number three Trey Donaldson His first team at the line shooting cheering Cory has been everything Stanford wanted him to be and more when you look at what hes brought to the Cardinal program just a freshman When you put yourself in the company of AJ Deansa Cam Boozer third highest scoring freshman in the country you have seen why tonight 17 points to his name Yeah those other three guys will be lottery picks in this upcoming draft Henderson cheering hes had a frustrating second half Shelton Henderson They keep calling his number Just two of eight from the floor Plenty of time for Miami Just got to keep applying pressure on the rim Malovitz Hell make you pay from there Teemo Malovitz His second three He was open for a few seconds They didnt see him Both guys went with Washington on the drive Great shot there to make him pay cheering And for Stanford everything starts with number one in black The Cororey Kent Smith down the lane high off the window Offensive rebound AJ Roi will have two at the line when we come back Stanford dominating the glass right now Great pass there by Washington Three mo as they call them here Knocks down his second three Miami trying to get back in it music has got to get going I mean hes got to put his head down to continue to get in the paint Henderson Foul called And that sends Miami into the bonus with 11 minutes and 31 seconds left Remember Stanford had three fouls on the opening possession of this second half and they piled up quickly for Kyle Smiths team So Miami shooting the rest of the way and it is a long way to play Stanford a couple of times hadnt communicated there That was a guard to guard switch Made that mistake a few times here in the second half and Miami struggling Youre giving them opportunities when you make mistakes like that Henderson has to make the first to earn the second and he misses him Hurricanes have been dreadful from the free throw line tonight Just eight for 17 shooting under 50 and one of six in this second half Hakori in attack mode cheering Wants it back Gets it back and he had the back door wide open Couldnt quite come up with the ball Turnover Yeah hes saying my bad Shelton Henderson was playing over top Back door is there Had he caught that I think he had a layup Well the talented freshman I Okori with five of Stanfords 10 turnovers Kyle Smith told us we let him play through the mistakes So takes the pressure off a little to know theyre not going to hook him Drew Washington pull up pop for two Great drive there I think Drew Washingtons got to get aggressive and cheering he and Shelton Hendersons got to continue to attack the paint Keeler had it stripped by Henderson Ball on the floor Miami forcing turnovers This is where their best defense into offense Washington missed it this time cheering Okorei leans in No good from him Both of these teams struggling to find a basket right now Stanford more than four minutes without a field goal Malovitz lost the handle on the drive Chaotic sequence laughter here Both teams going up and down I thought that last shot attempt by Ibuka Cororey He had made a shot like that earlier I think that was a bad shot and both teams are starting to press a little bit trying to force issues Its not working out for him right now And no need to panic We got a one possession game here right now and 950 left to play cheering For as much as Miami has struggled offensively the last eight minutes of the first half and now here in the second only down three one possession game Absolutely there for the taking Two teams squarely on the NCAA tournament bubble Donaldson drills the three to tie it at 51 And Kyle Smith says give me a timeout Two teams that desperately feel like this is a game they need If they want to play in March Madness in Donaldson this is the guy you lean on Its got to be him Jay The way this game is going Malik Ray knew in foul trouble He had 13 points going early playing really well His lack of production is just coming from him not being aggressive Here he twists the screen comes off reverses it Finny Giler goes under and he stops and pops and ties this game up And were headed for a great finish here Yeah youve stayed up late A shot up and thats a shot clock violation Thats what you need to do to him You got to corral him put extra bodies on him I think its the same Use the game plan Stanfords using against you Theyre trying to take away your big guns making Rose got beat you Three turnovers in the last three minutes for Stanford A lot of that is too late in the shot clock being forced to heave up the Miami defensive intensity and pressure is picked up Donaldson missed it got a really good look to fire Miami in front Came up empty cheering Gagarwall well defended by Donaldson trying to muscle his way inside hands it off for Roosi cheering and one They give him the continuation and Stanford back in front with a chance for a threepoint play for AJ Rojosi Thats just great patience there by Rahosi Watch the relocation there Agarwal starts on the left block dribbles to the right Rahosi relocates catches it in traffic with the shot fake and finished Thats textbook play there by AJ Roi for you big You want to see that And now both teams will be in the bonus for the final eight minutes and 28 seconds Roosi a friendly bounce to complete the threepoint play Stanford back in front by three Now really great news in the game Hes going to come up and flash that elbow with that ball screen Now his ability to dribble drive changes game changes things Now Rosi has to come out and defend him Henderson finds Renu Counted for two Malik Renu back into the game playing with three fouls And you see why hes out there So important to this Miami offense Now on this end though the question becomes can they rebound Theyre kind of running an offense defense and possession there And youre making Sheldon Henderson your starting three play as your as your fourman now And now hes got to help rebound Hand off Aggerwall drains it Ryan Agarwall Purdue trying to spin his way free The lefty goes right to no avail We heard Kyle Smith run by asking his guys What are you doing They dont want to leave Malik Reu isolated against their big at the free throw line Camman fires the three off the mark cheering Well Miami stringing together some stops on the defensive end Can they capitalize on the offensive end Theyre trying to double off Shelton Henderson when Malik Reu gets the basketball and starts dribbling Soon as he puts it down THEYRE COMING ALLEN TIES IT at 56 Which role guys going to step up and make a play there for either team The stars are drawing a lot of attention cheering Really unselfish play there by Rick Ray to skip it across for the three Miami four threes in this second half Stanford none Agarwal another tough take cheering applause in transition Couldnt quite get there Henderson went all out to try and finish that alleyoop and Allen hustles back to knock it out of bounds Oh the hustle plays on full display Tied at 56 Dante Allens doing it on both ends of the floor Hustling there but here gets the skip Knocks down that three ball Tie game here in Coral Gable music Its time to check out tonights gameed Foul called against Miami with Cayman down slow to get up This is the Kanes first lead since it was 3332 late in the first half You see Henderson flying in to Cam there And now the officials have gone over to the monitor to see if this should be upgraded from a common foul to a flagrant one Watch the right hand of Shelton Henderson at the point of contact This is what the officials are looking at What do you think Randolph I honestly would like to see Shelton Henderson leading up to the screen Hes got his eyes on Ibuka Cory trying to fight through it I dont think its intentional but where the contact took place it doesnt need to be intentional The call on the floor stands Its a common foul Were going to shoot a one and one for Stanford Common foul Both teams in the bonus So it is a one and one Have to make the first to earn the second A chance to tie this game back at 58 For as close as this game has been throughout weve only been tied twice tonight Miami made that big run in the first half Stanford battled back controlled most of this second half And now we expect a close competitive fun finish here late night in the ACC Both teams know whats at stake Jay And theyre going to leave it all on the court cheering Misses the front end Big rebound by Drew Washington Always comes down to the little things Making free throws Who can get a rebound Whos going to win a Hustles points cheering Shot clock down to seven Heres Drew Washington on the drive Rejected Great defense by Jeremy Den Smith But Miami bailed out Fouled with 11 seconds remaining on the shot clock It was good defense for 28 seconds but not for the full 30 5050 ball there And this is the second time weve seen Shelton Henderson come in and just want the basketball more than anyone else Miami struggling at the free throw line Just eight of 17 on the night Make it eight of 18 after that miss Jay when youre missing free throws like this the problem becomes guys dont want to go to the line Anderson makes that one He is just four of nine even after that make Stays a onepossession game Miami leading by three Two teams desperate for a win squarely on the NCAA tournament bubble Miami last four in Stanford next four out according to brackentologist Joe Lonardi Everything but the finish Just rimmed out for Agarwall cheering and no good on the offensive rebound Sanfords been great at second chance points tonight Not then Malik Renu running the floor right to the rim Really good offensive lineup out there We talked about it Miami is trying to go offense for defense with their front line guys Malik Ray knew was the guy they want put the ball in his hands on the offensive end Miami on an eight nothing run over the last two minutes Timeout Stanford Kyle Smith Just one timeout remaining now And Jay thats a big difference there for Raosi I mean the quickness issue that shifts to relieu his ability to run the floor and hes used to having Ernest U and more of a physical battle and Miami right now with their small ball lineup has caused some problems Plenty of time to give the ball to Buo Cory to get out of the way You can get it in bounds He has three dribbles Dont need gets a great look Missed it Yeah See you get plenty of time You dont have to catch and shoot that 3 seconds left in the half court He had time to catch and dribble in crunch time Miami has turned the keys to Trey Donaldson and he has delivered Number three in white They gone back to that zone and theyre following everywhere he goes You got to know what number three is But Drew Washingtons been really good in this second half Shot clock down to two Washington gets it to go Strong off the window for two Its a 10 nothing Miami run Yeah And cheering he cant let him get to that dominant hand Cory splits two Easy layup Stanford had missed their last six shots Good to see it go in Trailing by five though on the road under 320 left Donaldson to the lob Shelton Henderson rocks the rim Both teams on the scouting report was focused on a couple of things For Stanford it was not letting a buo Cory spin ball screens And for Miami it was no baseline cuts for lobs Donaldson cheering H Anderson there and H Anderson battling through Hes limping up the court Timeout taken Miami with all the momentum Miami trying to take control of this game Trey Donson with the drive Shelton Henderson with the baseline highlight jumping over the front line of the Stanford Cardinal music Ladies and gentlemen can I please have your attention Eer the first made three of this second half for Stanford comes in the clutch And that was contested Vinnie Gila with a big time shot there Miami still a sixpoint lead Donaldson calling for it They cant get it to him instead DANTE ALLEN THROWS IT UP ERNEST Zud slams it home Jay its just a part of their offense When you help up on their guards the bigs are programmed Theyre going to drive and die for for lobs A three goes begging from Geler OBrien OConnell and Clarence Armstrong coming together determined its Miami basketball Eight point lead a minute 30 remaining And Kyle Smith signaling he will use his coachs challenge here He used one earlier this game and was successful Even if hes successful on this one he will have lost his ability to challenge the rest of the way He knows that he shook his head at his staff when he I think hes going to use this opportunity to coach his guys up knowing theyre probably not going to win this challenge Itll also serve as Stanfords final timeout if he loses it He realized this is a big play in the game and its closer than you think Look at that That is a looks like a really good deflection there Here its its literally a 5050 ball Goes up in the air and credit Washington for going and get it Sometimes Jay the officials call fouls in situations like that because theyre expecting you to foul even when youre not trying and they blow the whistle Washington makes the front end of the one and one earns the second and can deliver Miami a 10point lead with a minute 20 to go cheering Got it for Stanford You got to run all your quick hitters now You dont have a lot of time to waste You dont have to have a three but you got to score quickly Cam takes the three and banks it in So Stanford clinging to some life after that banked in three into Renu Double team loses the ball Camman has it Stanford doesnt have a timeout and they called one and thatll be a technical foul Stanford called a timeout when they dont have one They lost their final timeout with the Kyle Smith challenge And now Miami will be shooting technical free throws Yeah the guys didnt understand that when your coach misses the challenge you lose your time out And you said Oh you know what Geler went to go for the timeout but then he said No no no no no But he signal for it and your instinct takes over Yeah And again you just wasnt expecting it As much as the coaches got to know the rules its important the players know it as well And Vinnie Gila is a really heavy player and hes kicking himself over that Renu makes the first One more coming and Miami will have the basketball Yeah you got to foul now You alleviate pressure situations like that just had a little momentum They came in knocking in a three Purdue up to 20 Well this was a close competitive game throughout but credit Miami for just dominating the final five minutes They did Credit Jay Lucas for going to a small ball lineup and just trusting it This group was able to close out the Stanford limit their threepoint shooting and be music really effective with Malik Reu at the five that confusion on whos going to inbound this basketball Usually on technical free throws its you get two shots plus the ball but the officials came together and awarded to Stanford Geler makes it atones for calling the timeout when Stanford didnt have one And its back to a twopossession game into Donaldson Thats not who you want to foul Geler had no choice after making the three Just great execution out of your baseline Out of bounds Benny Giler coming off the screen No hesitation He knocked down one earlier from the other baseline And again we talked about it Hes a 41 threepoint shooter And hes knocked down a couple here tonight Had the buzzer beater to beat St Louis A win that has aged very well for Stanford Could be the difference of them making the NCAA tournament or not And Donaldson front ends the first Miami continues to struggle from the free throw line Six of 13 in this second half 54 on the game Donaldson makes a second 50 seconds for Stanford Kore trying to shake free Deep three Geler missed it this time Donaldson the rebound Yeah they didnt want to foul him but now youre running out of time and cheering youre fighting against the clock so you cant get pick in who you have to foul And that time they had to foul Washington Aiden Camman commits his fifth foul So hes fouled out of this game Miami trying to see this one out to the finish line Hurricanes under 35 seconds away from improving to 174 62 in ACC play Think about where this program was a year ago seven wins You hire Jay Lucas and now they are very much in the conversation for a top four seed in the ACC tournament March Madness aspirations and closing in on another very good win tonight They were struggling there offensively and this Miami team had lost two of their previous three games only scoring 59 and 63 and those losses and theyve been able to last five minutes of this game really been able to turn it up on the offensive end of the floor and get some stops on the defensive end Well Kyle Smith has just signaled to his team no more fouling after that music last one We mentioned in the first half gauntlet that Stanford has played in ACC play to start Louisville Virginia Tech Virginia North Carolina Duke Brutal rivalry game against Cal Brutal stretch Difficult for anybody to play that stretch of games And and now you come on the road and play a very good Miami team Challenge for Stanford is including this game Jay The next six games four of those six will be on the road We leave here next and play Florida State One two or three Gelers made some threes for Sanford but it is too little too late for Geler and this Cardinal team Overall he shot it pretty well 44 Usually thats good enough for this Cardinal team to win on the road Thats been their recipe Shoot it better than 40 51 away from home Just didnt get enough stops defensively And Miami so physical did such a good job getting to the foul line They just shot their 30th free throw of the night Stanford only 10 Thats been the difference in the game Jay Its just Miamis spurt ability and their willingness to push pace Stanfords been there all game long I think for the most part theyve controlled the tempo on pace Shot the ball really well in the first half Credit Miamiys defense The Hurricanes 121 at home this season and they improve to 174 at 62 in ACC play Great battle between two teams that could very well end up in the NCAA tournament but its Miami that gets the critical win for Randolph Childris our crew behind the scenes Im Jay Alter saying so long from Coral Gables Lets get you into the studio Nothing but net starts now
