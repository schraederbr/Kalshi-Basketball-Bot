basketball and hes got the record by himself well the last time we saw Syracuse was on Saturday at Wake Forest where they lost 9970 and for the second straight game they allowed their opponent to shoot for 60 or better percent I am curious here how Syracuse comes out will we see a better intense performance on this end theyve got a guard the ball theyve got to keep the game in front and theyve got to rebound the ball cuz when they get stops they can get out in transition and thats where theyre at their very best and so here is the Syracuse starting five again all sophomores and as coach mentioned JJ Starling has been playing better lately he has been more aggressive more assertive becoming more of an alpha for this Sy team nice action to find Taylor for the first two points meanwhile for the Cardinals who come in with a record of seven and 15 overall Tyler Johnson one of three players who had their career high in the game Saturday against Florida State yeah Tyler Johns is just hard to keep out of the lane you cant overh help and theres Huntley Hatfield knocking down that big three the ability to get a pain touch flatten the defense get him in rotation kick out half with a big three Brandon Huntley Hatfield just his fourth made threepointer on the season but everything has been going his way last 13 games averaging 15 points 8 and 1 half rebounds per and hes got the first for the Cardinals Johnson takes it away from Judah Min good job of Johnson tracing the basketball getting a piece and thats where hes at his best open court pushing it his decision making has really improved over the last two weeks Caleb Glenn the recipient Lov up five to two so we talk about this sophomore class having more responsibility it starts with Jud Miss judance must be good he must be good in a lot of different ways hes got to be good defending hes got to be good with the basketball hes got to be with his decision making and being a tone Setter for the Syracuse team he gets on the floor after Johnson lost the handle alternate possession the ball belongs to Syracuse and and Doug thats a start right there Balls on the floor Syracuses got to be first to the floor right theyve got to be active and alert defensively theyve got to pressure the basketball without overextending themselves and taking themselves out of plays defensively we got a quick Glimpse there up your former assistant at Virginia Tech Red ay and you have had an opportunity to talk quite a lot with him whats your sense of over the last couple of days whats gone on here with Benny Williams being dismissed and then trying to recalibrate things here with a months to go in the regular season I think know there its not a right of passage to be able to put that Syracuse uniform on its a privilege and theres a standard that must be upheld to put that uniform on and if that standard is not being upheld then you you dont have the right to wear that uniform and Adrian made a tough decision he went from being red archery to Adrian archery when he became that head coach and hes going to make tough decisions that are in the best interest of the program and nobody understands those standards better than red ay former all Big East point guard and then spent 12 years on Jim beheim staff before taking over this year so he knows what it takes and what success looks like here in Syracuse exactly and he understands that he needs to C thats just too easy thats a thats a pain touch overh help and and a little easy drop off pass really good start for sville team in terms of paint touches forcing the defense into rotation and making a good decision around and out on the three ball by mince after the dunk by Caleb Glen The Freshman from Louisville with four early points off the block shot there to clean it up Trey white and weve got a timeout Syracuse Louisville has scored nine straight points and so red ay uses his first timeout Louisville off to a quick start 92 Seth theyve been able to get the ball into the paint your ability to defend starts with the ability to defend the basketball and right now seratus is really struggled paint touch pocket pass bam layup no communication you got to be connected defensively same thing middle penetration getting to the offensive class ball goes up you cant follow the flat of the ball you got to find someone cut him out and rebound the basketball good timeout by Adrian Ary great start by Lille I was only half listening to you because Teddy Valentine was having a little fun at your expense during that timeout see the wheelchair Teddy Valentine he should be a supervisor of official he so old its too old to be running up and down to court like this I mean the greas formula is not working for him and that smile from Teddy is over here to my partner as they have a little bit of fun 1658 remaining first half Louisville on a 90 run Chris Bell misfires off the back iron Long offensive rebound grabbed by Malik Brown Bell will try again and this time he finds the ring and thats a nice job of getting to Second scoring opportunity getting that offensive rebound Chris Bell you can celebrate a threepoint shot but more importantly you got to get back Adrian archery going through the two3 zone right now now something they have not played a ton of but they got to find a way to keep lble out of the lane when you dont play zone full time how hard is it to move to a Zone and expect your players to be able to do what Judah minz just did right there bringing up Starling turns into two but how tough is that its difficult because the amount of time that Syracuse of there were playing Zone fulltime would spend on the rotations keep the ball off the post the ball goes to the short Corner youre spending that time right now really working on your manto man defensive principles so theyre going to try to get a little bit of a run this is like throwing a knuckle ball right now right a little change of pace try to get Louisville out of balance and right now its done a good job but now you got to communicate Johnson on the pull up rattles at home the the communication you have in your playing zone is no different than manto man when that skip pass someones got to call ball and someones got to close out to the shooter Vader Copeland J Starling dumps it off thats been a dynamite combination this year for Syracuse now both in the starting lineup and brown will be at the free throw line when we come back JJ star good job getting in the passer Lane with the push nice job chin on the rim finish terrific job right there but then against the Zone make one extra pass nice pull up by Johnson we got a game Syracuse fans had not seen until Saturday night after the game at Wake Forest where they allowed 99 points and what do you make of that and what you have seen from him the last 3 4 days I think hes he was telling the truth what I call Straight Talk uh meet the truth head on and and he needed to make sure that this community this fan base the tradition of Syracuse basketball understands the way they played how they competed you can live as a coach would made Miss shots you cant live with guys that are not competing on a defensive end and they did not compete especially in the second half of that W Forest game and he did the right thing and red archery is a fiercely competitive person you know very easy to talk to very calm but fiercely competitive and you I think youve got to hold your team to a standard what he said to the media is exactly the same thing he said in the locker room to his team after the game so there were no surprises and its not an easy thing necessarily to go from longtime assistant coach or associate head coach to the head coach your relationship with the players changes and it doesnt happen overnight well youve got to make tough decisions and you know what you you know youve got to make decisions that you telling guys a youre not playing youre not playing hard enough or were going with a different lineup or thats unacceptable as a as a assistant coach you make suggestions as a head coach you make tough decision and a lot of times youre telling guys things they dont want to hear so now again he spent three years on your staff at Virginia Tech and Im sure as a young mind his was one you molded I think that hopefully he took the some of the good things I did not some of my flws but I think the work ethic the idea of coming to work every single day to try to have an impact the value of Education the value of Player Development there well all kind of pillars of our program at Virginia 10 Bell off the bounce long twopoint shot is good Bell is a big time shot maker hes got to rebound the ball hes got to try to make the game easier for others at time but hes got to be more than just a jump shoot hes got to be engaged in the game on the defensive end hes got to be engaged in the game rebounding the basketball yeah hes a 67 wing with terrific athletic ability for over the last two games played 40 combined minutes and did not even run into one single rebound thats way to put it run into it I mean you can be on the floor eventually ones going to hit you in the hands but I really like the change of Defense as as basically changed the tempo of the game for Lille what has it done D heres first qu quiz question for you okay I know Cory doesnt ask a question what is the what has the Zone done to Louisville taking him what out of I this is not Jeopardy I cant give you the whole answer Rhythm out of the Rhythm exactly take him out of the Rhythm and kept them out of the lane yes now theyre jump shooting team theyre passing the ball around the perimeter now when you get stops perfect pass right there all of a sudden youve settled into the basketball game great decision by Starling good finish nice run by Syracuse right now coming off the Zone brown with the layup next time Ill start with an easier question yeah thank you Ive got my number two pencils so Im ready for a quiz at least in theory and Cory doesnt ask me any questions because you know hes got all the answers hes got a lot of guys to take care of he does heres staring and again you have seen the turn in the local players spent last year at not Dame his shooting struggles with the Irish were well documented but he is healthy now worked on that shot and he and the orange reaping the rewards suu up by Music five has made its last five shots a 90 run set yeah 90 run basically energized by the zone defense throw a little knuckle ball right there you get a deflection all of a sudden you play ahead of the defense good job right there stalling playing through the contact idea of coming back and rebounding the ball but when you rebound it those guards are up the floor its an advanced pass that was a big quick knock down three so the Zone has been really good the challenge for the zone is when that ball goes to the middle of the floor youre going to see brown hes going to have to match up with the center and everyone else has got to almost find a man I used to call fan and find and get matched up good job right there keeping it off the post scaleb Williams the turnover heres mince Starling for three well Louisville as a team is last in the ACC at only 5 and a half made threes per game and so yesterday at practice from Syracuse they were allowing Louisville to shoot not wide open shots like that Mike James buries it but really the only player for Louisville that Syracuse was overly concerned shoot the basketball is now on the floor number one Curtis Williams but Louisville is shown if youre wide open you can make that shot ctis Williams is a big time threepoint shooter more of a catch and shoot theyve got to do a good job in defensive transition circus got to communicate in defensive transition get matched up if youre going to get into the Zone locate Shooters and theres Williams right there you cannot let him catch and shoot the ball goes into the post if you going to scrape down you got to be ready to close back up really good job offensively for Lille settling in and making a nice simple play back to back out of transition and the Freshman out of Brother Rice High School in Detroit coming off his career high in the Florida State win of 19 points with his first three points here tonight coming off the bench for Kenny Payne key to the Zone youve got to have active hands and pressure on the basketball cant play with your hands down you got to cover space communicate with the back line and the front line you cant let that happen Bol ending got the basket for Mike James on the block shot attempt by Malik Brown timeout here in Syracuse penetration no one talks no communication like James knocks down that three now youre in the two three Zone ball goes in wall up dont overc commit thats a late close out Williams the best threepoint shooter on this Louisville team you got to close out harder now youre in the zone the ball goes to the middle you got to keep the ball in front Mal Brown gets beat straight line drive the zone is a change of speed for this Syracuse team its not who they are defensively but theyve got to be more committed to defensive transition theyve got to be more alert theyve got to close out and know their personnel in terms of closing out to threepoint Shooters well sass Syracuse had not allowed an opponent to shoot better than 60 in the game since way back in 2006 until their last two games against Boston College and against Wake Forest and Louisvilles off to a fast start here tonight shooting better than 60 again they dont even know what theyre in a manner zone right now here we go theyre settled into the Zone they got to keep it off the high post they got to locate Shooters Louisvilles doing a nice job of moving the basketball try to get the ball in the middle of his zone right there James in the middle who his coach told us earlier today is the hardest worker on this team cant get it to go Tracked Down in the corner by Malik Applause Brown Louisvilles done a really nice job of getting back and setting their defense and in the half court keeping the ball in front where theyve struggled is off of turnovers Min earns his first trip to the free throw line you see Al louville that theyre really packing in the half court because Cirus has not shot the ball well they are really packing in their toes to the threepoint line the whole defense is inside the threepoint line taking away driving Lanes really good job of changing speeds he does such a great job of getting to the foul line getting to the line eight times a game the 64 sophomore from Fort Washington Maryland shooting at 76 on the year makes the first among the nations leaders in getting to the line such a huge part of what he does and when he doesnt get to the line that takes away from the Syracuse offense quite a bit hes a downhill driver he plays the compact pretty good finisher around the rim not a great threepoint shooter better in transition get better playing downhill mince goes out after making the two free throws how about this coach last five games Syracuse is shot only 64 from the free throw line why would that be why does free throw shooting seemingly come and go they shot so much better earlier in the season Home Road confidence getting the right guys to the free throw line is so important and then pressure when your team is struggled a little bit good job right there looking to trap that short Corner pass good offense Again by Louis there Goldman had a seene for a moment now back it off sophomore to sophomore once again its another dunk for Malik Brown and Im a big Copeland fan I think hes one of the better passers one of their more creative offensive players if you could just shoot it a little bit better look at Copeland right here Advanced pass attack eyes on the rim tries to get a pach of the paint head is up little no look brown with the Finish Copelands feel for the game High basketball IQ terrific passer thats all from King cesing Park in Southwest Philly that is where he grew up playing ball and the feel and the flare that he plays with is from those roots thats the Southwest Philly floer thats where that originated the great Ty Garland who played at Virginia Tech for a year had a great career at Lal three ball good sky Clark is the fourth to make a threepoint shot for Louisville tonight Cardinals back in front Midway through the first half sky clock missed the last game with a little bit of an injury hes back play hes kind of a ball guard a scoring point guard now a little bit more ball pressure darling cut off now on the switch try to go inside to Brown KCK it back out wide open Bell off the shot fake good job defensively and a really good job being patient in the paint right there third leading score on the season for Syracuse at over 10 per game and when he shoots it well Syracuse usually wins darling mishandled the pass brings it back outside to Bell who has it poked away take away by Louisville Here Comes Williams He dribbled it off his foot and the whistle comes as Malik Brown went to the floor and flattened a cardinal Tyler Johnson Tyler 6 Fe 160 Brown is 68222 thats a little bit of a mismatch that possession before Tyler just took it too deep into the lane if you dont have a penetration opportunity back dribble Swing Swing get the ball reversed you cant take it into traffic like that as a little guard again Johnson coming off a careerhigh 27 points and 11 assists against Florida State both nearly doubling his previous High Syracuse playing his own Better B but that ball goes into post you got to get matched up Hunley Hatfield left it short Copan pushes the tag Bell on the reverse love the ball in copelans hands his decision making his vision his feel offensively another turnover here they come again staring with the twohanded play Kenny pay needs to put time out creating offense out of the defense getting deflections playing ahead of the defense thats been Syracuses best offense Williams missed everything right place right time for Trey White hes got a chance for a threepoint Play Taylor picks up his first foul of the night and so the USC transf for Trey white at the line out of prolific prep hes a native Texan who missed three games this year with a groin injury in early January he had a wonderful game at Clemson just the other day scored 29 against the T ERS how about they have six players if Im not mistaken they have scored more than 26 points I think its five but yeah that is something darling Starling off the bouns no Here Comes Tyler Johnson to stop the ball easy bucket for sky Clark back the other way Brown trying to get those two right back and he do think about the his c as made I think defensive transition youve got it back well for ctis Williams coming into this building perhaps means a little more he says the basketball player he most admires Lelo Anthony Copeland leans in Top Shot good job by Huntley Hatfield to stand his ground and knock toit the foul clar has the pass right through the hands of his teammate numbers again for Syracuse Copeland fakes the pass Allah Sherman Douglas style and has the easy to that was a little magic right there now that was little Magic Johnson back in the day no look pull a little Rondo pulling it back cops been terrific in terms of as a facilitator playmaker hes actually their best perimeter Applause passer Tyler Johnson Louisville is now five of seven from three got a mismatch from Johnson bell with a hand in his face give him three more hes got 13 to lead all Applause scores Williams little strong off the back iron and a foul on the pushback count the basket and one Tyler Johnson will have a chance for three when we come back remain in the he is going all Magic Johnson on us when you have a history of greatness the real champ CER copelet his dropping dimes terrific active and alert defensively two skills five assists he is Syracuses best and most creative passer go to paint touch and transition make a play reads all five Defenders surveys to four active hands defense what happened there happy that one connected and then in transition if you do not stop the ball take the little drop off and finish at The Rim he uses his size his length to see over the top of the defense a creative passer in transition I think in a lot of ways Syracuse is the best when the balls in in his hands well quader says his mom Pamela Parsons is his number one fan she is the first phone call he makes after every game and quaters got an outsized personality he says that his mom is like metimes 10 wow Ill tell you what I watched quader shoot today in the shoot around and I know he struggled shooting the basketball but when he shoots in the shoot around hes really shooting the ball well hes on balance hes squared up pretty good shot preparation and you cannot give up a missed free throw block out now carry comes in game Balls being shot on the free throw youve got to cut that guy out put him on your back step across him not step in Zan pay the coachs son into the game to come up with that tie up on the alternate possession though with Syracuse basketball Taylor mince Starling Bell and as coach mentioned Peter carry into the game for Syracuse hes one of the guys who is likely to play more minutes with the dismissal of Benny Williams yesterday notice every time mints and Starling come up a ball screen theyre commit basically two Defenders theyre theyre really making a commitment to try to keep those guys out of the lane good patience right there by mince mins first field goal giv Syracuse the lead once again Applause 3634 big part of the zone now theyve got to come back and rebound those guards have to come back and rebound the basketball Louisville you got to find a way to get a paint touch there it is beautifully done xan Payne fouled off the nice feed from Huntley Hatfield youve got to keep the ball off the high post really good Patience by LV they get the ball to the middle short Corner man makes a nice Cut hard to seal back one of the guards have to keep the ball off the high post xan pay one of 27 Suns playing for the the dads in division one well coming up next well take you to Cameron indor for number nine Duke hosting Notre Dame what will the Blue Devils do coming off their weekend loss in Chapel Hill they probably play with a little more sense of urgency I think thats first and foremost and then probably the other thing is probably survive the broadcast crew P Min off the bounce the big question with Coach beheim returning to Durham for that game Jack it on or jack it off jack it off especially because youre upstairs and its warm up Music there get matched up now cant let that happen when that ball coms to the hot post you got to step up play really good Patience by Louisville getting the ball to the middle especially Huntley Hatfield his ability to catch face and either score or movement has been really impressive you know he was a top 20 recruit coming out of high school when he went to Tennessee but he has been very open talking about the fact that confidence was an issue for him as a young guy trying to find his way in the SEC and now couple years later after transferring to Louisville under the guidance of Kenny Payne you are really starting to see the emergence of Brandon Huntley Hatfield he totally believes in Kenny pay uh and Kenny pays done a good job of nurturing big guys develop differently than perimeter guys and it takes time for them to get to understand getting up to the Speed playing in space having to defend ball screens having to play out of double teams and then getting in world class condition so you can improve Kenny Payne has done a great job of connecting with him nurturing him and empowering him and you see the rewards the way hes playing right now the last five games 15 points a game last 13 games almost 15 and eight now last season bhh dealt with a foot injury which also made it tough for him to get in world class shape which we have seen him this year and hes got all the metrics 610 240 a junior from Clarksville Tennessee a wonderful athlete Johnson to Williams for three Johnson came down hard offensive rebound for Lille and Johnson limps away not putting much weight on that left ankle while the Cardinals knocked down another three and Tyler Johnson hops all the way back to the Louisville locker room Tyler Johnsons been their shot Creator and their and their playmaker in terms of getting them into offense but if you look on the right side of the screen when this ball is shot oh thats not good you can see he rolled it you see Carrie youve got to put a body on someone and cut him out when the ball gets shot Music Starling off the right foot Banks it in as you watch tape on Starling you see his confidence growing you see him understanding where his shots are com front you see his decision making improve you see his creativity coming out as a what I call a ball guard a scoring guard that can also make plays CLK into the lane got the defender in the air and draws the foul it goes against Taylor in the act of shooting Syracuse up two as we head to time here at the JMA Dome being the best takes tomorrow one of the ACC womens basketball matchups of the night he is right here on acc Network number three NC State host number 16 for Virginia Tech at 8 Eastern the nothing but net crew will follow with a full breakdown of that game and the whole night the pregame starts with ACC pm at four from Raley Brandon hry Hatfield hes got eight points in this game but hes so good in the middle against that zone because he can catch it face knock down that little 15footer he can also move it and play post to post with the guy in the short Corner hes just a tough matchup then JJ sterin as this seasons gone on you just see him growing each and every game last five games 18 points a game 16 for 43 from the threepoint line picking his spots being more aggressive driving with a purpose so you put him and mids together and that is a dynamic back cour sky Clark at the free throw line makes the front end his father Kenny Clark a star wide receiver back in the day at UCF had a cup of coffee in the NFL as well his son Sky played one game back in 03 with the Minnesota Vikings returned a couple of kicks so just got to do a better job of rebounding the ball in that zone Bell has had the touch so far tonight get 15 points nice job covering up down with a wide pin down curled it shot ready good GL great job red archery coming out of the timeout executed we are glad to say during that last timeout Tyler Johnson returned from the Louisville locker room and is back on the bench official word is that he tweaked his knee and that hes okay shot clock down to two Huntley Hatfield has to put it up Syracuse with a baseball pass can mince track it down he does Starling first fre mince on the offensive glass no and white rips it away Clark then kicked it out of bounds inadvertently its back to the orange one thing you talking of red before the game he said the team that competes the hardest for the longest period of time to win this game can you know anyone can do something once its to consistency of your effort how tough and competitive you can be and then I used to say that you know playing hard as a given playing well as the goal but right now these teams have to compete consistently and then make good decisions once theyre competing at a high level kick ball reset the shot clock to 20 well for the first 18 minutes who do you think has been competing harder here tonight S I think theyve both been sporadic I think that Louisvilles done a nice job on the Glass Syracuse has done a good job creating offense out of the zone and getting playing ahead of the defense Baseline screen coming right here for Bell watch Bell Number Four good job great good job scouting right there vce gets it back and he was Applause fouled SK first foul on sky Clark and the 15 foul against Louisville did they say he was in the act of shooting looks like hes heading to the line to shoot two its like Doug its like working with me can you do the tough things consistently no so I mean I mean thats the challenge I mean like for these guys on the court can they do the tough things consistently the team that does the tough things consistently you know will have a huge advantage you can do the tough things consistently well get to the end of this game I hope so you got a ways to go I dont know if Ive got it in me coach I mean youve been about well fed today you didnt get your workout you know you took a little shortcut you had that big juicy burger what was that place we went to uh alen Angus alen Angus One the biggest bur weve ever seen you showed great discipline by the way only half a row both rebound to basketball guards got to come back into Zone and rebound the ball next to 12 Second Chance point for Lis Cardinals have dominated the glass so far tonight yeah you great offense out of your defense but youve got to come back and rebound the ball 17 to9 the rebounding Advantage for the Cardinals a switch now they they can go drop and give q a chance to make a Applause play S A SHO backing down Johnson tries to stay with him he is called for the foul and minz has a chance for three good job this is like old Mark Jackson St Johns Back in the Day little back down get to the middle to four use your size really nice job by Jud M I was really impressed Jud has had a 13 assist game I think in a nine assist game that thats sign of trusting your teammates hes got to just make the right play you know JZ has a desire and a goal like every guy in this to play in the NBA I got it got it you got to trust your teammates when you come off screens if they commit two youre four and three behind youre just got to make the right play that right there the back down was a nice job now watch when the ball gets shot guards have to come back and rebound there you go guards come back and rebound now you can run BR quick Outlet to Bell looking for the shot hes got it 18 points for the sophomore from coner California and rare for to see him shoot one off the bounce most of his shots off quick ball reversals one more catch and Applause shoot well orange fans will remember his career high 25 points against Colgate to come back from 24 down earlier this season and beat the Raiders James tough shot drew the contact he hit the hardwood very hard and hes yet to get up watch this straight line drive right here you got to guard the ball like its manto man good hard straight line drive by James couldnt exactly see what happened at the end hes up and about when youre playing a Zone youre still defending a man if that guard goes straight line drive from the top of the circle thats exactly what Adrian arer that that would get him upset because you got to stay between the ball and the basket you play in a Zone you close out on on on a ball handler stay between the ball and the basket its what you learn when youre a little kid you know playing CYO basketball keep the ball in front great job by James though but the no call on the defense by Brown who went straight up and James seems to be okay he stays in the game out there with white Clark Williams and Huntley Hatfield defending the final 20 seconds of the first half get the last shot give yourself a chance to offensive rebound will get the last shot Im might try to get Bell something right here got hfield on Bell Min has got to go two seconds one to the corner Starling beats the buzzer but a productive first half on the offensive end for the Orange shooting 60 at 10 its the Cardinals who get the basketball first to begin the second half here at the JMA Wireless Stone good to see Tyler Johnson who went out after tweaking his knee in the first half get the start in the second half at the point for Louisville Syracuse opens up manto man in first possession Applause defensively really important for Syracuse right now in this man keep the game in front of you and then force a contested shot come back and rebound bable create space and give Johnson chance to get in the lane theres a spread ball screen see out of cours wide open James spins in the lane cant get the roll Bell pulls down the rebound I like The Possession by Lille little spread ball screen kick it over to James floor is open he tries to get in the paint make a play well James said after their big win Saturday over Florida state that Louisville essentially turned it into a street ball game and that worked for them can that work here tonight well this s team one theyre going to change defenses number two which I think is just as important they dont switch as much so so what Louisville did was they created matchups and pack those matchups this is the key can you keep the ball out of the lane thats just too easy great job right there over Taylor for two Im not sure that the individual defensive players for the Syracuse team can keep Louisville out of the lane I think theyre going to have to continue to change defenses throughout the Applause game mince has it poked Away by Johnson hes liking these back Downs right there but hes got about a 4in height advantage and so he will head to the free throw line after Johnson picks up the personal he gets in those back dos hes got to work to the middle of the floor if it works the middle floor he can either shoot a quick jump hook or then he can spin back and use his size to score over the defense on the other a dunk if youre defending manto man youve got to keep the ball in front youre playing against Louisville you got to understand your personnel you cannot overextend play in gaps and close to Shooters on the kick out but you cant give up those straight line drives and as you saw there minz is second in the ACC in steals per game at over 21 but that doesnt necessarily tell the whole story of a Defender right coach 100 you set me up pretty good there theres a difference between stealing the ball and creating a turnover stealing the ball basically lacks discipline maybe its an anticipation if you try to steal the ball too often its a riskreward proposition if you force a turnover youre basically defensively sound and then turnover could be a bad pass but turnover could be quick shot a Turner could be a bad shot a Turner could be pushing the defense offense out of step and taking him out of the Applause river feeds inside white going to work on Starling nice looking move for the former USC Trojan a great start to louard a great job by K pay finding matchups attacking matchups against the manto man back to back going at stalling R white whos bigger and can either beat him off the bounce or take him down to the Applause block mince through the defense hangs left it short with a chance to take the lead here clar to the corner white for three now lble didnt score there but they got a great look off mince trying to go for the steel in the back court and not getting it mince makes two plays in the r right there like B he is just shooting a cover off the ball thats 21 for Chris Bell possession before M tried to make a bad play and a hard play offensively turned it over and then he tried to get for a Ste he got to be solid James buries the triple and theres Bell helping down and then he doesnt get back out to close out James knocks down to three he cant trade threepoint shots Cardinals draw back within a point last time out Louisville snapped at six game losing streak meanwhile Syracuse has dropped backtoback games in three of their last four but in spite of that Syracuse is in a fourway tie for eighth place coming into the day with Virginia Tech Pittsburgh and Clemson although those two losses their last two times out minz able to get to the bucket and score really nice job of mittz coming off that screen tight and getting downhill watch mittz here on the left hand side watching dip his right shoulder right there straight line drive put the defender on his hip keeps his chin on the rim and a nice finish I like what what Syracuse is doing offensively defensively they got to be more committed I absolutely love what Louisvilles doing right now tacking matchups playing with space not settling and dictating the shot theyre going to shoot Kenny pton is finding matchups he likes Music Brown called for the foul trying to fight for space inside Teddy Teddy Valentine just stopped right there Teddy you blew the whistle theyre going to stop little extra I mean little little hit here youve done this thing for a long time they blow a whistle they usually stop round with a steel and then get it right back sky Clark for the basketball James for the three ball that would have tied it another offensive rebound for the Cardinals back to Brandon Huntley Hatfield he came into this game coach having made three threepointers all year hes got three tonight all kick out threes and when that ball gets shot and with that we are tied at 55 a piece timeout called by a three and a three Doug Sherman Seth Greenberg back in Syracuse Louisville and the orange tied at 55 a piece and uh during your days as a head coach at Virginia Tech you were shaping young minds including that of your former assistant Adrien ay who I dont think was getting the message at that point right there I got to get away from this guy this guys lost his mind what is going on here Im not sure what that game was but looking for my training and and Adrian things probably werent going very well but I hired Adrian orer he was an assistant High School coach at the time working uh with Team Takeover as in the Grassroots program a team in DC and he I knew him as a player tolentine high school and obviously here at Syracuse he had an insatable work ethic tremendous effort loved the game loved everything about it was lost in the game was lost in getting better helping players reached their potential cared about anything and everything Jim beheim did a great job with them in the end hes coaching in his own personality hopefully taking a little bit of everyone whos touched his life but this guy here is going to be a terrific head coach uh he cares about the players he knows the game he can teach the game he has the ability to communicate and behind that demeanor people have to remember what a fierce competitor he was as a player and when you think about the facts that that he is just the eighth head coach in the 100 22 year history of this program its remarkable that is remarkable well theres a guy beheim who was here for a long time he was better part of a half a century as the head coach Min tough shot perhaps looking for the whistle James picked up the dribble they go inside to Brandon Huntley Hatfield size Advantage working down on Taylor so hes been hurting him from the threepoint line now he goes ins side and does more damage youve got to send a second Defender at him uh you got to go trap get the ball in his hands Jud last two or three times in this half hes getting in the paint and hes making his mind up what he wants to do you got to get in paint and then read the defense theres a good job thats reading the defense thats really good offense take what the defense give you thats the whole thing you put someone in a ball screen you put the defense in rotation you read the forearm three behind and you make the right play Mi has got to be doing more of that that was really good offense by Syracuse now six of eight from Beyond the threepoint line Chris Bell is within one point of matching his career high now with the dismissal of Benny Williams yesterday this is something Syracuse is going to have to address when you face a talented bigger post like Brandon Huntley Hatfield offensive foul that is going to be a problem Sky Clarks loow to get up and weve got a timeout an official timeout Louisville with a onepoint lead here in the Dome the interaction with everybody here since December Brandon Huntley Hatfield has been outstanding for Louisville and I love what Kenny Paynes doing isolating them on the Block watch right there youre oneonone this is an advantage JJ Sterling either youre going to double youre not going to D youre in no mans land even on Brown heres the back down hes working to the middle of the floor Starling again you cannot allow him to get a foot in the paint either youre going to go or youre not going to go once he puts it on the ground you got to go and get the ball out of his hands right now Kenny Payne is doing an absolutely tremendous job of finding matchups and exploiting matchups do you think for Kenny Payne that comes from his time spent in the NBA the couple of years he spent as an assistant coach without a doubt theres no doubt about it in the NBA is about a game of creating matchups whether its off of switches or finding an advantage Syracuse back to the zone right now out of the Zone what do they have to do quiz number two keep the ball from getting into the paint and number two know what they got to do get shot close out rebound to the threepoint line I got I got and rebound and as to still good job change defenses Copeland to Starling count it goal tending so what has happened by going to the Zone theyve taken away Kenny Payne going to a matchup and creating offense out of the defense watch here boom deflection copin always making the right pass good job and Starling really nice job of keeping his head on the rib 12 lead changes Syracuse back up by a Music point white has a step along the Baseline James fouled on the Applause shot JJ Starling picks up his first personal foul third against the orange in the second half and so there is Mike James the red shirt sophomore from Orlando out of Oakridge High Applause School heres our next gymnastics meet right here on acc and the ESPN app Sunday afternoon North Carolina squares off against rival NC State at Reynolds Coliseum coverage begins at 4 Applause Eastern big part of James 18 points against Florida State getting to the line he was 14 of 19 against the sem hes been their most consistent most complete play at AO who made the play copelin makes the play He Is their best point guard Id almost try to play Judah mins off the ball Advan pass him where hes got space put the ball in cops hand whos who Advance passes the ball and sees plays a little bit earlier Jam dumps it off bhh missed it Taylor may have gotten a piece it goes out of bounds Louisville will keep with 20 on the shot clock well this has been fun coach Louisville shooting 60 Syracuse shooting 62 basketball is fun to watch when the uh baskets are piling up it is fun to watch but as a guy that won most of his games playing defense it kills you crazy that you dont come back and rebound the basketball and you cant keep the ball out of the Lane White NOW into double figures Louisville back in front 6362 at the next stop with Peter carry will return for Syracuse we have yet to see Kyle cuff the Kansas transfer Bell strong to the rim missed it Lille with Applause it gets the handle picks up the dribble in a tough Applause spot and now the Cardinals reset again heres that match up Clark into a double team and hes called for traveling heres the hardest thing that Adrian arry has with bell bell is a big time shot maker all right but hes got to do other things hes got to defend hes got to STP back and defense hes got to rebound the basketball right he cant he cant be a one trick opponent he could he could really impact winning if he just does some of the intangibles a little more consistently toopan tough shot and the contact theyll have a chance for three all right d you watch this team a lot full disclosure new house graduate yeah all right change speed change Direction thats what good players do boom change direction because of his size has ability to finish right there you watch this team the ball has got to end up in terms of playmaking situations in this kids hands yes if he can make just a couple of shots he has a really good feel and a good pace and that would take pressure off of of Judah Mi and as you observed the shoot around today he has a good shot it just hasnt translated into a better percentage in game now watch watch when the ball goes on the rim right now straight line drive off a close out in his Zone you k did not give up a straight line drive terrific job Patience by Louisville ball reversal hland lost it windes up going into the front row along the Baseline and the Cardinals are back in front 6564 Louisville on the road giving the orange all it can handle for the Louisville Cardinals theyre scoring by class what do you make of the numbers in front of us here Seth well this is a foundation now you got to build around this Foundation As you move forward at Louisville basketball but youve got a solid foundation James can score and Trey Ws been absolutely terrific at the start of the second half he had a couple of isos where hes got to the front of the rim uh they posted him some but if youre continuing to build if you can find the right guys in the portal and you find an elite high school player and you build them around veteran players if everyone can return then you have a foundation and thats the key now can they compete compete and can they do it consistently thats the challenge and not just putting up numbers but efficient numbers well specifically Trey white you know he was a starter on an NCA tournament team last year at USC he made the Pack 12 all freshman team average nine points five rebounds now that hes back healthy after missing a few games in January for Kenny pay he continues to evolve only one of the better players for the Cardinal Williams making that turnover but I like the the other Louisville players walking up to him going lets go next play which is what you want to see from your more experienced upper class cand rejected the screen and then got rejected himself trying to do too much Clark left alone the elbow another easy two for number 55 in Black got to stop the basketball transition first world defensive transition stop the ball big possession right now coper last two possessions hes tried to make hard Applause plays little stagnant right now Syracuse tend to shoot Taylor trying to work on Williams now with four to shoot starlings going to have to initiate good defense by the Cardinals who lead by three with a basketball carry pick up the foul hes got his hands full with that match up Down Low by number 23 you look at this Syracuse lineup right now whos going to make jump shot whos going to knock starlings got to be and cops got to be a facilitator it be interesting when Adrien archery brings back mince and when he brings back Bell had a really good good workout this morning with Jerry mcmo thats a blocking foul as Copeland barreled down the lane James slow to get up but he seems to be okay and heres the thing I want to see a bench engaged I want to see a bench that is excited I want to see a bench thats locked in and this is the thing when youre trying to establish a culture and and a standard you know you talk about what happened this past week with Benny Williams and and the susp and being suspended from the team well you know what its not a right of passage to put that Jersey on its a privilege you you play for those who played before you these guys that you got 10 minutes to go in this game its a two or onepoint game these guys need to be locked in engaged so when their numbers called theyre ready to go theyre ready to go then if theyre not in the game they need to be basically invested in the game with their teammates got it you got it you got it got one out of two from Bader coland back to a twopoint game lville continues to dominate The Glass its now 31 to2 the orange has just two rebounds in this half Clark for three theres rebound number three for Syracuse this half Le Brown pulls it down heres JJ Starling with the basketball Taylor cut off by Applause James Hopeland gets to the basket and draws the Applause Music foul cul does a good job of using his body hes got legitimate size he made that big three against Miami you would think that would have given him some some confidence but hes got legitimate size sees over the defense just got to make simpler plays well during practice yesterday red ay said to his sophomore point guard ball fake less pass more quickly and I found that interesting as he makes the first Saturday night the nothing but net crew will break down the day in the AC see with highlights and Analysis of every mens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule in the coming week thats coverage you can only find in one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN we talked to Jerry mcir about that very same thing again today at shoo around what do you think about that coach I think its well I think its really important I mean I basically you get you get in the lane you get a pain touch your decisions really simple score it or move it sky Clark oh my God Huntley Hatfield gives Louisville the lead Once Again Carrie cant rebound to basketball I mean they absolutely getting crushed on on the glass Copeland to the rim trying to find Brown out of bounds off of Syracuse back to Louisville well this is a Syracuse team that will ride or die with his sophomore class its remarkable the the roster makeup as sophomore point guard Jud minz comes back in no points from a senior no points from a freshman this year with a dismissal of Benny Williams that is a junior now off the roster these guards have got to get engaged rebounding the ball Tyler Johnson the reigning ACC fman of the week got it on the rim and finished off by Trey white where did he come from he came from the perimeter you cant follow the flat of the ball when the ball is shot great job by Trey White Mintz will go back to the line the foul called against Applause Clark Trey Ratt at a tremendous second half look on the left hand side youre seeing dribble penetration look where hes coming from hes coming from the 45 degree angle no one finds him no one puts a body on him everyone follows to fly to the ball great job of Trey white getting to the glass 10 of his 15 points have come in the second half you see hes got a double double very efficient for the sophomore from Dallas really like the way Louisvilles playing I mean theyve attacked matchups theyve attacked the Zone better when they havent turned it over theyve been aggressive on the offensive glass basically what theyve done is theyre taking advantage of their strengths can you impose your strengths on your opponents weaknesses and thats exactly what theyre Applause doing 21 Point Second Chance points right now for Applause loville good job of keep it in front thats better on the Block Williams rising up James com from the weak side had it momentarily Syracuse now with numbers three on one and mince finishes in transition Tyler Johnson Huntley Hatfield will head back to the free throw line under 8 minutes remaining in quite the entertaining ball game tied at 71 with no perc tied at 71 their turnovers 15 of them that helped Syracuse stay in the ball game and the scoring of Chris Bell has helped keep the orange close hes got 24 points one off his career high but he has been on the bench for quite a while here in the second half coach yeah Chris Bell is a talented shot maker but he cant be more than he cant just be a shot maker and I think Adrian Ary he trying to get his attention hes trying to say son you are really talented we need you if were going to have a chance to win this game or to be successful but youve got to be more than just a guy thats can come and make shots you got to Sprint back on defense you got to help us rebound the ball you got to make the right play and I think whats going to happen is hes going to challenge him eventually hes going to get him back in the scame body language is going to be really important now look if he pushes back and gives B body language you put him back in the game youre sending a bad message youre sending a message that you know that type of behavior is is is tolerated so this will be really interesting last8 minutes for Syracuse and for Chris B body language in terms of how he sit on the benches engag with his teammates so he can earn the right to get back in the game is going to be the big thing we just saw there assistant coach Alan Griffin go down and talk to Bill what do you think that message might have been coach get your head out of you know what be engaged in the game be a good teammate right stay positive and when your names called and coach goes to be ready to play and you see him his reaction just then a little hand clap more engaged be locked in and be ready so uh Bell watches his classmate Malik Brown at the line 72 from the foul line this year oh yeah there struggled from the line again the last five games coming into this one Syracuse has only been 64 from the charity strip for right now Applause tonight back to a onepoint game 735 on the clock and now Bell com to the scores table and I think the fans here in the dome react to that now that hes back up off the bench thats a good job of Staff coordination Adrian Griffin coach challenged him probably a little bit thats a CL out Louisville a team that doesnt shoot the three a lot has been lights out here Applause tonight make a play mince gets it blocked and thats by Kar Johnson its good defense its bad offense you get in the paint and make a play for someone else Clark M it here comes Syracuse again with numbers mince initiates the contact and earns a trip back to the free throw line another block against the Cardinals fourth foul on Clark the eighth against Louisville see the four fouls on Applause Clark and mince makes the second free throw Bell will come into the game lots of conversation here yeah one of one of the people on the line screened as he was about to shoot the free throw now bell comes in for Taylor now heres what Im watching Im not watching made of Miss shots for Bell right now is he going to Sprint back on defense will he stick his nose in and help him rebound will he sit The Stance and try to keep the ball out of the lane got to Mak free Applause throws love the way Louisvilles attacked the Zone I love the Poise and their shot selection ball movement at Browns going to be called for the reach in Music foul that is his third on OPP 16 foul against Syracuse next one will put Louisville in the bonus Applause Johnson passes inside another foul against Syracuse will send Williams to the free throw line Kenny pay has really done a good job controlling this game and the says watch on the left hand side of your screen or now the right hand side of your screen uh really good cut by Williams a nice pass crowd didnt like the uh replay they saw of Copeland going for the block shot he gets the personal Curtis Williams The Freshman from Detroit calmly sinks the free throw he was a top 100 recruit coming out of Brother Rice High School a year ago he gets one out of two rebound by Bell thats his fifth of the Applause night Applause Balls getting stuck right Applause now Starland tried to go behind his back lost it to sky Clark 7973 Applause Louisville make plays Applause ball is really getting stuck for for Syracuse right now every trying to make a play themselves and not make them play for each other great job defensive by loville theres an extra pass boy shoves it to Brown back out to Starling with a clean hook both teams its amazing if you make an extra pass and make a play for someone else the quality of your shot improves 76 like the little screen that Lille Applause set shot looked good from Johnson from our angle just a little too Applause long under 5 minutes remaining Brown left his feet had nowhere to go and threw it right into the hands of Williams Clark as it poked away fight for the ball it comes to Syracuse Starling safe it Mintz out ahead of the pass and hell have a chance for three and a chance to tie the ball game good job on the advanced pass really active defensively coming up with a 5050 ball little bit playing a little bit too fast a little bit out of control in this play good deflection right there Bell actually sticking his hand in getting the deflection and a very good pass right Applause there mince has now exceeded his scoring average the third leading score in the ACC at 182 per night and we tied once again at Applause 799 time called with 439 on the clock coach yeah and you know we talked the start of this game Adrian Archer saying the team that compete for the longest period of time both of these teams have had runs so what do you have to do in the last 4 minutes and 39 seconds both teams take care of the basketball both teams limit your opponent to one shot both teams keep the ball in front force a contested shot and then make plays for each other Syracuse gets good scoring opportunities because the ball had energy Louisvilles best offense has been getting to the offensive glass but how do you get to the offensive glass dribble penetration move the defense and good angles Louisville a little bit of foul trouble its going to be interesting to see these last 3 and2 minutes the impact Bell has on the game mince trusting his teammates Hunter Hunley Hatfield getting touches and then the ability to rebound the ball down to stretch for Louisville Cardinals have dominated the glass bman Bell has 24 points to lead all scores and Kenny Paynes team looking to stack victories got their second win in conference play the last time out on Saturday beating Florida State and try to make it two in a row coach ay trying to get his troops up with 439 to Applause go Johnson white and Clark around the perimeter for the Cardinals James works the high post Huntley Hatfield along the Baseline now he tries to post up brown as the ball goes around the perimeter Johnson inside Hunley hfield great pass F lock Brown itll be Louisville basketball with 11 to shoot really good offensive possession right there you got the ball to the middle of the Zone really good cut by Trey white on the Baseline and Bell see now up good engage and a good job of brown coming Applause behind nine to shoot mint goes for the steel Clark to the high post James turn tries to make the pass and with 410 of a second on the shot clock the whistle comes one one one and one I think that was a foul it goes against Trey white of Louisville that is a great job of Fanning and finding and thats where the f the foul was before the reach by copela but any chance we can get that one more time when that ball went to the high post you look at Judah Mintz he fans out and finds the open man and comes up with that stale watch right that Balls going to go into the post watch the balls going to go with the post watch number two excuse me its Starling right there really good job of Fanning out and getting to the open man and so starling makes the front end hell get the bonus solid night for the 64 sophomore from Baldwinsville New York who first met his head coach Adrien arrey when JJ was just seven years old calmly sinks a pair of free throws and Syracuse has the lead once again an 8 nothing Syracuse run to retake the lead how will Lille respond W is doing a really good job of going behind the defense Johnson was fouled and hell be shooting two free throws when we come back looks like its going right down to the wire here at the Dome the orange cling to a twopoint lead did you know you can get someone to shop for you reviewed to see if there was a flagrant foul committed on Louisville and Seth you just got the answer said it was a common foul I mean I its interesting right there because any shot above the shoulders with an elbow unless hes invaded there right there you see right there you see starl he invaded the cylinder and thats what created the contact so uh I think its its the correct call heres a look at the game so summary neither team has led by more than seven points its been tight throughout game of runs though bell with a 24 points one off his careerhigh Brandon Huntley Hatfield has made three threepointers to match his uh season total coming in last two games he has made all four of his threepoint shots the glass has been all Cardinals turnovers have been a problem for uh the cards what do you see here in the final 349 coach I think its really important if you hear Louisville its it is really important you continue to pound that thing in the paint dont settle and then get on the glass but you got to take care of the basketball if youre Syracuse got to make Lis you cant get something in transition or out of your defense youve got to make lville guard both sides of the floor and its got to be on a pass you got to make a play for someone else if everyones trying to make a play for themselves the ball gets Stu it loses energy and you end up with a late bad shot couple the big free throws by Johnson he now has nine points more importantly he re ties the Applause game Bell mince Brown Copeland and Starling this has been the closing Five for Syracuse for the last several weeks how the ball stuck short clock Bell h shot for number four and thats a new career high to put Syracuse back in front Big Time shot out of a basically almost a broken play but an unselfish play Copeland not taking a bad shot but making the next pass does Louisville have an answer three minutes to go in regulation James leans in doesnt get the bounce James had a hand on it but it goes out of BS back to Syracuse like now if youre Syracuse whats our best action can we get Bella a shot can we get Bell where they overcommit and then we play off of them overc committing maybe a back door cut or something like that the Louisville youre fine you just got to be solid keep it in front limited Syracuse to one shot defend without foul Johnson defending starling now Clark with mince everythings about trust right here possession ero Applause Syracuse Trey white is trying to tell the officials the arrow is wrong and that Louisville should have it but he does not convince Teddy Valentine and so it will remain with Syracuse with 233 to together all right 10 on the clock right now its either going to be a high spread ball screen or some type of stagger for Bell Min has got to stop playing with the ball you move your Defender and and then you want to attack every time hes played with the ball theyve done a good job of getting Underneath Him heres the ball in his Applause hands Starling a deep three he was fouled on the shot by Johnson a huge mistake made by the Cardinals point guard if they Im not mistaken that might be his Applause fifth if the balls for for for this Syracuse team they theyve got to get into things a little bit quicker and theyve got to have some type of movement off the ball when they get into those ball screams you know the defense is just locked in and shrinking so really makes it hard for mince to turn turn the corner and so kind of an extra timeout with the disqualification on fouls by Tyler Johnson and Syracuse has got three free throws coming up for JJ Starling who on the year coming in at 70 now heres the thing Williams is coming in for Johnson Williams is a better threepoint shooter the balls going to be in Sky Clarks hands another big body who can get to the offensive glass maybe a guy that can d and get a deflection not a great defender though but a guy who can make a shot so Starin makes these threes you go back Zone you got the one guy the two guys basically you cant let catch and shoot you cant let Williams you cant let get James get a catch and shoot Starling is two for two now three for three from the strike Applause tonight Applause you know Syracuse assistant coach Jerry mcnamer Mike Hopkins longtime assistant under Jim beheim now the head coach in Washington used to hold a camp a Hoops Academy at the Mellow Center non recruitable for young kids Starling was one of those kids and here he is now 15 years later making three big free throws for his hometown team hes improved so much during the course of this season die Clark into a triple team back outside Huntley Hatfields have the hot hand but not there ball bounced around and it comes to Applause mince two minutes to go ser in no hurry with the ball and the sixpoint lead theyre going straight flat ball screen for Copeland and nice good job of making the right Applause Music Applause play got to know where James and Williams are from the elbow hell have a chance for three big shot for the Cs really good job of that high screen and great job of coming off that screen hard watch right here you move the defense a little bit to the right when you bring it back theres the step up screen by Hatfield great job of Clark using the screen playing more downhill getting his feet Underneath Him great execution move the Zone One Direction bring it back screen the outside of the top Defender now you got to take care of the basketball inbound the basketball and make a good decision on the other end really nice play by Louisville a great job by Kenny pay Clark now a perfect three for three from the line and Louisville calls timeout well as soon as we are done here in Syracuse we will send you chance to see the Duke Blue Devils take on the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame we talked about it in the first half the Blue Devils lost on Saturday to North Carolina how will they respond how will Kyle filipowski respond against a very good as you see freshman point guard Marcus B uh Burton for Notre Dame theyre not going to match up headtohead but Bart Burtons a handful yeah I think the big thing right now Kyle Phil pasy hes got to get to the next play Its almost like golf you know I mean shortterm memory you got to be more assertive more aggressive play with a greater base and then Tyrus Proctor I thought Tyrus Proctor really struggled against North Carolina Duke turned the basketball over did a poor job a defensive transition and we out toughed against North Carolina playing in simple they were out toughed the the game when the game got physical when the game got tough Carolina came up with plays it started the first play of the game when they went inside the Bon so I think that they probably had a pretty tough set of practices but this is a big game because you know every time beam goes to you know Cameron its a big game it is and so coach beheim along with Cory Alexander and West Durham will be part of the broadcast team coming up at 900 and Coach beheim will be back in here inside the Dome on Jim beheim Court later this month when Notre Dame is in town it will be Jim beheim day and hes only been back in the dome once he came when Dave Bing went up in the Ring of Honor his old teammate and good friend and Coach beheim already up in the Ring of Honor but it will be Jim beheim day February 24th how long have they had the Ring of Honor just a couple of years not been long how can theyve B not going in the first class in the Ring of Honor about the same thing and uh from what I understand the pandemic threw off timing of things and so Bing rightly went on earlier this year Copeland was tripped in the back court and another Louisville player fouls out its Mike James who has his night come to an end and thats huge for Louisville they really dont have anyone that they can replace him with theyre going to probably put in Glenn whos a freshman inexperienced doesnt have the experience the toughness and hasnt been in these type of situations the culin stpp at the line not a great free throw shooter yeah James is is the leader of this team third year sophomore sat out a year with a Med medical red shirt because of an Achilles injury and certainly they will miss him for the final9 of Regulation so now if you Kenny Payne youve lost two of your guys Johnson and James out Clark one more and hell be disqualified where do you turn at this point for Louisville its going to be white and Hunley Hatfield I mean that look the balls got to go through the post right now theres no doubt about it and then maybe Williams knocking down a jumper Scott Clark came off that high ball screen did a really nice job last possession I would think the ball would be in Sky Clarks hands space in the court with Williams and put Huntley Hatfield in some type of screening situation with white trying to get to the offensive glass or playing off that post pass Caleb Glenn The Freshman from Louisville Male High School has come into the game to replace Mike James Copland missed the first heres the Applause second theres the ball screen at the elbow and the rescreen watch when sky Clark gets it Applause back this shots been Louisvilles best offense Clark uses the screen and hits the three three we said that outside screen of the Guard you got to fight over that you cant melt off of that screen really nice job of screening and clog again with this lineup hes got to be the guy to make a play I dont like they got to switch make plays for each other both of these teams you got to make plays for each other B screen from Brown mint picks up his dribble bell with a good shot face and a wide open look and nailed it hes made every shot but now he got to get back on defense Bel can make shots if hes energized in every part of the game as he is with with his shot preparation thats a big thing not a great offensive possession but a good job of finding the right guy means takes the screen pivots creates an angle good job of belt creating a passing line what I call getting into the window you know theyre going to close out on them hard so so a little shot fake notice how he moved the defender with his Applause eyes now get back on defense thats great you know three goggles veins cheers kisses get your tail back on defense and get a stop well now 30 points for Bell hes been terrific eight of 10 shooting from diston let me ask you youre a youre youre not a fan youre a broadcaster but you followed Syracuse I mean youre graduate new house you grew up with this basketball program yeah you see a guy like Bel you see his ability to make shots yet he leaves you wanting more it tantalizes you and you dont even have to be a Syracuse Alum to see it with the physical skills he has and his shooting ability he tantalizes you and thats the problem that Adrian Archer and the STA they see this and say we just want more great body great length good enough athlete give us just a little bit more and thats a late close out and Miss wh black out with the big tip in its back to a twopoint game shot clock is off now get the ball to the guys who can make free throws make simple plays Min where are you off and Louisville with a basketball Clark attacks blocked by Bell Syracuse has it thats the play you want to see B may thats EX exactly to play as a coach running it down and making a play that if hes capable of making that play thats why you always want more from him but Judah minz like you cant make that turnover you cant make that decision watch out where are you going son thats plain and simple where are you going you have the ball time and score read the defense but what a great I mean this look at the play mint make uh Bel makes in the rundown and I love the reaction of his coach the thumbs up to his player but thats sitting him on a bench and basically trying to send a message that we expect and want more from you big free throw here to make it a two possession game couldnt do it Louisville with a chance to tie foul given in the back court by Starling Applause early how many fouls Cardinals were looking to call time out Kenny Payne is saying he got to the front Court we should get the ball here on the sideline out of bounds but Starling seemed to give up that foul in the back court theyre in the bonus did is the timeout called before I think thats the question they were trying to get it before the foul Im Kenny Pam say say wait a second my man got fouled make two free throws now you can get you you can get a trap and a foul and and and and stay in the game now youre the twotime ACC coach of the year in situations like this defensively do you foul or just play straight up five under five so not yet yeah not too too early to foul heres the ball heres the advaned Kenny Paynes calling he hes now you could see he he actually called the timeout before the foul I dont know what what what Mintz was thinking fouling right there Applause though they there they have the ability to go back and review exactly and we can stop it we in a way we can spot Shadow Kenny pay hes on the right hand side of your screen I guess he called the timeout Advance look at him on the left hand side of the screen hes saying bring it bring it and now watch him right there hes calling timeout he called timeout prior prior to the foul really good job with the officiating crew working together so they have 12 point one on the clock Syracuse should be manto man switch everything if they can turn a ball handler right here in the back court thats good you force him in the back court keeping in flat its a switch and a contest Clark for the tie hes got it here comes Copeland 5 seconds and its blocked from behind theyre going to count the basket its a goal tending call that will give Syracuse the lead back and with that call the officials will go and review it at the monitor if you really good job and you switch up you dont want a foul and that is a big time shot and great execution from that angle it didnt look like it hit the glass heres the problem is thats Caleb Glenn trailing the play and and Brown gets to follow right if the whistle doesnt blow Syracuse gets the easy two on the putb but the whistle BW three seconds a long time will the goal contend call stand I dont think I dont think it was a goal tender I dont either I think it was on the way up and it didnt hit the glass and if they agree with us theyll take those two points off the board off the board and and give Syracuse the ball with three or four seconds to go no matter what they come up with TimeWise heres what these are two plays now where are you going youre headed field Veer out dont have to score those two points just Veer out and now all of a sudden youre running two seconds one second its a one its a 1 second game like just keep you like keep your dribble alive and take take it right underneath the backboard games over games over you could say well you know its a fourpoint game you finish its a four you dunk it its a fourpoint game all right the officials have come to a Music determination theyre counting the basket wow Cel so two points for quader Copeland they count the basket and so now Louisville with 810 of a second put back on the clock will have 38 to try and either tie it or win it now time is called by Syracuse I I Im Im confused here that three tied it tied it Syracuse retook the lead on the missed theop missed a free throw so the goal 10 right now is the difference in the game and Syracuse uses its last timeout to set up its fullcourt defense against Louisville that has already lost two of its key players 38 seconds is a long time by the way math was not my my strong point in fly deck Harvard on the hacking sack Harvard on the hacking sack didnt teach me to speak very well either so you got to turn the ball handler in the back court you cant foul obviously in the back court uh look for to try for Kenny Payne to try to get the ball on the run to sky Clark and then step up and set a screen for Clark to try to get him downhill but hes got to catch the ball on the run now he might catch on run one dribble and advances to James but that thats youre going to try to get the ball on on it like basically what I call a shallow cut now the other thing that could happen is someone will screen for him on this shallow cut theyll hit the screener who will then Advance pass it to Clark on the Run lets see how they set up and Ill give you a better understanding of of what theyre going to do no timeouts remaining for Louisville so theyve got to get it in with Caleb Glenn against the 611 sophomore Peter Cary whos come off the bench to Def defend watch 55 here he is hes catching on the run and heres going to be the screen clar has it heres the screen there is front looks up at the clock puts it up no and thats your ball game Syracuse wins it 9492 on a
