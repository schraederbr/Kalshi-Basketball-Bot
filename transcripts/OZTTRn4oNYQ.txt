you possibly can but it starts here on a Tuesday afternoon and Mike young likes this building you know why Mike young likes this building his first ever conference title as a head coach with the wford Terriers was in this building they captured a Southern Conference Crown here at the Spectrum Center back in the day by the way the tea dogs are going again huh wer a winter last night Nashville in the Southern Applause Conference Miss shot by the Golden Bears this will be they played to a threepoint game on January 11th at hos Pavilion in Berkeley Ben Hammond has had to guard and take on some big point guards throughout his ACC tomby lewow welcome to the ACC tournament and the two small thats why is Toby La wow yeah it is you got to make sure you pronounce the wow at the end of it because Toby makes plays as such I even saw the Hall of Famer over there yeah chair when he saw that last time we saw him get that excited he was getting thrown out of a game to Kon indor Jee wow thats a throwback heres sto yakovich 100 years ago on the perimeter oh it wasnt that long ago I tell you what and you didnt get up this high but you got off the ground Toby the wild driving and is able to finish strong and as coach mentioned on the way back just throws out a little too small in case anyone was wondering Tyler Johnson the foul a minute in heres the Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC The Freshman from just outside of Atlanta Jeremiah Wilkinson coming off a career high 36 in that four overtime game against noted a so hes playing confident basketball looking to get going blackshire inside sasoko went for the hammer and hes going to draw the foul and it is on Jaden young and Coach thats why you used to always ask your bigs to go dunp the basketball right dunk it dont go up soft and they wont call it you have to try to take it that way so here is M Soko grad transfer from Michigan State to the line hes a 68 free throw shooter California was ninth in the ACCC at 746 through the regular season WD Im walking through the tunnel in the back coming from you know getting my pre mid game snacks sure see might Soko go to DAP him up yeah youre lifting me off my feet almost said hey put me down man that dude is strong by the way sasoko whos observing Ramadan has not had anything to eat or drink since sunrise and will not be able to drink during this game so of course hydration is always going to be huge when youre observing Ramadan for guys especially playing in the middle of the day game yeah Jim by the way yes he was into the third overtime the other night before he could have anything thats thats hard to do yeah heres blackshire now in the corner petritis who has struggled as of late from behind the threepoint line and Soko had it lost it off his leg out of bounds it will go to the Hocus but you see how much pressure Soko puts on opponents by going to the offensive glass hes been one of the best in the ACC of getting second possessions for his team little backourt pressure by Wilkinson you see the starting five Jaden Youngs been on a tear Hammond Johnson a freshman the wall a transfer potit the most veteran piece on the floor for Mike young sneaky move through the Baseline skip out heres young catching shoot back rim knocked away slapped out by Migel potit or he and Soko inside will be entertaining that is going to be a battle between two big guys in the paint trying to carve out space Hammond weaving around spot up at 16 ft is good Pressman from Northern Virginia Ben Hammond on the board you cannot drop coverage in those ball screens hes getting easy shots betrus heres Wilkinson Soko sto yakovich and Blacker on the floor from Mark hson heres Andre sto yakovich double team on the Dig Down five to shoo and he lost the handle on it saves it petritis a launch H the side of the glass ahoko recovers nope shot clock violation says Eric Lewis good call so its a 42 game potit will come out and Patrick wesler who grew up just east of Charlotte out Highway 74 in Matthews North Carolina Checks In For the First Time wearing number five we got a shot of Mike young earlier of course one an ACC tournament Championship I believe that was in Greensboro last was in Brooklyn okay he went to the to the city never sleeps heres young spot up good Jadon young five straight double figure games for young averaging 172 points and shooting 46 from three and the amazing part about that WD he was coming off about 10 straight games where he couldnt get in double figures but really found his offense late in the season heres sto yakovich trying to answer and Andre sto yakovich he is so struggled as a late he has struggled when its a big shot for him to make right there he has struggled but good sign for St yakovich knocking down that three early in this game see if that gets him going on the offensive end as coach mentioned hes not been the same player since coming back from illness and injury heres lewow spinning inside through it pass wesler Johnson to recovery look at the athletic Tyler Johnson Drive for the basket freshman on the board yeah Tyler Johnson may be a freshman by classification but he doesnt play like one and it double double earlier this year and was big in the win that Virginia Tech had at cow there goes Wilkinson through a double team and draws the foul on Ben Hammond thats going to carry us to a timeout third foul on the hokes Virginia tech8 Cal five and sh problem with me when I was playing that they werent invented yet so there was no you cant count they also didnt have wheels used to roll around on rocks at that point three balls stovic now heres the Andre sto yakovich that walked into 2025 as one of the five best players in the ACC yes he he began December he was on fire you consider his ability to shoot the basketball and what he does defensively as well a couple of 30point games for him on the season and also a great start here in his first and Cs first ACC tournament westler trying to find room on sasoko throws it up there heres Andre the son of the great Pia St yakovich longtime NBA veteran into the front court and heres his running mate and also a bucket a bucket if you get these two going at the same time yeah watch out Charlotte and Im not just talking about this game you get both those guys going and get on a heater like this it might be problems its a team that could possibly take this thing down to the wide Far Side catching shoot for Jaden shoot spins out theyre going to scramble on the deck petritis got rid of it heres stov check time oh he wants to you know what NBA players kids play the right way Id get it back to zero heres Wilkinson against Rex Steiner fights through a double team Dums it inside sasoko is fouled by wesler Jeremiah Wilkinson Cory Im a huge fan his explosiveness overcomes the size right just his ability to get up but heres the other thing too its not just the action plays in the shoot game for him it feels like he wants to make plays other ways too did hes gotten better and at times we saw him he really struggled but but he hes off to a good start as is stanovic hes the ACC Sixth Man of the Year because for the first 18 games of the Season he came off the bench right in his last 13 games as a starter hes averaging 21 points per game and so youre talking about a young man who has truly had a great freshman year from Mark Madson a cal a all ACC rookie throughout this year and as much as I hate to say it hes going to be a highly after even if he doesnt go in the portal theyre going to try to come after him regardless Cs going to have to get some big hitters involved to keep him in their program by the way the note at the bottom you have to go all the way back to the great Shar Abdul Rim a freshman who has filled it up like Jeremiah Wilkinson has share part of that 96 draft class which of course the greatest NBA draft class and that was Shar as a one and done yeah hopefully we see Jeremiah back in college next year there he should and that is a foul on blacker and Rex Steiner and Joon blackshire got tangled up out there on the perimeter well I think these three officials are are using their whistles in the first game they werent really using talk about the officials when when they have been good heres heres poti with the say that malijah losing their whistles Elijah only two points on his in his last game at Clemson so Im sure hes looking to have better fortunes here tonight averaging over nine a game he had 12 in the meeting at Berkeley back in early January for the hokes who won 7168 Campbell had it knocked in the air they battle for it and its a turnover on the Bears Cal leads by three and heres the sharp shooting Rex Steiner whos kind of been a hot or cold perimeter shooter Soph more from outside of Atlanta Hao earlier got the basketball to him late once he was outside of his post position Jaden young gets one to roll for hes gotten better all year every game hes gotten better and hes another one of those guys thats kind of stayed the course you know stuck with Mike young didnt get into the transfer portal and now found himself with a nice roll for the Hokies this season so onepoint lead for Cal heres Wilkinson blers had pretty good scoring success recently and he is fouled by Rex Steiner and Joon blackshire is going to go to the line to shoot a couple Brandon Rex Steiner his first five now on the hes Virginia Tech starting to stack some fouls here in the first nearly seven minutes and you got to save all those fouls cuz you got to deal with Soko and dor on the interior and they put fouls on team just trying to keep them off of the offensive glass get a look at Mike young who is always one of our favorites to talk to hang out with as he eats his popcorn pregame blacker knocks down the free throw coach did you have any pregame superstitions like that like coach young likes to come out so watch yeah um several more than I want to talk about thats just it we just get youve been retired a couple of years you can share one or two Ive got 20 I we dont have enough time to go into home we didnt have so we had to have 20 superstitions theres a drive potit on a block by Dort couple of free throws from Elijah po what time to get to the building what time to come out what time to sit down what time to what socks to wear which yeah this collision between two big guys in the painted area Dort and poti theres nothing petite about potit and when you consider these two guys coming together like that its going to be some furniture move in WD heres potit 73 does not have enough conversions to be listed among the ACC leaders but he is Virginia Tech he knocks down his first point Mike young talking to Toby lewow who is at the hok bench and I think getting ready to come back in 77 it wouldnt he wouldnt be listed if he had a th000 free thrs second one for potit gives him four and here is low back in the game to replace poti so were tied at 14 now with the hokes and bears thats one of the things weve seen from Mike young this year hes played a rotation of about 10 guys gets a lot of action out of his bench Dort back for blackshire heres Wilkinson Jeremiah trying to get by Hammond draws the foul second on Ben Hamond six now on the hokes and Rex Steiner right back to the scores table coming back in now if you get look we were talking about Wilkinson and sto yakovich blacker had some scoring success in the last six ball G Clos in the regular season Mark Matson when the offense is good thats when theyre trouble thats really it they have difficulty scoring at times go through droughts but when you got Wilkinson and sto yakovich both knocking down threes early in this game theres an offensive foul on Cal theyre going to get Dort yeah Lee Dort draws another one thats his second hes the first bear with two on the third of Team wise I think I think there was a conversation in the locker room to the officials about making some calls in this gamee and getting the game under control early and theyve theyve pretty much done with heres Rex Steiner Ben Burnham Checks In For the First Time 67 senior transfer from nearby Fort Mills South Carolina three ball for young and sto yakovich another rebound Andre for Wilkinson quickly heres DJ Campbell who transferred from Western Carolina to Berkeley Fall Away rattled out Dort trying to stuff it back wow a lot of Miss dunks today out of the corner Jaden shoot air ball and a couple of those Dort got right back down the floor for the rebound oh you got to be the first guy by DK you have to be the first gu wow slapped that off the glass and for any of you who are seeing Toby wow for the first time he has a 48 in vertical lead so when you see him with his head around the rim thats nothing new for him let me tell you this hes also in only about his fourth year of organized basketball honored for senior night yeah was a little awkward well I mean I think of it like this Montgomery coach Madson did a great job he and was kind of involved in Matson being hired at Cal heres Rex Steiner and he is fouled by Wilkinson yeah so let me tell you why that is because Montgomery mhm after a stellar career at Stanford right went to the NBA correct and then came back to college thats right at C correct thats a move thats like Rick patino Kentucky NBA Louisville there you go foul on Wilkinson by the way free throws by rexin theres a lot of Cal Stanford Mixology that goes on it really is I mean a lot more than you get in most rivalers okay and everybody seems to be okay with it Jim which is interesting you mean Carolina guys arent going to Duke we havent had that yet weve had State guys go to Carolina from the 40s and 50s and 30s and now weve dant styles with a stop at Georgetown but we havent had the Duke Carolina thing yet yeah but youll never have youll never Dont Say Never in this world I will never have a Duke guy coach at Carolina and you will never have a Carolina guy coach at Duke Im putting never on that one too Im putting never in a day Telly what you guys be careful what you say about todays world speaking of the Carolina look weve already got Boozer and Barry sitting over there yeah but when they get behind the scenes they punching each other in the face twopoint lead for Virginia Tech Rex Steiner got one of the two and heres Wilkinson off that foul a moment ago petritis uhoh against lewow with the right hand tough shot and a hokey foul thats the NBA whist a little late lets see if he makes it Wild coach I mean you know Eric Lewis also was a NBA referee so if anybodys going to make that call it would be Eric again I I like it if it forc if the contact forc you to miss the shot yeah but if its the a foul then you call it right then whether it goes in or not should not be relevant you got to make the call but then youve got coaches like Jim beim on the sideline screaming hes already got two fouls dont call that you see what I mean I never worried about it cuz we zoned him up anyway so we didnt never foul you know what you always have that great point to come back always petrius hits them both and Cal has tied the game at 16 we see this often from Cal after a made free throw going to the full for pressure sooko not up far enough to keep the basketball to be easily inbounded for poti they got Kristen Tucker on the floor now to spell blackshirt in the Bears lineup he wears 22 for Coach Matson 15 to shoot for potit almost turned over re Steiner chases it down against the aforementioned senior from MCE Arizona Tucker heres potit against Soko and motty is going to pick up his first great defense ruined by the reach in 15 foul on M sasoko and were going to get free throws again for Migel potit potit by the way a year ago against the league averaged seven and a half points and four rebounds this year better than nine and right at about four hes had seven double figure games in conference BR a lot of his success credit he lost 20 PBS in the off Seas remember now you know Lyn kid left like right after the season ended a year ago got in the portal Mike young knew he was developing wesler but wanted to give potit the Reigns of it Cory but he had to go get in better shape he absolutely did and you think about the way that bigs have developed yep under we go back to Kev Luma think about Kev Luma who was an all ACC performer sure was you think about ly kid malija Fati guys have gotten better yep as theyve been at Virginia Tech over time theyve been able to come in and these are guys who transferred in who have become strong performers on the front line wesler wesler checks in by the way for potit and the Hoke lineup and Mike young coach a small school where you develop players so now hes doing the same thing blacker three bounds away wesler the rebound for the h so coach when you coach at a smaller School Mike young coming from Watford of course theres more responsibility on the head coach to be able to to be involved in Player Development Etc 100 so what youre saying is you didnt have to do that mean that you were at a humongous School you didnt have to worry about Player Development well the first 15 years we were before the Big East we were at a smaller kind of e school okay all right then I became a better Coach once we got in the Big East and got better players and you went big time and then you stopped having to worry about that you you know they always talk about guys winning championships and their players are good thats nobody wins championships without having good players very true no one yes its not by coaching this combination of both Tucker the foul he checks out promptly little Zone here by the Bears coach yeah they dont see much of that anymore WD you remember when Mark Madson first saw coach and he was talking to him about the Zone I remember that he went back and put some work into it sure did here goes Hammond on the drive that was rejected petritis blackshire and the Bears trying to find transition Oh I thought Andre was going to pull the trigger should have hes two for two and now he drives it all the way in got his own rebound and scores and Im sure people recognize how big St Yakov is when you see him you walk up beside him hes a legit 66 but he plays has the ball handling of a much smaller guard but you see him inside amongst the trees he can handle his bit heres young C in front of basket Jaden young trying to push Virginia tack back in front he does six first half points for young who played to Greensboro Day School for the great Freddy Johnson the winning is High School coach in North Carolina by the way and want to stay champion this year correct sure did with Ace Flag a flag yeah the one minute older twin brother of Cooper about that 1918 blackshire now boy Hammond having to work against the veteran blacker missed everything and it bounds away from sasoko its going to go to the hes Joon and so Soo talking as they go back down the floor but I love Mark Madson up at half court encouraging his players to get back and play defense after what wasnt a beautiful offensive possession sticking with the script young another three Soko the Applause rebound hoki by a point sto Music yakovich black are on the bounce Ahsoka look at mty turn oh wesler caught him right on the dribble and forced the turnover yeah wesler holding his ground there isoko leading the basketball behind him the easy turnover and steal for West trying to initiate the offense boy Hammond lost it heres blacker hes got sto yakovich if he wants him shot faked twice and scored how about that Jon jobon blackshire fifth lead change of the half Cal back in front another defensive battle here in this second game whoops Hammond and black here lining up Music Applause here now Hammond tried to get the pocket pass wesler the catch low lost it on the dribble and Petr has had it lost it Johnson recovers out of the scrum and scores only two turnovers in this game for Virginia Tech almost a third there but thats been an issue for Mike Youngs team throughout this season but and maybe even having to beat the Blue Devils in the championship because if they make it to the finals they will have beaten either Clemson or Louisville most likely well if Clemson can make it there they should move up in seeds get off the four five and get into the three seed really and for Wake Force youre going to have to win the whole thing to find yourself in the NCAA tournament yeah onepoint game hok in front and the ball after the Miss out of the corner by blackshire Johnson for potit heres Jaden young whos been tough today yes he has been very aggressive not only with the three but getting downhill as well thats the second foul on they definitely chance they free throw by Young is good by the way the first two wins dont even help them Carolina a little bit but not really well it helps them more than losing they dont have a chance oh yeah thats that thats a good point they have one win against UCLA New York UCLA New York right I think theyre one and 10 thats 11 now one and 11 thats not good eight and a half for young he leads the hokes who are ahead by three dor who replaced the sooko on his second foul a moment ago look after knocking down that first three hasnt really been able to get going but offensive end Johnson the rebound The Freshman from Orlando Virginia Tech has been pretty good defensively all season long the problem is they turn the basketball over so much and thats a not characteristic of a Mike young coach team Jaden young a three out front petrius the rebound sto yakovich has had a couple flashes here hes got eight to lead Cal there goes Wilkinson feeding petrius missed it got his own rebound and scored give him an assist I me he missed oh oh no what we given is a conversation at halftime like hey when I pass to you if you cant make that shot Ill just shoot it next time there goes Burnham digging down drive right hand score for Ben Burnham then Burnham a thousand Point score coming in and playing his role Off the Bench for Mike young and and one of those you we talked about the 10man rotation that coach uses yep and often that gives you many options to see whos playing well and who needs to earn more minutes each and every night for Petrus leans in couldnt finish it strong defensive stand by Burnham though stay vertical on that possession yep heres Rex Steiner under five we go into Music half Dort trying to help out now young back along the Baseline Burnham with tend to shoot Applause now poti going to try and help young and heres Rex Steiner from the logo air ball no choice and so itll go back to Cal third turnover on Virginia attch but thats not awful they average 133 turnovers per game as Rex ler with a little smile I mean he just watched Steph Curry make those shots on this court not too long ago everyone should be a to do it right hey Brandons had some moments that might been a little too far for just a regular toll call sto yakovich bang hes found it he is found it yep heres the guy they were talking about right here we were looking at re knock down thats more so in his range but we got to remember now that the the cow Bears have been we wont say on the East Coast but in the East for a long time for over a week now yeah they started the trip to Louisville on Monday missed by Wilkinson yeah theyve been here uh basically the front end of eight and a half days right kick out three ball missing black are the rebound they played Louisville they we at South Bend Saturday for four overtimes and now here in Charlotte but that can be good for you its all basketball and again you probably have some class online but for the most part you get to concentrate on basketball been in two tough games patrus miss the layup got his own rebound again and scor Coach I think petrius might be doing this on purpose hes now pading his second time we miss a point blank layup only get a rebound the put back meanwhile Virginia Tech three is their first of the game theyre not shooting it well and heres Wilkinson look at yep those are the turnovers that get you beat turnovers are now two for five and getting a easy one like that we watched him knock down the three early that could get him going on an offensive tail Rex Steiner ball away against black are good boy Brandon Reiners put the last five on the board for the hokes hes got now seven in the ball game Applause Music and Virginia Tech back in front of Music Point Wilkinson against Burnham with five to shoot patrus bounds away got slapped around lewow finally collects it in front of Dort onepoint lead and two minutes to go here in the first half coach Im going to say that Toby LW has the loudest two points on one of one shooting yeah of the day of the day and Wilkinson second oh that ball through the wickets laa run it down eight to shoot trying to take Dort oh wrecked petritis reached in knocked it away ahead they go for blackshire sto yakovich against Burnham thats the way you attack a mismatch how about that thats it now hes playing the way he played earlier in the year 12 for Andre stojakovic why was their emphasis on that its the last game they played thats why I dont see a problem here I dont either man listen first The Fat Boys break up now it this I guess you need to maybe be the assistant coach or the head coach at Virginia I guess now you go starting stuff start that tonight we got time we only got about a half and a minute left to go in our campaign here we might as well get some Street rumors going yeah we can do that so do you want to bring up what B Mo sent us about that we have a little bit of Break In Action no were saving it for the second half Im going full tilt on y cuz Ive got Ive got receipts to to back up on the ACC historian has chimed in never he he said so much for never heres the heres the guy that did never again young the Fall Away what a half for Jon young hes been the guy for the h look he had 27 at Miami and it just kind of took off from there he then had 26 against s Wilkinson had it blocked look at Petrus hanging around again couldnt finish too close onepoint lead for the hokes we got two possessions left in the first half Rex Steiner on a standing dribble Tyler Johnson little entry pass for potit over dorton theres a foul on Lee Dort thats his third by my count thats the eighth on Cal po has been featured throughout this game and one of the ways to attack C is to try to get Dort and tsoko in foul trouble and Virginia Techs done a great job of getting the basketball in the hands of Po right three fouls on dork Migel has all three of his points at the free throw line and Soko has two fouls one field goal so going into the chest of Dort on that possession and for those who dont think thats a foul if the arms are not straight up when you bring them down that contact is going to be a foul but it five fouls right now combined between the two centers theat so now its a sevenpoint half for poti Youngs 10 Rex Steiner seven potit seven now heres black Shir small thing right now you dont want dor being a screen s especially playing with three fouls here this late keep him away from setting any screens blacks are going to initiate the play and heres will hson at the right with six into traffic kick out for blackshire on the dick down and lost it and poti had it in the horn sounds and the hokes are going to take a lead to the locker room 3431 Jaden young leads Virginia TCH seven of eight or nine of 11 at the free throw line Cal was seven of eight sooko on the floor to start the second half with two fouls Dort on the bench with three and the hes give it away so what would Virginia Tech do come out three on the first why not I like Mike young pulling up the the stool oh yeah tournament stool for Mike Applause young I thought you just needed those on the raised courts blackshire heres Soko Wilkinson with three to shoot squares up three ball away and good Jeremiah Wilkinson now with eight in the ball game they have a reason to shoot threes theyre making some well and Wilkinson who got that dunk late in the first half knocked down his first three but Im sure he came out got a couple reps in his halim warmups looks pure on the first Mike Young by The Ways gone to standing over there hes sh the school hes going back to the stool okay hes only going to be on the stool when his team is on the defensive end on the other end its almost like being in a defensive stance but with assistance well he cant be thrilled with the two possessions here you got a Miss three and now a turnover what I tell you oh hes in the stands he not even going to use the stool coach young is in The Stance while the team is on defense sasoko against potit b sasoko gets his first field goal to the ball game six now in his 155th career game here today thats a lot of college basketball played there the first Four Seasons at Michigan State yep that ball got deflected by sasoko blackshire tried to make a save the winner of this gets Stanford the seven SE Cal lost both of the regular season games against the Cardinal and Virginia Tech lost by 11 in early January but Cal and Stanford get together its called a big game so its a possibility well see a big game Eastern version of course they all happened to this point yeah in the great state of California be the first time we see a big game in Charlotte good thing we got uh Stanford Legend royalty Kim Bel royalty here we got a lot of cardinal influence read over todays game notes yeah a lot of Kim Bel theres a lot of Kim Belton in there yeah another guy I didnt recruit successfully yeah another guy shut the door on B yeah no here is STO yakovich tend to shoot Wilkinson out front now working on Hammond this is where you dont St wow over the top but thats a settle WD we knew what it was he was planning to shoot the three the entire time thats where you got to put it in drrive Kick to the corner young going to try the three ball long rebound petritis and he puts the Bears in transition with sto yakovich and a foul going to be called Isaac Barnett the whistle on Hammond third foul on the Freshman first of the half on the H its been getting physical down low you got the guards mixing it up Ben Hammond all of 510 tossing petrius to the ground I do believe petrius may have um oversold it maybe oversold it just a bit Yeah Music WD whatever he did theyre not calling it no they the officials are not going to fall for that one Wilkinson heres blackshire almost three minutes gone here in the second half twopoint lead for cow who Trail by three at the break you talked about blacker having success as of late offensively hasnt really been able to get going wow off the glass youre not going to get going challenging the wall at the rim no you got to punch it if youre going to score it cuz hell block it if you dont will Rex Steiner a three and Soko from behind Patrick wesler hows that threepoint shooting working for you not black shirt oh mismatch and now Soko with Wesley soft turn left it short everything was good until the release yeah it was good when if sasoko had opportunity to get the basketball earlier in the mismatch but westw can stand his ground against the SOA one of the very few that can about Johnson and sto yakovich now heres young oh and thats going to be another turnover on the hokus so Virg Virginia Tech whos got the three thats their seventh turnover they have not scored here in the second half but outscored 5 Nothing by Cal and turned it over a couple times missed two others in their forward possession and thats been the issue for the Hoke throughout this season Mike young the pillars of the program one of the things you dont do is turn the basketball over right he is quoted as saying we dont turn the basketball over here you hear it in practice all the time yet this season they have done it at record marks under coach young sto yakovich the Miss heres Johnson back for young and a whistle and a foul and thatll get us to a break in the action here and you just turn it over when you have a freshman point guard there was no League there was no rivalry and the guy ended up being a baseball coach so that none of that counts coach I I I first off WD with one on2 its them against us right here but now let me also throw this in the miid yeah World War I happened from July 28th 1914 to November 11th 1918 sure there was no one else here in the states to coach the thing because everyone was fighting in the war so they had to have they had to have someone coach at both schools but what coach and I said was it would never happen again again we were very clear today we in the history of the world remaining that we have a Duke Co the anyone from duke will never coach at the University of North Carolina and no one from Unity North Carolina will ever coach at Duke Im stamping it right now look Mike young look at all the people accomplishing greatness they got the Brotherhood shirts on and let you guys standing on your heads in the first half said nobody would ever go coach at Carolina and coaching Duke again and hat tip to ACC histori Brian mors Brian thanks Brian yeah beo beo took care of us with the chick do and by the way do field where NC State Elliot AV plays baseball named after chick but he found his calling after failing miserably in coaching basketball okay and Duke inada he found his calling a coaching baseball petritis Ms one of the two after the foul on Wester was his second and heres Young shooting to Tai and Burnham had the rebound saved it but to sto yakovich ahead on the break and Wilkinson cant get it to him across the floor Wilkinson has to find a way to get into the paint hes settling for jumpers throughout this game sto yakovich going off the bounce how about that we got a little uh something has come onto the floor well Soko putting it back into his short so that must be a part of his uniform yeah or maybe it was what we saw him injure his finger in the first half maybe had some type of bandage on his finger trying to put that back on 15 now for sto yakovich on his six field goal Andre is 6 for eight and three for three from three I think Virginia oh that was theres an offensive foul and thats on Burnham first on Ben Burnham fourth on the hokes and petrides didnt have to sell that one buram no Burnham committed that offensive fou right in front of Eric Lewis that was an easy call yep speaking of Eric Lewis Lewis shout out absolutely to his wife Vanessa Blair Lewis who the George Mason head coach yeah the womens team wi this team and qualifying and getting their bid to dance in NCAA tournament B away sto yakovich rolls off the rim we shout out Vanessa Blair Lewis we got to salute to theres Rex Steiner a twopointer on the Baseline they need to stick with the two theyre making some of theyre making most of the twos and almost none of the threes so lets do that the Patriots athletic director is former Georgia Tech basketball star Marvin Lewis Cory not related he is now retroactive Rex Steiner got oh almost in a foul I tell you what its just exciting to watch to this leave the floor hey this this Miss dunk attempt was so nice we absolutely have to show the replay absolutely this was not a good pass however when youre an athlete like that you make bad passes look great look how high he goes we talked about him putting his head in the rim and his head is right at The Rim on that possession WD sto yakovich first foul and and to Andres credit he stays off the poster and thats two possess two shot attempts today for laow right thats it a dunk and a miss the the only player that averages double figures for the hokes on the season and an ACC play and he has one field goal attempt and two free throws to show for it here in round one of the ACC Applause tournament transfer from BCU junior year from London terrific kid to visit with by the way too twopoint lead for Cal DJ Campbell to work look at him back down shoot and draw the foul on the Duke transfer play the fifth of the half on the Music hogies Toby lewow catalog here first of all how about the Miss dunks in the first game of Zack Austin yeah not just one but two missed opportunities from Zach Austin in a game that was decided by one point coko missing the dunk but I tell you what the Toby the wild dunk missed the Im okay with that one he got fouled made two free throws but more importantly just to be able to show that highlight again you know that thats thats must C Applause TV DJ Campbell who played for Justin Gray at Western Carolina year ago Jay great o Legend thank you youre wondering yeah also for for Deacon star yeah now the coach at Coastal Carolina ball got deflected away Mahoney got a hand on it here the Golden Bears with the turnover and in the front Court Burnham picks up Spencer Mahoney Spencer Mahoney a freshman from Brooklyn New York transferred from Washington State to Cal but didnt play in Washington St correct yeah Campbell a three bounds away and low covers it up fourpoint game just inside 13 minutes to go winner draws Stanford tomorrow ohow the catch and flush now thats a beautiful pass from Rex Steiner yep really manipulating the screen and roll keeping the defender behind him and drawing in the big man of course the ability to throw it anywhere for Toby L to be able to go get it five now for Lew twopoint lead for call and the ball in Wilkinson heres d oh wow foul on Toby will be his second thats the sixth on the hokes so theyre starting to uh pile up here but thats when you know the Personnel you recognize it you can put it pretty much anywhere you got a teammate that can jump well above the opposition to be able to finish it home hey we got to look at James Scott on some of that pick and roll stuff last week at Louisville the big kid that Pat Kel is going to bring in here on Thursday he and Toby could crush a pick and roll couldnt they they absolutely couldnt but they do it in different ways James Scott of course a little taller quite a bit taller than Toby low but Toby low with a 49 half reported vertical leap yeah and Johnson almost took his eye off of it after the sto yakovich bucket Andres got 17 in the game and theres his foul trying to defend Tyler Johnson itll be the second on sto yakovich and Jaden young is over there behind the bench the Virginia tght folks are peeking in on him from the sports medicine side oh boy the Thea gun uhoh to work got to stop and pause anytime the balls going to the W in the air look at Campbell fighting against shot hes going to get credit for two free throws and in the shooting in the act of shooting on shoot second foul seventh against the hes to do but Jim hes a guy that broke through the ceiling he I mean he paved the way for so many guys so many foul going to break was on shoot so here is DJ Applause Campbell and Carlos Boozer Leonard probably down there telling Boozer about a travel he got away with something like that or else hes telling him about you send your two sons to me I could still be coaching oh boy oh my Heavens heres Campbell at the line Second of the two rattled out and the wild goes and gets it Im sure somebody said that to coach bahim he was kept him to himself yeah yeah fivepoint lead for the Golden Bears shoot on the Block for laow petrius got a hand on it but Burnham collects Toby on the drive what a impressive move third field goal for the Junior from London but after only one field goal attempt in the first half which was the dump on the first possession of the game he was relatively passive throughout that first half and much more aggressive here in the second standing sto yakovich Bo Dort almost dropped it on his shoe tough to make their hand off I dont think Ds going to be a quarterback anywhere I dont think that would be the position for dor no but defensive end yeah tell you what Andre is having a game today number twos cash money with that pull up he really is and this is reminiscent of when he goes and gets 30 you know against Clemson so you talk about a guy who has had big games throughout this year eight of 11 from the field three of three from Beyond a threepoint R heres L got caught lost his balance Dort got shaken up on the play and Toby L lays it in hes got seven and the half half now nine in the ball game yeah Dan boner and I were at Little John tonight he got 31 against Clemson Cory yeah he was watching that game oh man we got the full catalog that night M heres another pull up a foul on L Toby L draws his third and that is eight on the hokes and Andre is feeling pretty good yeah Andre getting into his bag going to the midrange great footwork the nice pull up knocking down the two and then Toby L off the bounce attacking the basket no dunk this time going with the Finesse but still just as effective for a twopoint 10th best free throw shooter in the league and free throws are good for Andre sto yakovich well pesia was something now his dad a terrific terrific player in the NBA you see the career average AES 17 points almost five rebounds a game but I can tell you right now I played against Paia Andre a much better Defender than his dad wow Andre had six blocks and thats for overtime loss against Notre Dame on Saturday and averages close to two block shots per game so I dont know that pag ever blocked the shot in his entire NBA career PA will tell you he got paid to shoot this very true now will say this Andre nowhere near the shooter Baseline goes shoot Soko did enough to disturb it and the ball on the deck look at sto yakovich wrestle it from potit and possession is going to go to California Applause here and so the Golden Bears will take Music over and Wilkinson reports back for Campbell in Mark madsons lineup the thing thing you appreciate about the seconde head coach of the Bears is this everybody knew what the travel log was going to be right they sought all the expertise they could get NASA scientist sleep specialist everything involved not one time when we were around them during the regular season was it used as a prop or an excuse Cory Mark Matson is not about excuses he wasnt about excuses as a player and hes not going to be that way as a coach one of the things with certain is his team takes on his personality they were still one and eight on the road in the leag as well Stanford so its not easy to do that ball got raped away from sto yakovich turnover on the Bears fourpoint lead hoks looking inside at poti heres Tyler Johnson trying to make a move on sto yakovich spins back into sasoko and then potit threw it up there and the foul is going to be I believe on sasoko which will be his third and patite continues to stack up the fouls on the front line of the cow Bears y sasoko with three Dort with three personal fouls so that and all of that has been the byproduct of malal petite being very aggressive when he catches basketball in the post seven points but only one field goal doing his damage from the free throw line make it eight and poti missed a lot of games this year that hurt the J Tech him being out losing Rhythm and everything seven double figure games on the year from malija Applause poti and the second was good so now nine in the ball game for potit seven double figures I should say against the lead twopoint lead for Cal and the ball Applause here Blacker Applause now Campbell to work T to shoot DJ Campbell a kick out Wilkinson a three back rim Miss and poti the rebound and I think theyre going to get a foul called here believe theyre going to get petite on that one as Soko is trying to get the offensive rebound butti making contact Eric Lewis with the call lets get another look at this see the two big guys battling and at this point O actually got hit twice thats nine fouls by the way on the hok but those guys are so big as they battle I mean this is nothing intentional its just big guys battling in the paint its still hand to the face right it is still hand to the face and they got they got the call right no question about that remember the year when you have you hear anybody above the neck it was a technical and you were out of the game yes I do remember that that was great to work with sooko Mark madon talked to us about how Soko takes advantage of his opportunities at the free throw line right and he gets fouled a lot thats one of the things that you see from him because he goes after so many offensive rebounds often gets fouled and does a good job taking care of business once he gets to the free go strike hes just inside 90 minutes before the sunset so in observing Ramadan he hasnt had any water or food since sunrise and hes out here trying to win for Cal to play Stanford tomorrow and spending a tremendous amount of effort trying to get around poti hes unable to get that position and nice play by poti spinning often times you see so many different Defenders taking away the inside that going over left shoulder right hand jump Hook when youve got a guy that has a counter to be able to drop step or Spin and go off the glass you can get an easy bucket double figure game now for potit his eighth against the League this year8 minutes to play its a twopoint game Wilkinson thought about it kick back for Campbell three away and petritis the rebound from behind burnam and the stick back how many feel goals does Rus Petrus have on Second Chance opportunities and hes missed a couple easy layups 5147 uhoh and that ball got thrown away Hammond looped it across the floor and a turnover on the hokes this is Tech work get the ball inside to the big fella watch him go to work who said the post game was dead they cant be watching if they see him alij with petite with the sweet feet 16109 Cal is ACC play Stanford is the entire season blackshire left it short on the runner but also consider that after the game at at Louisville on Saturday the Stanford Cardinal went back capalo Alta they did and so then theyre going to make the trip back here today they came back last night yep at should play tomorrow yep Cal State yeah they did they came directly from South Ben to Charlotte and theyve been in Charlotte since Saturday night and its showing in the way that they played thus far today you can tell that theyre acclimated now to East Coast time and theyre acclimated to Charlotte theyve had a strong performance especially in the offensive end of the floor for the first 33 minutes of this game pull up jump shot by Jaden young gets the hokes to within two here goes blacker on the drive against L High arcing shot bounds away L got the rebound tough to get a shot up against him hes quick off his feet and High Hammond on the dribble Drive had it knocked away heres Wilkinson petrius has got Le to beat hell lay it up it Applause in petrius has got his eighth double figure Game of the Year in conference play he averaged eight in his last three coming in tell you what hes been impactful in this ball game hes the ultimate glue guy he does whatever the team needs for them to do to be successful whether its make a big three whether its to dive on the floor after a loose ball take a charge hes Mark madsons type of player a guy thats willing to do all the dirty work five and change to go here is Campbell out front now Wilkinson to work had it knocked away turned over young uhoh Toby LW with Campbell to be and DJ see if youre Toby L on that possession you got to find a way to get the ball to Ben Hammond yeah because if you get to Ben Hammond Ben Hammond is going to get it back whether he throws it off the glass whether he lobs it up youre going to get an opportunity right here that basketball has to go to Hammond in comparison to W trying to take it himself he gets fouled of course can go to the free throw line and get two points yep but its much more difficult than it would have been the dunk that he would have gotten so nine points for Lew today hes got four rebounds he is four for four from the floor and the free throw is no good hes now one for three at the line and heres Andre sto yakovich back for Cal and Rex Steiner and Jaden shot report back for the hokes now Cals going to burn a timeout so a 30 second timeout for Mark Matson we step aside in Charlotte on acc Network nice ACC tournament weve seen 11 lead changes half dozen ties biggest lead by either teams been Five Points as Toby lewow hits the back end of a two shot chance and with Jim beheim Cory Alexander West Durham Kim belon our Producer Mike Griffin our director great to have you with us on acc Network as we open the 72nd Atlantic Coast Conference tournament here in uptown charte best time of year WD playing in the granddaddy of them all the first conference to ever have a conference tournament would be the Atlantic Coast Conference heres blacker sto yakovich a three thats his first Miss from three right and the rebound for lewow so here we are in a onepoint game under five to go we had a onepoint game in our first contest here on this Tuesday a little hand fighting between Johnson and sakovic in traffic fouled by Andre sto yakovich itll be his third thats the sixth on the Golden Bears and as patite goes to the line you see the foul trouble Soko three Dort three and now sto yakovich and our Star Stories for players that have been crushing it brought to by Crush how about potit and sto yakovich here sto yakovich looking like early season form 20 points for him three of four Beyond a threepoint AR Elija Fati has done the majority of his damage the free throw line but he is stacked up fouls on the front line of the Cal Golden Bear and Virginia Tech has to get it inside thats the key wow and it falls off the iron I think this is Soko and if it isoko thats going to be four so Dort will have to come back in Off the Bench of Mark Madson now seventh foul on the Bears with 437 to go and L will go to the line Mark Matson did not go get the Dallas junor lead Dort as quickly as I thought he would 4 minutes 37 yeah but I think I would still get him ah and then maybe bring tsoko back after the media timeout but picking up that fourth you got to make sure you remind him that he has four fouls and he missed the second sasoko the rebound Soko is playing better than Dort I like going to Soko just let him go but coach do you need to tell him that he has four fouls are you assuming that he knows that hes a Kell he should know that yeah okay 418 to go Wilkinson blackshire against Rex Steiner into traffic off the glass and in Javon blackshire Jr from Oakland has got five in the game and the Bear lead is back to Applause two Rex Steiner in the corner young missed on the three black are the rebound and a foul in back court and if the whistle is not blown Jeremiah Wilkinsons doing circus tricks at their goal that was a great foul great to take away theic job defensively on him they really did hit bottled up Burton didnt allow him to get much going on the offensive end neither team shot the basketball well I just hate to see the ending come down to free throw yeah in comparison to just the players deciding their F here goes poti skips it for Rex Steiner thought about the three Burnham P Tri to to stay with him hell drive and scoop and score Ben Burnham second field goal of the ball game hes got four and you see D in the game right now to allow zoko to stay off the floor and not pick up that fifth foul you got to remember the cow Bears just played a four overtime game sto yakovich has got 22 now and so Mark Madson recognizing that this game could absolutely go extra minutes and you want to make sure sure you have madis Soo available for your team heres Tyler Johnson The Freshman back for Jaden young a three ball away Jaden Youngs been dealing with cramps weve seen him with the their gun drinking pickle juice so going to be a little different for him trying to elevate on a threepoint shot fourpoint game coming up on two and a half to go Wilkinsons been relatively quiet Cory just a three and a half sto yakovich feeling it bounces away look at petritis around the rim he got raped off of him by Young and everyone looking at making the signal to review but with 2 and A2 minutes you cant do it yeah it has to be under two Mark madon going to send AO back on the floor shakis doing it on a defensive possession I thought he would do that on the offensive possession yeah I know but I I want my best player and hes a great offensive rebounder I want I want him in there I want to try to theyre up for they want to try to win the game well part of it is to malag petite going to the bench hes got four to hes got four so I you pardon its wild with four without him on the floor now you dont put sasoko in a position to where hes going to have to bang and possibly get that fifth foul but if he puts his hands on the wild trying to attack off the basket thats a tough predicament to put sooko in you got four threepoint Shooters on the floor for Virginia Tech and Ben burn or and rather Tyler Johnson and low and theres the rebound and theres a foul and if thats Soko its not no Soko got the offensive board so hes going to shooting y Johnsons third thats why I I thats why I coached and you announced because you put your rebounder in the game and he gets a rebound gets fou and hes a good free throw shooter okay so let me ask you this question ask let me ask this question coach do you run Dort to the to the scores table to get him out on this defensive possession after the free throw yeah I want Soko in the game Im going to go down the stretch with him in the game right thats a lot of trust I know trust free throw bounds away fourpoint game by the way now that youre not coaching and your announcer you just Jinx Moko on the free throw talking about how great a free throw he is you have to trust your player at the end of the day all right so both potit and Lew on the floor here and and here comes Dort just as I said coach Dort is at the scores table ready to come in for is soo after the free throw line as long as he makes the free throw hes coming in havent jinxed him too much no who is this weed you speak of there it is go nice job see thats why coaching is you have to make so much money coaching cuz this stuff happens all the time yeah maton going to send D back to the Applause bench as coach said you got to trust your big guy to stay away from it if youre you got to go at him you cant allow him to St out the hook and look at sissoko block young there they save it to lewow and then it got knocked away away and Wilkinson the recovery that was a great defensive possession by Soko to stay vertical on that possession and if youre young you get that one back you really should have tried to dunk that on him because hes got his arms back trying to stay away from a foul 14th turnover on Virginia Tech Wilkinsons been Music quiet against Rex Steiner now sasoko eight to shoot M tries to roll right hand jump hook rebounded l w heres Rex Steiner front court now to L petite calls for it against Soko with a right hand scores and theres not much he can do to contest that twopoint game in Charlotte so many seasons will end here in Charlotte at the ACC tournament minute to Applause go twopoint game in STO yakovich this is the guy you want on the gra and it fell off the iron Lew the rebound 45 seconds to go Rex steer front Court he had it poked away Wilkinson but recovers 20 to shoot young Baseline Rex Steiner for the lead got it Applause Mark Matson go for one here or best shot to the basket tried to get foul whoa the return to cender stamped by Toby lewow Toby lewow coming from the opposite side timing it perfectly and throwing it out of bounds and thats where Bill Russell would just tip it and then go grab it and the game will be over okay if we talk Bill Russell Bill Russell would have just grabbed it and push it down the other direction trying to get a bucket and Toby the wild could have absolutely grabbed this one as hes talking to Ace cus thinking to himself I probably should have just kept that one in bounds but the crowd here on hand loving the action that theyre what at the lift on Toby Le gets a little more another year under his belt hes hes going to be a pretty special player I think Mark Madson is out of timeouts and its is a bad spot to have to inbound the basketball and Wilkinson catches it easily 15 to go well hes going to go right to the basket throw it up didnt go they had it lost it belongs to the hokes with 84 and Mark Madson wants them to look at that to go over and make sure because theyre shooting 51 here in the uh in the ball game and a lot better from two so everything called on the floor stands after review Burnham will put it in play trying to get it to Rex Steiner now going to put it in play lall couldnt handle it look at this Campbell and we get a foul with 53 left blacker is hurt on the floor over in front of the cow bench wow Ben Burnham is called for the foul on DJ Campbells drive to the basket and Black Shear was the player that got the deflection he made the play defensively and and WD let me tell you this do you know someone that wishes you could Advance the basketball right now it would be Mike young because that turnover in the back court immediately puts the opposing team in scoring position game hes going to limp but hes not coming off FL and as a general rule you dont want to throw the ball in the middle of the Court like that you want to try to get it to the sideline where they cant catch it in the middle and go right to the baset Campbells got two free throws hes three for four those are his only points theyve all come in the second half no good too strong tough thing tough position to be in yeah a lot of pressure on this free throw black here will limp off Moko back into the game looking for an offensive rebound on it hokes by the way have one timeout left DJ Campbell from Hampton Virginia ties the game its better that it doesnt end off oh heres Rex Steiner three two Hees hopes overtime great job defensively by the Bears to double team rexin forc him to have to take a tough shot from 30 ft first ever Atlantic Coast Conference tournament game so the Bears play their fifth overtime in two games and they get the ball first and sto yakovich whos their scoring star hes got 22 today petritis and now Wilkinson with 15 to shoot working against Burnham Jeremiah tes up a three petritis another offensive rebound Rak out of there Rus petrius has now got six offensive rebounds and nine in the game its been a monster on the boards he hasnt finished three of them but hes got them Wilkinson now two of eight from three I still believe hes settling too much he has the advantage quickness to be able to get to the rim and put pressure on the defense look at Wilkinson kick it for Campbell right corner sto yakovich its too strong on the three and here are the hokes now with their first possession both these coaches managing their foul trouble extremely well to be able to get Soko and poti both playing with four fouls into this overtime session Rex Steiner to btit against Soko sto yakovich helping out front three ball young nope look at Soko go get it that is a grown man rebound right there sure is theyre now two for 19 from the three and its just one guys made both Eric Lewis stops play here because Tyler Johnson is looks like CR he was hurt during that possession before that possession Jaden shot going to come in the ball game and Tyler Johnson Applause immediately to the bench here to shoot sto yakovich back out front Campbell will fire front rim Miss and hit last off Soko itll go to Virginia Applause Tech erit a second hang on Eric Lewis M Campbell trying to find the entry point its Wilkinson out of the corner rattled out shoot the rebound heres Rex Steiner front Court Music almost two minutes G already in the overtime were still locked up at 60 and this benefits Virginia Tech we talked about the 10man rotation from Mike young hes got a number of guys that are in the rotation he can trust in overtime even without some of his starters on the floor Wilkinson gambled itll cost him a foul its the eighth on Cal second on Jeremiah Wilkinson Cal over nine from the field down the stretch Virginia Tech started 12 of 28 and since then 10 of 17 so they have been able to pick it up but its all been inside the ark only two made threepoint field goals two of 19 in the game burnam and shoot go out Lew has come back in the game with Tyler Johnson as re Steiner goes to the line hes two for two and the front angle one and one gives him 6 and A2 and the over time both teams are seven for 40 one or two from the three they need to get the ball to the Applause basket second one also good for Rex Steiner and Rex Steiner not the starter but has had many games where hes played more minutes than Ben Hammond the starter and right now Mike young trusting Rex Steiner down the stretch St yovic his team trails to and theres a foul on Johnson Andre went through with the motion theres no continuation of course foul on Johnson will be his fourth this two free throws for Andre stoyak this is Advantage for Cal theyre one of the best free throw shooting teams in the ACC they shoot more free throws than anyone in League Play but you can see how much pressure they put on the basket sto yakovich misses there he is the 10th best free throw shooter in the league by the way Well Done by you that Jinx brought to you by Jim beheim the F no no no wait a second wait a he was accused of the first one that was all on uh Cory Alexander twopoint lead for the hokes take responsibility gakovic has missed two straight at the line knocked that one down points are going to be hard to come by in this 5 minute period everyone is precious 23 now for Andre sto yakovich heres Rex Steiner to work pull up three right of the circle there something Brandon Rex Steiners got all five Virginia Tech points here in the overtime the lead is four all three threes in the game for Virginia CH heres Wilkinson slashing through now petritis put it up on the glass and if thats lwow thats five it cant be any one else it was L thats they didnt call it on low wow well low absolutely smacked him in the face so look at this replay well we see Brandon rexer nice footwork raising up getting the power off that right leg squares his shoulders knocks down to three ball they got Brandon Rex Steiner for his second foul cor he must have reached in early on that one because laau absolutely made contact but again I would much prefer to see low on the floor so Im glad they didnt call it on him C trying to cut it to a twopoint hokey lead here with the Air Force Academy transfer petrius oo tell what you got to be in shape to play there training camp there place is unreal 7200 ft above sea level you dont want to go there uhuh well now wait a second not as a visiting team here we go Rex Steiner out front against sto yakovich trying to reroute now heres young Baseline block Soko Campbell and the bears in transition oh why stop thought he was going to sto yakovich and he didnt pull the trigger into the corner but again no one sto the basketball Campbell would have had a wide open layup and he continued just to go to the basket two a tie three to lead heres St yakovich bounce pass petritis in traffic got it how about that nice cut by petrius to get into the open area help his teammate out who want a dead dribble and get a bucket to tie the game at 65 great effort from both teams great great effort inside 90 seconds to play in the overtime Rex Steiner got all the Hokey points missed there petrius another rebound tried to make the save and the foul on Tyler Johnson as petritis ended up falling into the Virginia Tech cheerleaders Johnson thatll be his Fifth and petrius gets in between two hokeys comes up with the rebound as he and Johnsons arms get tangled up oh foul no foul there so 118 to go the first time this year that Tyler Johnson The Freshman from Orlando has fouled out and now p is to put the Bears in front nope whats that whats that rule something about the ball and lying doesnt lie 70 8 seconds left to go in the overtime and that through and fell off but patrus fell away from the free throw line on that one didnt stick with the shot didnt shoot that one confidently at all heres heres Rex Steiner skip for shoot oh potit was calling for it Rex Steiner on the hard drive Baseline all the way through and had it deflected over the inline tend to shoot itll stay with Virginia Applause T 65 all winner gets stford tomorrow potit now for Rex Steiner quickly Applause low back for potit sasoko there got hit rebound foul the wall and now we got sasoko I think its his fifth the conclusion of this game but both these teams playing like they want to continue their season Toby Lew who is three for six at the free throw line has a double double of 11 points in 11 rebounds were tied at Applause 65 and the first one Applause good Junior from London and calmly knocks them both down pretty cool right there two big free throws for a guy that hasnt been making there yeah 64 free throws he might be a little better than that heres Wilkinson now pal trails to sto yakovich working against Jaden young fights through tried to get the shot up and it hit over the top of the backboard and out of bounds to Virginia Tech Mark Matson employing his guys to get up double fist means most likely the one 1211 triangle press this the same press that they were able to force the turnover with at the end of the first at the end of regulation to send the game in overtime and we got to mention Javon blacker hasnt been back in the game in overtime injured himself leate Rex Steiner stepped out of bounds before he can make the pass and the Golden Bears trapped on the inbounds Cory and get the turnover now do you remember when our Hall of Fame coach said you want to throw the ball to the corner not to the corner but not to the middle not to the Deep corner and if you do throw it the Deep corner you throw it right back to the guy that gave it to you so you dont get that situation okay its 0 for two on turnovers at the end of game situations the pressure has worked extremely well really good sure has there heres Wilkinson now against Rex Steiner quickly sto yakovich half minute to go Andre to the basket that got blocked away and a foul call sto yakovich on the ground below the bucket now Ill say this we talk about the similarity in the games in the NBA this would not be a foul because the ball was already out of sto Yakov pics hands before the contact right you watch him get downhill watch when the ball leaves his hands its out then the contact that and the free throw good he can tie it here but there are many people as coach talk about who would love to see consistency in the game and by rule that is a foul in college basketball so I have no complaint with that call but that had no bearing on the shot because the shot was already blocked well before there was any contact made so Mike Youngs got two time to stay back and not pick up that bow or do you want to be aggressive youre going to be if youre going to press youre going to try to steal it in bounds to PO double team right away Campbell and petrius now to shoot that was good and heres Rex Steiner with 20 seconds left at the midcourt lines sto yakovich will defend him hes got three fouls lets try to do something here Rex Steiner to Young out front potit 5 Seconds young quickly through it pass Le 29 left to go Mark Matson wants them to go look at the clock felt you know if you throw it directly to him you dont lead him and thats the mistake so 35 is where this is going to stay and they got a cluster of receivers right here at the Timeline petrius Campbell and Wilkinson inbounds heres petrius the catch working against L double clutch and threw it up oh and Campbell went for the potential tap in and instead were going to go to a double overtime at the e oh since 2007 Applause bears with the ball I like this by sto yakovich sending everyone away let me just go to work and he cant finish sooko catches scores how about that Matty Soko once again on the offensive glass doing a tremendous job keeping a possession alive and getting Second Chance points for a lead Cal in front 6967 meanwhile the Nos and orange wait here in Charlotte roughly a half hour after were finished sasoko reached in knocked it away here goes Campbell in front Court another Virginia Tech turnover thats now 18 for the hokes So Cal who just played Four overtimes on Saturday is into overtime number two here in Charlotte Campbell or Wilkinson rather put it up on the glass got blocked away last last touch on a deflection by Virginia T thats a nice job by poti denying that opportunity with Toby LW on the bench locks the shot leaving the Bears with only 3 seconds on the shot clock yep lob Soko the catch back again all four points for the Bears at overtime belong to the gr transfer from Michigan State the guys that shouldnt be tired are uh up four potit the hand off for young in traffic pushed it up rebound for call and sto Yakov hes going to do the same thing I think well got a bigger guy in him now but hes going to get the switch on the screen of roll action get everyone out of the way allow him to go to work youre going to skip time off the shot clock and youre going to get a quality shot fallway Baseline rolls in for sto yakovich should be the offense for the remainder of overtime for the cow Bears G lakovic to basketball get out of his way largest lead of the night for Music Cal out front Jaden shoot tries to cut into it potit the long rebound back up against Soko block petritis petritis coming down limping after that play tell you what hes left it all on the floor sure has he has an unbelievable effort terrific effort by Rus petrius they want to get the matchup Wilkinson triple back rim Miss and young clears and that was the mistake by the Bears they didnt have the proper gu setting the screen you wanted to bring Rex Steiner over to be the defender pull up two is short by Rex Steiner and Soko they did get Wilkinson a wide open three and hes normally been a good shooter this year well Mark madsons teams got to be just respected for the energy level Cory holy smokes they really do and again we talked about they take on the personality of their coach this is a tough group sto yakovich on the drive and the basket sto yakovich now 8 field goal in the second overtime hes got 29 he hes got four points in the second overtime for the cow bears in this second overtime and Virginia Tech has yet to score in this second overtime right now so the Bears in good shape but still 146 remaining a lot of time for Brandon Rex Steiner and the hokes to get some points on the board well they need something right here heres out front Toby Lew hell go on the drive and well get a foul here that might be five on to SOA theyre going to get P trus onus yeah so thats two on trius the trius reaching in on the Bears for a number of reasons one when he wants to make sure that Toby the wild doesnt take off right also he doesnt want madis Soko to get that fifth foul L at the line and he rolls it in Toby is now hit three in a row at the line he is six out of seven our rart he is uh 6 for n and 6 for 10 after the Miss there but gets his own offensive rebound oh boy look here Wilkinson got knocked on the floor for the first time since what the last the last play of the regulation yeah he playing the first overtime you see black here trying to stretch and get loose now has that sleeve on his right leg we have to pay attention to see how hes moving with the basketball now for all intents and purposes Im Virginia Tech Im going at black shearing the basketball Im going after him to see if we can get some turnover theyre going to press full court pus put it in play here Soko right back to Rus petrius now for blackshire they try to screw traffic Campbell and a foul on burnam third on Ben burner and with 125 to go this games going nowhere fast right now because its six points Virginia Techs got to try and trim the ratio on possessions and they get a foul every time try to score and trying to fou so here is Campbell who is four for six at the free throw line tonight Cal is 22 of 32 as a team that rattles Applause in all five of Campbells points in the second half and overtime I like this substitution gets Tucker into the game for Black Shear on the defensive possession so allow him to chase defensibly guard Brandon Reiner and then you may want to give black she back in the game for offense when you can just as he gets foul to shoot free throws hes limping over there pretty pretty good no he he cant move Applause no lead back to eight Lew of three twoo strong shoot knocked it out Burnham tried to save it hit the far sideline and itll belong to the Bears with 73 seconds to go into double overtime and just dont turn it over and make your free throws thats all if it were only that simple yeah again those are those Hall of Fame quotes that we get just turnov turned it up uh oh here goes L and hes fouled by ped or Andre sorry I finally did it I knew I was going to do it at some point this year 15 minutes ago didnt well schedule coach schedule I remember sitting back there waiting for some game once like that free throw rattles in for Toby Applause Le 77 70 with a minute six to Applause go and the second one good now here comes the pressure again and black are back out on the floor and this is what I love to watch this the the football alignment yep heres petrius quick foul by shooting the back court on re is petritis J shoots third and a couple of free throws for petrius at the other end and he is five for eight he hit five of his first six and missed his last two and Tucker involved in a conversation on the bench we talked about black year coming out of the game black she back in because Tucker caught the basketball turned it over right gave it back to Virginia Tech so hes involved in intent conversation on the sideline try to Z one of of the two so its a sevenpoint game with a minute one to go Tuckers a good free throw shooter too and you got to go at black here set the screen just go by him right he cant move Rex Steiner shoots it into the corner burn him a three banged out of there sto yakovich tapped it away Campbell is fouled by Jaden Shu Im shocked Rex ster gave that basketball up if he simply would have just rejected the screen gone Baseline with Black Shear trying to guard him he would have gotten everything he wanted an opportunity at the rim or make the defense contract and then kick it out to one of his Shooters so now DJ Campbell will go back to the line look at all that space with Black Shear if you reject that screen of roll you have the entire Baseline to be able to go right to the rim if they come after you now you kick it out to one of your teammates for a three but whenever youve got a guy thats hobbled on the floor I mean theres no empathy in this you have to attack him if hes going to be out there they dont have anyone else they can put on the floor you have to go after and the free throw good by Campbell hes now hit five in a row at the line fellas 8071 with 43 seconds left Hokes got to live behind the line here dont they Rex Steiner at the long two and a fallway thats good so its 8073 and Mark Madson is going to take the timeout has happened in the state of California before but now when you consider that youre going to have an opportunity to be able to do well maybe they had a couple in Vegas in the old pack 12 tournament possible but never one on the east coast here goes Campbell off the inbounds hes finally fouled by Rex Steiner it is interesting you bring up the Pack 12 tournament because Cal coming into the ACC tournament the Pack 12 tournament did not last the lifetime of the Pack 12 it only lasted from 1987 to 2024 and Cal was tce the runner up they went 18 26 in their Pack 12 tournament history Stanford went 19 26 they won the 04 title and were twice the runner up in the history of the Pack 12 so neither team has what you would call like a glowing postseason record from a conference tournament perspective well you know one of the things that were going to get an opportunity to see tomorrow and this is of course coach Bams favorite topic the Bears who have stayed yeah against the Cardinal who against the Cardinal who didnt stay good to blocked by mad so continuing to play now the Heth of black she and Wilson will play a large part in that yeah but it would be a great test to see how much that travel truly affects you and a Stanford team who has not shot it very well at all from the floor in the last six games except one time and that was the win against SMU this its going to be a tough comeback tomorrow for this team for Cal were really tough but its a heck of an effort to play six overtimes in two ball games guys and Come Away with a ninepoint win in your first ACC Tournament game it absolutely is get Mark mat
