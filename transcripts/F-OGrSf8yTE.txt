Mo you better defend the threepoint line theyve made 29 threes over their last two games and theyre shooting over 50 bird Smith Clarence Armstrong and Jeff Bon the officiating crew here from purcel tip one by the Irish and the all whites one last nonconference game before the holidays hit and then ACC play from here on out in the Irish heres Davis attacking the glass immed immediately drawing the foul and thats been a vocal point for Notre Dame and the point of emphasis they have been feeding Tay Davis and they put him in a multiple different uh positions on the court that time they posted him up sometimes theyll put him in screen and rolls when we spoke with the ly poaching staff uh that was another key in this game matching up against Tay Davis Davis 72 from the stripe here this season he continues to evolve his offensive game the confidence growing for Tay yeah in his last two games hes averaging close to 18 points per game and shooting a high percentage from the floor another difficult match Applause up six straight games of 14 for Davis danler Jones Tekken cared and coroma to five for the Dolphins their first offensive possession nice back door cut good ball movement on the attack floater two strong rebound bound Alo the transfer from Princeton hes joined by rer Shrewsberry Davis and is K and watch how Le Mo defends the ball screen actions of Notre Dame thats going to be key in this game how they defend all their multiple screens Second Chance threepoint shot up there from the locko how about a third chance count it and one Tay Davis a menace hit the rim so far early yeah he has been outstanding great work this time on the offensive class all set up though by the spacing of Notre Dame the Miss Tay Davis continues to move thats his great work on the offensive class and one situation Davis the junr from Indianapolis he look at his last game a double double 20 points 10 rebounds he converts the and one five nothing Irish early that foul by the way was on D Jones hes picked up two quick ones yeah thats huge in this game and again another thing for Notre Dame keeping paint touches to a minimum thats something coach Michael shuberry talked to us about trying to keep Le Mo out of the paint in particular off the bounce Robbie Cary see him with the touch there now Tekken one on the shot clock got a fire away out the buzzer counted Dwayne Koma from the outside what did I say at the top Le Mo when you defend him you must defend the threepoint line over their last two games theyve made 29 threes and theyre shooting over 51 in their last two gam from Beyond The Arc response is there for rer Julian rooper Michael Shrewsberry Notre Dames head coach that his confidence continues to grow he has had an incredible week of practice and I think thats a a by result of Marcus Burton their star player being out other guys have had to step up and thats something coach Shrewsberry and staff have talked about tacking back door reverse land is there five for Koma and thats twice now le Mo has done a nice job back door Cuts pinpoint passing and the spacing again excellent by both these teams 8 to five Irish winners of two straight roll to the basket J kick out Shrewsberry now a locko the team without marus Burton one of the stars of the ACC and in the country on the attack Roper fouls hell go to the line foul on Dan thats a heads up play that time by Notre Dame again they just broke off the play they like that matchup and then just let him back down help was late and rer at the free throw line again theyre just identifying matchups and then just going at that matchup this time Applause rer roers only been to the line eight times total this season started his career at Northwestern we have a lane violation on the second attempt I believe we do this time of year for Notre Dame right right for the holiday break you dont have your star in Burton finding guys that can step up and gel together for when Burton does come yeah I think its again guys uh playing more doing more uh what they would have to do in particular on the offensive end because again Barton does so much for them offensively thats something coach Shrewsberry has found out about this that uh his team without Marcus Burton other guys have stepped up shown some offensive power step back three too strong rebound Saves by alako heres rer hes got four early the ivy league transfer alako now Davis backing down the defender turns strong to the rack thats what hes figured out over the last couple of games and right now le Mo theyre going to have to make a decision again theyre just breaking off plays whether its Roper that time though they go to Davis theyre just going to break break off their play post them up if the double doesnt come theyre going to continue to try to exploit the matchups that they want good ball movement open three in the air theres another one and thats Nate FS you cant ask for a better offensive possession oh my goodness excellent ball movement and spacing unselfish play that time by Le MO two of three from Beyond The Arc early in this one point of emphasis for Notre Dame today in shootaround was making sure High hands contest as rer drives thats too strong G crashing the glass cant get their fouls cleans excellent block out that time by fals Drive kick picked off by Roper now Shrewsberry through contact play on Tekken hes fouled by alako hand check thats our first media timeout Marcus Burton Notre Dame up by three here after the first couple of minutes Music Music we be running just wonderful Dance from alar High schoolar High School show me what you Music iol well Marcus Burton has been out since this play at the player era against ruers and it was a big one right here one of the best guards in college basketball going down a preseason First Team all ACC and theyre different team uh without him again theyve uh wred the ship a little bit but uh make no mistake about it Notre Dame with Marcus Burton uh is a completely different team and speaking with the coaching staff hes getting closer uh to coming back but you can take a look at the stats and numbers with him and without him and its a drastic difference and how how can and OD be right a guy who had been off to such a terrific sophomore season after being named the ACC freshman of the Year this is a good sign as he continues to get closer to getting back on the court yeah we saw him also as shoot around and the difficult part as coach Shrewsberry said is is trying to keep him uh not hes been engaged uh but keep him uh trying not to do too much they dont want to rush him back and obviously his longterm future more important uh than some shortterm pain that Notre Dames going to go through without him shot deflected there Burton continues during timeouts like you said to be engaged with his teammates seeing things in a different Vantage Point how can that help him as he comes back yeah the coaches staff talked about that being engaged said look this is your team and hes seeing things as hes obviously not engaged on the court as you take a look at a beautiful back door uh but that engagement again keeping him in tune with whats going on and certainly there looking forward to getting him back on the court no doubt about it that was Jr kzn the hometown hero from South bence Irish extend the lead to five ball Applause rotation three ball W missed everything Robbie Cary this right here again look look at the spacing excellent passing and thats something Notre Dame does an excellent job of again of their spacing that time right there excellent back door cut Davis screen set alako to the wing KES alako he can stroke it connects all three of those for Matt Alo but thats all set up by the pass great job that time by kesi again Alo his leadership thats something the coaching staff has talked about with Notre game obviously a guy thats has NCAA tournament experience and one of the better players out of the IV league and he has been huge for that the Irish are heating up here in the first half theyve hit five of their last six shots constantini cleans the glass Notre Dame wants to run kesn hes looking for the quick hitter defense got back for the Dolphins yeah thats a great transition defense that time and particular the close outs good look inside to the big man foul calls this right here again a play weve seen notor Dame run multiple times in practice and round of this afternoon again little dple Drive got to have better ball containment if youre Le Mo you dont want to get beat where the help has to come though Irish when you watch them play both of these teams do a really good job of it but the spacing look at the spacing that Notre Dame has at all times when theyre running their half court sets Davis he can shoot that three ball back IR cont constantini to Shrewsberry that three rattles all the way out and another offensive rebound boy the Irish are killing it on the offensive glass early interor your feet constantini turning to that right hand now to the left patience good defense from Applause fals transition Koma thats a big time offensive move by coroma that time Euro Step and then finish through contact with the left hand again right here get the rebound Euro and then finished with the left thats a tough move and Ive been impressed though with Fouts again hes done a nice job defensive rebounding uh hes had some nice blockouts and hes doing a great job battling The Bigs of for Notre Dame Roma Hales from Germany this is his fourth stop the Collegiate Tor in his career foul was on am m and now a traveling Music violation Notre Dames done a nice job of protecting the basketball here this season that is their second turnover of this first Music Applause half am driving kick danler FS against Shrewsberry now amik Rises off to the right long rebound haredy lays it in count it and one hell go to the line great job of shielding with his body Cary off the offensive rebound and then the top finish with the left hand foul on constantini itll be Cary at the free throw line when we return Irish by four Under 12 media Irish man we know youre looking forward to seeing what in your stocking this year thats why we have freshman here to his five take a Music look friend today we be playing um first Christmas staing St first here socks Music K one yeah three I guess thats Music Music Music Music n Music Music Music Applause Robbie Cary is back at his old stomping grounds and you look at the challenging career that has been presented to the Mars Pennsylvania native and you feel for this young man Applause again a its just great to see him back on the court healthy but you look at his timeline and really just a lot of tough breaks for this young man take a look at his picture here and before the game it was great to see him prior to the game ushers ball boys uh people in Stand Notre Dame fans coming up to him wishing him well and telling him uh how nice it was to see him back on the court healthy what a great story he said coach n Champion talks about the appreciation he has for the game right talking about Robbie in the way that hes been through so much has allowed him to love every minute hes having a nice year averaging North at 12 points per game the talent there thats never been a issue the issue has been him staying healthy and being able to stay on the court so again really just nice to see him back on the Court healthy doing what he loves nice finish there from J Irish lead by five here in this first half cared against kzne attacks foul colds see who thats on Alo and Ja were both in the area theyll give it to 20 Jr KES to the Music line cars got three first free throw connects Malcolm what did you want to see from both of these sides early on well for Le Mo starts off with Braden Shrewsberry we talked about it Marcus Burton out uh he is the guy over his last two games 23 points per game and then they got to make some threes which theyve done over the last two games 29 uh then on the other side for Notre Dame they must keep Le Moine out of the paint thats something coach Shrewsberry talked to us about that was key number one for him we have to keep them out of the paint cant let them break us down and then we got to defend threepoint Shooters Mo right now 8 to six Advantage Irish in the paint for that key zone defense thrown at Notre Dame by the Dolphins oh they break it perfectly and its kevi the feet from Malo yeah thats a great pass by alako and Jai with the Finish again excellent zone offense got a little break early on there almost a turnover but then Theo again thats that leadership nice little bounce pass which led to a layup almost get the feeling jas progression here in his junior year could provide a big boost inside for the Irish oh no doubt and again he provides a great post presence for them great size and athleticism am working against SRA floats it good contest from the Irish and J might not get a block for that but he should again he changed that shot with his length IES not about attacking pulls it back Notre Dame will move the ball around Imes ball fake foul called on fou thats his second this game is getting physical and the refs going over to talk to both teams but physical game early on an Notre Dame team that started the year winning its first four games dropped a stunner to Elon here on this home court and then went to Vegas competed in three games especially when you factor in Burton was out after a couple minutes against ruter but you can see the minutes starting to wear on them right the travel the three games in seven days then they go and play at Georgia in the ACC SEC challenge that doesnt go well but theyve started to figure out how to play without Marcus Burton and theyve had a long break 10 games uh to 10 days excuse me to be exact in between games so again for them after that stretch uh really important for them to get some guys uh closer to getting healthy and to try to work out some things then theyve got almost two weeks before they play again and normally coach dont like that but with Marcus bird out again that gives him more time and then more time to try to get him healthy as they start to get back into uh the heart of the ACC conference play four on the clock now to Shrewsberry at the buzzer it rattles home braen Shrewsberry one of the best threepoint marksmen in the country that right there is a tough shot shot clock winding down and thats what he does uh he makes some difficult shots his first points of the evening I think a Hil was on the line right here again great shot fake got to stay down right there if your Cary and then Shrewsberry I think one of the things uh really that is tough about his game hes got a quick release again right there he get needs a little bit of space a lock up Wast no time he got the matchup he wanted went right to the rack theyre just playing simple basketball Notre Dame theyre isoing that time again Alo they like the match up they like just let him back out and the problem is they got Shooters around them but my goodness Le Mo has the answer wow Dwayne Koma the hammer hes got nine they may need to check uh the screws on the backboard because he definitely rocked the rim on that one textbook pi can roll right here pick roll and then take off the rim my goodness excellent half court execution again up by La Music Mo does that qualify as Rim assault uh yeah thats definitely that I I would say yes and you know coach Champion has to be pleased early on he said were going to have to take some of their punches has to Beed pleased with how his team has executed and then responded to some of these Notre Dame runs want to remind you Tuesday December 31st on New Years Eve ACC Network gets you ready to ring in the new year with a mens basketball double header 230 Notre Dame takes on Georgia Tech and 430 Cooper flag and fifth ranked

out of the paint and that was a key coming into this game when we talked with Coach Shrewsberry this afternoon at shoot around he said we must do a good job keeping them out of the paint started off this game Le Mo hitting some threes getting into the paint that has not been the case in this last four to five minute stretch well the Dolphins started two of three from Beyond The Arc theyve missed their last four from downtown Shrewsberry floater hes been working on it oh my I mean he is starting to really figure out his offensive game and thats the Freshman the sophomore jump I think back to

nice move by teken ball rotation Koma again yes and thats the matchup problem J hes not used to being out on the perimeter and Le Mo again excellent ball movement and spacing in their secondary transition Ks got 15 of their 23 points hes hit a couple of Threes drewberry Davis alako ball fake steps back wants the three yes oh its now raining threes here pel alako and also Shrewsberry do an excellent job ball faking again because you have to honor their threepoint shooting if youre closing out out of control theyre going to make you pay excellent use of the ball fake again turnover there danler looking for a roller to the basket didnt get it and right here watch this shot fake okay youre running out out of control and we saw them all afternoon working on this they took hundreds of shots of doing that same exact move right there Alo Shrewsberry all the guards and wings of not game get excellent use of the shot thing Malcolm we asked Matt earlier today at shooter on whats it like to be in the zone right against ruter it was like everything he was throwing in was was in he could have shot out from Chicago and it would have gone in and he said look the basket gets bigger you just kind of have that confidence you dont even need to see the bucket he singlehandedly kept them in that game and almost won them the game without Marcus bur yeah he is really a special player to get the coaching staff a rave about his leadership obviously the talents there to make plays good this Sky obviously High basketball IQ but really for them its been the leadership that hes provided to this unit 4123 making 4125 a nice little fading away jumper from dancer yeah he is tough again we talked about it in the open how he can go off on any given night for 30 points and theyre going to need it to get back into this game ims Dial Zone three ball that one wont go offensive rebound Davis stays with it underneath the basket now might have been partially blocked he wont be denied and hes fouled oh Tay Davis said thats my ball grown man offensive rebound but right now Notre Dame executing well in transition running the floor sharing the ball give give it back the three Notre Dame rolling Music I go anywhere do anything Music Music knew Music Music Applause that Nate champion in that huddle talking to his dolphins in his Fifth Season at the helm of Le Moine back where he used

here hes growing 70 deep family friends and what a great story he said he grew up a huge Notre Dame fan football and basketball and just an incredible story obviously you talked about him being a player for Le Moine and now in their second season has a division one program him leading them and doing an excellent job again I told them look they do not look like a team that just transitioned up to D1 theyve had uh some early success in not an easy out by any means said I love watching Bens Ben hansboro play basketball when I was a kid growing up said would you watch the football game Friday he said uh you bet said what do you think of your chance he said I like him coming up against those dogs no hesitation whatsoever I think once youre an Irish football fan it never really leaves you best time of the year though you got college hoops college football NFL NBA too many options its not a bad thing good good defense oh almost led to transition offense and Davis a rare Miss at the bucket danler try to take advantage and does hell go to the line foul on Music IES that is the first on the Logan Imes 64 sophomore Music and now danler from Indianapolis Indiana knocks down that first free throw next Sunday well have the first of four consecutive weeks of womens basketball quadruple headers here on AC Network noon Eastern Hannah Hidalgo and third rank Notre Dame host Virginia

started turnover young players take note right here little head fake hop step off two feet finish through contact eyes never left the rim thats a tough finish by IM he made it look easy IMS described as steady by his head coach gives them an additional ball handler had eight points against ruter in Vegas at the Players era again Notre Dame looking for guys to step up right in the absence of Marcus Burton and the hope is when he comes back everyone gels together for a finished product Davis oh hes living in the paint looks like uh Le moys going to get a timeout and Notre Dame doing an excellent job attacking the Zone theyve switched up the zone late in the first half and a Notre Dame has had to answer they continue to roll Music Music Music Music ACC PM with Mark Packer and Taylor tan bomb can be seen weekdays at 4 Eastern here on accn and also the ESPN app boy Mark and Taylor are busy right now huh yeah they call this crossover season love it again you said it having so many options but we got a good one here tonight Notre Dame Ive been impressed their defense yes offensively theyve gotten out but its because of their defense which has allowed them to get out in transition get some easy buckets and then when theyve gotten into their half court sets theyve really executed in particular against this Leo Zone Michael Shrewsberry talked about look in Vegas we had to kind of do it on the fly as Cary missing that Burton goes down we didnt have time to practice and to figure things out without him you almost are preparing for the next opponent day after day as thatll be a turnover on the Irish he said we finally got some time to implement things and figure out roles I think youre starting to see the Irish take those steps forward in that area and thats why the long break was really key uh coach Shrewsberry said look game practices start to get a little chippy but again it was a valuable time for us those 10 days to really get guys used to playing without Marcus Burton again we really didnt have time as you said to adjust that time off and time and practice really has helped him harmy fouled will that be three shots it will former Irish guard again he does a great job moving without the ball and thats really on the big again js got to come up be a little bit more connected talk give a little bit of help in particular Cary coming off looking to shoot in again we talked about his story KY four years here at Notre Dame unfortunately because of the injuries only played 23 games while a member of Notre Dame Fighting Irish but really great to see him back on the court he hes got double figures in six of the eight games that hes played this season the talents there right you dont get a scholarship to Notre Dame unless you could do something on the hardwood but hes had a challenging career I think it just warms your heart to see a guy like this get a chance to be healthy and to have this type of success at Le Mo yeah and again you know the folks here still care about him before the game had a chance to see him out here as soon as he walked out again five or six ushers came right up to him gave him a hug and talked to him a little bit about how happy they were for him just being healthy back on the court timeout taken by the Irish well step away well be right back Notre name up 16 Music Music Music on the season high for points in the first half was 46 for the Irish against ston Hill first game of the year theyve got 46 right here its been a good offensive half but youve been more impressed with the defense Thats Whats led to their offense coach rber talked about this the emphasis was defending the actions and particularly with Le Mo the threepoint line we said coming into it 29 threes made in the last two games for Le Moine right now uh they only have uh four in this game theyve done an excellent job keeping them out of the paint and then defending the threepoint line well have the ball here to wrap up the half shot clock is off Shrewsberry with 12 on the attack off the glassing in hes fouled hell go to the line for one more this not a good sign right here though Tay Davis on the ground and thats certainly something well keep our Eye On Again couldnt see it from our vantage point see right here again nice job by Shrewsberry finishing and then yeah he took a pretty good hit right there from kedy hes limping over to the bench so again well see how he looks coming out or if he comes out after uh the intermission but certainly a storyline will watch keep an eye on that fouls his third foul of the first half shot block there from Himes Tekken traveles wow a great defensive half capped with that play there from mes yeah and thats just all great scouting right there again understanding that screen and roll got over it didnt get beat and then the recovery to block and not foul excellent first half by Notre Dame well theyve got a new season high for point point in a half 49 Davis and Shrewsberry combined for 24 points and their defense though Le Moine makes the Zone really ineffective uh in that first half lets see how they come out defensively to try to match up against this Notre Dame team worked on defense during the break did the Irish strong first 20 minutes in that department what adjustments do you want to see the dolphins make well I think it starts with uh here on the offensive end they got to try to figure a way to break down this Irish defense they shot a lot of contested threes like that right there to start off the second half be more patient I think the other thing is try to get out in transition up before this Notre Dame half court defense can get set up looking inside not of Chris feed turnover coroma had a big first half hes fouled as he drives to the cup one person I was impressed with was him right there Koma he has done a nice job defensively right there coming up with the steel and then his ability to play off the bounce again he is a big of that can lead the break and difficult matchup great Mobility pomas had quite the path to Le Mo hes been at UT Arlington Salt Lake Community College Music Iona now making his way to Syracuse New York at Le Moine hes had himself a nice evening hes got Applause 16 his career high 19 against Army as Davis through the contact hell go to the line for the and one he has been an absolute Menace inside well his last two games we talked about it close to 18 points per game shooting over 50 from the floor thats tough but he has become a matchup problem of four opposing teams and Notre Dame does a nice job putting him in different spots on the floor theyll post him put him in pick and pop situations but they move him all over the floor to try to give him scoring opportunities the lead 20 for the first time tonight for the Irish thatll be deflected out of bounds itll stay with the do dophins Davis has got 12 Koma on your screen with 15 excuse me they will reverse the call last Touch by the Dolphins Irish basketball now le Moy picks up their pressure see if they can try to turn a Notre Dame over Davis gets around Jones but great recovery by Jones ball loose kick ball itll stay with Notre day Bo second year in D1 winners of two in a row picked fourth in the ne oh wow Davis had mean intentions on that one was trying to put the Dolphins on a poster yeah he definitely had bad intentions on that drive aggressive drive right here my goodness almost an and one situation but again thats really a great out of bounds underneath execution right there this diagonal pass to the wing Davis with the quick First Step knocks that one down what have you liked about Davis here tonight well I think the biggest thing is is improved jump shot again last year teams really didnt have to go out and guard him at all so its really difficult to get your driving Lanes when teams arent really closing out on you that has changed this year and open up more lanes for him the turnover there Davis was fouled Robbie carmy won it the travel last season Tay Davis nine points a game and this year up to close to 16 points per game and we talked about what hes done over his last two really been impressive but I think thats the area that that hes really worked on his game uh that jump shot again hes an explosive athlete can play off the bouns can guard and play multiple positions the Ros been on its now seven games with at least 14 points seven in a row and again when Burton comes back youre looking for potentially a big three or a big four these are the minutes that you need right to be able to develop your identity how about that jumper from Beyond The Arc and its kevi hes added that as Marcus Burke loves it thats a beautiful find uh by Burke uh excuse me by Shrewsberry in ch doesnt shoot a lot of those but that looked pretty good right there no hesitation Corner three hes now hit three of them Michel Shrewsberry telling us they really worked him and Tay Davis on the threepoint shot oh look what I found says Dwayne Koma as he flushes at home a timeout taken by Le Mo we step aside the Irish lead 56 33 here in South Music B all right this is a Christmas game a lot of you of

and Digger Phelps here in attendance as well had a great talk with Coach Digger Phelps prior to the game and we shared some fun stories I played against many of these great Notre Dame teams lonso Ellis Monty Williams I asked him say coach favorite memory in this building he smacked me in the arm hes like thats a silly question January 19 1974 UCLA us beating UCLA snapping the 88 game win streak uh by the great oh coach would would and uh you know again just phenomenal history with him hes got so many stories but that list of coaches phenomenal list of great ones that have coached uh before coach shuberry he lives here in the area what an iconic moment there Davis stays with it the put back it belongs to him hes just been really too much for the Le Mo team to handle theyve identified that matchup and theyve continued to go at him again I think if youre Le Moy you got to try to double provide some help because he has just had his way when hes gotten the ball in the post right here again ISO they have the spacing they want the help doesnt come and that time on the offensive rebound put back off of his own Miss but he has been impressive in this game efficient 18 Applause points 58 33 ball hes going to stay with Notre D after a deflection out of bounds Alo to shrew J rer look at his spacing that Notre Dame plays getting very difficult to guard you have that type of spacing and then you got a guy like Davis and also Shrewsberry that can break you down off the bounce again look at this spacing again very difficult to defend right here do you help on the wing you cant help right there because you have one of the better threepoint Shooters and Braden Shrewsberry in the on the corner oer knocks down the first reminder to Tuesday on New Years Eve fac network will get you ready to ring in the new year with a mens basketball double header 230 eastern time Notre Dame taking on Georgia Tech and 430 Cooper flag and Duke hosting Virginia Tech at Cameron

for Notre Dame at home uh speaking with Coach shuberry uh he was concerned still has obviously no coaching to this zero on the clock uh they wont be uh satisfied but he wanted to make sure his guys were locked in and uh not thinking about going home for the holiday break Mario mudi Malcolm hucke our entire crewp on the attacko baby kay Davis he leaves No Doubt this is about as impressive as a performance as Ive seen in person from Tay Davis obviously saw him a lot last year but his improvements in particular his shooting but we know hes an explosive athlete that time almost taking off the rim Davis now with four 20po games all coming this season his career high 27 Buffalo and I like how theyve looked for him again they have identified the matchup and then theyre just posting him letting him ISO and go to work Davis fouled on the attack that time right here take a look at the improved explosiveness take flight Tay Davis my goodness his first step and then the ability to attack the rim impressive is there a confidence level youre seeing Davis play with as opposed to last season yeah well I think coach shrewbury talked about it look they knew the talent was there one of the unintended consequences of Marcus Burton not being there is guys like Tay Davis uh stepping up and obviously taking more of that offensive uh role obviously hes put into work during the off season as you take a look at Marcus Bert one of the best guards in college basketball but yes I think the confidence because they know look uh hes going to have to pick up of that Miss scoring that theyre losing uh with Marcus Burton being out in a perfect world right Burton has Davis Shrewsberry AO to be able to lean on when he comes back as multiple scoring Applause options back and forth here in this second half pace is Quicken step back three oh d Jones sweet Lefty stroke from downtown much needed three try to break up this role that Notre Dame has been on if they have any chance of getting back into this game theyre going to have to get multiple stops and more threes like that kesn through contact offensive rebound and they foul cols Nikita Constantin noski was doing some Dirty Work Down Low yeah thats a grown man offensive rebound opportunity to try to put it back but uh really the paint has been the issue for Le Mo again right here on the offensive class and we talked about it in the first half points in the paint right now it stands 32 14 in favor of Notre Dame points in the paint they have dominated the paint in this game well Malcolm Notre d 10 offensive rebounds Le Mo has 14 total rebounds re ball kesn you back theyre just executing everything that time out of bounds underneath nice little double screen kesi comes off clean KES with the steel pushes it in transition Davis pass intercepted saved by coroma now Applause am Jones ball rotation three ball in the air too strong and kzn again with another Applause rebound truberry quick trigger offensive rebound number 11 constantini Imes strong Drive hes fouled that will put IM at the line for the one and one 17 fouls now on the Dolphins well L Moy continues to battle as take a look at coach champion and look theyre going to be a very difficult team pick fourth in the NEC conference and I look Ive been impressed with their ability uh to attack and transition again they havent had their shots falling but theyre going to be a very difficult team as they get into conference play again we talked about their ability to put multiple guys in double digits it doesnt come from just one guy many capable scores on this team bur chabahar into the Applause game 30 points excuse me 30point lead the largest this season for the Music Irish its been a dominant night FS turn around airball Alo clears if you wondered how the Irish would respond with the holidays right around the break I think theyve passed with flying color so far well it was an intense shoot around we were there uh we sat through film session thank you to the coaching staff coach drewberry allowing us to sit through their film session it was a lengthy film session going over personnel and then it was a physical very intense shoot around so again that was a key for him when we asked him keys he said I want to make sure my guys are locked in and not thinking about going home before the break and they have responded thus far in this game thats going to do it for fouls his fifth foul Michael Shrewsberry was intrigued about how his team would respond hes been through the ring right Penn State head coach Brad Stevens is assistant with at the Boston Celtics hes coached for Matt painer hes coached to Butler its a guy whos a basketball Indiana basketball guy through and through yeah one of the best coaches in college basketball bright offensive mind teacher of the game and certainly future very bright for this Notre Dame program with him uh at the head no good for chbar from the stripe on the bonus didnt earn the bonus after the Miss 68 38 a 30point Advantage for the Music Irish drive to the cup count it and one danler on the blow by thats what he does we talked about it end the tip his ability to score in their last game a win vers dartman 20 points four a six from the threepoint line but he also is a guy that can play off the bounce thats a tough finish right there through contact and one Applause opportunity free throw good as well dancerss got seven Alo against am alako Fades that one rolls off the rim rebound cleared by Jacob Blakeley kick Corner three two strong and the rebound again Notre Dames defended and rebounded at a high level here tonight great find kesn blocked foul calls on Robbie Cary 6841 Notre Dame leaving no doubt and Tay Davis has been the guy right here take flight almost rip off the rim it has been all Notre Dame in Davis this afternoon Music Applause Applause you in Irish Applause Music Applause Applause Music this Music just s its been the Tay Davis show here in South Bend tonight 22 for the junior he has been efficient uh he is uh isolated out of the zone and manto man theyve had no answer for him hes gotten to the free throw line 12 times 10 to 12 from the free throw line and hes got four offensive rebounds capped off by a Monster Jam right here Le Mo has had no answer for him you look at his numbers efficient hes gotten through the free throw line he has been a matchup problem all night started his career at seen Hall it was a big get out of the portal when he came to South in Notre Dame last season he finished the year seven straight games to end the year in double figures and you look at the Improvement again of the coaching staff has done a nice job improving his game I think the biggest thing is improved jumper again is he a threepoint shooter no but his a midrange and 15 fet out yes hes improved that area last year teams were daring him to shoot this year hes improved that number now its opening up those driving lanes and the numbers have improved last year nine points per game hes up to close to 16 points per game this year and he is going to be a matchup problem for opposing ACC opponents yeah the signs were there that this was possible for Tay Davis here in his junior year and when Burton gets back healthy you already have Shrewsberry in the bag a good number two right to a number one can Davis emerge as a true number three option and give you something that really you havent had in a couple years or noday yeah I think he can as you take a look at beautiful execution right there here back door pitpoint passing but uh to your point I think uh the biggest thing for them is how they use him again theyve isoled him on the Block take a look at look at his pass again great anticipation he threw that before his guy was open knowing that he was going to come open thats a tight window pass had to be perfect and it was M connects on the bonus free throw 70 to 44 a little over 11 minutes to play for the holiday break Alo three ball in the air count it all three of those and its Burke Applause Music chahar the transfer from Lehigh brought here to shoot the three ball and hes done at a high level this season you see it on your screen 57 coming in theyre just putting on a clinic in their half court right here again look at this space this is a great angle to look at the spacing difficult to guard screen you have to cover such a long area uh to recover because of the spacing that they use and that illustration right there that overhead view shows the beauty of the half court sets that Notre a runs all set up though by their spacing theyve hit the three ball theyve got 3 two points in the paint how does that spacing open up driving L well this right here again look you cant help now theyre coming to double off of Tay Davis watch how the ball moves and then this opens up the driving Lanes as it did right there unable to convert but good offensive set though for the Irish three ball in transition no Davis cleans the glass with authority his six rebounds hes approaching his second double double and J lost his shoot right here they came and doubled off his guy basically playing four on five foul called on carmy thats his third what do you think of the kicks hey those are loud man thats Hey listen Im not sure I can get off with that color right there get away with that youre on the cloud game yeah I I definitely on the cloud game but these guys right now with all the sneakers and nil and all that stuff theyre probably changing every game now I wasnt a guy that liked a new set of sneakers this is something that these younger Generations Ill say of players like I like my sneakers worn in a lot of these guys need a fresh Pier every game I couldnt do that I had to have my broken in get a couple practices in before I can wear them in a game going to be family I think I know what my man wants for the holidays if youre watching boys definitely that always can use new pair of kicks all on the floor oh look at that handsome fella wow I a lot of here back then as well too used to have the high top fade but certainly a lot of fun memories in this building playing against those great Notre Dame teams fonso Ellis Monty Williams uh always uh tough matchups playing against some of those great teams and it was great talking with Coach Phelps to Digger Phelps a lot of great history here in this building a lot of great players a lot of great coaches that have uh coached here and great atmosphere here what a great weekend it has been for Notre Dame big football win moving on advancing in the college football playoffs no doubt Neel iys Irish earlier today its been a basketball double header today they were dominant theyve got big wins this season they beat Yukon theyll be a force and ACC play Im telling you Marcus Burton comes back healthy with the way this Notre T Notre Dame team is evolving it could be a fun year for Hoops on the mens and the womens side for the Irish the womens team is tough really love watching them play great Energy Great excitement great guards it just really again do get better than hialgo and miles in the back court doesnt does not that is mustwatch TV right there Marcus Burton must watch oh I mean over 50 combined points between these two a triple double for Olivia I mean its special a lot of buckets right there and really just so fun to watch yeah West belt healthy and all bets are off that Irish team can make another charge in the final for michah Shrewsberry hoping his hoping his guys can make a run here as we move into the new year not happy on that offensive possession you got to love about him huh a big and youre still coaching them hard until there zero on the clock he is going to continue to coach uh he really they were locked in uh at their shooter around again uh he knows the importance of this game at home danler this time from the right corner for three yeah thats a breakdown right there again last game 20 points four six from the threepoint line cannot give him that much air space great diagonal pass that time and execution in the half court by Le Mo Daner now with 10 third dolphin in the double figures joining Koma and kedy drewberry inside puts his shoulder down hes going to the Applause line third foul on am Music Music quiet second half here for Shrewsberry thats actually his first point of the second half do want to remind you next Sunday well have the first of our four consecutive weeks of womens basketball quadruple headers here on acc Network at noon Hannah Hidalgo and third ranked Notre Dame hosting UVA followed by Louisville and BC at two Eastern then number 19 UNC and the canes of Miami and finally the Tigers of Clemson meet 21st ranked NC State in the night how tough is the ACC women side my goodness as deep of the league as youll find in the womens game maybe the deepest three ball carmy off to the left offensive rebound a rarity for the Dolphins here tonight Amika calls his own number left and short rebound by ji his Music sixth loo to Shrewsberry Shrewsberry had an ocean ball on the deck hes fouled again back to the stripe foul on 22 am his fourth 77 49 Word of Life mural also known as Touchdown Jesus beautiful here tonight Music Music he Music Music Music he Music w e e e e been impresses without him but make no mistake about it if they want to go on and make a run in the ACC regular season and try to get into the NCA tournament theyre going to need a healthy Marcus Burt but Ive been impressed with Tay Davis Braden Shrewsberry uh those two guys the jump that theyve made from last year to this year uh really has been impressive and then to go along with their defense but they set the tone early on against a Prett look this Le Moy team beat a dartman team thats pretty good they put the clamps on them in that first half uh they really were impressive defensively uh but again thats a longwinded way of saying I think their season get impressive but the health of Marcus Burton is going to be key getting him back healthy they got 10 days after this game uh before where they play again so again theyre going to have to get guys back Healthy Starts with Marcus B Cary knocks down the three there thats got to feel good here in his old gym timeout taken by the Irish 79 Music 54 bio blast on Marcus Burton and mean just the the the sheer importance right of a player like Burton not just what he does with the ball but hes a pretty good distributor of the ball as well and he opens up everybody else on the court well he makes it easier for the other guys again you have to its almost impossible to keep him out of the paint uh oneonone so what Marcus Burton does it makes it easier for the other guys to operate on the court make no mistake about it hes one of the best guards not just in the EC but in college basketball a guy that flirted with going to the NBA last year decided to come back goes down early in that Rucker game uh but hes getting closer to getting back on the court coach rusb staff has been impressed with how the other guys have stepped up but him back healthy Notre Dame is a team I can easily see being at the top the top half of the ACC it feels like some real estates available right in the ACC this season for teams to gain them absolutely and its going to be key every game is going to count and weve talked about of the numbers for the ACC is it going to be four is it going to be five teams potentially six dont know where uh those numbers are going to come from but make no mistake about it most coaches know you got to take care of business in particular when you get into the ACC regular season at the top You got Duke right Carolina Clemson pit those four seem to be a step ahead of everybody else smus had a nice nonconference slate who else figures and factors in well I think look Notre Dame certainly is a team that you have to watch out for but again once you get into leag play I dont care who youre playing whether its a wake a Georgia Tech a Virginia Tech look League Play is very difficult these coaches know that nice Bucket from HS hell go to the line for one more Notre Dame continues their impressive off offensive performance right here IMS through contact hes another guy with the absence of Burton has stepped up taking on more of an offensive role for this Notre Dame team fourth person oan Cary as zes connects hes got seven m d deep on it bench now getting some guys extended work its been an impressive night for the Irish here on their home court nice pass finger roll Tekken and another whistle Music timeout believe the Dolphins took it that time the Irish poised to get win number seven for Le Mo they almost stunned the state of New York first game of the year against Syracuse inner city battle they were leading late cut the lead to one and Le Mo got some big experience thats a group as they get in conference play could make a run there in the NC and push teams like Central Connecticut state or an fdu or even a wack yeah absolutely I mean look they have I think all the pieces we talked about it in the tip its not just one guy when you look at their stats not one player jumps out at you a guy thats averaging 20 but they have guys that are capable of going off for 30 we talked about that and I I think thats actually a luxury as a coach where you have multiple guys that are scoring options for you I think the big area uh for them rebounding uh I think thats going to be a key concern I think they have enough guys offensively uh to play with teams but as they get into League Play will they get hurt in the paint will they get hurt on the offensive glass I think thats going to be a big factor in the success of their season IES cant connect we talk about the injuries for the Irish but the Dolphins have injuries of their own Trent moscara Freds Pauls back beatus oscier Owens three heavy contributors not available here for Nate Champions Squad they hope to get those guys back soon and be at full strength that three ripped by kzn not good lley into the Lane off the glass no up ahead kesn his shot no oh it was tipped in did IM get it or was that a dolphin Im going to take credit for it yeah guys are going to be fighting for that one after the locker room who takes credit for that one couldnt tell from my vantage point right there they might go back and review that teammate on teammate crime that time trying to see whos going to get credit for those points jabbaar cant connect from the corner Tekken Blakeley finger roll not there with the left Applause hand heres IMS right corner kesn Sun ball fak skips it Imes hes fouls thatll be a three free throws coming for rmes itll be on the other side of this media timeout the Irish putting off the finishing touches here against Le Moy Music Applause Applause he Applause Music help help Applause Applause Applause a Applause Music Applause Music Applause all Applause Music Applause Music Bren Shrewsberry has stepped up in the absence of Marcus Burton and tonight another solid even yeah solid I think thats the key word his ability to play off the bounce I think thats been the biggest Improvement in his game we know he can catch and shoot but his ability to do this right here play through contact floaters uh he added that to his game you can see the improved work in the waight room hes able to play more through contact and again life without Marcus Burton uh Davis and also Shrewsberry have picked up uh the missed scoring that that they have with Marcus Burton being out of action and tonight again another solid night for those two yeah 40 combined points efficient from the floor got to the line put the pressure on that Dolphins defense and Notre Dame 8558 make it 86 to 58 as IMS now with a new career high it was eight he is well passing now at 11 Music leley its been a good night for coroma on the slip am lost it picked up by eyes Irish can run they had numbers dolphins getting back three ball in the corner short that was sunra am no look Cary Amika hell dial up a three thats too strong and the rebound from sunra here at SRA The Freshman from Ashburn Virginia saw the coaches putting him through the paces working him out pick and roll situations this is something that coaches do like though in these games get a chance to get some of their younger players guys that dont get a lot of minutes on a normal basis get them some action reward them for all the work they put Music in Sandra Music in want to remind you that acpm with Mark Packer and Taylor tanom it can be seen weekday at four Eastern here on acc Network and also on the ES Cole Sera into the scoring column The Freshman from looy Illinois first basket made as a member of the Irish basketball team I mean come on now thats pretty nice right there going into the holiday getting a bucket and certainly thats one that he will remember nice little girl cut and finish first points of his career then parlays into an energy boost right diving on the floor get your first bucket well coaches are watching again they dont players know look but whether theres two minutes left in the game a minute mapup does not make a difference they want you going in playing hard and certainly thats how you continue to try to get yourself in the rotation and earn Music minutes three ball rattles out sundra stick back no long rebound a scrum one by the Dolphins Leo on the attack layup not there Second Chance opportunity it was Isaac nundi will go to the line benches of empty here for both sides in a good way getting guys into the game yeah and I think again both sides are right anytime you get a chance to get guys that are not a part of the normal rotation or walk on uh you get a chance to reward them with some playing time on national TV certainly something that these coaches like doing Applause Music Applause Music slapped them both short and and if youre wondering why theyre cheering naos again whether students are on campus or not fans if a opposing team misses two free throws in a row free nachos I just need to know are we part of that deal do we get that deal Im starving and not sound pretty good right about now all right Im going hold you to that if not you still going to pay for my nachos right I got you my man were in the holiday spirit three ball launched off to the right offensive rebound s of three yes first points in the bag now its first three in the back yeah pretty good looking shot as well to mechanics that ball touch nothing but net nice response there from leoy most points in the game this season for not Damon the most since 2022 they nearly cracked 100 they had 99 against Boston College back on February 16th of 20122 the attack not there Thomas atan the Irish going to pump the breaks they are strong Victory here tonight one last time before the holidays and for 2025 Notre Dame flexes 9162 over Le Moy well the defense the defense set the tone but their two star players Tay Davis Braden Shrewsberry
