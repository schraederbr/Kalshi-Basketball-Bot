between playing assistant coaching and coaching We got a great one in store here tonight as William Kyle III and Reed Von Tutic take the jump ball The orange control and theres the captain JJ Stling taking things from the point George finds Starling who lays it up and in as smooth as hed like from the start there DVO And thats the start you want to have for Syracuse and for JJ Stling Being aggressive getting downhill to the bucket applying pressure every single possession down A look at the Stonehill lineup Rex Sunderland Devonte Hackett Hermon Kofi Rvon Tutic and Raymond Espanol Guzman Kofi the standout player for Stonehill Im here Extra pass to Hackit Good ball pressure there by Sadique White Heres Kofi steps back over Kings and drains it Hermon Kofi hes the standout guy for Stonehill DVO And Stonehill offensively in the half court theyre going to be patient Theyre going to move the ball Syracuse has to apply ball pressure and they have to be aware of Kofi Hes a guy who could make shots and make tough shots at that As you can see Kofi a preseason allNEC selection And a look at the Syracuse lineup unchanged as Starling Kings George White and Kyle continue to hold down the fiveman lineup Ref stop play for issue with the contact lens It looked like well have our first change of the game as Pierce Mcguin is forced into action due to the change It was Espanol Guzman that had to check out Hes getting looked at by the athletic trainer now And Sean you see Syracuse has the advantage at every single position on the floor So when theyre able to be aggressive and attack thats what they should do Stling out to White JJ no hesitation drains it So the first five points of the game go to number two And hes only two points away now from crossing that000 point mark And really the last four or five games he started off really hot He just has to be able to continue that throughout the whole game Ky over to Sunderland McGuins first touch of the game A lot of motion from this Stonehill offense in the early going And Sean if youre Syracuse you just want to get up and make Stonehill uncomfortable You dont want to let them see those passing lanes You dont want to let him make easy decisions with the basketball Nice contest there from Stling and Kyle Sunderland got to grab a William Kyles wrist And you know every time that Stonehill tries to get downhill William Kyle is going to be able to put pressure on you blocking shots altering shots Stone Hill is going to have a long night if they think theyre going to have a clean looks at the rim Kyle sets the screen for George George pulls up and he drains it Hot start for the Orange as Nathan Jar George George opens his account for the night He was coming off his best game of the season 226 and six And how did he have that game He was looking to be aggressive He wasnt hesitant He wasnt overthinking He was just playing and looking taking Starling WITH AN EMPHATIC FINISH to cross the thousand point mark Its JJ1K 1000 in the orange jersey And that might be the fourth straight game where he hit his first three shots And thats a way to get your thousand points on an emphatic dunk down the lane Great start for this team Great start for Starling and the Orange Its like he knew DVO he was just seven points away and he made sure he got it out the way early and now he just has to continue that play going forward in this game Aggressive orange Theres that pressure youre talking about cheering At no point in this game Syracuse let Stonehill feel comfortable And Chris Krauss head coach of Stonehill is feeling a bit of that discomfort 122 all orange one Heres a look at what hes been able to do Mixing it up going inside getting the kick out from Sadique hitting it from the outside as well And then DVO that emphatic dunk as well on the break JJ Stling getting it done on both ends so far in this one Well hes just being active on both ends of the floor And when you do that you just feel a little bit more confident about yourself Youre not thinking about things Youre just going out there and playing basketball The local kid a Baldwinville product transferred to Syracuse after his first year at Notre Dame He came home DVO He came home Adrien Autry brought him home to try and create something special here together This is the season where they think it might be possible And pretty awesome to score a000 points in front of your family cheering Heres George looking to push the pace Kyle sets the screen George pulls another one just off on that screaming one But its not a bad look We We saw George in pregame and he was knocking down those threes You just dont want to settle You want to be aggressive especially when you have success early on Sunderland corrals the miss DVO taking a look here at your DVOs dimes for Stonehill What you got Well that was one of them right there Slow down the game and execute in half court make threes if youre Stonehill And then defensively they have to make Syracuse a perimeter team Keep guys in front and keep them out of the paint And then as far as Syracuse goes drive the ball downhill every single possession You have the advantage Get the ball inside attack the rim and then dominate both ends Be aggressive on both ends Ball pressure getting in passing lanes Dont make them or dont let them get comfortable And then we just talked about offensively getting downhill Sadique White showing that aggression there 125 Orange early in this one This is the start Talking to them at practice at shoot around and now seeing them in action on the court Starling restarts at the top of the key See if you can keep up that hot start DVO George finds Kings Kings over to George the jab step Sent Sunderland on skates and gets the friendly roll Nate George says Count it His second threepointer of the night When hes looking to be aggressive scoring the basketball hes a much better player Great movement early on in that half court by Syracuse Ended up in a good look and a knockdown by Nate George George is coming off his best game of the season The Orange want to see a confident Canadian leading the charge Theres Hackett screaming Kofi finds Sunderland open at the top of the key who cant answer the trifecta Kofi over to Hackett who drains one So Devonte Hackett into the starting lineup today in place of the injured Chaz Stinson Knocks down his first three of the night And Hack hes an aggressive scorer He can he can do it from beyond the arc He can get to the basket And thats something thats really been hurting Syracuse these last few games offensive or excuse me defensive rebounding limited second and third chances for the other team White pulls up and he drains one So the orange hot early from distance Well look Sean they havent had any trouble scoring the basketball They scored 91 points last game The problem is keeping guys out of the paint and defending keeping the ball in front They have to be able to keep the pressure on this Stonehill team on this end of the floor Both teams getting it going from distance in this one It was Devonte Hackit who knocked one down from distance A good scorer like you said DVO Well hes aggressive and again it was it was off a offensive rebound so it was an easy look But if this guy right here is knocking down open threepoint shots watch out Hes already as athletic as they come Now hes going to have to have the defense respect that hes going to be able to drive by to the basket every time Nice knockdown right there by White Tudic misses the first free throw Three new faces in for the Orange Tyler Betsy Akir Sar and Cayenne Anthony check into the game And for Stonehill Anthony Holden and Pierce McGuin check into the game alongside Trenton Ruth Tudic knocks down the second And Sean how about Anthony last game 18 points in 21 minutes Its really a microwave off the bench right It comes in just looking to attack Instant score instant offense And it was efficient as well 18 points on just those six shots Well see if Kai can pick up where he left off Here he is Cenne getting into that midrange Getting to the basket And just like that Kayenne Anthony knocks one down Well hes hes a great driver to the basket but how about the patience and the pace that he plays with Hes able to slow fast and then make a decision once something opens up for him Tying now six for his last seven He hasnt been missing cheering a lot of shots recently Kings pushes the pace Hes got Holden matched up with him That feels like a mismatched dbo And Kings rocks the cradle brings the baby inside and finishes with the left Well it seems like coach Red told them from the beginning of the game attack the rim dont settle And thats what theyre doing early and often They have to continue that throughout this 40 minutes And wasnt that the DVOs dime for the Orange as well Get downhill get to the basket Get downhill apply pressure to the rim everything else opens up from there Theres Tutic finishes with a tough layup inside And see with Tut you got to do your work early Either youre going to front three quarters or dont let him get the ball But once he gets it that low hes a physical big guy Hes going to try to bump and get to that rim Anthony from distance just long on that one but itll stay here as Akir Sari was fouled underneath by Tudic and Sean Im not going to say its a bad shot but you just scored the basket by music driving to the basket being aggressive right just continue that that shot will be there whenever you want it Anthony has done a really good job of picking his spots getting to the areas on the court where hes comfortable he never seems like hes sped up on the court hes really mature for a freshman he knows how to play the game Obviously he hes learned from one of the best to ever do it but you could see it in how he handles the ball and how he makes decision Hes never sped up Luke Fenel on the ball for the first time tonight is Betsy The turnaround Jay No good The miss coraled by Ruth Betsy is another guy who I I like him a lot He can shoot the ball Hes a big body He can get downhill being aggressive You just want to see a little bit more consistency from him Ruth the lefty step back No good Luke Fenel the Aussie controlling the tempo right now Calls for the screen from Sare Fenel out to Anthony Its taken away Thats Holden going to the basket No good there Betsy tries to corral the miss Cant do so screaming Kofi back out to Ruth who knocks it down And again those are loose balls that Syracuse has to get Didnt get the loose ball ends up in another made three Couple possessions before gave up offensive rebound knocked down open three They have to be able to limit those type of things The Orange went up 11 in this one This is what youre talking about DVO Sustained pressure Can they keep their foot on the gas here early And then when you have a bad defensive possession dont come down here and be hesitant You still got to be aggressive and attack the rim Anthony fouled by Kofi with the hand check The Orange up eight here Cenne Anthony talking to coach Adrien Audrey Well see what the Orange have in the paint When you drive the paint youre going to collapse the defense Now you got open kicks and theyre able to knock him down tonight Anthony off the inbound Unable to get it to go but he picked up the foul Kai and Anthony will be headed to the line for the first time tonight And Sean I I know Kai he can shoot it from deep but I I just think hes a much better player when hes able to get to the rim get to the free throw line and now open up his his perimeter game He has great size Hes creative at the rim great footwork Just a better player when hes looking to be aggressive and not settle at first Anthony has been working on his free throws in practice that one in and out for the freshman Hes got great shooting touch inside and out DVO its just a matter of time before he gets him to go from the charity strike Its nothing wrong with his shot I mean hes a guy you go up there you shoot it with confidence He should be a 85 or more free throw shooter and he will be as he continues his career but hes a guy that nothings wrong with the shot Hes going to go up there and knock it down You got the last name Anthony People arent usually worried about your jumper thats for sure Ruth brings it up the court Came off the bench in this one but hes provided some instant offense for Stonehill And this this is a great opportunity for guys like Fenel and Zephr to come in and really make an impact Show what they got Maybe they earn themselves some more minutes going down the road Espenol Guzman finds Ruth on the back door Ruth to high lefty unable to drop Theres Mcguin as the Orange looking to get a rebound They cant Mcguin follows up his own miss and the Pennsylvania native gets one to go And Sean that just cant happen Thats their fourth offensive rebound I mean it was a good job by Suare coming over but you got to have somebody else coming to get the rebound when he goes for that block shot There was four guys one guy from Stonehill Cant happen Sari returns the favor Anthony drives and hes stripped Here comes Hermman Kofi all the way to the rack and Saware gets that shot out of there Sky high from Ski to keep Kofrey from dropping one in Theres a great job Great effort by Suare just running down the floor previous possession Anthony has to do a better job of seeing where those defenders are but great job by Suare making up running the floor getting the block shot The Orange brought all five starters back into the game and the ball went out of play there See if they can pick up where they left off Starling presses Kofi Espanol Guzman the righty shot Sadique White gets a piece of that one Heres George in transition Goes underneath Cant get the floater to go Ruth comes away with it Gets the screen from Guzman Theres Hermmon Kofi the shooter for Stonehill No good on that one And Kyle skies for the miss Its a good stunt by Stling but you got to be aware who youre stunting with Kofi is one of the best threepoint shooters on the team Stay down Stay down Stay down Nathan George drew the foul on that one We saw him take 14 free throws against Northeastern knocking down 12 Nathan George getting downhill One of the keys to the game tonight And we know how good he is off the pick and roll making decisions But when hes aggressive looking to get downhill getting to the free throw line its going to open up his overall game Its going to make his teammates better When Syracuse drives the paint they have to be able to recognize those shooters out on the perimeter George calmly knocks down the first one Free throws have been one of the storylines of this Syracuse season but theyve shown improvement of late Were only shooting 54 over the first 10 games Theyve upped that with 73 in their last two DV And we dont want to dwell on the past too much but you figure at least two or three of those games you hit some more free throws you win those games Yeah And now were were talking about maybe 10 and two instead of eight and four So we know how important free throws are And its really good to see the Syracuse team improving at that aspect The Orange come out of the made free throws with some pressure and Stonehill will have to try and break it Hackett makes it look easy Espanol with the pump fake Nice ball pressure from the orange here defensively Espanol Guzman goes up kicks out to Ruth No good as Sadique White grabs the miss cheering And it was good ball movement right there by Stonehill They got a good opportunity A good shot Starling backs down Ruth puts up the righty Cant get it to go So we had those seven points early from JJ Sterling his first shot attempt since that stretch And we want to be aggress and Syracuse wants to be aggressive but you have to get some good ball movement You just dont want to go play off of one pass and try to attack when the defense is already set Stling picks up the foul on Ruth JJ Stling Two on two there Trenton Ruth Detroit guy DVO much like yourself Yeah Detroit guy from Ferndale Actually lived in Ferndale for a year when I was coaching at Detroit Mercy But we know about those Midwest guys Sean tough as now So hes going to come out here and compete at a high level Won a state championship as a junior at Ferndale High School looking to bring that winning pedigree to Stonehill Now Espanol Guzman we havent seen him take that three but he looks up at the rim every time as Ruth misses everything from range Syracuse is doing a good job of keeping Stonehill out on the perimeter keeping guys in front If you do that its going to be tough shots every single possession for Stonehill Zero field goals in the last five minutes for the Orange Lets see if they can break the drought on this possession Well they have to see where they can get the advantage when theyre coming down the down screen or up the pick and roll Make a good decision That was a good decision right there Kalis to knock down that little floater William Kyle shooting nearly 74 from the field this year Not often that you see him even miss one from that range Hes been super efficient around the rim this year for Syracuse Hacket will get called for the illegal screen applause and the Orange take a ninepoint lead Look at that got a Syracuse lacrosse jersey in the building to the faces not just of the children but to the team as well It was something that I heard them talking about at practice after how much they enjoyed the visit No made field goals for either team in the last three minutes The Orange looking to end that here as JJ Stalin a tough bucket inside And Syracuse does a good job in the half court especially tonight of coming off that little down screen curling it all the way to the basket JJs done it a couple times They have to keep being aggressive off of that curl Stling now with nine points and he got a hand on that one Hes pleading his case for it to be orange ball I think he might have a case there Debo Syracuse has has been doing a good job defensively initially but the second chance points is 11 to zero right now But they keep giving Stonehill chances and more opportunities You cant keep doing that White got backed down by Espanol Guzman Guzman back out to Kofi Forced into a tough shot Cant make it Stling advances to George George out to Stling Full head of steam JJ the turnaround screaming Cant get it to go Sari skyed up there got a hand on it but Stonehill comes away with it Tudic nice pass out to Kofi Corner three bullseye That was a great job by Stone Hill right there playing with a little bit of pace getting ahead of the defense and a great pass right there out to the threepoint line He knows what to do with it knocking it down Sare getting some extended minutes here Kings the elbow jumper just long shot It just seems like Syracuse lost that pace that they had early on in the half court Theyre whipping the ball side to side and youre going to get an advantage like that late closeouts and youre able to get more drives They got to get back to that Kofi unable to convert there but those are the sort of looks that could give Syracuse trouble George drives into lane The hoop and the harm Nathan George and JJ Stling share a little flex there the starting back court for the Orange getting it done And Sean if youre Syracuse try to get out and play with a little bit of pace Get ahead of the defense before they set up in the half court Great job by George getting downhill noticing that getting to the paint A chance for and one Nathan George already up to 12 points on the night coming off that season high 22 in the last game talking to coach Autry about Nathan Georges early season struggles He said Nate George is a guy that works too hard for those struggles to continue and were seeing him shake off the rust a little bit here in the last couple of games Well weve weve all seen him play We saw him play at Georgia Tech We know what type of year he had last year in the ACC So we know what hes capable of Everybodys been waiting for this breakout game that he had against Nor Eastern Now he just has to continue that going into ACC play Starling lays it in with a full head of steam JJ Stling hes hard to stop Well JJ is at his best when hes playing at that speed getting downhill And Syracuse is at their best when theyre able to get out in transition and play with that base The Orange extend the lead back to 12 Betsy getting in the passing lane screaming cheering Rex Sunderland havent said his name too much tonight draws the foul versus Tyler Betsy And Sean look what Syracuse is doing a great job of extending Stonehill all the way out by half court Stone Hill is starting their offense at half court Its hard to do that that far away from the rim Syracuse has had their own issues of doing the same thing on the offensive end but theyre doing a great job of pushing Stonehill away from the basket Kofi sizes up Kings Sunderland comes off the screen Oh Betsy right there switching and guarding the point guard Saware another rejection Hell pick up the foul on that last one as Tudic underneath was mixing it up Yeah that was great to see Tyler Betsy getting out as Sar got a piece of the first one And then it was Pierce McGuin who drew the foul on the putback Another offensive rebound conceded by the Orange And you see me Im circling it right here on the statue Thats their seventh offensive rebound They already have 11 second chance points Thats the only thing thats keeping him in the game keeping him around right now A guy that might help with some of that defensive rebounding just checked back into the game as William Kyle III returns McGuin knocks down a pair as the Orange with under five minutes to go have a 10point lead George directs traffic Stonehill going to a little two3 zone See how the Orange respond George has to be aware of that You got to get a guy in that high post or drive that gap George aggressive again with the hang time Air Canada from Nathan George Thats a great job of noticing that split right there up top and just driving it downhill getting to the basket Thats one way to beat the zone right Go right down the middle of it Being aggressive and drive those gaps George now up to 14 points on the night We may be looking at another season high for him tonight Tudic and Kyle Thats a battle of the bigs underneath And it looks like William Kyle wins that round Great play from the Nebraska native Great job just standing his ground hands up getting the block Stonehill stays in the zone George finds Starling who goes up with the right hand JJ Stling Hes the Baldwinsville bucket Again handoff from George Turn the corner Hes getting that speed straight downhill Its tough to stop JJ Stling when he has that type of speed getting downhill Sunderland finds Tudic up top Theres Cory Lavell the New Zealand leader Sunderland got Betsy on his hip Remain Stonehill possession A few changes will come into the game and JJ Stling has been changing pace all night It was William Kyle III welcoming Stonehill to the block party before JJ Stling finished underneath Syracuse team getting it going offensively and also setting the tone defensively ball pressure getting in passing lanes it just making it uncomfortable for these Stonehill guards 5 seconds on the shot clock as Guzman gets underneath goes up with the left hand Unable to finish Itll be Syracuse ball coming down Syracuse got lucky on that one They have to have a better communications on the out of bounds right there Anthony in the game for George and Betsy and for White Kyle finds Nate Kings who takes the three ball in and out for the shooter Packet controls finds Hermmon Kofi Kofi up to five points on the night Good ball movement from the Skyhawks and it ends with a three ball from Raymond Espanol Guzma Great movement around the key You called it It started with the baseline drive Kick to the corner kick to the wing kicked up top and Guzman knocking it down Great ball movement right there Sean Anthony from range Another one just off not getting the friendly rolls that Nathan George got in the early going here Syracuse has 20 paint points Do what has been leading you to success in this first half Attack attack attack Stonehill just kind of hanging around in this one and the Orange have controlled throughout but no putaway punch quite yet in this first half Ruth nice crossover there Starling good box out and commanding rebound Finds Kyle underneath Good footwork He gets stuffed by the rim on that one You dont see that often from William Kyle And Hackett comes down on the other end and drains a three It just always feels like it goes that way right Debo Well a few times Syracuse something happens on this end and they dont hustle back and get back on defense And twice now Stonehill has been able to convert with a threepoint field goal Stling comes up short on the Euroep And Stonehill cuts it to single digits Sean you see Stonehill playing with a little bit of pace but they will slow it up and be patient and look for a good shot Their confidence has grown over the last couple of minutes here Tudic fouled by Betsy underneath I say Stonehill just did a good job of continuing to play William Kyle with the miss dunk and they getting out and running Great job right there by Hackett open on the wing knocking it down Kyle good pressure there Itll remain Stonehill ball under a minute to go in this first half And defensively right now Syracuse is a step still slow even on that last possession on the foul right there with two dish Betsy has to do a better job of coming over early and meeting him higher where he cant be so close to the rim Coach Chris Krauss calls out the commands and gets his Skyhawk set up Good deflection there by Sadi White Forces the steal Great job by Anthony meeting him higher and Anthony draws the foul on the way up Thats how you create some offense DVO playing good defense on the other end And they play with a little bit of pace He got the ball up ahead and Anthony know what he did He didnt settle He went to the cup aggressively He either going to finish or get fouled Anthony will be headed back to the line for his second trip tonight will be Kenne for two shots Three points on the night for Cayenne Anthony following up that 18point performance in the last one Sean I just feel like Cuse has to play with more urgency Its 3527 and Stonehill shouldnt even be in the game This is their last nonconference game until you play Clemson the 31st of December You have to be able to set the tone for this game going into conference play Anthony another 50 trip at the line Ruth brings it up the court 14second differential between the shot clock and game clock where Syracuse has to communicate talk Kyle right now just has to let Anthony know whats going on whats behind him Sadique White gets the switch on to Ruth And Ruth loses control of that one Stonehills got to put a shot up Hacket put it up No good And itll be a shot clock violation Good finish to a defensive possession there for the Orange Yeah they need more possessions where they could on the season Have a chance to go 8 one tonight and then New Years Eve against Clemson Well get into that one a little later Last possession of the half for the Orange Stonehill comes out in zone Theres Stling Kick out to Kings and Kings drains it Its the Kings Gambit to end the first half for Syracuse Members of the basketball family and rightfully so Sean Home Alone whether its one two or three what how many of Home Alone should always be starting The undisputed Christmas movie goat amongst the Cuse consensus Heres Tudic Kyle gambled on that one Hackit looking for nine and hes got it Devonte Hackett found the space and made no mistake right there William Kyle doesnt even have to cheat He cheats Get in the paint Kick it out Wide open three for Stonehill Starling bends the corner goes up aggressively Sadique chases down the first Syracuse offensive rebound of the night White goes up strong and hes fouled So theres Syracuse giving Stonehill a taste of their own medicine Good fight shown by the freshman and Sadi has been quiet in this first half He has to show his athleticism his explosiveness and he could do it especially if its a Stonehill team Get the ball in the high post rip through and attack the basket Yeah its been a quiet night for the Qs front court Sadique with three points and William Kyle still yet to get on the score sheet Well and heres my thing Every team that Syracuse faces theyll be just as athletic or more athletic They have to be able to use that to their advantage White comes up empty on that one and they have to be able to make free throws yall Tudic from the high post finds Hackett Starling and Kyle suffocating defense underneath Sunderland looks for an option cheering Hackett Hes had the hot hand for Stonehill Hermon Kofi goes up and Sadi White great contest at the rim Great job by White coming over Syracuse in the half court defense They have to bump the cutters They cant let guys just cut through cleanly What a look from Nathan George Looked like he had eyes in the back of his head there to find Sadi White We know about Nathan George passing ability When you have guys like William Kyle and Sadi White you dont even have to look Just throw the ball up the rim Theyre going to go get it George to White A winning combination for the Orange Packet takes the screen from Guzman Arman Kofi had five points early We havent seen him score yet as Sunderland draws the foul And just like little details we talked about bumping the cutters as they go through Dont let them cut cleanly And then on those pick and rolls if youre going to fight over fight over Push them to the side Dont let them turn the corner Right there Southerntherland had the advantage just turned the corner Thats why I got the foul call Sunderland cornered by Kings Gets out of it Tudic underneath Stland comes over to help and Tudic misses the second chance but hell be headed to the line Sean one thing for Syracuse if youre going to go go You You cant JJ was playing in between right here If youre going to go go Hes already too deep when JJ gets there You have to make a decision right when he gets the ball to be able to go over and take him while hes further away from the rim Thats a good job by Stonehill just being aggressive Tudic one for two on the line tonight Make it two for cheering three Soft touch from the serot Sean you youll hear this Syracuse these Syracuse fans get restless as you go deeper into the game if Stonehill is able to hang around Orange went into the break up 12 looking to sustain some pressure for a full 40 minutes hoping to create a little bit of a gap here to start the second half Starling avoids the screen goes up cant finish White nearly put it down on the putback Kyle finds Starling for three Just long White got another hand on that one Hes bringing the intensity on the offensive glass but unable to control it And I like what Stlings doing Hes being aggressive If you have an open threepoint shot shoot the ball You You cant be hesitant at all The Orange started redot from deep Four for six from three Just one make out of six attempts since then And weve seen JJ knock down threes You cant think about it Thats when you start to miss shots Sunderland the drive and kick to Kofi Tudic backs down White drop step Good footwork Sunderland from deep drains it So Stonehill cuts the lead to six And how about a great job of playing down low and then noticing the help come kicking it out to his shooter It like most mid major teams youre going to see them be patient in the half court because they dont necessarily have that guy to go oneonone in isol situations George gets to the rack but just cant finish as Stonehill starts to show some signs of life in the second half And look just over 16 minutes to go and and Stonehill is creeping back Youre giving them more confidence as they go forward in this game Starling gets a hand on that one Tudic the big man Great footwork underneath to find Sunderland out top And great job being patient noticing William Kyle coming in and hes going to hit a shooter every single time Southerntherlands going to knock that down Sunderland shoots 35 from deep Thatll help the percentages Stonehills doing a great job with body movement and ball movement trying to create advantages off their passing and their movement Three seconds on the shot clock as Hackett pulls one No good Kings picks up the miss Heres Nathan George looking to pick up where he left off in that first half Good footwork A pretty finish off the glass Thats one of those slow steps right there Great job by Nate George controlling it and able to get an opportunity at the rim finish it Hacket and Starling Two big body guards going at it Sunderland takes a screen from Tudic but itll be an illegal screen by Tudic Back and forth to start this second half as the Orange look to gain control as we come back Syracuse outside A good shot there Chris Krauss fratonizing with the enemy him and Carmelo Anthony I think even for a head coach its pretty cool to look to your right and you see Melo sitting behind you Debo Absolutely Its a Hall of Famer One of the best to do it in my opinion top five offensive player basketball player of all time All time I love it I I stamp it Im not arguing He can do it in every single way off the jab off the catch off the dribble whatever you want hes gonna give it to you Melo was just in Massachusetts a few months ago as Nate Kings knocks it down to be enshrined into the Nasit Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame Congratulations once again to the legend And its good to see Nate Kings getting on track knocking it down Again Ive said this several times he was recruited as a shooter We need to see him knock down some more of those Yeah a slow start on the season from deep but Nate Kings has picked it up in recent weeks Starland closes out Packet the pump fake Betsys cheering and applause box out not strong enough to keep Guzmans hands off it And they didnt make the shot but great job by Southern driving the ball getting into the paint collapsing the defense and then finding his open shooter Just didnt knock it down that time Change here for the Orange as Cayenne Anthony checks back into the game Orange up 11 again here Sunderland to inbound Hermon Kopi still looking to get going Hes really the goto guy for Stonehill but we havent seen him produce all that much on the offensive end And if you watch Stonehill rarely are they just standing still The guys are moving off the ball creating opportunities just by having a lot of ball body movement Excuse me High IQ play there from Kayenne Anthony drawing the charge They call that teach tape DVO A great job just standing his ground And when you lower that shoulder more times than not theyre going to call that offensively Anthony the top of the key Gets a screen from Sar Just like that Rex Sunderland took a page out of his book and drew the charge back Hey you could do it I could do it a little bit better Right Giving a taste of his own medicine Thunder shifted those feet over and like you said DVO got in position and drew it You just got to be careful offensively when he beats you to the spot You got to be careful lowering that shoulder You just got to be in control Play off two feet Hacket crosses over drives in the lane and Sari gets a hand on it And a great job that time by Suare meeting him early not letting him get close to the rim His third block of the night Hes been active in this one Anthony driving kick to Starling Backs down Anthony gets around Kofi A kick out to Sari from deep No good Just the second shot attempt from Sari on the season number one and I dont think that coach Autry is pleased with that decision from him as William Kyle quickly relieves him Yeah that I mean thats something if you havent shot a three the whole year theres a reason why and you see right there and coach Red rightfully just laughter taking him out the game But youre playing your role Youre youre doing what can impact the team and right there thats thats not something that impacts the team in a positive way Starling hit on the elbow there Hell be headed back to the free throw line Sean every time Syracuse attacks the middle of this defense they have another guy right there waiting for it which means they have a draw and kick opportunity and that guy whos getting the kick can play off that long close out if he doesnt have that shot You love to see Saris teammates putting their arms around his shoulder Bad decision there from the big man I think he realizes it being on the bench now Hes got Nathan George and Sadique White kind of uplifting him over there Its hard not to laugh and and I did I had to giggle a little bit but if you play basketball long enough youre going to make you know bad decisions and thats one he wants back but Coach Red let him know he get back in the game and and do what he does Starling full head of steam Hell be headed back to the line Offensive rebound there from the Orange off the free throw miss and itll send Starling back to the charity stripe for a chance to make amends And I think the big thing is right now even if you do have an open opportunity from three drive that basketball into lane get two feet down play in control on balance and get an opportunity at the rim If you dont make it try to get fouled an opportunity at the line JJ gets that one to go for his 14th point of the night And even right there right there on the free throw it looked smooth It was a fluid motion It It was just one motion and he went through his shot and held his follow through Go up there and be confident Shoot the basketball Stling splits a pair there and Betsy will be called for a foul 94 ft from the basket tried to steal another possession there after the most recent trip ended in a free throw miss Just a silly foul right there by Betsy If he has the position let him get it Run back on defense Stonehill scoreless in their last three and a half minutes Lets see what the Skyhawks can do to change that Packet dodges the screen Anthony with a great play to meet him at the apex and a late whistle to draw the foul But it was a great drive by Hackett right there He got Anthony on his hip See right here Anthony on his hip William C has to come over earlier right away He should be right there on that block and the opportunity wouldnt even have been there for Hacker Looked like a lot of ball there from seven And his father not too pleased not the first dad to argue with a referees call against his son But heres the thing Sean he had the advantage Anthony was on his hip So theyre always going to give that call to the offensive player especially if that defensive player isnt all the way in front Weve seen Kayenne Anthony himself take advantage of that on the offensive end time and time again this season with some crafty play Stonehill down 10 And the Orange look to respond Stling with the screen from Kyle and Hackit And Kyle got tangled up there Itll be a foul on Devonte Hackett His third personal Stonehill wont want to see him get in foul trouble Well well even on that one right there JJ if Im coming off there and I dont have anybody guarding me its either a shot or Im attacking the rim right away You cant wait and let the defense get back in position Kyle heads to the line Syracuse is now in the bonus and he calmly knocks it down cheering William Kyles first point of the night comes from the charity strike I got shooter After a couple of strong performances from the line Syracuses percentage dipping a little bit again here tonight The free throws arent on the coaches You have plenty of free time especially now with no classes to get in the practice gym and and shoot 100 200 free throws Theres no excuse for guys coming out here and missing free throws And they have it I Ive seen it being in a force And the Orange just got to do what it takes to be more efficient from that spot It was a big reason they were able to score 91 points against Nor Eastern If you can take advantage of those opportunities this whole thing will open up Highscoring teams are usually good free throw shooting teams Betsy from deep unable to go Great box out from Kofi to keep Kings from getting it And Id love to see Betsy be more aggressive getting to the basket using his 68 frame playing through that contact Espanol Guzman the pump fake the pass fake and Betsy talk about using the 68 frame gets a piece of that one And I love Betsy I think hes a really good shooter but you dont want to fall in love with that every time especially when youre 68 and you have that big build Use that to your advantage Tyler Betsy a New England guy He was the twotime Connecticut State Player of the Year And he got those awards for more than just shooting being an allaround player with that 68 frame Weve seen glimpses throughout the season Ruth the lefty pulls one Unable to go And now Stonehills getting into what Thats not how they play oneonone iso ball They got to get some movement and create advantage off of their ball movement Kyle looks for a back down Hes got on his rump puts one down but the foul will be on the floor as William Kyle the third is sent back to the free throw line And for Syracuse I Im not mad at dropping it down to William Kyle But one two three pounds thats not his game Give him a duck in where he could get right in the middle of the rim catch it and then turn and try to dunk on somebody Thats more efficient for William Kyle Kyle back to the free throw line where hes one for two So one and one as Bryce Zephr checks into the game Zephr is a guy who you can really count on the ball pressure on the defensive side of the ball And I think Sean thats really where he can make an impact on the Syracuse team Kyle missed everything cheering on that one Itll be Stonehill ball underneath The Orange come out in their fullcourt press And I like the pressure Now lets get into it and cause some turnovers out of it Ruth brings the ball up the court Gets across the timeline Sunderland setting up shop Lets see what the Skyhawks have to offer Theres Kofi the wrong guy to leave open but he misses another one Good job by Syracuse keeping Stonehill out on the perimeter George surveys the landscape Ball ends up with Will Kyle underneath Good defense from Stonehill but Kyle the man with the plan underneath flushes one cheering William Kyle the third stuffs one down the chimney Thats a little bit better than four dribbles How about just get it to me under the rim and dunk on somebodys head Thats the efficient William Kyle we know In the words of Kai and Anthony if youre standing under that rim hes going to dunk on you William Kyle the third First one of those weve seen tonight And William Kyle we know what you can do around THE RIM THROW IT DOWN one time big fella And being a threat to score the basketball it just opens up his passing ability and just opens up his overall floor game Hes been more decisive and its coming at the right time as Syracuse gets ready for ACC play The ball will remain with Stonehill as Tudic got a hand on it So the five for the Orange George Zephr Kyle Betsy and Anthony Stonehill no made field goals in the last 6 and a half minutes but the Orange still unable to get the gap any wider than 134 points Kofi plays off two feet and hands it These last two possessions Stonehill is getting two feet in the orange area And for anybody who doesnt know what the orange area is thats called the paint And when you get in the paint you collapse the D You get easier opportunities at the rim Syracuse has to do a better job of keeping these guys out of the paint Kyle in the post goes against Kudich underneath The hook shot from Kyle off the back iron Sean just look at everybody else just looking at Kyle No off the ball movement no cutting to the rim nothing like that Just stagnant looking at him dribble the basketball Kofi goes past Betsy Swing around Theres Sunderland from the top of the key Hes wide right Another good opportunity for Stonehill Great ball movement Zephr the California native Finds George looking to pick up with that aggression Hell draw a block Rex Sunderland Thats his fourth personal foul He fouled out of their last game against New Hampshire Stonehill already without much depth due to injuries Cant afford to lose Sunderland in this one And Southerns been playing really good hitting open shots getting downhill making plays for his teammates Nathan Nathan George back at the free throw line where hes two for three tonight Just off there Few new faces into the game as Sadique White and JJ Stling check back in and Devin Hackett checks back in for Sunderland And if Im Coach Red Im keeping JJ Stling in the rest of this game 945 keeping one of my best players in the game and letting him play this through Its the starting five with Zephr in for Kings now for the Orange Under 10 minutes to go Theres Ruth and Kyle welcomes him to the block party And Im going to nitpick a little bit here Sean on that pick and roll And you see Kyle dropping Hes so athletic Hes going to be able to get back and get to the block shot right here If Im Kyle Im trying to take away that alley to the rim downhill and cut it off and make him play side to side So he didnt have that opportunity at all Ruth looks for an option Six seconds on the shot clock Heres Ruth Not much time George got a hand up and misses everything Great defensive possession there from the Orange coming out of the inbound And if youre Syracuse those are the type of defensive possessions you want Stay in front force Stonehill out of the paint and force them into tough shots Great job right there defensively by Syracuse The Orange defensively use a metric called kills Three stops in a row equals one kill Theres two in a row and it puts them as the jumbotron shows here in the dome in the orange cell George was looking for Sadi White back door on the alley Got a push from the side Here we go Espanol Guzman and itll send him to the line Im not a fan of those type of fouls where you know hes open but dont push anyone in the back right there Thats how people get hurt Sadique White 0 for three from the line now He made the three earlier from the wing Hes been strong inside but the free throw line area is still giving issues to the Orange And he he has a good form He if you look at his rotation he has a little bit of the sid spin And I think thats his opposite hand thumb getting in the way but hes more than capable of knocking down free throws And he does so just there 13point lead for the Orange Just over nine minutes to play And they come out in the fullcourt pressure You love the smile from Sadi White face guarding Ruth I tell you what he he doesnt lack any passion or intensity out there on the floor You love that from a freshman Ruth comes off the screen Goes up with the left hand and he gets it to fall Tough bucket from Trenton Thats that Midwest Detroit Michigan Tough to the basket tough as nails Great drive right there getting downhill Finishing the lefty He might have learned that from you He might have been watching those Eric Dondorf highlights growing up in Michigan He You know what He probably doesnt know who the heck I am Im too old now laughter No No No chance DVO No chance JJ Stling had a tough drive to the basket through the foul and knocks down the first of two free throws Sean JJ is more than capable of being a 75 or more free throw shooter And you see when hes aggressive when hes getting downhill to the paint hes going to have multiple opportunities to get to the line He he could get to the line anywhere from 8 to 10 times a game if hes aggressive throughout Splits a pair there and Kyle comes away with it Now cheering we gets White gets another chance and puts it down Some offensive rebounding for Syracuse in this half DVO Well that should be every single possession If you got Sadique White and William Kyle under there you should get every single rebound Just a great job by the Cuse being aggressive off the free throw music William Kyle couldnt have finished the first one but Sadique White great job picking it up and finishing with that off hand More aggression more assertiveness from the Orange over the last couple of minutes White unable to get one to fall He loves that little right hand hook If you if you watch Syracuse basketball and Sadique White he loves that little offhand right hand hook Hackett kicks out to Ruth Great talk right there by White Syracuse forcing another long offensive possession Trenton Ruth with the fadeaway Cant get it to go Kyle had a hand on it but it goes out for Stonehill Ball Syracuse is a much better defensive team when theyre communicating and theyre talking Theyre letting each other know whats going on Hey left right I got you back Whatever it is just communicate It helps out the whole defense overall 14point lead for the Orange Ties their largest of the night Kofi from the corner Cant cut him to that White was fouled by Cory Lavell The New Zealand native will send White to the free throw line as the Orange are in the bunks laughter Cory Lavell New Zealand native You got some history in New Zealand DVO So I played in Wellington in New Zealand the Wellington Saints for four seasons Won a championship Unbelievable city Unbelievable country And I remember a young fell there He probably doesnt remember me but I dont know how old he was He had to be I dont know Sean Im aging myself Maybe eight years old But I I remember him in Wellington you know being a young prospect coming up So its awesome to see these guys come from overseas and then you know make a a college career over here in the States All roads lead back to Central New York And DVO I want you to give yourself some more credit man Youre a humble guy I think more of these folks from Michigan New Zealand any place where you have been I bet they know the name Eric Divendorf Well you know what If they catch me in the summer when Im in shape they can find out There we go There laughter we go Hes still got game Form is temporary but class is permanent Trenton Ruth from the win finds Kofi up top Hermmont Kofi still struggling just three for 12 from the field Nate Kings doing a great job defending it Stling got a hand on that one as Hackett will be at the line when we come back Convincing finish here to end nonconference play a convincing finish and and and weve seen Syracuse in in prior games get up 10 get up 15 but they werent able to really send that knockout blow You want to be able to try to do it in this game versus Stone Hill and hopefully get you some momentum going in to your game versus Clemson The Orange up 15 Stone Hill has played a few ACC opponents since moving to division one Miami and Boston College havent come away with a win yet Syracuse will be hoping that stays the same George off the feed from White drives in kicks to Starling The step back from the corner just off But Sadique Whites aggression will earn the Orange an extra possession But if youre Syracuse you like that possession because Nate George did a good job attacking the paint getting in there and he had two options He could have dropped it to White or he could have kicked it to JJ Stling JJ probably should have caught and shot it right away George off the curl Drawing attention underneath Goes up against Ruth and draws the foul Weve seen it time and time again from Nathan George So crafty getting to the rack And hes doing a great job of being in control when he gets to that spot Again if Im Syracuse you need some off the ball movement even if its just an exchange on the weak side to give Nate George some options But a good job by being patient being strong playing through the contact an opportunity to knock down these two free throws George extends the lead to 16 Rex Sunderland checks back into the game with those four fouls and hes joined by his fellow starter Raymond Espanol Guzma And Sean Syracuse wants and needs Nathan George to be aggressive because when he gets to the free throw line hes Syracuses best free throw shooter Hes going to knock him down The Orange hold a 17point lead with seven minutes to go Kofi controls it up top Under seven minutes to go now DVA whats the key for the Orange to extend this lead Just energy and effort right here You want to see the ball pressure You want to hedge out You want to communicate and you want to be able to limit Stonehill to one chance Kofi from the wing Nlock in that position They got back to the ball movement body movement and then they created an opportunity found an open shot and Kofi is one of the best shooters on the team Hes going to knock it down more than not Got to look for that high post short corner area against this zone Kings finds the short corner The turnaround is pure right on Q Nate Kings the trifecta And its great awareness by JJ Great job of Syracuse sending that baseline overload You cant have too many defenders right there Great job with the extra pass Nate Kings knocking it down Hackett comes off the handoff finds Kofi and Kings doing it on both ends Gets a hand on him A great defensive play right there by Kings Starling up and over Smooth as youd like from the Baldwinsville bucket 19point lead the biggest of the night for the Orange And itll prompt a timeout from Stonehill How about Nate Kings getting all the way from the paint to block the corner three and then start in transition This guy right here JJ Starland knows what to do with it Flying around being athletic showing their athleticism by blocking shots and altering shots They have to stay locked in on that end and just continue that play Under six minutes to go in this one The Orange have a chance to really push the pedal on this one George fast break here goes back to White Athletic move but cant finish But Kings there to clean up the mess And Chris Krauss calls a timeout right out of the break Unhappy with the effort from his team on both ends there Another look at the cleanup here from Nate Kings after a good defensive stop that George led the break for And this is Syracuse basketball playing with pace getting out in transition Sadique White has to finish it but great job by Nate Kings cleaning up and being there off the miss But when Syracuse is able to play with pace get out in transition ahead theres no reason for Syracuse that you wouldnt be really blowing them out in that stat right Just from being more athletic and being more active and having more effort and energy Stonehill had that in the first half Syracuse doing a good job of turning that around here in the second Kyle gets a hand on that one as Stonehill is having trouble getting anything going offensively now and just being active hands deflections bumping the cutters talking communicate You can see theyre more engaged Hackett uses the off arm and JJ Stling gets in position to draw the foul A rise smile there from Starling to Hackit I bet Hackett was thinking I dropped him there There was no push off there It was a great job by him recovering and getting back in front When you see the off arm right there you you cant extend fully But great job by JJ not giving up on the play and trying his best to get back in front Both Hackett and Sunderland with four fouls now Coach Krauss doesnt have many options left to turn to George to White cheering whos got reservations for the top floor And and if you were paying attention you you would miss it But Nate Kings great job looping around and setting that back screen right there on Sadique Whites guy JJ Scar throw it up for the dunk and White rejects Tudic underneath Getting it done at both ends And its funny you get a dunk on one end you just got a little bit more energy on the defensive side of the ball Great block right there by White Starling tough move Unable to get it to go Sunderland comes the other way Espenol Guzman sets the screen gets it back in the post Hes got the mismatch with George Good footwork underneath the head fake Drew the foul on White Squs third foul Hes been in foul trouble at times throughout the season Its really a testament to the energy and passion that he plays with and he just has to have a little bit more control We saw one of the games where he got the tech and I love the passion I love the intensity Sometimes you have to dial it back control those emotions Hey Sean trust me I was one of those guys I coach said Hey Debo dial it down a little bit I love that you have it but now you have to know how to control it as you go forward in your career So much promise so much passion shown by the freshman Hes in double digits tonight with 12 In these last few minutes the intensity the effort the energy has went to another level for the Syracuse basketball team And another level of energy for the fans as Stonehills two misses means free chicken Its ChickfilA The foul shot promotion Thats foul shot as Orange Nation will get some free chicken sandwiches tomorrow 23point lead for the Orange with under four left to play in this one Would be a quad 2 victory for the Orange So much talk about the quad one wins the quad 2 the opportunities for Syracuse to get to where they want to go this year to make the tournament Everythings still in front of them ACC play is where all of those opportunities reside Plenty plenty of opportunities to be able to get quad one win quad two wins and weve seen them compete at that level Houston Kansas Iowa State that was different but they can compete at that level and they can win those games And a guy that would help a long way with that is Donnie Freeman expected to be back for that Clemson game on New Years Eve and the Orange could use him 18 points and six rebounds Surely they could use him George drains the corner triple cheering He looked his eye in the man and said Hand down Mandow And just a huge difference these last two games in the games prior Hes not being hesitant Hes looking to be aggressive scoring the basketball and hes making more shots because of it Nathan George 22 points tonight to tie his season high that he set in the last game So 44 points in two games for George as the starters are running rampant now JJ Starling no hesitation cheering and he knocks one down Its like shooting threes can be contagious Well theyre playing with confidence You see theyre being active energy on the defensive side of the ball and usually that translates to the offensive side as well White gets the miss and the Orange not looking to slow down anytime soon and they shouldnt Starling puts him in the mixer George step back Another triple just off there Thats the heat check And Im not mad at that I watched him in pregame hit 23s in a row So he was ready for this game going in Guzman takes his first triple tonight That ones off And Kyle strong rebound White sets the screen for George And notice this Sean William Kyles not really having the type of game that he usually have But guess what JJ Starling and Nathan George are doing what they have to do from the guard position so that all evens out Once cheering this team can get all the guys clicking at the same time watch out I tell you what guard play is so crucial in basketball at any level If you have great guard play youre going to give yourself chance to win White reached around and drew the foul So good effort from Sadi to draw an extra possession for Syracuse It was good for Stonehill to get a lot of these guys in who probably wouldnt get any time normally but given an opportunity to step out on the dome floor touch that basketball field a little bit If Im if Im one of them Im getting a shot up laughter Im getting a shot up I dont I dont blame you Really special moment for some Stonehill players checking in Charlie Diamontis Eno Motin among the changes And theres a look at Sheffy diawir Hes a guy that coach Red wanted to try and get into tonights game Hes got surprising skill for a big man Orange Nation hasnt gotten too much of a chance to see it quite yet but dont be surprised if you see him step out and maybe take that corner three that Akir Sawari took earlier in the game Well he better not laughter I just think from that position you just want to be active You want to be able to move and he has all those attributes Diara the Mali native played professionally in Italy before making his way to the States Very appropriately the Italian club that he played for was called Orange One Visano Some things are just destined Some things are just meant to be And and Sean real quick just going back to George and Stling If theyre playing like this and you you tell me hey you have George you have Stling going to ACC play Im all good going into any it doesnt matter who Syracuse is playing Louisville Duke Im rolling with George and Stling If theyre playing this way Nate George led the ACC in assists per game last year JJ Stling coming into this year was named preseason second team all conference The expectations have been there for this back court and now over the last two theyre starting to show that that can be the reality for this team And these guys have the respect of their peers in the ACC Betsy finds Fenel Theres Diara up top Bryce Zephr goes back door to George up and under with the left Cant get it to go Back seat to Zephr The lefty to Cali Kid cheering makes Stonehill feel the breeze Its Bryce Zephr up with the right Come on coach Get a timeout Get my guy Noah in there Oh it looks like it might just be time cheering And the dome crowd goes to its feet Tyler Betsy crowds the miss Coach Audrey will call a timeout and hell grant your wish cheering Nice dome applause as Noah Lobell the hometown hero checks into the game We talked to him pregame Debo we said you get that opportunity what you gonna do with it Oh he said hes gonna put it up You just look its great to see these guys be able to get in and get some experience They work hard in practice Theyre doing the scout Theyre helping out these starters Awesome opportunity for Noah to be able to get in and get some playing time Lets see if he gets a touch Diara on the high post Backs down The smaller defender has it stripped Zephr goes up Loses it out of bounds Itll remain Syracuse ball 37 on the shot clock And heres the thing Sean These other guys who dont play a lot theyre trying to get some shots up as well Everybody wants to make the most their chance Finel finds Betsy He plays a lot Hes unable to get it to go Diamontis the Milford Connecticut native goes up top and takes an attempt And a foul is called on the three with Lell trying to contest Hey if you go get in the box score get in the box score by any means necessary Foul turnover bucket whatever it is youre in there now He is in there laughter No doubt about it Diamontis now has an opportunity to score his first points of the night Thats a great memory for Charlie Diamontes Hell have that two truths in a lie for the rest of his life no matter what he does I scored a point in the dome Make it two Im And I tell you what as I get older Im making up any story I want to make up about this Yeah I was in the dome and I I had a quick 12 laughter As time goes on you can uh kind of increase the lie I feel like they dont have that film anymore 77 to 48 Under 20 seconds left here now I think Coach Red wanted that 30point lead to stay intact This is what Syracuse fans have been asking for a dominant performance from their team First look at Noru Ja Dawara controls the miss and Finel will hold off the charge Final score in this one Syracuse 77 Stonehill 48 Steo did you like what you saw from the orange and
