Music from the home of the wolf pack part of that is you you have to adjust to your personnel cuz you dont really know who your personnel is at midrange it breaks down your defensive principles which are run people off the threepoint more minutes per game than anybody in the league for a wing team coming off its second quad one win of the year a very impressive 11point win at SMU Saturday they have been off since then NC State meanwhile needs at least two wins just to make it to the ACC tournament d you can start with the ball and they start with an offensive foul called by Ted Valentine against Fon Reed and your laughing 16 seconds in Im laughing because theyre both just going like body to body I mean how is that on either one of them its just funny to start thats how you start a game and if youre have to read and youre wake for say come on man not an early foul NC State starters an open three Miss by dodre Styles and the putback is there for Paul mcneel Jr on the first play of his first career start what a shot out of a can for the Freshman heres the weight starting five Spillers the big with three leaves it short Johnson cam hild back in there after missing Saturday with a foot contusion he scored 20 in his last four and Salis Jaden Taylor Ben Middlebrooks Michael oon three returners from the final four Miracle run a season ago with Styles in the aention mcneel had 14 points in 14 minutes against UNC and he is red hot are you kidding me first career start hes averaging 29 a game and he has five and two possessions thats actually great and you got to feel good for a kid getting the the first career start as you mentioned but getting out there and playing with great energy I mean thats ultimately what youre looking for for Kevin ke someone who can start hot and then keep the energy High throughout Marcus Hill their leading score is on the bench for only the second time to start Reed with a brick rebound to Styles NC State 3 and 12 in the league they started 22 theyve gotone 1 10 in the last 11 okado WPS it into middle Brooks he was open oconnell for three thats too strong and mcneel at the offensive rebound oconnell hits this time timeout week first I guess they didnt have Paul m Neil at the top of the Scouting Report Im not really sure he was on The Scouting Report much at all you mentioned two plus points a game but its energy that you need the kid came out hot came out on fire and its not just making shots its getting offensive rebounds Second Chance opportunities get it while youre hot Good Start NC State Music Music Music we got part of the student section behind us theyre literally St in and chanting Paul mcneels name freshman at a Rockingham North Carolina first start of his career put back layup threepointer offensive rebound and assist the first three possessions of his college career as a starter and its 8 nothing NC State out of the weight timeout hildred bounces inside for look whos got the steal of course since mcneel off a deflection Middlebrooks that pass knocked away a rare NC State turnover for the team that turns it over the ninth least of anybody in the country just 92 a game and fensive foul that is two on read in two and half minutes this is just a waking nightmare right now for Steve forbs and I go back to that first foul you almost forget you got it at happen so soon and you just go back to play and not realizing that if you do one silly thing like a a moving screen youre going to be on the bench probably for the rest of the half and now Omaha Baloo whos played very sparingly to the injury this year is in McNeil no way he had to miss at some point why no way no way because this has been an impossible enough start heres Belo good defense by Ben Middlebrooks boy NC state has just been sming to start this game I think wakes been a little obvious about where theyre going pushing the ball ins side theres really nothing happening off the ball and that that allows the defense just to focus on the basketball heres styles for three NC State against the best threepoint defense in the ACC has started three for six 11 to nothing wol pack Ls chasing the play a little bit chasing the basketball and then once you pass out of it you get what you want Salis meanwhile he may have gotten away with a pushup there given the offensive fouls weve seen he does get fouled by Taylor and here is Kevin Keats who is now the third longest tenured ACC coach and will be second shortly with the impending resignation of Leonard Hamilton at Florida State final four a year ago he really loves these players they have not found that connectedness yet maybe they are finding it today it wouldnt be the first time NC State found some lak season matches look there are a lot of teams throughout the course of college basketballs history that have had a nice run like I I was around with Northwestern made their first NCA tournament the following year they fell apart right you you almost become a victim of your own success and I and I hate using cliches but sometimes they just work I think thats one of the things you you feel great about what you did and you forgot about what allowed you to get there connectedness is the right term continuity is what you want to seal on the floor but you have to have that social connectedness as a team to really maximize the potential of your group oconnell starting point guard on that team middle Brooks is fouled on the post entry ran oconnell Jamal Spearman along with Ted Valentine our officials and thats the first foul on Cameron hildr today so there is Steve Forbes who was trying to get Wake Forest to the tournament hes been Oho close a couple of times hes right on the edge again this year his teams won six Road games in the ACC thats tied for the most Road wins in the AC CC in W firstest history go back to 9697 Styles open for three he had another one in and out but but those were all good looks good misses in Rhythm shots they theyre getting what they want on the offensive end and defensively theyve been great see States got Trey Parker and Marcus Hilla in the game McNeil and Taylor to the bench after the great start for the Freshman mcneel beloo jumper goes for the Iowa State transfer very skilled player alahao I thought that was good defense by Middlebrook staying with Silas who wants to get to that midrange game right in the middle of the paint brings defense your way and Sal made the right play in passing it off OKO never turns it over does here knocked off of Middlebrooks by Spillers so a little bit of energy for Wig first for their second Quadrant One victory of the year that is one of the evaluation tools that the committee uses it is so tough because a lot of your nonconference quad ones are going to come in November you dont even know who you are how you want to play and then you got to figure it out in conference play the problem is in the ACC is not a lot of quad one opportunities inside Spillers couldnt finish rebound grabbed by Brandon Huntley Hatfield Off the Bench quad one for a road game thats beating a team in the top 75 of the net theres a turnover blo and he has it poked away from behind by Applause Hill Trey Parker freshman the transfer from Bowling Green Hill kicks it Styles leaves it short and then Hill flies in for a onehanded rebound VY state has taken eight of it nine shots from three and again this is not what they do they are the most surehanded team in the ACC this is going to drive Kevin Keats nuts four turnovers in the first 520 the frustrating thing is when you go to the bench and guys come in and turn it over youre not asking for much youre just asking for guys to move the basketball and find the game first right find the game before you start moving it too much theres Spillers on the feed from Hil trayon Spillers averaging 10 and eight with his first two you get what I mean by find the game right game has a certain the way you move the basketball the defense rotates find the game first thats going the other way be their fifth turnover an offensive foul I think wake has the ability to do this this is just simple execution right screen I mean nobody gets caught up that one takes the roll away thats just a simple roll off of a kind of a handoff situation oconnell was calling for the offensive foul there Michael oconnell who had only 24 turnovers in the first 26 games already has two Juke Harris the freshman in the game feeds the Poston Spillers against Huntley Hatfield way too strong and then Hill couldnt grab the rebound really bad shots are hard to rebound right they dont come off normally they come off really strong and and bounce far air balls usually go the way the the offense gets that hard off the glass good luck Coral in that thing hildr drive it at Hill Cameron hildr the senior from England and after an 11 nothing ATC State start wake has eight in a row eight in a row but outside of the slip for an easy dunk they theyve been tough I mean that shot from cam hild I mean he really had to work to get that off its tough made basket oconnell drives it and just got it over the onrushing Spillers and then Salis was fouled so wake farest with the nice little burst here the ball an 80 run big big triple header today starts at four Eastern with Georgia visiting number one Auburn that is Sonic Blockbuster in Tuscaloosa Kentucky and Alabama followed by Missouri Arkansas three great SEC games all on ESPN all on the ESPN app I think Missouri might be one of my favorite teams to watch too like theyre just fun its like they dont give a rip if it goes in or not theyre still going to commit to playing the way they want to play and they force you into their game Spillers inside got blocked with foul and Missouri makes a tournament two years ago in Dennis Gates first year then goes 0 and 18 in the League last year wild but they are super deep tons of great Shooters including Caleb Grill tons of great ball movers they are an exciting team and they get a little overshadow by the top of the SEC but a very very dangerous team and if you havent seen better that way check them out tonight Missouri Arkansas Razer backs you need a win there right on the bubble to good promo support Kev youre going to make a newsletter or something theres not much you need to say to support other than its an SCC game in 2025 Ill do what I can first try to be try to be I think theres something to that though right teams that really establish an identity and commit to it Missouris done that for better force and way Alabamas done that right they miss or make theyre still going to seek out three opportunities play fast just shoot with confidence and fearlessness I love that thats fun to watch and I think if youre a good watch youre the type of team that could go far you could beat anybody Dennis Parker who was barely on the floor picked up those last two fouls mcneels back in there Hill lefthanded player spinning to the right and that snaps the ten0 Wake farest run yeah that came off his right hand like hes a lefthander mhm wasnt hard to tell is what youre saying heres Harris for three made it despite an absolutely wild contest by JRE Styles waving his arms in the air and from down 11 week has tied it like that well theyve tied it up because theyve just operated a little bit better in the half court and theyve adjusted to that November they wanted to play faster in December they thought maybe we need to scale it back a little bit by this point in the season they figure out that they need to operate as a half court team just take care of the basketball he got caught in the air Taylor off the shot fake inside Huntley Hatfield hyfield been a tough year for the Louisville Transfer they can get him going down the stretch it could really open up this team 15 13 8 minutes gone by wake far its the last team in Joel Lenards projected field on this February 22nd Salis draws a contact fouls against Taylor thats is second so wake far is starting to draw some fouls here they were down 11 zip theyre back within two another one of these half to have games for week NC State just trying to get back in the mix to get to Charlotte big one here in Raleigh State basketball Applause despite a slow stretch of a Zubin Oregon putting itself in great position one of 10 big 10 teams Jars projected bracket ACC is at four right now with wake the last team in the field they would certainly drop out if they lost this game as Hunter Salis goes one for two can I just point out that its just weird looking at that not seeing a pack 10 or Pack 12 yep its still weird and then you said orgon Big T its still still weird its still really strange that tie up blue on the shot by McNeil I dont think it will ever stop being stranged although well have the Pack something back in a couple years I dont know what number will from the East Coast well there is a pack returning we dont know theres going to be East Coast teams in there but hey who knows anythings possible Styles inside hes got five NC State leading it by three NC state has to continue to play not Carefree but just fearless and just attack try to take care of the basketball they do that well Theo from Salis and then Harris off the cut nice start for the Freshman who 17 against eight the first time these teams met depending what lineup you have on the floor you you may be able to extend but if you have bad communicators on the floor defensively and you get extended youre going to give up layups and duns just like that like Faris Hedges the ball screen as for told us they love to do every time to a guard make uncomfortable thank you so much siles long two just a couple of those that were halfway down Salis get to take a shot from the field hes gotten to the line twice theres his first attempt and its left Applause short NC State shooting 50 to the field theyve turned it over five times Hill another one in and out give good looks though I say it all the time pable Miss like you can build on those and good misses allow you to set up your defense once again H trying to take hill hill going chest to chest ild leaves it short its just too obvious what theyre doing in certain situations you know exactly where theyre going to try to score kind of line up your your defense to rebound I I want to say its tough defending by state but its a little predictable right now for w first thats the point its obvious like it its we know exactly where theyre going I think Salis needs to be more involved offensively cant just be feed the post and stand around B boy what a lift hes given them Omaha Belo Four Points he had just two in the last three games combined and Wake Forest has its first lead just like there clappable misses theres F gold fools gold makes and thats not going to win you a basketball game youve got to move it create a little rhythm on the offense belugas called for a travel on the rebound but couple of early baskets for the Iowa State transfer its kind of I thats all good stuff I mean thats where everybody gets involved the last possession it was just kind of standing around if you notice like our cameras on two guys thats really the only two that were moving the good ball movement is something you can build upon you create a rhythm with your ball and body movement right and then you establish the way youre going to be able to operate on the offensive end okono no good for three was tip by Parker Frederickson back to Brion pass Deep Off the Bench for NC State five straight misses for the pack Styles their second leading scorer Hill their leading scorer a rare three its not close and its grabbed by oconnell ell air ball goes the way the offense once again Michael O connells got five now Harris trying to back downhill and he scores over the top I just dont think youre going to win the game that way I just you might be able to win The Possession but but I have a tough time thinking you win the game that way oconnell gets a step sets up pass for three no good I might win the game if NC St cant score I just think Hunter Salis getting involved getting some ball screen action get get the ball and body moving Salis has one Feld goal attempt four free throws and he wont get any on this possession sixth wake farest turnover Salis does such a good job of getting Defenders on his back in a ball screen where if you hedge so what hes patient he gets the other defender on his back once you vacate as a big he gets himself into the plate where that midrange game is really tough to stop wak seven for it last 11 NC State which led 11 nothing has gone a little cold but thatll help nice drive by Styles inside Harris and seven for the Georgetown transfer began his career at North Carolina 2120 NC State back in front wellpack need at least two more wins to make the ACC tournament top 15 of the 18 teams will get to Charlotte Sal is hunting for a shot now and he miss its one of the tough things if you dont get good looks you tend to start forcing them you dont want to see that happen okado Middlebrook stra fight that was nice that pass is there because okell showed the ball high you show the ball high the defense just instinctually lifts youre able to make that bounce pass through to Middle Brooks billers a cutting frickson look at this Parker Frederickson who almost never shoots from inside the arc with a two two really good offensive possessions for both teams oh Lord and then that not great when the ball ends up with your head coach six turnovers a piece and C States got a slim lead look this is good stuff watch show the ball high show high there it is great pass good action and right on the backside right we can do the same thing good read good cut easy finish we got a ball Music game that is correct name is Music Andre Applause is up to 17 and a half a game shooting more Carolina looking more and more polished as this uh last weeks gone along RJ Davis with the ball in his hands more maybe less with Elliot Kau with the ball in his hands I its always felt early on when you have a guy youre playing a small lineup and you have a guy that struggles to shoot it youre playing Five on four half the time four on five half the time thats tough Carolina has started to figure out how to work with a smaller lineup cam HRI with a muscular drive and finish swake Forest is back in the lead Hunter Salis 0 for two from the field Fon Reed is just come back he had two early fouls played two and A2 minutes and yet wake is still in front hell double Middlebrooks and Spillers knocks it away so these guys get doubled and theyre they know its coming but they still turn away and try to get rid of it too quickly if you welcome the double and pass out of it you give your team an advantage by welcoming two guys to come your way pass into middle Brooks couldnt finish but a foul thatll go against Salis is first another big ACC game following us over on the ACC Network SMU in the first four out according to Joe lardy they are still without a quad one win theyve got a great chance to take down a quad one opponent in Clemson ranked 18 and then Virginia Tech Miami after that ACC Network and streaming live on the ESPN app I felt like SMU was and you know I got to call a bunch of SMU games over the last few years when they were in the American but I feel like theyre a good ACC team like just something about the institution the potential in both football and basketball its there I think thats a program youre going to see get into National relevance over the next few years well weve seen the former already winning the ACC football regular season championship and again a lot of good metrics no bad loss I dont a quad one win they could get one today they put themselves in a great position heres Spillers for three rebound to Hill they also have competitive finances yes they do yes they do well located for that sort of thing Styles off the front of the ribbon good NC state has done well operating in the half court but when theyre deliberate and attack quickly before the defense gets set they get good look Missi or mate doesnt really matter the the goal of offense is to get good high quality shots H Tyler Johnson who does not have a statistic in 10 minutes hes got a 10 trillion right now theres a foul away from the ball its on pass his first well this was good stuff because it was deliberate right he just you get a defense hugged up on theres a theres a spot in the paint and a driving lane you can attack worst case scenario someone picks you up and you move the basketball best case scenario you get a oneonone situation and you score Johnson hris for three thats off line n of these teams are great threepoint shooting teams on the year wake is one for four today NC State three for 11 Styles make it four for 12 Dantes with a doit and NC State with a little seven nothing spurt yeah kind of a secondary quick hitter not really a fast break point but they flow right into it the ball moves a couple times to get a good look take it those quick hitters have been good for NC State hildr switched on to Middle Brooks Hill comes over to double hilds in trouble tried to throw it off Hill the ball stays in bounds a cutting read somehow Powers it through despite the foul draw up that play for me right like coaches work so hard to figure out how to help your guys score this thing was just broken from the start hris kind of banging down low throws it off the defender gets it back and Fon Reed Cuts gets half block lays it in and fouled its just way the game is you could you could spend hours every week scouting and preparing your team and and then you go play the game plan didnt exactly work his plan but it worked threepoint play for the 7 foot senior epon Reed I would also argue that broken plays are the hardest to defend because that its just scramble ball right relying on communication football same thing happens a lot W throws a little zone out here which was very very effective against SMU got a ball fake zones like its the simple fundamental things like the simple ball fakes will open up a driving lane you drive against the Zone it breaks down the Zones principles they have the tough decision to saying whos going to stop the ball do we stop it before it gets in the paint or do we stop it when it gets to the rim quite often times two guys go to the basketball and now the defense is chasing the play use ball fakes to be able to get where you want against the Zone dont just move it too quickly de ke gets Paul mcneel back in another shooter against this Zone Styles well they had an open look in the corner but oconnell commits a rare third turnover for him he thought it was deflected Ted Valentine did not hes been pointing to the right side of the Court tic the last 25 seconds does Ted Valentine do anything not emphatically oh you he comes over here and gets his water bottle with intensity Johnson on the drive his first shot of the game is good theres your statistic There It Is by the way I was fine with him not having a statistic because no turnovers moving the game moving the ball its all good good start pass for Middlebrooks mconnell pass mcneel Styles whos got 12 in Middle heres Paul mcneel to deep on the three batted up in the air and saved by Styles Johnson scrambling at the point in that zone they leave Styles off a fake he misses another Middlebrooks Second Chance opportunity left short and then just a collision between mcneel and milbrooks in the ball and a calamitous ending to an otherwise intriguing possession NC State by Music Applause one guys top 10 teams bubble teams everywhere you look we got one of those here Wake Forest last team in the projected field right now down one despite trailing by 11 out of the gate and theyve had eight players take the floor all eight have scored Hunter Salis their leading score is 0 for two he scored just three from the line theyre led by juk Harris with seven meanwhile Hill and Taylor NC States leading two scorers on the year have combined for two Marcus Hill came off the bench for just the second time and Jaden Taylor 6 minutes no shots and hes missed much of the half with two fouls Brion pass with his second foul and a free throw left short by Cam hildr that foul is one that thats a great teaching moment because mcneel was covering hildr on the ball and he forced a tough drive it wasnt going to be an easy shot not a higher percentage shot but pass on the Dig Down rips at the arms and gives them an opportunity at the free throw line now you got to know situations they can make a t shot theres a nice soft spot in the zone McNeils got seven I say the best defense is not stopping every shot from occurring its forcing the toughest shots are the ones that you want them to take Johnson and the Trayvon Spillers hildr 83 free throw shooter just missed two and he finds Spillers who just rushed it Applause they got an easy one there but the fact that Hunter Salis is not touching the ball I would have issues middle Brooks somehow got out of it a three for Styles 15 and seven all in a halfs Applause work Tyler Johnson left it short Reed that tangled up with Middlebrooks itll be Ben Middlebrooks second foul one and one coming for epon Reed I like when they were able to kind of get this thing out of the double and then you Skip its going to lead to a long close out but hild knows not a lot of help behind him so hes sagging a bit Styles has had a great start we are getting a review now for potential hook and hold looks like middle Brooks got tangled elbow to Elbow with Reed thats what the officials are going to discuss we just call it a foul well its been called a foul I know but Im just saying like who wants to announce the left previous play is under review Ted Valentine will r o Connell to his right I understand there are certain things we want to get out of the game but like these dudes are just battling man like yeah theres a foul that wasnt called then then theres this one yeah does he pull him down probably just battl him just a shove Factory down there its just a fullon its a fullon fight underneath you could have called five f I get it look these guys are asked to call things as the rule book says they are but it takes gives gives no real I dont know puts no emphasis on the fact that things happen in the moment that are just going to be physical battles hate to see flavorant one in this situation but wouldnt Music surprise well this is the the hook and hole which has been in the game for quite a few years now is after the review at the 151 Mark we are up in the foul to a flagrant one hook and hole I mean that certainly fits a definition no it does it Applause does so middle Brooks picks up the foul its a second and it becomes a flag grou so thatll be free throws for Ricky you know has to come over here and tell us and then just get yelled at by everybody behind us ran drew the Short Straw there like T Valentines explaining it to Kevin Keats right there I get it as its written I just dont think the game is played in the black and white I I think the the game is played in the nuanced gray area and you cant just look at a rule and say does it qualify under the the words that we have written under that rule I dont know I also stoppages in the game well the Chan is balone lie behind us and Reed goes one for two so ball partly lies and Wake Forest will have possession down five a minute 51 to go Ws got to get Hunter Salis involved just involved in the action does he need to involve himself more is he being too passive to a degree but everything needs to flow through him its flowing through everybody else a ball screen situation let him operate a little bit things happen out of a double he feeds Harris Juke Harriss first Miss after three for three start Styles been a great half for him inside Hill got it to go saying go back to those quick hitters for NC State Defense isnt set thats where theyre having their most success NC State by seven heres s cut off by The Freshman mcneel there has been a lot of good individual defending and heres some more oh it was for a moment then Hill toppled over the legs of eldr thats got to be a foul and it is I think I didnt hear the whistle from Ted Valentine but I saw I saw the arm in the air so heres the thing though kind of like a half dive for the ball I think hildr did a good job of walking into this Applause one its a little veteran Savvy it is Applause I dont know if he blew the whistle because not only did I not here mcneel and Hill who were standing right next to him or on the floor next to him were both Applause celebrating so Hill who just missed two will go back to the line six in the ACC in free throw percentage see awake hanging in this game partly at the line NC state has only attempted two free thrs I should say too I probably havent pointed out enough that NC States coverage on the ball has been good y when Hunter Salis has had the ball and had has had the opportunities to make plays theyve been right up on them chest to chest making everything tough making him pass the ball back out but if youre a high level player like Salis is you got to figure out how to get the ball move it and get it back youre too important not to be involved with six Salis at the front of his 131 zone now under a minute first half NC States LED nearly the whole way after the first time these teams met weight LED nearly the whole first half off the deflection okon three to shoot Styles fake okon desperation three is rebounded by Balo kept that pivot foot just glued enough to the ground hildred driving shot fake on the Freshman ishmail dofu just checked off the bench and a pure finish and if W can get to the half down just three theyll feel a lot better about themselves game they Trail by 11 early and seven recently if you can get to the half down three with Hunter Sal only having three points and limited attempts from the field you do it all right especially considering the hot start from NC State oconnell back for hill almost never shoots from three and he hits it just his eighth of the Year boy what an unusual book end in the halves Marcus Hill takes 88 Salis involved and try to slow down the attack offensively of NC State whos seem to have it rolling and if youre looking at those numbers you think I he probably had foul trouble he played every minute every second of the first half it took just two field goal attempts four free throws so the good news for week despite that theyre only down six C HRI through at eight and lead the way big jump stop in the lane whoa Slams on the brakes and rolls it home and he leads away with 10 its like at Camp over the summer when youre teaching a first grader how to do a jump stop you you exaggerate everything to teach thats exactly what he did but it was well done Michael oconnell will be called for a travel so his fourth turnover that never happens maybe if he just came to this kind of jump Music stop covered a lot of ground looks like a Euro Step its like a full multicontinent step a Eurasia step come on come on what youre proud of yourself for that Im proud of myself Im just trying to get the folks at home a more appropriate visual than eurostep we say eurostep all the time that was more than a Euro Step Jaden Taylor just picked up his third your agep oh man help this only 1913 to go so here is Salis out for Reed who picked up two early fouls and was limited in that half W far has got a lot of scoring off its bench they typically dont get many minutes off the bench theres Salis love it he got it back Kevin thats thing he tried to make something happen he didnt have it he gave it up he got it back you vacate that corner its an ISO situation really easy to get the midrange game going in an ISO situation to State the ab obvious this feels like a dangerous couple of moments here for NC State but crowd energy still not back in after halftime Sixpoint lead down to two and Paul mcneel has been making things happen tonight draws a foul first career start for the Freshman thats Sals second foul and mcneel will shoot two some guys do well because theyre purposeful in their aggression right they theyre purposeful about creating an opportunity and its not just a score its just create an opportunity draw defense get get to an area where the defense has to rotate like the paint McNeils been confident and aggressive throughout I think thats great when you get a start you come out here and play Fearless basketball and this this is a kid who scored 71 in a high school game which broke a North Carolina record that had stood since 1950 averaged 32 a game at Richmonds Senior High he was ranked 46th overall in this recruiting class his minutes have just been very spotty just six minutes a game but Kevin Keats looking for an answer after Paul mcil played really well largely in noncompetitive situations but still against North Carolina 14 and 14 he deserved a chance and hes made the most of it it matters and it doesnt whether its a important situation or not sometimes you just got to get a feel for how to play the game Reed trying to find a c Spillers and eventually did off the deflection middle Brooks and oconnell race back in the position whats your high school career high uh same as it was every game yeah that was very consistent read for three round it out and theres Salis on the offensive glass did you get 71 in a game pit no had 62 62 I blew it what was your brother Joes high school high okay but he had to play with me look at this that is all but down thats like 75 down that only seems to be happening on this Rim Yeah right again up to short rebound Styles whos got 15 and nine struggle with that being your best offense kind of bully ball down low with a perceivably smaller guard it doesnt create Rhythm it doesnt get any sort of movement doesnt allow you to feel what the defense is doing McNeil contested two and Paul mcneils into double figures for the second straight game the point I make is look hes clearly a scorer you dont score 70 plus points in a game I dont care who youre playing against unless you can put the ball in the basket but youve got to learn how to be effective at this level sometimes it takes time when when you got length and you can create just enough space I mean this is really good stuff deals with the physicality gets the space he needs elevates hes got a nice game again you just have to learn how to level up to the major division one level its a a different Applause game Salis hits the first of two 79 free throw shooter so thats three on middle Brooks he and Taylor each playing with three early in the half and Salis sticks them both under Salis looking to get in double figures for what would be his 16th consecutive game he scored 20 or more 10 of the last 15 a lot of time left for him to heat up Dallas needs to be the first third and fifth option and that means if you dont have it it comes back to him in some way shape or form Styles misses a rainbow mcneels in there for the offensive rebound and its a drive for Taylor a hand off for Middle Brooks hes fouled tonight on ABC and ESPN plus our NBA Saturday Prime Time game LeBron James Luka doic and the Lakers against the great Nia yic 37 to 19 Nuggets NBA cown starts at allay Eastern and the game to follow a half hour later whos the best all round player on the floor in that game wow its got to be yic Im going yic 100 no question now LeBron is coming off a 40 40 at 40 and win against the Blazers that is that is remark I think n goic is the best all around player still in the league fair to say people are bored of him cuz he won backto back MVPs he could probably WI like needs to be somebody else why guys incredible just watch 5 minutes in Nicole y play basketball and tell me youre not in love with that absolutely manipulates the game I love it lead back to 64 NC State Johnsons in a very quiet game Bob into Reed quick touch Captain Reed with six it was a good simple find from Tyler Johnson who earlier this season Steve Forbes didnt think he could play him that much cuz he just couldnt take care of the basketball he tried to make the spectacular play all the time the simple Ones best Taylor steps into a three a rounded out Applause again heres hildr sensing a weakness in the defense maybe didnt exactly find what he was looking for thats going to stay with weight according to jiml Spearman Brandon Huntley Hadfield Marcus Hiller going to check back in and Middlebrooks and Taylor the two men with three fouls well get a breathing NC State started the game pretty hot and then the second group came in and lost it and right off the bat you come into the game if you dont communicate youre going to get beat right I always look at the next group that comes in are you paying attention on the bench are you in the game while youre on the bench if not youre going to give that up yeah why dont open look for Salis whos got six here in the opening four minutes of the half and in an out of bounds underneath if you give up an easy look its not good offense its bad defense I care what anybody says McNeil wants to shoot it again bobbs away I dont think hell just get six minutes a game the rest of the year no 14 points hes tied a season High which he set about 72 hours ago hildr fouled on a wild drive you will always remember this NC State fans as the day you were truly introduced to Paul mcneel Jr hes just hes got it in the bag right now and hes playing with a conviction that that you need if youre NC State you need that confidence LSU Kentucky to follow there here from Z James NC States leading scorer live on game day tomorrow tremendous day of womens college troops could be a very consequential weekend for the basketball programs here in Raleigh NC State which is the mens side is trying to make it to the ACC tournament top 15 teams make it its now an 18 Team league theyre two wins back they one back of Syracuse in the Lost colum they do go to the Dome Wednesday so win this game they be in position to get back into the top 15 Wednesday Styles tripped up no foul or Connell hes got five assists but shockingly four turnovers with the ball and hes double team by the hedging Reed finds an outl no good on the three for D Styles had a big game a lot of his misses have looked good though its either been in or halfway down seemingly seven of 21 from three wake far is has hit just one threepointer for 346th in the country shooting 29 from Deep Johnson behind his back for Reed little floater its a onepoint game tell you if Tyler Johnson could make the simple play like that he could be so effective and the more he does that the more youre going to get open look threes ell got it back and got stripped but theres a foul this is good stuff I mean just win your back right theres the open spot attack the Gap draw two great dump down and not an easy finish by the way just cuz no ones covering you doesnt mean thats an easy make little runner from 10 ft from your sevenfooter so Johnson now three assists no turnovers in 21 minutes and you were all critical earlier you were dogging him saying he hasnt recorded a statistic I took the glasses half full side of that equation and said well you your turnovers that thats a guy thats growing up a little bit and finding patience within the game I know youre over here saying have to wear his stats I simply said hes played 10 minutes without a statistic and I I would say its actually you interpreted that incorrectly I would actually say thats good because hes showing Poise at a time when you you look back earlier the season he couldnt play because of the lack of poise and now hes actually being patient learning how to play and figuring out the way the games going to be played finding a rhythm still think Hunter Salis needs to be heavily involved maybe moving more without the basketball not just hovering around the half court area hes been in Hover mode most of this possession tend to shoot it inside to re from hildr one dribble and couldnt score with Hunley Hatfield on his back styles from oconnell steps inside Salis knocked it away Salis gets on the floor and saves it down the floor hildr from Harris Spillers theres a foul somewhere its Huntley Hatfield NC States fourth of the half I also think wakes had a tough time creating something off the bouts because they really look to go inside they have the obvious Advantage down low but but sometimes you actually disrupt your own Rhythm by putting someone on the Block and taking driving Lanes away Hunter Salis really hasnt had anywhere to go into the block again Reed pushed by Hunley Hatfield who picks up backto back fouls his first two and Reed can tie it at the line I want to tell Defenders if youre not going to play your defense early and win the position battle just force a tough shot Im okay with Fon Reed going right shoulder left hook from about 8 to 10 ft just wall up and get ready to rebound 70 foul shooter Reed has averaged better than 10 and eight in the last six he had 19 points shot eight for nine and to win a cal two weeks agoy Hatfield takes a seat middle Brooks replaces him I had last time I had wake was against Duke at wake and Eon Reed worked and he really worked had to cover a variety of positions had to be a communicator they fought back in the second half and I thought he was a big piece of that five of the last seven hes played 37 minutes or more 7t 250 yeah and Steve Forbes told us we can hedge ball screens now because I believe in EP Reeds ability to hedge a ball screen Parker up three for Dennis Parker Jr only his seventh of the Year and that weight nearly throws it away down the floor and in fact they end up throwing it away away I think thought was off of Parker I think he was right I dont think there was any question there lets see if Jamal Spearman has a reversal his call Ted Valentines talking to him and they will reverse the call good good job and the good thing is there like Ted Valentine came in and pointed but they communicated and said what did you see that thats the right way to do it Applause its okay to be wrong right well if somebody says youre wrong and you believe them change the call no problem with that Harris throw it away Parker no was in and out got it back and hes fouled Dennis Parker Jr theyre only sophomore with a couple of active possessions he cant believe he missed the first one but he will shoot two just if if were playing the energy game which you know it sort of matters I think it matters pretty significantly NC States winning the energy battle you see their benches getting up theyre getting excited for one another Parker just keeping it alive playing again good energy High motor keep it rolling that was that was that was like one of the worst misses theres one way to like you know you kind of hit the back of the rim when you hit the bottom front of the rim right now lets see if hes going to adjust just to the back of the rim or not look at him thats a good team there he goes all right have a look better oh man when your own teammates are cheesing over it they made that sound Applause too thats all Applause right give you love for the second one alls well that ends sort of well tell NC State just keep your energy High communicate talk be loud H almost took it away s down the Applause lane what a tactical foul what do you want him to do fall his back hes in the double figures hes got 11 eight of those since the break Marcus Hill looking to stop that a lot of dribbling and and a foul against hildr Lake forests fifth hilds second thats where you got to be careful if youre NC State look you got a unique lineup on the floor right now your primary scores are not in youre trying to get to this under 12 dont turn it over and dont put yourself in a bad spot Trey Parker Dennis Parker Jr Taylor Middle Brooks Hill heres Parker junr for three and the foul will go against Harris honor Salis right broken play hes got a really quiet a really quiet 11 I think the steals going the other way and Hunter Sal gets all the way to the rim no one stops the ball that was a proper swing right I dont think theres any technical foul good to get Hunter Salis going and got to involve him in the offense more Music Applause W all right guys 1151 to go here in this second half a twopoint lead for NC State Trot Spillers just got called for a foul and Wake Forest has committed seven actually its going to be against Reed his third beg your pardon so three on Reed go the two very early Steve Forbes with a baby trying not to distract him behind him safe to say its been a weird game its just its been hard to find what the rhythm is of this game I think that actually favors NC State whos the team thats been able to kind of put little runs together Salis eight of his 11 in the second a half inside Hill easily blocked by middle Brooks wait Forest to hit just one and attempted just four threes I just think if your NC State with this lineup on the floor youve got to figure out where the offense is going to come from H going another easy basket offen under the basket play Kevin Kats frustratedly walking to the middle of the bench wake is tied it again at 54 have your back to the ball there needs to be crazy ball pressure with someone really tall on the basketball to negate that pass concerned for this group offensively Jaden Taylor got it first points me they worry about a a game like this freny state and their fans have seen it time and again this year they have competed so hard theyve had the lead in most ACC games in the second half and they have just had trouble executing in the final 10 final five minutes of games Spiller is with a three Wake Forest is back in front just their second three of the game ears we talking about second half lead in 13 of 16 ACC games and nine of their 12 losses Hill long two Clank so NC state has been competitive almost every game but theyve lost so many close games HRI into Spillers this the first time today wake has led by by more than a point think again I go back to I just think its a tough lineup its a very small lineup for NC State theyre just getting fully Down Low Bottom three teams missed the ACC tournament over on acc Network right now as NC State turns it over BC is up a dozen on Georgia Tech at the under in that be their fourth win NC Saints going to need at least five wins maybe six theyre on the road three of their next four though its not a daunting stretch at Syracuse at Georgia Tech pit and then at Miami but theyve got to win this game they cannot go into that stretch two WIS behind 15th Place and feel good about their chances they led by 11 and now down by three as Reed misses the little hook that was good defense I dont want to say allow the shot but allow a tough shot to go up and be position to get the rebound well Connell and mcneel have return to the game with Taylor Middlebrooks and Dennis Parker junor just picked up his third Taylor driving no Spillers was in there to defend with Salis and heres a pull up three and its no good W far still just two for six as Salis Miss fir just feel like Salis takes that shot cuz hes just not as involved offensively you feel like you have to man facture your shot opportunities Parker turns it down he wont turn this down swirl it out and then mcne just over playing there as Harris draws the foul seventh on NC State one and one coming for Juke Harris its good youre getting Styles back into the game if if its for the last 9 minutes if youre Kevin Keats you need your best players on the floor like I think thats kind of led to some inconsistency and I saw that in prep right youre watching there certain groups that you go I see it but theres a significant drop off when you bring two or three guys in Off the Bench thats a problem I think the Energys been good that the bench has been good in terms of their positivity but on the floor its a different game Harris misses the front end of the 101 see if this group can score it a little bit better thats what weve seen throughout the course of this game when they score they get their defense set theyve been good wake hasnt had three opportunities theyve really had to operate to get good looks here Styles was not scored in the second half he had 15 and eight in the first half points and rebounds hes got zero and one here in the second one to shoot it mcneel and then Salis fouled by styles again bad position by Styles smart play by Salis leading into it he knew what he was doing he gets a one andone its a smart play but it can also be annoying right like its its definitely a smart play a little stop and barely bumped I mean I think he sold it a bit its both smart and annoying at the same time Nuance like that those can be true the game exists in the grade his life exists in the grade absolutely annoying that thats a foul but its a smart play so Hunter sales after three points in the first half as 10 here in the second hes up to 13 the quietest 13 Hunter Sal could have outside of the dunk like what shots do you remember remember the one where he wasnt guarded on the out of bounds Im sure Kevin Keys remembers that one too but I dont even remember the other one and yet wake Faris is up by five they Trail 11 nothing oh con lets it Fly maybe that will get some light back into these wolf pack both teams when they can get two Defenders to commit to the basketball the pass out of it creates a shot opportunity second three for oakle just 29 on the year hildr from Reed no and Oles got the Applause rebound s and a half to go Taylor quiet Knight loud shot its a three got the switch and he wanted the ball back and Ean Reed just had the SAG got a good look six straight just like that offensive foul its the fourth un read middle Brook draws it and the wall pack in about 40 seconds totally change the game that good stuff again two guys on the basket ball you pass out of it you get a good look get the switch you know the defender got a sag you use the the dribble to ACC Wake Forest since the conference opener when BC hit 40 said no team has hit more than a third of its thre since in the last 15 games against wake and here comes NC State which never hits threes and they cant miss now thats 11 they tied a season High and the Freshman Paul mcneel has a new season High 17 if youre Kevin Keats you got to stick with this line up for the duration go win this game I its the best offense youve got defensively theyve been solid now you got to smaller lineup for weake Spillers Omaha Maloo reads off the floor with four fouls Salis good contest by okell okell Middlebrooks Taylor Styles and the star of the making Paul mcneel Jr whos either at or set a season high points minutes rebounds and assist the Freshman from Rockingham Taylor bricks a three thats not the Applause Music weight meanwhile is just two for seven from D they also struggle to shoot it oh boy yeah clear out offensive foul on hildred T Valentine had quite a few offensive fouls in this game and hilds hit with his third overall I know middle Brooks acted a bit on the last one but but he is absorbing a lot of contact I do think when youre playing bullyball you have to be careful with the dislodging Zone from Wake probably not a team they expected to need much Zone against and they get a take away heres Salis driving boy its just not been his game he lost it on the way up off his knee been his game and yeah hes just lost it but at the same time credit NC State for getting back in the action they got back and and they just threw bodies up at the the basketball to contest and honor Salis just lost the basketball because of the attention that K Mon its a 90c state run on three threes Taylor cut Middlebrooks gets it to Styles instead Dantes Styles first points of the half telling you the midrange game is there particularly against the Zone a couple dribbles defense doesnt fully commit on the help side that midrange is going to be there HRI wouldnt go and its off of blue this C he State crowd which has not had much to cheer about this year appreciating these moments this 11 nothing wol pack run still think Salis has to be heavily involved in everything you do offensively whether hes making the play or just dragging Defenders with him heres Styles what a tough shot timeout Lake Forest its slipping away from him now MC state is taking the game away Music except for the last two baskets this group right here I know theres a month to go but this would be a quadrant three loss it will be a very very damaging loss to wake farest resume NC State is 133 in the net whether theyre playing like it or not Spillers in the post over Styles hes fouled and he will shoot two more great college basketball coming up the Wake Forest fans will be rooting for Auburn in Missouri against thec bubble teams Georgia goes to face the nations number one after this on ESPN Sonic Blockbuster Kentucky Alabama and then Missouri Arkansas back to back to back on ESPN and the ESPN app if theres any bubble team I feel badly for its its a bubble team in the SEC right like what a brutal conference and we talk about top to bottom strength its really to me bottom to top how difficult is it to beat your basement teams that makes the conference brutal one of those bubble teams got a big win today Oklahoma beat Mississippi State in home snapped a losing streak for them NC State remember trying to get into the ACC tournament wow ell a slippery bouncer for the middle Brooks dunk thats the problem if youre going to hedge you have to be there if youre up read okon was able to drag both Defenders out so far that he was able to make that pass with a one hited Bouncer and a 10 assist game for oconnell epton Reed for three I mean thats not even close to the top of the week far as Playbook hes just 6 for 25 on the year from out there now that thats a last minute of the game shot theres still plenty of time to get back into this only down eight starts with a stop P Brooks and sty was calling for the whole way got it hriff no Reed out for Harris driving into his own teammates oh what a mess this is for Wake what a party this is for State just out of sorts offensive and the best player on the floor Hunter Sal doesnt touch it its an 182 wol P run Styles and wake fars which is H just two threes in the game needs instant offense Styles has to just feel that out and continue to work Fon Reed to the middle of the Court just got it with his fourth foul everything else has been going brilliantly though yeah look good energy right you pass out of the double team makes the extra in Rhythm high percentage three which not always the case with NC State tonight theyre knocking down open looks 12 threes a season High Paul mcneel hes got three of them in a season High 17 and Wake Forest is in a world of trouble now they are the last team in the projected field according to Joe lardy atus very moment Oklahomas already won game against Mississippi state that will go down as a quad one Victory and wake fars trying to avoid a quad three loss Reed goes two for two last time NC State hit this many threes in a game you got to go back to December 12th 2023 as they get a timeout that was against UT Martin just look at it MC Neil 17 Styles 22 okell with 11 assists just much better balance on the floor its hes been a tough shot take a tough shot maker got a got to stick with and make everybody level up to play on their level they made his subs and styles of the 9 Minute Mark and then it was a 101 before that they almost turn it over bad spot to inbounds though so he still got to get it across in 5 seconds OC connells making sure his teammates know that middle Brooks may have to come back and be an outlet tough place for styles to inbound it near the Wake bench oh boy Taylors in trouble and hes tied up NC State still has the arrow thatll change right now and now they got to get it across in the next three seconds at least you get it on the sideline I I would rather send someone out and just eliminate some of the congestion send somebody long you got to say guys your job is to get open send somebody long get rid of some of the congestion get open and look to throw ahead Styles two inbound it guarded by Spillers ell throws it long to mcneel but they didnt get possession in TI wow wow that was close so it is a 10 second violation mcneel didnt have possession of the ball before the 10 seconds expired lets see I mean its about possessing the basketball and there it Applause is oh its so close so ninepoint game remember wig Forest is sit just two threes they havent in a field goal since the 1019 Mark Sal is blocked by Styles wow Salis was thinking another highlight reel dunk and then Styles stuffed it and thats it for Reed he just found out of the game this play at The Rim was awesome straight up and I like the attack from Hunter sales but a great contest and thats where the wall up has been such a good thing for this game more plays at The Rim then we fixed the block charge where they basically made it nearly impossible to take a charge for a play coming at the rim and Im glad they did we have more plays like that tough one for Fon Reed man hes tired and when youre tired and you have to hedge you do things like grab its just its natural you get tired you got a hard hedge middle Brooks goes to slips he just grabs them I get why youre tired when youre tired you lose discipline middle Brooks two for two styles by the way now has two double doubles on the year both against wake and the lead is 11 closing in on two to play Tyler Johnson back in there for Reed weake will go small ER Harris fouled by Styles who has just fouled out of this game as well thats his fifth with 2011 to go I thought he played great defense I like the attack from Harris I think Harris brings he a lot he hasnt been able to do much in this game sorry John its actually on Taylor here on the reach in right there from behind didnt look like Taylor got much but its the fourth on Taylor so Styles does stay on the floor Applause I dont know if Taylor got him at all I dont know if he did either Wake Forest has not h a field goal in the last 8 minutes and 18 seconds but NC States defense has been really good Ive got H by somebody sandwich if he misses this chck missed it now they wake got it back Harris scored but who cares they still get a chck at Sand that should negate the chck Del we should have to secure the rebound were going to add to that and C only has one timeout they barely get it in and almost they do turn over with a mid of 45 to go and itll be reviewed because everything has to be in in the final two minutes its not a rule but its basically a Applause rule following plays under review Applause all righty ninepoint game the call on the court is Wake Forest basketball think its important that Styles didnt pick up his fifth foul on that play you know he hes been really good for them got him in this game in the first half this team came out hot I said its been hard for them to maintain with the different Music groups did Spillers get it before mcneel did need to see like 15 other angles this one might tell us knock it out of bounds off SP hopefully we can be quick about it right I agree as John Wood might have said if he had reviews in the game be quick and be in a hurry yeah so minute 45 to go they have reviews back then you imagine watching 20p views this would by the way technically be a quad 2 game NC State is 133 in the net a quad two game on the road is up to 135 whatever it still would be a damaging Fe now hang on are they going to say that mcneel touched it at the end in there I swear like half the time I dont know what Im watching and I think its really easy in slowmo to convince yourself one way or the another or convince yourself that its too much to overturn the call like I was watching a game the other night and and watched a review and I was like you know I was Iowa Iowa was playing somebody there was like a couple tough reviews and it is so easy to convince yourself either way depending on what your rooting interest is I thought this was clearly off of Spillers its right there I dont know I mean who knows maybe its just too hard to overturn I dont know either were probably looking at time like in my mind that felt obvious but I think its easy to convince yourself that the other player may have touched it so its hard to overturn so ninepoint game off the quick takeway heres Johnson leading in for another top two Spillers pulls it down theres a foul so hell shoot two with a minute 38 and thats the fourth on Ben middle this is where any any sort of flow comes to like a grinding hul for the last couple minutes were going to have three reviews a lot of fouls middle Brooks Taylor and styles all out four this is something you got to learn how to play if youre NC State lost a lot of close games you got to learn how to play without fouling you learn have to learn how to contest and then you have to learn how to get the ball in bounds when youre playing against the Press thats been the issue the last few possessions Spiller 66 shooter hits two leads down to seven 98 seconds to go Spillers will let the ball bounce away wake will set up the Press so Connell can run and C state only has one timeout they get it in the corner again man oh man they are throwing it in the dangerous spots its knocked out of Music Applause bounds is this going to be reviewed too anybody twirling their hands needs to stop doing it Ted Valentine is is going to review it again go this is where like I think its safe to say this is where it just gets dumb these reviews prev play on a review I mean who knows Music maybe maybe it was close but I feel like we just do this we give free timeouts lets see I mean right its close but it seems to me like its off haris but then again so did the last one we got that youre not lets just put it this way youre not overturning it no no way I would love it if the officials came over and said yeah it was close but were not going to overturn that because Harris hit it out Harris is pointing weight first of course TR but its not close you m a guy and you complain that the foul got called I mean you always fight the call so sevenpoint game we think we think we think its going to be NC State ball NC State 10 of 13 at the line can they hit their free throws and can they not turn it over right now its mainly about the ladder and they will have possession here 29 to shoot minute 37 on the clock so all that sorted out both teams in the double bonus and this will be another tough inbound without the ability to run they have really struggled to get the ball in bounds Spillers did a nice job on the ball as well hes hopping like a mad man on a pogo stick and the Taylor almost traveled with it oconnell touch past mcneel there you go NC State breaks the pressure and they going to start fouling now wake fars they look like they want to and now Salos will pull off NC States not a great free throw shooting team not a basket here feels like its over yep oconnell heres McNeil step back bang oh I mean it had to end this way didnt it dont foul good middle Brooks is out of the game which will give us more chance to appreciate the Unstoppable Paul mcneel machine we said it a basket here all but ends it not fouling early and mcneel is hes just been terrific tonight today whatever time of day it is hes been great it was today its getting closer and closer to tonight I mean between Styles and mcneel and then just the consistent play and feel and ball movement of okell theyve got something there every time Paul mcneel shoots I dont think hes going to miss and he typically doesnt and oconnell has just tied a career eye with 12 assists because his teammates cant stop missing threes I was going to say I mean theyre making shots and I think they were able to get them early enough to kind of build a little something but youve got to be able to play down the stretch without foul so hildr hits the first Marcus Hill back in the game for NC State Paul mcneel first 16 games of the year had 28 points combined in the last four he has 48 points hild two for two three possession game wake farest still has hit just one field goal in the last 9 and 12 minutes or Applause so theyve struggled to get the ball in bounds though another tough spot and another foul I would almost wait to foul there because that trap is so tough to pass out of the problem is if youre able to pass out of that trap its hard to foul the next pass and its easy to advance the ball and next thing you know it takes 20 seconds till you get back and foul somebody so mcneel to the line Ras two for two today and 13 for 18 in this freshman year I dont I mean I mean this in the best way possible but its almost like the worst thing for Kevin Keats is everyone now going why wasnt whats wrong with you its like if you want them to do well but not too well I think theyll take this performance you get my point scattered MVP chance behind us has 22 points bring somebody up bring somebody up make him pick the ball Johnson drives it no foul Spillers and another foul good Lord I think there was a foul Applause there lot of people asking Applause maybe we can apply The Purge to basketball and say each team gets to pick one possession in the final minute where you cant have a whistle blow until positions over I dont know who this was on his Styles its his fifth hes done two at this point up 10 51 second shouldnt be a killer but again I go back to the fact that you youve struggled to get the ball in bounds so Brion pass who is barely playing the second half will come in styles leads to a heros welcome 22 points just too shy the season High 10 rebounds his second double double of the year and he was awesome in this game particularly in the first half but that block on the Salis dunk was as important a contribution as any better than the 22 and 10 as any individual play I think dont you think sure yeah Applause Music so Spillers for two more remember wig Forest last team in the field as weve said for Jill andard their metrics arent great 60 in the net two and six in Quad one this would be their first loss in Quad two where theyre 5 and0 but it would be at the very very back end of quad 2 so theyd probably drop a few spots in the net and theyre next for Virginia Notre Dame at Duke and then Georgia Tech now all games besides Duke theyll be expected to win none of which will be resume builders except for the game at Duke which is a Monday night game big Monday March 3rd on ESP spin they pull that one off well then forget about this but theyll be heavy underdogs and theyll probably need to with this loss probably need to do some work in a conference tournament in a couple of weeks not that Steve Forbes is thinking about anything like that but just putting the reality of the situation into perspective this is going to be a tough one for Wake Forest to live down Kevin Keats you got to be telling your guys hey contest dont foul get somebody up on the ball dont let them roll it up you got to get that clock started NC States got 14 for 17 at the line as hell hit two Wing pars is not hitting shots from the field knocked away from Spillers itll be wake ball were going to review it were going to review it no just dont do it yep I know you kind of have to but all right another stoppage I feel like State take their 18th combined timeout in the final minute I think the review becomes a crutch for Music officials I get it you got to get it right but Lord Almighty the end of games is brutal well take another look at it theyre looking at it we might I mean I would say off of spillard and the the call was off of oconnell but thats off SP so look youre going to review it this is a good one to review I know but my point is if you dont have the review you got to get the call right I think it becomes a crutch where youre like were going to review it either way well just make the call and go look at it but if you got to get it right its the story just like basketball when its fluid you know that youve been around here I have well well get you by the way down the road shortly enough to Virginia UNC if youre waiting for that game Al UNC is opt another red hot start 152 6 minutes in all right if if this doesnt go the other way I dont I dont know what the point of of uh reviews would be so 432 yep and see State ball that should just about do it it should have been just about done a long time ago but Michael oconnell and NC State are going to get a massive massive win they need at least one more by possibly two to get to the ACC tournament hey who knows if they get to the AC tournament who knows how long their stake could be nobodys going to be saying this a final four team again but boy are they fun today and mcneel drops the final Hammer hes got 24 and the shot clock is off and Steve Forbes will call off the dogs boy in a season just filled to the brim with frustration with a lack of execution in late games NC state has been waiting for a day like this and Paul mcneel Jr The Freshman from right here in the state of North Carolina has just delivered the biggest thrill of his young career 24 points for mcneel one one small step for NC State one giant step for Paul mcneel Jr
