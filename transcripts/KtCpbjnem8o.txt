Music here at home Wake Forest in black pit in white we are underway in the ACC and its the demon eens and start with the ball Wake Forest off a long nday layoff since they last played on big Monday in a lost to North Carolina pit J comes out in manto man defending the threepoint line is going to be key in this game for both teams uh two of the better teams at making threes uh in this lead swatted great defense by Zack Austin all over boy Miller theres two still two seconds on the shot clock here and wake one of the uh better offensive teams in the ACC as you take a look at their starting five deep into shot clock though on their first possession shot clock violation you do Wonder in the middle of the Season where all these games are coming Fast and Furious in ACC play its rare that you would have nine days off in between games especially way in that game just shot three of 20 from three a season low and I think thats a theme were going to watch in this game when you have that type of long W layoff will they be rusty to start off this game heres Hunter Salis hes been the goto guy all season for the demon Deon and his fellow transfer Fon Reed and a muscle on feder Rico feder Rico and opens the scoring Fon Reed Jay that is all set up because wake is such a good threepoint shooting team you have to be out on the shooters and allowing Fon Reed uh to work he has been such a huge addition to this wake for his team uh the sevenfooter transfer from gagon pull up bub carington nothing but the bottom of the net a star freshman continues what has been a terrific first campaign here at pit and youre absolutely right uh he is in star in the making one of the best freshman guards not just in the ACCC but in college basketball foul called Rake Forest is going right at feder Rico tonight Steve Forbes head coach of the Demon Deacons he has been effusive in his praise for Fon Reed since Reeds return this wake team nine and three and I think with him in the lineup theyve proven theyre a top 25 team in the nation oh no doubt I absolutely agree and I think this is a dimension he adds to this team a post presence and thats all set up uh because you have to double read excellent pass that time out of the double team and again if you dont defend the threepoint line against wake they will make you pay Reed and sales both coming over from Gonzaga tough to find two more impact transfers in the country Carrington backto back buckets for the Freshman well he does not play like a freshman uh his basketball IQ off the charts thats a big time move snake the screen and then hold off the defender Carr trying to keep it in play gave it Applause away heres Jaylen low the fellow freshman in the back court swings it to Austin on the drive head on the timer L leaves it for federo who draws the Applause Music foul and Jay this is the dimension that Eon Reed brings to this wake team again you have to double him if he gets it going thats a beautiful play out of the double team and then right here the Freshman playing like a veteran thats a beautiful move snake the ball screen hold off the defender and then shoot in the midrange Jeff capable and snap have really found another really a good young freshman point guard but you mentioned Huck two teams that are not shy to let it fly two of the best shooting teams really in the ACC in the country and both of these guys Salis and Hinson can light it up I tell you what uh the pickup Salis you talked about it transfer from Gonzaga and then Henson for me he is a guy that can go on on a 100 run by himself uh one of the quickest releases in college basketball so again if you like offense and threepoint shooting youre at the right station now Wake Forest fans need no reminder of what Blake Hinson can do he had 83es in this matchup a year ago part of a program record 18 and its interesting Wake Forest theyre committed to going inside to start this game all seven points have come from the paint to start this matchup and early on uh readed more of a passer out of that double team hes doing a great job reading the double team and then hes finding guys that time the cutter low turnaround contested and he hits it jayen low these freshman continue to show up and show out for pit thats great footwork little reverse pivot and again both these uh young guards excellent in the midrange everythings been generated from down low even the Salis 3 came off a reed pass and heres Reed passing again out of the post Carr drills it from Deep Andrew Carr registers a triple and Wake Forest firing on all cylinders early and Reed right now uh give him a assist for that thats the hockey assist thats set up and started because he makes an excellent crosscourt pass out of the double right now Pits going to have to do a better job disguising their double team right now Reeds just reading it and then hes making an excellent pass out of the double team getting it done on both ends Fon Reed to start this Applause game lake is made four in a row theyve had a hot hand early Salis lines it up and drills it Hunter Salis hes got two triples early well Jeff cable we were at shoot around and uh the emphasis was that right there defending the threepoint line now thats a switch great read by bopy Miller had had a big on him went right at him triple drive and then pass uh to a wide openen shooter hon splits the double team and Cashes in Pittsburg desperately needed that ending a 6 nothing wake mini Music run shooting five of six to start this game including the last five all make although Ry Miller misses that layup Austin the trailer cant knock it Applause down Alice going Coast to Coast Hunter Salis he is on fire eight points already out of the Demon Deacons 15 two things Jeff G will talked about at shoot around Keys defend the threepoint line and then transition defense uh again wake uh one of the better scoring teams uh in the ACC they lead it right now but that guy right there is the answer F kinson spins his way into a three we mentioned the last time these two teams met pit hit a program record 18 threes Hinson had eight of Applause them green didnt get it off cleanly great defense freder Rico these team shooting it combined 11 of 15 to start this game Salis draws the foul on the floor if you like good shooting Haw you found the right game on a Wednesday night if you like threepoint shooting and offense youre at the right spot Hunter Salis with the three and then Blake Henson put him in the spin cycle one of the quickest releases in college Music basketball head coach Steve Forbes is dominating the transfer portal better than anybody else since it has really taken off in the last three years this year no different the two guys coming over from Gonzaga Salis and Reed and then bopy Miller whos got a great name but a better game that Trio has been terrific for the Demon Deacons yeah and I think uh Miller obviously putting up some great numbers but for me Salis and REE two guys coming over from kaga the jump that they have had in production you look at it one point uh one rebound per game for Eon Reed last year with the zags jumps up to close to nine and then Hunter Salis really having a phenomenal a start to the ACC a conference play for Wake and it really hasnt just been this season Alis Williams Tyree applebe two guys that come in and both become First Team all ACC players and you know hes really shown over the last three seasons that he can consistently bring in top talent via the portal and I think though hes got a great eye for guys that fit his system again its one thing to bring in guys its another thing for them to be the right fit a lot of credit uh to coach fors and his staff and then the Player Development piece look hes done a good job turning some guys that uh really again uh nobody really thought was going to turn into NBA prospects those guys are playing for payex Music Applause Music now leot trying to spin his way free couldnt quite create the right angle Applause there Hunter Salis with eight of the Demon Deacons 15 has it here with 10 seconds to Applause shoot frericks in with three has to hoist it at the end of the shot clock he didnt have nearly enough on it great defense by pit the Panthers trying to clamp down after a hot start offensively by wake Force weve got a good one here in the Music ACC a wake started this game shooting five of six from the floor since one of six and its because Pittsburgh has really dialed it in on defense and the key right here watch feder Rico federo heads on the ball screen that is so key that disrupted the offensive flow weaks a half cour set and thats all set up by all five guys being connected and Jay I think the key thing as you take a look at uh Steve Forbes frustrated with that feder Rico feder Rico the key thing for him and what makes him special for this uh pit team how he defends ball screens that is so key speaking to the coaching staff excellent job that time disrupting wake fors offense and Fon Reed was off the floor during spell I to think that the offense has been working through Reed foul called against pit on the rebound and with him on the floor he just gives the demon Deacon such a big Music presence and youre absolutely right I think on both ends we talked about it uh close to two blocks per game so hes providing some Rim protection I think the biggest thing though offensively it allows them to have somebody that they can dump the ball down low and play through uh in the post to go along with all the excellent Shooters they have trying to squeeze it into Reed red well and intercepted by lean heres Carrington in attack mode pulls up cant connect this Applause time hon great defense he brings so much energy and passion to the game Blake hson and hes leaned out again really worked on uh all aspects of his game and uh credit again Jeff cable and staff but they do a great job in terms of the Player Development piece and Hensons added some twist to his game everybody knows he can shoot but now hes playing a lot more in the post and also off the bounce that drops in for Hunter Salis ends a threeminute scoring Dr for the Demon Applause Deacons Salis with 10 of weight 17 in this first half thats a great pullup jumper uh that time the previous possession for Salis again playing off of two feet look at this right here again a change direction and then up off of two feet young players take note wake does a really good job having their guards and wings a play off of two feet once they get into the paint Monsanto transition three and hes fouled its been great to see deari Monsanto back in the lineup with wake fors this is his third game back from injury he has overcome three season ending injuries throughout his career to get him back on the court a huge Testament to the character and the mental fortitude that that young man has and and shoo around this afternoon pit hes also one of the more Le lethal threepoint shooter oh yeah already two games 6 threes and right there again uh that was something pit worked on uh in shoot round Closeouts in particular on Monsanto they said look you must be there on the catch that time theyre late and he makes him pay uh from the free throw line an eightpoint lead for the Demon Deacons in what would be a critical Road win wake has been terrific at home 110 just two and six away from home and this would be a quad one road win the best win you can get in terms of an NCAA tournament resume L kenson felt he was hit on that Music turnaround and the scoring drought is now four minutes for pit so while the defense has improved for the Panthers the offense has fallen into a scoring drought of four minutes and Jeff cable told us that they need to be able to weather those storms Blake Hinson heads out to the pit bench Panthers have missed their last six shots Jeff cable said it shootter around today were going to go through a period tonight where the shots arent falling we just cant let our opponents separate during that time and I think the big thing is growth right again theres starting two uh young backourt players Jay I think weathering those storms uh starts on this end right here see if you can get some stops and then try to get out in transition if youre this pit team Reed going right at Diaz Graham and thats too easy for f Reed theyre going to have to double again right there uh hes uh giving up a lot of weight and strength uh theyre going to have to double quick cuz right now re catching the ball deep deep into Applause poses and this is what he brings right here look at this again uh squaring up you have to honor the threepoint Shooters and then thats just too deep Diaz has got to do a better job of pushing him out of the paint when he allows him to back down and get two feet in the paint uh hes going to score or youre going to have to put him on the free throw line heav nothing Run for the Demon Deacons as wake starts to separate on the road Frederickson great fake steps back it doesnt Applause Music drop Carrington hes been the Catalyst tonight and I really like how Carrington changes pace and changes Direction great size for a freshman goes about 65 a great strength putting up some pretty good numbers uh for a freshman 13 points a game four assists five rebounds and I think thats the key thing he does a little bit of everything really good rebounder from that guard spot wide open for three rattles in and out no good pit desperate for something to fall the scoring drought now longer than five 5 minutes here they missed seven straight Lop to Reed who couldnt quite keep it in turnover well thats great team defense again thats the adjustment by pit Reed went flying for that ball 7f footer 240 lbs now hes down lets hope hes not hurt again I didnt see the fall afterwards but theres a lot of just stuff there again you got some camera folks some stairs so lets just hope he didnt hit his head or also body on anything where hes going to be injured thats a good sign right there hes up and walking again right here hildr trying to make that pass but again you see the help coming and then he just kind of carried his momentum into the crowd the camer cameraman took the charge yeah the cameraman might need some Advil after that one right there blocker charge Im Im going to go with uh Im going to give him the charge on that one for giving up his body our cameraman Jared putting his body on the line there Pittsburgh scoreless on nine straight possessions its been more than 5 minutes and 30 seconds without a bucket leg it trying to change it and he does Isle it knocks down a big time three much needed both these teams shoot the ball so well from Beyond The Arc that time though off the bounce eldr lost it legit who just hit the three looking for more dishes it to Austin who flies into contact and its an offensive foul Wake Forest getting back with some transition Music Applause defense leg it trying and will Pittsburgh back into it after a 5minute scoreless trout finally got the triple at dominoes we know life doesnt always go with where Bracketology begins to heat up and I dont want to get in trouble with our colleague Joe lonardi who historically is very accurate with with projecting the field of 68 but you look at what he has today the ACC a three bid League behind the Mountain West the Pack 12 the Big 10 the Big East I I dont love the net either but its closer to reality than Joe is look at the teams in the top 50 of the net the ACC is the third conference with six above the Big East Big 10 pack 12 Mountain West and I think if you look at the eye test it should at least be a six bid League well I had a conversation with Joe lardi uh this morning and were going to get him on uh as we get get closer to March uh because again uh some of these numbers obviously its a debate every year as we get closer to March as you take a look at whos in whos out uh for me Im just going to have a hard time believing that only three teams from the ACC should be in uh I look at these teams teams like UVA teams like wake uh teams like even a Miami uh Virginia Tech uh I test I dont care what you say about what the numbers say to me I think theyre worthy uh NCAA tournament teams also to go along with some wins early on of that complete St that rattles in for the Freshman Bob Carrington cuts the lead to six and he has led the way for the Panthers all season but tonight no exception seven points Reed lines up the three cant knock it down and youll live with that if youre pit Fon Reed shooting threes I get step back got it backto back threes and just like that its a one possession game and thats a mismatch again that time Carr or on Legette he sees the mismatch goes right at him beautiful step back jumper Drake bunched up Reed trying to clear out he has had the better of freder go feder Rico tonight that time feder Rico all over Reed great defense and you see the adjustment a by pit again now theyre going to double but right here this is Leed beautiful pass you cant draw it up any better unselfish basketball dribble Drive kick and then Carrington gives it right back to him leg get going at car excellent offensive possessions back to back by pit Miller contested three as the sounds great defense by pit they are right back in this game theyve made three in a row on a six nothing run in the last minute for the tie lean left it Applause short keing in the half court the close outs and trying to keep the ball out of the paint if youre wake Hunter Sally is so crafty off the window and in he leads all scorers with 12 oh Jay I love his midrange he showed off off of two feet that time though shoots a nice little floater high up over the defender thats a big time finish when wake has needed a big time bucket this season it is usually in the hands of 23 Salis well again before off of two feet right here knows he needs to get it up quick thats a tough floater over feder Rico feder Rico by Hunter Salis the leading scorer for wake and he came into this one averaging 16 and Ill tell you what he might get there uh before the half uh finishes a week from tonight right here on acc Network a double header that tips off in Syracuse at seven as they take take on Louisville and then continues at camon indor and the Duke Blue Devils host Notre Dame that is a week from tonight right here on acc Applause Network great conference game right now in pit one possession game wake has led for most of this first half of the Panthers battling back L to read and the sevenfooter Hammers it home thats a beautiful set play so many actions on that halfcourt set by wake finished with a beautiful law by Salis to read frto Rico answers with a slam of his own the high flyer feder Rico feder Rico both teams executing in their half court back and forth we go both of these teams outstanding offense in execution right now oh wake again we talked about it uh leading the ACC close to 80 points per Applause Music game I get lost the handle but re gathers it drives to the rim misses the layup bounces out to Salis dangerous in transition leaves it for hildr that rolls off the rim no Applause good High Tempo back in fourth game leot connects well leot has been really big for pit in this game thus far in the first half he is a step back threes that time though nice little pullup jumper from the foul line Chas had it deflected up aad ah head Hinson hes a threat to shoot at all times backing down hildr trying to bully his way in and draws the foul the pit has made five of the last seven as the slam dunk contest broke out here in pit well right here Fon Reed off the Beautiful live pass and then feder Rico feder Rico says right back at you we got some excellent offense in this first half by both these teams its bow time hey sweetie hey Mom I land at three the pit back court has been the glue of this team so far tonight yeah credit Jeff capable and staff theyve done a phenomenal job with this young back cour right here Carrington with the three off of excellent ball movement and then right here in transition I love the basketball IQ right here thats a great read identify the mismatch and then Legette taking advantage of it with the step back and youre absolutely right Jay that has been the strength for this uh pit team their wings and also backourt play and you think about the team that won two games in the NCAA tournament a year ago that was built off a very veteran talented backcourt and they graduated and moved on so the question was well whos going to step up for pit and theyve relied on two freshman and an impact transfer to jayen low one of those two freshman along with Bob Carrington and theyve had huge shoes to fill and they done it very very well you look at low in the last four games has been tremendous he has and again going back to as these young players as you take a look at low uh off the high ball screen I think thats what any coach looks for trying to play your best basketball will come February and March the defensive end continues to come up with turnovers thats the eighth turnover call cused in this first half theyve only turned it into four points though and thats the key right there trying uh to limit those but again obviously uh Steve forb is not happy with the turnovers and I think though the glaring number is the paint right now wake is dominating the paint uh 186 and favor uh of Wake Forest theyre doing a great job a lot of that though Fon Reed uh establishing him uh playing through him in the post Leets had the hot hand lines up a three this one cant connect Ry Millers been quiet explodes turns around Fades away kicks to Salis long to missfires Applause one thing though that awake has done against this pit team cleaned up the defensive glass uh pit came into this game one of the better offensive rebounding teams lake has limited those Applause opportunities Collision there from Leed and Miller ild on the bench with three fouls and thats a veteran move right there by Boy Miller he just put on the brakes got the rebound knew that Legette was behind him and just stopped put on the brakes made him run into him again thats just great recognition if youre boy Miller look youre in the bonus those are uh two freebies for Applause you makes the front end Jay wake a really good free throw shooting team uh as well and again I think thats key as youre trying to win these games on the road missed the second the Malcolm wake shooting 80 on the season from the foul Music line deacons have led for most of this first half heres Music Hinson and they get into some contact no call Carr rips it away for Applause Wake Miller pull a pop Perfect Touch for bopy Miller key thing is off two feet thats one thing that I noticed with these weight guards and wings thats under control playing off of two feet a beautiful a body control by bopy Music Miller low in a double team trapped in the corner foot on the line thats a turnover great pressure by wake and thats great again just recog this and seeing the guy in the corner keep in the Trap and then right here again playing off of two feet young players take note under control off of two feet thats excellent body control and touch in the Applause midrange Miller trying to shake his way free boopy Miller so crafty foot thats a footwork clinic right there again you cant uh show off any bed better footwork than what bofy Miller did right there get in the lane reverse pivot and then finish right now wake on a Music roll now Malcolm you just said a footwork Clinic you love watching boopy Miller play right here again off of two feet and then the previous uh one going into break uh it was a reverse pivot again that is so key uh when youre a guard getting into the paint being under control contested shot goes begging from Carrington now wake can hold for the final shot of this first half theyve built an eightpoint Applause lead Alis with under 10 to operate goes to work pull up pop draws the foul an opportunity to make it a 10point lead headed into halftime from the foul line well right before Salis shot that uh shot I was thinking to myself if youre pit thats the last thing you want to do is foul again we talked about Wake Forest one of the better free throw shooting teams in the country not just in the ACC it becomes very difficult when youre playing a team thats shooting 80 from the foul line to come back late in game because chances are theyre not going to miss from the line and you know just becomes very difficult to claw back well 44 seconds left so Id say the same thing to wake as well too obviously the last thing you want to do is fou end this situation plenty of time to get a couple of bounces maybe a pass uh before you shoot uh if youre pit but you got to go quick into Carrington 3 seconds left in the half hoists it good if it goes but Off the Mark and Wake Forest closes the first half holding pit to a 4minute scoring drought and building a 10point advantage on thead and then also Fon Reed out of the paint hon passes out of the double team Federico Federico two chanes at it couldnt convert Sal is weaving through all the way to the rim everything but the Finish stays demon Deacons ball Miller on the Move kick to the corner hildr sends it back to Miller 3 seconds to shoot draws the contact and boy Miller will head to the line and this is something the pit uh coaching staff talked about in particular with Miller you have to stay down on his head fix again we talked about him and thats why its so key playing off of two feet well you saw him that time again he revers pivoted about two times on that possession alone little shot fake gets him up in the air and hes at the free throw line again you have to play Stay disciplined uh in your defensive position right here little head fake again thats just craftting by Boy Applause Miller the largest lead of the night for Wake Forest theyve led the entire game and now a 12point lead here at the start of the second half caring to pull up pop left it short you mentioned the offensive rebounds thats the first of the night for Pittsburgh can they cash Music in heres Hinson only five points to his name in the first half count it plus the foul thats more like it for Blake Hinson talk about playing off of two feet this is a grown man move right here shot fake and then take the smaller Miller through contact and one look at his eyes right there on the basket and rim the entire time thats a tough finish through contact by Henson Henson who Jeff capable has told us his confidence when he gets going is contagious to this team and they uh really pleased with the leadership of that he has shown to growth more of a focal leader this year on this team and again we talked about the young back court it has been huge for their growth Reed continuing to go to work on the low block Fon Reed hes put on a big man clinic tonight well theyre going to have to double again uh in that first half the adjustment was uh they started doubling they cant leave him alone against Reed feder Rico feder Rico go tending plus the foul so an and one opportunity coming again for pit and this right here again youre going to have to double hes just backing him down a feder Rico feder Rico giving up too much weight and then on the other end right here Federico going right back at him not a smart play though by Reed again thats a clear go not sure that ball was going in if he tipped it but again thats an easy call for the refs to make theyre over at the monitor this will be a quick look yeah I mean it hit the hit the backboard first and he clearly hit it afterwards and I like that again not much uh not much debate on that one right there make sure you get it right thats not one that you need to take a whole heck of a lot of time Applause on both coaches using that little delay as a timeout Dess trying to get them back to uh the free throw line and set up but typically reviews take a little bit longer and its two great coaching staffs we really enjoyed talking with Jeff capable and Steve Forbes and are a great production staff put together these are the two reigning ACC coaches of the Year capable last year in staff and Forbes in year 2122 they both took over programs that quite frankly needed a rebuild and what have they done theyve rebuilt them they really have and I think both these coaches have done a great job in the transfer portal and then this year with cable the young back court hes done a phenomenal job and brother Jason on staff Milan Brown uh coach Timmy UL those guys all do a great job not only obviously Manning the transfer portal but then the development of these players they get here you mention the backourt experience with this young back court that pits working with this year 18 and a half for Wake the average is more than 20 ripped away heres Le pit trying to get something in transition feels like theyve come out with a much better energy in this second half well the key thing on that that last defensive play watch how feder Rico feder Rico resist again thats further out than Fon Reed has normally been getting feder Rico Federico shows some resistance and then keeps him further away from the basket setting up to help to come in and take the steal he needs more of that in this second half thats great individual defense by Federico Federico leg it into the double team missed it Salis keeps it in play for Wake great hustle play from hter Salis who leads all scorers with 14 points Applause tonight Wes got a mismatch down there it was lean yeah Le was on Reed yeah and he did a great job blocking out as well too feder Rico feder Rico ejected by Reed travel on the other end but thats what Fon Reed brings to this Wake Forest team right here again feder Rico does a great job running the floor hes done that all day but then the recovery and thats what uh Reed brings again close to two blocks per game and you dont want to harp on the Bracketology stuff too much but you hope the committee takes into account how good theyve been with Reed you look at their metrics top 20 in offensive and defensive efficiency with Reed on the court theyre nine and three since his return and Jay thats a great point and I think thats the part where again I dont get the analytics guys playing injured wake with Fon Reed versus without him theyre a completely different team thats a sevenfooter coming in transferring from Gonzaga certainly uh they are much better with a sevenfooter that can score and also shot block uh in their lineup and youre right the numbers dont lie yeah numbers dont lie in an opportunity to get a critical Road win tonight this would be a quad one win and you know wake for is net 44 thats without Reed as well you know it takes the entire year into summary and theyre missing that quad one win which they could get tonight if they get that tonight I think youd have to put them in the field as it stands and I think youd put them in anyway considering how good theyve been with Reed back into the lineup both these coaches we asked them about that and they had a lot to say about it but at the end of the day both of them said and I agree its all about winning just win baby and your everything else takes care of itself y especially if you can get a win on the road it has cut the lead to six beautiful pull up jumper of that time by the Freshman Carrington Salis from the corner Way Off the Mark Carrington finds low contested three he misfires gets his own rebound kick out Carrington missed it another Applause look third times the try scoop to the hoop is leged offensive rebound we talked about it they had zero in that first half second chance opportunity right here unselfish ball and then Legette with the reverse right now pit on a Music run Pittsburgh is wearing tonight there this game is no secret shooting shirts recognizing the the game played in 1943 between Duke and NC Central when coach John McLendon organized a secret game against Duke the M clendon Foundation minority leadership initiative that began a few years back is so important to Jeff capable and this pit program Malcolm it really has and theyve been heavily involved the university along with Coach cable the capable Brothers had a great chance to talk with assistant coach Milan Brown as well to on pit staff and again they do a great job obviously the awareness and the importance of of Mr McLendon and their Foundation the work that they Applause do Frederickson with the shot clock at 10 buries it from the corner that halts the seven nothing pit run great play out of the timeout yeah and also obviously breakdown by pit D Forbes called Frederickson one of the best Shooters hes recruited that time wide open hes going to make you pay hon trying to answer from three cant connect up ahead hildr splits the double team in transition misses the layup Salis keeps it alive feeds it out to car three and he cant connect a break right there the pi coaching staff along with Coach cable they felt Henson was hit on that jumper previous possession Carrington weaving through leg step back and that rattles in legot has been huge right now in double figures 12 points for pit again his midrange has really been impressive tonight for pit hes going right back to Reed freder Rico gets the better of him this time Scramble for the ball it stays wakes Music way now back and forth we go a tough contested game between wake and pit in the ACC well wake up five on the road but a battle of the bigs right here Fon Reed of the transfer from Gonzaga great footwork going right at fed Rico and then on the other side right here great work by feder Rico uh these two J have gone at it I think this is going to be a key uh in this game a wake has done a really nice job trying to establish read and the post pit has made some adjustments doubling but I think the key is going to be feder Rico can he push Reed further away from the basket and right on Q right back to the post battle Reed getting the better of feder Rico there and that time pit again again chooses not to double I think you got to double or dig I think again uh right now Reed has the weight and strength advantage on feder Rico hes just backing his way down Carrington trying to answer and he does the Freshman not shy he has met the moment throughout his first season here at pit he is so impressive against snaking ball screens and then U holding uh players off as it Tak a look at Great recovery defense but this battle uh between Reed uh and feder Rico I think is going to decide this game wake is continuing to play through Reed right here great footwork and finish by Fon Reed and dont you think the Demon Deacons when theyve looked their best offensively it has been through Reed absolutely tonight and thats the matchup they continue to go at rake have the largest lead at 12 pit has cut it to five 5 Seconds to shoot Carrington finds Hinson step back contested three rattles home Blake Hinson hits it and its a fourpoint game or twopoint game one of the more difficult contested shot makers in college basketball thats not bad defense thats just a guy thats one of the better players in the ACC Frader looking for the answer cant find one bounces out hriff sends it into Carr hes trying to muscle on feder Rico 10 seconds on the timer heres Salis yet to score in this second half lost the handle lean sends it up for feder Rico thats a jump ball between feder Rico and Reed now Blake hson hes been a little quiet for his standards tonight but a big triple here yeah one of the more difficult shot makers not bad D but thats Blake Henson right there doing what he does Music best okay so Dominos Perfect combo includes two medium one topping is number eight Kansas theres nowhere better than allenfield house nowhere then its round one of du a pit on the season three and six in ACC play and when you look at what happens in WIS versus losses it falls on the shoulders of Blake Hinson 55 from three in the wins just 31 in the losses yeah and again hes the focal point most uh hes right at the top of the Scouting Report anytime pit is playing you look at what hes done tonight struggled in that first half starting to heat up uh theyre going to obviously need his production and also leadership to close this game out and sitting at 50 so thats closer to a win than a loss pit still trailing by two Under 12 minutes left in regulation here you get the feeling that this game just going to come down to the final possession and remember when they played a year ago Hinson hit 8 threes against Wake Forest hes had backto back seasons for pit that have just been terrific in fact hes just the fourth pit player to make 70 or more threes in consecutive years and Monsanto answers with a triple of his own Jay thats a breakdown thats a breakdown in The Scouting Report Monsanto hes what thats what hes out there to do well he is a guy that you have to be connected to cannot give him that much airspace thats a big three for weight right back to hson this time he takes it right to the rack for two lets see the adjustment that pit makes got to communicate on the actions of that Wake Forest runs again they use a lot of ball screens wheel Cuts Zoom actions communication is key Salis left open offensive rebound Falls to Frederickson he cant connect wait getting good looks it just cant finish yeah again if youre Steve Forbes youll live with that offensive rebound uh one of the better times get a three fron wide open just short wake shooting just four of 15 in this second half its allowed pit to take a 12point deficit and tie it up Bob Carrington drills it to tie it at 49 oh this freshman does not play like a freshman basketball IQ off the charts and the zoo is a WI into Applause Reed Lefty hook to Perfection Fon Reed delivers again got a double A Diggin not going to work faking Diggin not going to work Fon Reed right now uh just too much a weight and strength for feder Rico in the post you got to play bring some help to help him when he gets the ball into Applause post hon driving can met by Reed foul called and hitson a chance to tie it at the foul line right there thats two grown men again right here Henson again this is the dimension hes added to his game you know he can shoot but then right here two grown men trying to go at The Rim Reed met him Henson goes through it now hes at the free throw line we talked about the importance of Blake Henson to this pit team again the coaching staff really raving about his leadership in the role that hes taken of this year with this young back court that Ratt out no good on the first you take a look at this pit program and coming off an NCAA tournament appearance where they went in one two games lost a lot from the back court but Hinson returns and I think a lot of people thought pit would be a lot better than their three and six ACC record theyve been terrific on the road went to Cameron indor and beat a ranked Duke team the home court advantage they usually have at the Pete has not delivered in conference play they are 0 and four here at home in ACC play a great chance to change that in the final 10 minutes here but that is unlike this program and for me though I think it goes to the strength of this conference Yes again theyre playing a really good in my opinion a tournament team and Wake Forest again they have had some tough competition but make no mistake about it but theyre going to have to try to close this game out F Reed everything going through Reed at the moment and why not because he keeps delivering grown man move again hes taking his time and the problem with playing a team like wake we talked about it uh theyre one of the best threepoint shooting teams in the country if you double theyll make you pay carington pulls up from three too much on it it falls to leg it he hoists and knocks it down Dish leged been on fire all night player to game for pit uh his offense in that first half he continues it in the second second chance opportunity right there pit one of the better offensive rebounding teams in the ACC salz turnaround knocks it down these two teams going punch for punch in an ACC heavyweight fight if you want to show young players how to play off of two feet watch the Wake players Salis again that time off of two feet reverse pivot into his midrange Carrington pull up hes fouled Applause right here again we talked about it the offensive rebounds heads up play and then leg Le it and then on the other end Hunter Salis watch this footwork reverse pivot off of two feet you cant do it any better highend highlevel basketball both these teams in the half court a Pittsburgh Trail by 12 at the start of this second half they have battled back to tie it on a number of occasions and they might tie it right here on the second Carrington foul shot but they have not LED even for 1 second Applause tonight hon checks back into the game tied at 55 smaller lineup in here for pit so now obviously uh youre going to have to show some help uh if uh weight continues to play through Fon Reed Reed calling for it and jeffris called for the foul he was all over Reed there trying to deny the ball Fon Reed hes got a season High 14 points trying to will Wake Forest to a critical Road win all tied at Music 55 10 matchups on ESPN this Saturday you take a look at the ACC Carolina and Duke at the top and then theres a log Jam really Virginia all the way down on to pit the top 12 theres just not much to separate and for me again uh we can go on and on about uh the strength of this conference for me I think its a shame there are some quality teams that are log jammed right in that middle and wake one of those Applause teams coming out of the timeout trying to regain this lead poopy Miller a man on a mission everything but the finish and they say it was off Wake Forest last so pit basketball and and thats a great job of team rebounding and blocking out by pit again they got a smaller lineup out there right now its going to take all five guys to get on the defensive Applause glass Off the Mark offensive rebound and low The Freshman mishandled Applause it in that first half a pit zero offensive rebounds theyve woken up in the second half and what their bigs do they do a great job tipping the ball back out so if they cant get it they try to tip it back out uh to have one of their teammates get it do a great job attacking the offensive Music Applause glass Miller another turnover heres Carrington and he draws the foul a chance for Bob Carrington to give pit their first lead of the night from the foul line this right here all set up by the defense again active in the passing Lane and in kariton so good changing direction little hesitation right there and so impressed uh with his court awareness his ability to change speeds change direction great size for a guard he leads all scorers with 17 points tonight and with that made free throw its the first time pit has taken the lead all night long theyve tied it six times but this the first time pit is in front and what a bounceback it is for the Freshman only four points at Miami over the weekend now 18 to lead the Applause Panthers Salis weaving through traffic and that rattles in ties it at 57 hes so under control through traffic that time weaving through and just nonchalantly lays it up off the glass thats a tough shot he made it look easy great body control by Hunter Salis leg a deep three drills it is Applause leged he has been on fire tonight he scored at all three levels that time a deep Applause three Salis thought about the three gives it up to hildren inside Reed 4 seconds on the shot clock hildr lines it up missed Applause it count it plus the foul is leged has taken over thats the best defense to offense transition and its all set up uh by uh their defense right here a beautiful dribble Drive by The Freshman to the get and then right here and one for leget off of the great defense body control and one and pit on a run and its all set up though Jay by their team defense smaller lineup out there theyre just being active in the passing Lanes cant convert the and one but legit has the last five points for pit and a season High 20 points for the transfer from Rhode Island if Im Wake Forest Im going at Fon Reed a play through him dont have him up uh out on the perimeter set a high ball screen and then dive him to the post see if you can get a paintt touch Alis Off the Mark pit has dialed it in defensively and from down 12 to up five with 5 minutes left a 17point swing in this second half looking for more Carrington got it the elevation on his pullup game some of the best Ive seen for a freshman guard Applause over had to get creative there just threw it off Hinson he was in trouble and watch this high ball screen right here again Reed flattens out too late great elevation by The Freshman Carrington time out Steve Forbes with Pittsburgh on a seven nothing run wake up again against it on the road well be back in 30 Music seconds and ish legged they each have 20 points a piece a combined 40 and they have just found another gear down the stretch in this second half and a high ball screens weight Force now is going to have to adjust Reed has flattened out on ball screens hes going to have to show harder or hedge harder to slow down the guards of Applause pit delri battling his way to the bucket up and in for two great play out of the timeout and thats where they need to go again theyve been settling for jumpers attack the paint again uh pit out there with a smaller lineup dribble drives or try to get read back established on the offensive side jeffris couldnt control it he was off read last so itll stay pit way you mentioned points in the paint wake 30 points in the paint and yet youre right theyve went away from that in the second half and I think thats where they need to go to close this game out let Fon Reed get some touches Reed commits the foul had both hands on Carrington this game is getting chippy and physical right here his fourth foul yeah Reed steep in out hard again thats the adjustment but thats what you want to do if youre pit theyve continued to attack Fon Reed in high ball screens and great a recognition uh by Jeff capable and staff again they just put read in ball screens make him defend way out on the Music perimeter rattled in and out no good misses the front end to the one and one and Steve Forbes electing to leave Fon Reed on the court with four fouls well if Im wake Im going right at Reed again just dive him to the post let him get a paint touch hes calling for it hildr cant shake free 10 seconds to shoot hildr still with it Carr from the corner missed it Reed bats it out a ton of contact Jefferson Reed pushing and shoving very risky cuz Reed has four fouls there was never a whistle Im surprised theres a lot of contact on that one I thought they might have got him for over the back but then after lot of extracurricular pushing and shoving Carrington step back three missed it it falls to hints at another offensive rebound swatted out of bounds its gotten chippy here in pit physical game down the stretch the Panthers clinging to a fivepoint Advantage emotions have reached a fever pitch here in Pittsburgh in a critical conference game and you can feel how much it means to both teams battling for every ball and there was a skirmish right before the break between Fon Reed and William jeffr going for a rebound Reed is in the game playing with four fouls lets show it to you again jeffr great blockout and he has been key when hes been to me thats an overto back I mean thats an overto back right there and then afterwards again Jeffs trying to get him off him and Reed very lucky to ref talking to him right now uh thats a break for Wake Forest very fortunate that Reed did not pick up fit f and hed be out of this game for the final 3 minutes hit with the basketball leading by five the Oakland Zoo in full voice two teams battling on the NCAA tournament bubble and a big time Jam William jeffris on a wreck attack beautiful set play thats a set play out of bounds underneath you cant execute it any better fak the ball hand off teas kept it and thats a monster dunk beautiful execution out of the out of bounds underneath wakeing the danger zone trailing by seven Reed lost it leg it scoop to the hoop a career high 22 for ish lean Sal is trying to spin his way free two minutes left Miller gets the layup to go now if your hit run some clock and I think youre going to put Fon Reed in high ball screens that has been the formula for them get Reed in the ball screen and force him to defend out on the perimeter that gets had the hot hand all night Carr the rejection that time shot clock down to three and a timeout by pit and this out of bounds underneath right here again thats all set up and Jeff with the fake handoff and slam thats a beautifully executed play by Jeff Music cable and then on the other end Leed in transition all set up by excellent defense and that has been the key for pit in this run and turnaround a minute 33 to go Jay theyre up seven a pit I think of the key has been their defense on FN Reed and keeping weight out of the paint well they have outscored wake by 17 in this second half and they are a minute 33 from closing in on what would be their first conference home win this season they will have won three of their last fours theyre really hitting their stride as this season heads into February 3 seconds on the shot clock coming out of the timeout Hinson called for the offensive foul theyre going to call Hinson for the hook and Jeff cable felt like he was pushed first thats a big break lets see if he got him on the hook yeah thats again you can argue that he pushed him before but certainly thats a hook and Miller gives it right back turnovers have been so costly for Wake Forest tonight thats now 15 against the Demon Deacons well I feel like theyve stalled in their offense again in that first half they were running sets and then they were getting read posted uh now theyre having issues entering the ball into the post right now though if youre wake you got your full court pressure on again uh make sure you dont get beat going Music long legan hoists it up to Hansen Hansen into contact Blake hitson making winning plays for pit and thats what I just said there was no safety back for Wake all five guys were face guarding throw over the top nice little post up and then right here beautiful finish by Blake Henson and thats a breakdown by wake again you have to have somebody over the top great recognition they brought guys up and then had Henson going long the execution at the end of this game really if you look back at it if pit is able to end with the win uh the out of bounds underneath and then that time out of bounds have to go to full length of the Court what a turnaround pit Trail by as many as 12 in this second half now leading by 10 Salis wake is Fallen ice cold he punches it out hildr time running off the Applause clock Im going to say its wake ball obviously theyll review it at the monitor and I think this is critical right here again I like that they can go and review this uh I think one of the Great rule changes one of the great I think things in the game make sure the refs get this right theyre going to review it again from our angle we were blocked I still think its going to stay with weight well in this situation take a look right here again hildr not settling for the three yeah again I dont see how you reverse that I think thats still going to be wake ball yeah it looks like its swiped out of hilds hands yeah I think thats going to be off of Le it and thats going to probably remain a wake ball again I didnt see anything hit his foot Applause afterwards again the strip yeah and the ball clearly I think thats going to stay with wake now again if youre wake a minute 04 to go you certainly dont need a three but as you take a look at whats at stake for both of these teams well whats funny is weve talked about how both of these teams are trying to separate from the ACC pack if this result holds all its going to do is make the pack even Tighter and uh for me again I know a lot of people do metrics and theres net and all the this other stuff going on for me there are so many quality teams uh you take a look at this right here Clemson uh in the top 40 within the net and theyre a team thats almost down near uh the bottom half of the ACC you cant tell me theyre not a tournament team Virginia Tech Syracuse Miami NC State wait for us I mean look theres so many teams in there I have a hard time buying that theres only three teams that are going to get into the NCAA tournament to me thats crazy uh crazy talk and you take a look at the ACT ACC teams in the net top 50 numbers dont lie and some of these teams also have some quality wins against other conferences so again when you look at it as a whole yes obviously uh strength and conference is a great thing but these teams are just beating up on each other in League Play no doubt about it and I think if you look at the the conferences headtohead the ACC against the Big 12 is 9 and three so if you want to look at headtohead there it is again you can make an argument uh for anything for me everybody talks about the eye test I see a lot of really good teams in the ACC we just showed you 1 to 12 in the ACC theres really not much to separate these teams we saw that last night with Georgia Tech beating Carolina you know the depth in this conference is really the strong point and pit has shown that tonight Fredericks into three wake needs it they cant connect hildr trying to keep this game alive crosscore pass to Carr he has to heave it Reed this is three offensive rebounds and finally a made Bucket from hildr but a lot of clock ran off down to 48 seconds left now wake got beat long once lets see if they keep somebody back timeout Jeff cable did not want to risk a 5c call Jeff cable at his coaching staff I think this is been a master class of ingame adjustments they were down 12 in the second half and they turned this game around and it all set up by their defense as you take a look at Carrington off the high ball screen Leed getting into the action Carrington again uh I think the key thing is this guy right here though jefferis was huge when he came into the game the job that he did pushing Fon Reed out was huge so since Fon Reed last scored to the 925 Mark pit has outscored wake 2110 they are outscoring the Demon Deacons 4426 in the second Music half thats in game adjustments coming up clutch for pit I I think the adjustment on Reed that has been the key he had his way with them in the first half they played to him obviously Hunter Salis had a big a first half uh but for me uh the ability for them to keep wake out of the paint in the second half has allowed them to get out in transition and that has been the key to the game you know this might feel like a missed opportunity for Wake quad one road win you were leading by 12 in the second half but I dont think this was a demon Deacon collapse more so it was pit playing really well trying to close it out and they turned it over wake has life if they can convert here Salis going right at jeffris Frederickson fouled shooting three Carrington closed out on him and committed the foul the one thing you cant do turn it over and then fou a threepoint shooter in that situation again growing pains with this young backo but again this is just a poor close out and thats a foul again you hit him on his follow through clearly impacted the shot and again he will learn hes so talented uh one of the better freshman not just in the ACC but in college but thats a breakdown right there at the end of game Frederickson The Freshman B Forest an 80 foul shooting team on the season but the Freshman from Bigby OHA Oklahoma missed that one they really Rave about this uh the young guard Steve forb said hes one of the best Shooters hes recruited not saying a lot hes been around and had some really good Shooters makes two out of three cut this deficit to six for Wake Forest two possession Applause game the foul comes in off the ball Applause Music we just showed you how good wake has been foul shooting its been a problem for pit closing out games shooting foul shots reliably 68 288 in D1 heres jayen low the freshman at the line low and Conference uh play 72 from the free throw line hits the first that is huge to make this a threep possession game oh got them both so time not on Wake side trailing by eight they need points in a hurry they get it with Salis onehanded Jam Carrington fouled immediately and thats communication right there Jeff cable not happy with this team again no communication right here Henson is supposed to pick up breakdown and communication and thats just too quick again if youre pit you dont want to give up twos that quick you want to show some resistance without fouling and 281 seconds left in basketball thats an eternity again uh if youre pit right now Jeff cable talking to his team about defensive assignments again youre going to switch anything in particular with this lineup right here youll give up twos you just dont want to give up threes uncontested or twos that quick communication key right here for pit to close this game out Latt home for Carrington hes up to 21 points on the night how good is the pit back corpin this evening well they have found a really Dynamic back court credit Jeff capable and his staff they have found two really good freshman guards and they have been on display tonight Carrington putting up big numbers and the Bo and basketball IQ really has been good for both wake C to hurry Carr fouss it but a lot of time coming off the clock Carr leans into it and hits him from three fivepoint games 164 remaining Steve Forbes uses his final timeout well the problem with that play took way too much time to develop again if youre wake you got to get into a your offense better again right here almost the turnover and youll live with this if youre Jeff cable again great contest you just dont want to give up an open one without fouling but again way too much time went off on that possession tough shot though by Carr and now uh the question is can you get the ball inbounded and make free throws uh to close this game out if youre pit I think the key thing is you can get somebody running long uh if weight comes out face guarding they have no more timeouts uh you have to try to run somebody long see if you can either get a layup or run of some clock key thing is though get the ball in bounds and then try to close this game out with made free throws and Bob Carrington by the way the star freshman a careerhigh 22 points for pit after those made foul shots he and is Le 22 points a piece season highs for the dynamic duo a pit team that trailed by 12 in this second half and Leed has been huge for pit Off the Bench past three games off the bench hes been came into this one averaging 13 points a game four rebounds and two assists and tonight uh he was huge Off the Bench 22 points nine of 16 from the floor he hit scored at all three levels drives Threes And also the Music midrange lets see what Jeff cable Drew draw uh Drew up right here Carrington in the corner bumped by Monsanto so the Freshman will head back to the foul line to add to what is is already a career high just 18 years old he is so mature Beyond his years and thats the thing uh the coaching staff has talked about Ive been impressed with his midrange again his ability to come off high ball screens and raise up hes got great elevation and a high release point on his pullup jumper great size for a guard goes about 65 and Jeff Capel and sty are very happy with the future holds for this young man at the free throw line made them both he has been clutched down the stretch four made free throws in a row for the Freshman late the clock against them Sal is another quick two 10 seconds remaining risky pass wake has it they have to convert 5 seconds left Salis decides to put a floater up and misses and pit holds on for a critical Conference win
