man the notorious do says they share the sugar better than anyone in the league indeed they do and we are underway as Virginia wins the opening tip they are two and two in their last four games against Duke in this building but you talked about Obie this has been one of the better matchups John cire made it very clear his toughest games in his coaching career as an assistant as well as a head coach have been here in this building against Virginia Kofi up top here for bu Canon on the Baseline they kick inside they move the ball exceptionally well but missed the shot in close and Cooper flag comes away with a basketball hes averaging 20 points eight rebounds four assists per game and he just won his 10th ACC rookie of the week award that ties the record pretty soon theyre going to name that award after him it could absolutely happen especially when you consider that he could also be ACC player the year you see great defense by The Who coming in getting the strip the No No for the big man bringing the basketball down keep it high and get a bucket Kofi up top looking for a cutter Virginia in winning these last three theyre kind of getting back to the Tony Bennett principles a little bit better well when you think about Virginia in their 13 wins theyre only giving up 58 points per game but in their 12 losses has been 73 but this is what Virginia is doing better on the offensive end of the floor the exact same possession we had where Kofi missed the layup earlier this time Blake Buchanan finishes it strong with the two Hand flut late in the shot clock Whittle that down you know five or six seconds flag on the drive puts the shoulder down backs it in his first bucket and puts Duke on the board and thats where Cooper flag can absolutely have an advantage when you switch defensively in screen to roll action he can take advantage of smaller players inside the paint MCs been hot thats off to a hot start as he sinks a long one 22 points for him last time out at Virginia Tech where they were able to avenge a la sheld in the home floor and mcney much more aggressive as of late on the offensive end and Obie when youre shooting 42 for three you should be kiple whos been kind of chilly last couple of games he has not broken double figures hes going to drive it its off the iron grabs his own Miss and before the shot He will draw the foul the whos getting off to a great start on both ends of the floor the no no dont bring it down for the young small guys to be able to affect it Andrew roie with the steel and then mcne dropping it off for Blake Buchanan to drop the hammer mcne once again great footwork finding himself Beyond a threepoint AR knocking down his first attempt of the game cop to freshman with the foul canle at the line where he is outstanding at 89 El and copi will take a seat and Elijah Saunders is a 68 Junior out of Phoenix will come on the floor for Ron Sanchez when he is on he is a factor he had 22 against NC State 19 against Louisville and made his return against Virginia Tech in on the road but Virginia won the first two games without him in this three game streak and youve seen some of the young guys on the interior start to grow up without s Saunders at the foul line Roy willll get it back to him in the corner hell launch and bat with the Applause rebound James to the corner kiple will fire it up and swish it in and its almost a perfect close out by roie however not close enough you have to be in concal space to force him to not be able to get the basketball above his shoulders cuz once he does is a great chance its going to go down duuk is now made at least 1 three in 1251 consecutive games but Virginia off to a very quick start attacking the big man using his body to be able to Shield off the shop block and mod watch and get a Applause bucket cion James keeps on trucking to the paint he gets denied Cooper flag wants that lane that wont roll in battling for his own missed and Spins it up an in you know one of the commonalities in everyone talks about is how hard Cooper flag plays and OB thats been the case since he was in the eighth grade the first time I ever had a chance to spend time with Cooper and you see it on that possession hes the fastest to the second jump wow look at this Roy whos 41 from three he drills that to put the whos in front by one just like MCN in my opinion Ros another player that doesnt shoot enough once again youre shooting 41 for three you should be looking to let it go every opportunity you get oh thats a great pass and a great slam all watch Obie you realize the core strength that you have to have for seon James to be able to make that pass in midair most of us are not familiar with that I I know I dont have it you used to Im not sure if I had that much core strength iwi Now 50 dunks on the Year by the way Dukes opponents in total have 34 up to 35 today with Blake Ranon slamming the one home earlier however its still a huge Advantage malat versus opposition wow day day am who exploded for 27 against pit has four quick points and Ron Sanchez talked to us about data a earlier said listen Im done trying to change players I have to make them comfortable being who they are you see day day very comfortable being a scorer early crossing over Pro with the left hand what a beautiful move that is for two and quiets the crowd here OB in that Pittsburgh game that we did Virginia changed their defense a bit they went to a switching mantoman defense and it really threw Pittsburgh off Duke is prepared for that and when youre going to switch you got to have guys that can take advantage of the mismatch like we saw in tyres Brock with the last possession something Ron Sanchez was talking about earlier today a whistle here just the level of suffocating defense Duke is playing but Virginia really playing well and so is Cooper flag right away going in strong keeps on digging for his own Miss tell you what Virginia up to the challenge at least in these early minutes as roie goes Music downtown a big Virginia fan so shes rooting against Duke of course who is her rival and enemy but OB Virginias at Chapel Hill on Saturday indeed going to be a different scarf different scarf can bu Five Points early up to flag canle off the dribble trying to lean in and use that window wont drop the rebound TI right to him misses again but the stuff by Brown cleans it up so OB when you see Malik Brown do something expect a tremendous Ovation played high school basketball Blue Ridge right outside of Charlottesville but from Co pepper Virginia I asked the league pregame how many tickets do you have today he said I dont know and is that many he has zero idea and I asked the team earlier who was taking all the tickets everybody said Maliks got every ticket for the game right which section does Malik have here at the arena tight Roy a little bit too strong so Duke on top 1512 already five lead changes in this one thats a traveling violation and back over to the Cavaliers Malik Brown who just has magnets for hands the best hands maybe in the AC and that time you see him with the offensive rebound but just has a knack for the basketball 119 deflections on the Year OB and I believe he missed six or seven games right I mean still leads Duke in deflections and when you have teammates like a Cooper flag like a seion James and you still lead the team in deflections having missed that many that shows you just how magnetic the hands are from a basketball standpoint to Malik Brown and then spray knee returned against North Carolina really made do pole again didnt he he really did and the way that theyre able to defend the versatility on the defensive end of the floor is different when Malik is available Ro looking for screen great pass and flag with a deflection Virginia wanted goal tending flag with a terrific play gets rid of it here to Proctor so no Goen Proctor with a step back in the three and gets the shot tus proor stays confident OB we watched him make play plays like this at Clemson we saw him do it at Duke as he looks over to the to our table and just with a smile shakes his head hes feeling great about his game right now Duke on a 70 run Saunders trying to end that but too strong Applause inside kiple looking to make a move on Saunders will drive it again and the kick out r on Proctor Gillis with a shot clock goes down to 10 in the theft its three turnover turnovers already for the Duke Blue Devils and coming off a game against Stanford they turned it over what five times the entire day Virginia defensively will give you different pressure than youll see with Stanford is Robinson is unable to finish an opportunity right at the rim of those the ones you have to make against Duke because they turn him in the points on the other end fortunate parer wasnt able to get the bucket on that three yeah youre talking about Robinson the big freshman at 610 busted out for 157 rebounds and their big win against the hokes on Saturday on the drive all the way through Roy got the angle they had missed their last four shots rare to see anyone get all the way to the rim for an easy layup like that against Duke with Koopa flag and both Kam malawat who on the bench right now on the floor you have great Rim protection but flag out of the play unable to get over to Contest Applause out under 11 to go here in a quick moving first half Gillis back out kiple will Loft it and swish it in and Obie its a natural mistake but Anthony Robinson sees Mason Gill is backing down a smaller guard so he goes to help Gill is find canle Beyond The Arc and you have to stay disciplined and stay home with canle and cant allow him to get easy looks as such he has eight you kind of had the feeling tonight might be a big night for him you say you kind of had the feeling you actually had the feeling because you were the one who called it out and said I think kiple could have a big night today hes just such a good shooter he had 22 against North Carolina last two games hes been down but this is the largest lead for Duke trying to defend coopa flag has been an issue for the entire ACC this year Elijah SAS does a great job but then when you see Mason Gillis backing down he gives it up to K can nipple and on the other end of the floor when you see Malik Brown the recognize the basketball little bit in that second stands of this first half because Duke has found a way to start shooting the basketball even better and now shooting 615 from the field games with a fall away from threepoint land that wont drop and Duke comes away with it he 2114 lead and looking to add to that and they will coming off the bench Isaiah Evans at 42 expands that lead quickly to 10 transition defense is always important when you play against the Blue Devils but you have to match up with number three because Showtime slim is looking any chance he gets to find a way to get let one go from Beyond a threepoint R Duke four out of five beyond the line already ases stops at the line down to two to get off a shot had to hurry it up there caught a lot of iron and Off the Mark by Sharma so Virginia started five for seven theyre one for seven since then and thats been the issue for the whoos at times during the season theyve still gone through those scoring droughts and on the cut no basket and a foul before that the officials Rogers As Clarence Armstrong and Tony Henderson an outstanding crew tonight here at Virginia Malik Brown dealing with a shoe or something going on he goes over to the bench after he drops a nice dime off to Isaiah Evans but the foul is before the shot on Sharma yeah so Malik Brown was going over he was talking to Josh out there it is malage back in for John shy on the swing an open shooter something Duke does exceptionally well although Gillis couldnt cash it in also share the basketball so well continue to give up good shots to get a great shot thats a great shot from Gillis even though he doesnt get it to go down hes a guy that you want knocking down threes especially on the road is where he saved this team multiple times on the road but they didnt have him in that tremson loss try to take on canle lost the ball and Gillis scooped it up here James in transition killis again inside this time off the double fake grabs his own rebound kicks it out canle straight on ban battling for it it comes free into Corner Evans got it he knocks back a three and once again you continue to give the Blue Devils multiple opportunities and normally ends up with someone like Isaiah Evans knocking down a three ball a great look from Conan nipple he wasnt able to get it to go but give Evans a lot of credit for chasing down another opportunity and cashing it in and give Gillis A lot of credit too for digging so hard in that Applause paint so Virginia maybe in a danger zone on their home floor there big crowd is quieted RO off balance will draw the foul 66 Jr from Milwaukee will be headed to the line but Duke starting to to settle in that usually is not a good sign for the opponent on top 27 to 14 has been the story for the Blue Devils so far throughout this game A plus nine in Second Chance points 90 Advantage already six offensive rebounds and on this possession alone three different opportunities bason Gillis gets two rebounds and then of course Showtime slim shows up with the basketball beyond the threepoint Arc and you know he knows what to do when he catches it out there roie at the line to Junior at 82 hes been Virginias most improved player and his threepoint accuracy way up this year was at 26 last year 41 this year and playing more as a point guard this year his assisted turnover ratio is off the charts OB so really doing a lot of different things for Virginia this year as you mentioned probably their most improved player and giving Ron Sanchez consistent minutes Cooper flag back in looking to make a move shot clock down to six Gillis has trouble with it hits the deck gets it free shot clock at two follow watch with the rebound another offensive board for Duke theyre dominating there Evans and rattles in another three hes made a difference Off the Bench offensive rebounding once again you have zero chance to beat the Blue Devils if youre going to give them multiple opportunities on the offensive end of the floor Virginia did a great job defensively for for 30 seconds but didnt finish off the defensive possession ultimately very frustrating McNeely yes very quick release and they need a whole lot more that thats a tough shot you shootting that over a 72 mile watchat to break back at it Gillis with a misfire tapped up but out of play off of malawat 319 Duke Isaac mcney coming off the screen and no hesitation letting it fly over the outstretched hand of the shot Blocker in K milawat bringing back shades of Ky guy who is on the bench for the University of Virginia I can remember seeing kg take shots like that often and made a bunch of them Virginias best percentage threepoint shooter even though McNeely is on his heels man did he make big shots OB he practices of course hes on the scout team for Virginia and if they have a lefthanded point guard or lefthanded guard that scores he shoots lefthanded in practice and makes a lot of them by by the way but he was conon nipple this week near with another one this one a little too strong bat will clear it yeah he said if I were three in taller on a scout team today I would have been Cooper flag and then we said yeah if you were three in taller you wouldnt be here right now cuz you would probably been an NBA Allstar Weekend thats right flag on the attack lays it in not to be denied that left hand again weve talked about that of course you not had the opportunity to do a lot of Duke games just a couple and that left hand he is so comfortable going to the basket using that off hand and guiding it right into the rim with all those games I think Ive T Ive seen him take maybe one ill byby shot as thatll be backed in for two by Robinson hes going to the line and Cooper flag made the shot that might have been illin so not sure it counts as an Eli shot but this is a another area of showing off his touch the left hand Right Above the Rim and then the drop off the pocket pass which has always been a staple of Virginias off Anthony Robinson continuing to improve his hands struggle with catching the basketball when he first got here spends a lot of time working with Jason Willer who has helped develop The Bigs that have come throughout this program over the last 16 years Anthony Robinson continues to develop each and every day and is able to finish the threepoint play so cuts it back to 10 well this first half has been zipping along this is normally how Virginia games go they dont foul a lot and so Duke is meeting him with that theyre not putting Virginia on the line either so both these teams playing great offense and thats a another example of Malik Brown being a playmaker at the top of the key he saw that pass coming about 3 seconds before he even dropped it he watched seon James the entire time Duke is Good As It Gets in division one as far as looking for each other and finding finding the open man over and over Applause again Kofi for am and an official whistle here by Roger AES and he will stop the clock here with 516 to go in the half and an issue with a fan here I think oh wow and I believe hes ejected this gentleman yes he has uh Roger has H enough well he came all the way down and Roger tossed him out well I mean I and again if youre going to get tossed make sure you you earn it so to come all the way down the stairs and again Roger SS in my opinion the best of the best not only in the ACC but nationally his daughter actually graduated from University of Virginia so he couldnt do UVA games though give her a lot of credit she graduated in 3 years which is extremely difficult to do but so that Roger could get back on the court during UVA game OD jumping inside swatted away tough D there by Evans Duke with a couple of Big Blocks here in the first half James will penetrate Bank it in and hes off to the foul line looking for a threepoint Play Obie we talk about the big three for the Blue Devils the three guys that average in double figure scoring but they get so much production from other players seon James whose assist to turnover has been 6 to one over his last six games and now his ability to be able to attack the basket shows off that shrim getting to the rim laying it up an opportunity for a threepoint play Kofi with his second Applause foul James who played four years at tan he is one of Dukes true guards who stands 66 and if he doesnt move on to play basketball at the next level I believe would be awesome if he puts on the shoulder pads and the helmet hes got that physique he absolutely does and hes got the mentality as well looks like a linebacker Saunders on the back down out of the double heres Ro wide open Cashes in a triple but great play by Saunders to be able to recognize the help coming in be strong with the basketball and deliver a strike to the corner for RO to knock down to three you know Virginia has actually played at a very high level here in the first half and yet they down 37 to 25 and the issue is trying to stop du this end of the floor thats the problem and again its not as though really anyones been able to do it as Cooper goes that left hand once again but the Blue Devils are shooting 60 from the field and so as well as Virginias played on the offensive end its hard to beat a team when theyve scored 39 points already Virginia hasnt given up over 40 in the first half I believe this season and still almost 4 minutes left Duke is at 39 Saunders and a rebound by flag who has eight points the Freshman spinning inside to his right now I should have would shot the left hand he he hes 100 with the left hand right now in this game miss a couple shots going right to 15 for 26 canle getting ready to check back in now for John shy 320 to go Saunders from the corner left that well short Saunders a little winded right now remember hes just coming back getting back into game shape so having to deal with this Duke team on both ends of the floor can take a toll on Proctor midrange and Applause no as we mentioned many times over the last decade plus this game between Virginia and Duke would go a long way to determining who would win the ACC regular season title well these are the two teams that had the most wins in ACCC action and most championships during the Tony Bennett Coach K era but its a new day a new age as John Shire and Ron Sanchez take the Music h e e e e all right Applause Applause Music Applause Music absolutely coach Greenberg absolutely and when you consider this entire Duke team they all create opportunities for each other whether its passing the basketball its screening whatever you have to do and Coach you know very well when you have a team that all sacrifices every one of these guys is sacrificing some of their offense for the betterment of the team and thats why I believe they have a CH a great chance of being a national champion when its all said and done by the way Virginia has allowed 40 or more points in the first half only 10 times in the last 144 games du sitting there at 39 and I have to go back and revisit one team has scored 40 against Virginia in the first half it was at Stanford earlier this year when Virginia made the West Coast trip Stanford did score 40 in the first half the Blue Devils right now with 39 still with two and a half remaining tractor on the drive off the 10 those are the ones you want back T proor going to be so disappointed that he missed that point blank layup right at The Rim those the ones later when youre tossing and turning you see again in your sleep or when you of like 51 and you go back and you Google your career averages and field goal percentage Yeah those right there so youre saying you you really Let It Go easily right its just a figment of everyones imagination Ros had a good first half as he directs some traffic Proctor on him shot clock out of six mcne took a glance heres a long one rebound comes right to James Duke has missed their last four try to get heated up Applause again canle back in he was the hot hand early drive it inside and rolls in two and Conan nipple is much more than just a shooter he shows off his ability to be able to attack the basket but because you have to play him so close on the threepoint line often times he can get his shoulders past you and finish in the lane he said more points in the first half here tonight than he had in the entire last two games oh we might have an issue Malik Brown immediately grabbing at that shoulder we talked about how important he is to this team and Tony Henderson stopping play immediately once he sees Malik Brown clutching at that shoulder just reaching out we talked about how great hands he has no contact there but immediately grimacing now the man of John sh says is the ultimate Applause teammate he has had a difficult season with the Music injuries and well get you an update as soon as we can on his status tonight Applause heres Buchanan getting inside but cant finish that and Buchanan has to dunk that OB we saw him drop the hammer earlier in the game finishing strong in the paint that time really trying to avoid the contact you cant afford to give up those opportunities Virginias now giving up a number of those against the Blue Devils in this game follow trying to keep that alive but batted it right to roie and quickly on the other end going for the slam Saunders but could not do it there thats the way you attack the basket the second Mis dunp for Virginia throughout this game and of course the crowd here would love for that have been a foul call but this is the way you attack the rim you want it to go Applause down but thats the way you have to attack the r Elijah Sanders looking up at the replay upset about the fact that he missed that dunk and Im sure wanting a call and honestly Obie when you attack the B like that normally if you miss you get the benefit of Doubt and theres a call made take a look and he he goes up I dont really think theres much contact there to be completely honest he want he wanted that one a little too bad try to send it through with Force as he sees the reaction or sees the M attempt on the Jumbotron and thats another one of those that you want back Im sure is a little bit of hurt Pride there as the officials go to the monitor here Clarence Armstrong and Roger a this is a clock issue the reason for the official review yeah but back to that dunk attempt I didnt see anything that merited a foul did you no honestly you did there was not contact down low and malawat didnt get any of the basketball if he did he would have been able to affect the dunk attempt or the arm so I think its a good no call on that possession son is just upset that he had opportunity to finish it off and theyre looking at to see did the clock stop at the proper time and once the basketball touches out of bounds the play is dead so it should be well over 50 seconds remaining in the Music half so final moments of the first half Duke breaking away about seven or eight minutes ago and leads at 4126 going to put 511 up there and Duke basketball and they do have their largest lead of the first half here at Virginia but you look at the last two possessions where buchana didnt get the finish and then saers doesnt get the Finish those are two opportunities you had to cut into the lead flag going to after his own Miss will turn and fire and switches it out so John cire went NBA Style on that one OB they went two for one they went quickly to see if they could get a shot in the air and still be able to get the last shot with the shot clock of 30 seconds remaining but they able to build a 17point lead flag already with a double double Music well Duke on top 4326 they did lose Malik Brown a few minutes ago to this injury take another look and Malik Brown immediately grasping at that shoulder as soon as he gets a hand on the basketball no not much contact with anything there so hopefully well see Malik back in this game where he has opportunity to play in front of his friends and family close to home they left the court to go to the locker room for treatment so he hoped to have an update at Applause halftime Ro outside to Applause Buchanan nine to get off a shot Ames whos been pretty quiet toe to toe and right around Proctor but cant finish it rebound tapped High several times a battle for that AES from the corner will launch and BRS it huge momentum play for the hoos heading into the halftime locker room giving Duke a taste of its own medicone the offensive glass and it ends up being a big rebound game against Syracuse roie has 11 points to lead the way for Virgin irginia so often its that first five minutes or so of the second half when youre playing Duke Proctor off the fake kiple had a nice first half hell drive it keep on going for two and you have to honor him but once he lifts you off your feet in that pump fake now compromises your defense and no one there to help with kiple getting the easy layup in the paint give him 12 points along with three rebounds but Obie when you consider what kiple and Cooper flag are doing these are freshman in roow games true Road games in ACC play there are signs in the building talking about these guys and the way that theyve shown up and been productive already you mentioned Cooper with a double double in the first half and K nipple now with 12 points flag with a touch 10 points 11 rebounds already looking it that window again for two more both of those guys kiple and fle use the backboard so effectively and use both hands effectively when they get into the to the to the rim they have an opportunity to go with either hand around the basket to get a bucket 47 29 Points in the paint du huge domination there 26 to eight Virginia looking to quiet him down a bit flag on the outlet heres James back out for kiple for three we got a great look bwat with a big board working hard underneath that wont roll in kiple battling for the rebound a tie up there possession AR will take it to the other end rarely do you see anyone play harder than Virginia but look at the way the Blue Devils have gone after offensive rebounds and you look at the threes of charm we talked about how a careless turnover for Virginia Day Day Ames off balance out of bounds throws it away Isaac man not even looking at the basketball and again when youre playing against you know the number three team in the country OB who could very well beat the best team in the country you cant continue to have useless turnovers as such two coming in number three heres Proctor got it look at that look at what it turns into now you had down 20 when you had opportunity to cut into the lead a little bit but that unforced error and the turnover Ron Sanchez just beside himself years old but when you consider how they come to and not only the way they perform but the way they perform on the road thats a differentiator and part of the reason why this team has a chance to be successful in March the other thing is its as you pointed out from the jump from the opening tip theyre already locked in playing at that Elite level its not like they need six or seven minutes to warm up as Roy misfires and Robinson cant save it no they dont need time to warm up and more importantly theyre not always looking for theirs either theyre looking to make the right play for the team to be successful whether thats the pass or if thats going to the Lane and finishing with the left hand which weve seen both of them do throughout this game fortunately for Virginia Tyrese Proctor has a had the big performance like he 17 against Stanford on Saturday in the first half Duke is now led by 20 or more in 17 to their 26 games a whistle here with 1742 to go and the foul will go on Anthony Robinson the 610 freshman Applause and weve got Louisville and number 11 Duke coming you at Thursday at 700 pm on ESPN 2 what a huge victory for Yukon against Don Staley and South Carolina over the weekend a stunner given it was a complete blowout it absolutely was OB and I was actually in attendance to see my little big sis yesterday and you know the the the craziest part about all of it and and honest L Yukon was just a better team yesterday I mean theres no excuses to be made Dawn wont ever make excuses about it but the one of the classiest things Ive ever seen is after the game Dawn teams get her team gets blown out breaks their 71 game winning streak after the game she comes out makes the tour around the court for all the fans to take selfies and take pictures with them and again amazing to show that type of class and its such a defeat and showing her true character her players out there doing the same I thought that said a lot for Dawn Staley in her program and they were able to do that after a loss sure it does Gina orama has won a lot of big games a lot of big games recently of recent Yukon vintage that is right up there and I was there for game day as well and I listened to of course my sisters Andrea Carter and talk about has South Carolina taken the torch from Yukon and everyone kind of felt like they had Gino pae Beckers ha fud they felt differently about that and they made sure to let it be known yesterday really fudge hit 28 canle on the drive and that one denied Kopi got up there high for the block and stolen away by Cooper flag oh he went for the dunk oh right in his face Robinson and a great play by Robinson to deny that opportunity not allowing flag another highlight finish as weve seen throughout this season that looked like another one on the list but Robinson said no no no by of my house and I love the fact that Anthony Robinson didnt say oh thats Cooper flag let me get out of the way he meets him at the summit Anthony Robinson going up attacking that at the top of the top of both of their jump and a clean block there maybe that can get some momentum built in Virginias favor Day Day AES with a scoop backto turns into two points on the other end of the floor now this crowd which has always been one of the best in the ACC is back into this game give Anthony Robinson a tremendous amount of credit for coming up with a defensive Applause stop flag outside the three gives up the dribble gets it back heres the shot and that going drop and a whistle and thatll go against dke yeah thats going to be K malat who has some contact with bro as he got that rebound going out of bounds and now Virginia an opportunity to build some momentum Ron Sanchez who was clearly displeased with his team in the last huddle after the careless turnover has gotten a response all started by Anthony Robinson coming up that huge block against Cooper flag now one of the top defensive plays of the season in the ACC although its still Applause 5133 Day Day Ames trying to get rolling off Target there and knocked out of play by the Duke Blue Devils 15 59 to go here at Virginia some juice in the building right now and this is what started at Anthony Robinson meeting Cooper flag at the summit denying the opportunity and doing it on defensive end the floor but of course Carlos Boozer national champion for the Blue Devils in the building today and the lineage is strong his two sons Cameron and Kaden will both be Blue Devils next season not one but two yes a big man and a point guard not bad not bad at all flag up and it down stairs and the slang by gunba Patrick gunba from the state of Virginia family in attendance he was part of the group that did not get many tickets only six tickets for Pat because Malik Brown who fortunately is back on the bench but unfortunately for the Blue Devils in a sling took the majority of the tickets for this one but Y GBA got quality minutes when Malik Brown was out for the four game absence and has gained some experience kiple hit the deck there on the loose ball heres Proctor kiple gets back into the play and six it a threepointer and part of the problem when kiple goes down in the back court you dont account for him getting back defensively you want to get your defense back but someone has to know that probably the most lethal shooter on the floor is at the top of the key trailing to play and knock down a three to stretch the lead out to 23 Kofi gets a look from three got a really good look and it wont drop great job by gunga boxing out Anthony Robinson who right now you can see as a red shirt freshman has an advantage over gunga from a strength standpoint but Patrick gumba gives Duke a lot of punch on the offensive end of the floor yeah Duke punching back after that flurry great ball mve movement and count that one that will be interference and 5833 with 14 minutes to go Cooper flag attacking the basket dropping it off using the left hand once again to gangba who gets to slam and on the last possession and Cooper telling Pat Im going to throw it up next time but on the last possession we saw K alwat bring the ball down earlier Patrick gumba keeps it high gets on the glass quickly and ends up getting the goal tending call yeah good idea 611 backed in by roie by the way Cooper flag 14 rebounds and that is a career high but look now Obie playing point forward at the NBA level he most likely will be a small forward similar to The Duke greats that have come through the program and played the four similar to Jason Tatum Jabari Parker Brandon Ingram the list goes on and on for guys who have played in that position for the Blue Devils and gone one to be Stars at the next level flag with a shot clock at four gives it up swung in another corner kipple and a little too strong over the top Saunders that one interrupted Duke got back really well defensively to break it up yeah how about the play Baka nipple not allowing the lob to go through continuing to pursue as coopa flag just bullies Andrew roie to the basket uses those wide shoulders to be able to get the bucket his mom Kelly dad Ralph and his granddad in the building to support Cooper on the road all the way from beautiful Newport M off the fake McNeal Dukes done a really good job on him he came in a hot hand at 22 Saturday against the hokes roie again gives it up heres Buchanan Buchanan will Spin and two strong on and flag will take his time to bring it up 6035 Duke John shy will go to his bench here in a moment yeah Cooper flag a little winded right now hell get a break as Mason Gillis Caleb fer both at the scores table will get an opportunity to come in and see if they can help the Blue Devils build on this league of course thats always the job when you come off the bench you never want to go out of the game with the with the lead less than what it was when you came in back down to the big and unable to get that off in time a shot clock violation so Duke with the turnover Cooper flag attacking the basket and just lowering the left the right shoulder and finishing strong and there goes mom Kelly who was a great player herself and I say great player John shy says she was only a good player it started a war between the two of them that I didnt want to get involved in but Ive given Kelly great great player at University of Maine but you did kind of start it I did start it yeah 1153 to go here in the second half and weve got a break in the action Duke has it rolling again they leaded 60 they got another one Z you got the force going so kudos to Dicky V by the way what what a great job Duke did at Cameron indor in celebrating Dickys return last Saturday we had such a wonderful time he was deeply deeply touched got a chance to ring the bell as a cancer survivor many time cancer survivor the toughest guy I know and and not only to be able to ring the bell but to be able to do it with his granddaughter yes granddaughter of course plays tennis at Duke grandson as well has three grandchildren at Duke its a great tennis family yeah but when you consider to be able to do that in front of all of your family being there with you even more impressive that the Blue Devils were able to pull that off swished in by by Evans at 42 The Freshman beyond that threepoint line and he has 12 points in this one yeah hes four for four from Beyond a threepoint Arc similar to what he did against Auburn where he made six threes in the first half and which of course was a huge win for the blue Dev was their best win of the Season th far Day Day AES to the other side of the iron and a foul as well and the sophomore from Chicago to shoot looking for a threepoint play and D Ames had a little conversation with some guys walking out of that Roger a just know we dont need it right now calm down keep playing basketball like the way Roger works too because its not over the top he can go and talk to a guy its a couple of quick lines gets it done such a veteran official thats the kicker when you when you play at this level the relationships between the players and the officials is huge thats where you get the benefit of the doubt of getting that call thats when they know you have three fouls or four fouls late and they dont give you that foul later but again for young play players build those relationships with the officials it will help you in the long Applause run Proctor on the drive and gave it up denied Stout defense by Virginia on that possession but still down 63 40 mcne to Junior tried to wrap around pass and gangba will knock it out of play and this Saturday mens basketball weve got a triple header on acc Network Georgia Tech and they can really really be a dangerous team taking on BC to start the day followed by Chase Hunter and number 18 Clemson in Dallas taking onu followed by Virginia Tech and Miami to cap it off you talk about Georgia Tech being dangerous theyve beaten the second and third best teams in the ACCC and Clemson and Louisville and beat them back to back before coming here on Tony Ben day which was announced February the 8th in the state of Virginia will be Tony Bennett day Georgia Tech came in and lost to the who canle Takes a Tumble got it out of there somehow heres Foster and he grabs another Rebound kiple with another board they have been a monster on the glass and hell draw the foul offensive rebounding once again has been a strength of the Blue Devils throughout this game 10 offensive boards as we got a Wisconsin guy watching a Wisconsin guy well actually this Wisconsin guys on his phone right now however he and Khan canle both from the state of Wisconsin KH kipples mother Sherry played at Wisconsin Green Bay the same place as Tony Bennett both of their jerseys hang in the Raptor shes the alltime leading score for the for the womens program and then of course Tony one of the best to ever do it if not the best to ever do it at Wisconsin Green Bay who played for his father as did Sherrys older brother played with Tony Bennett and Conan nipples uncles formed a playing group not music but basketball the flying kles a popular three on three tournament team here Saunders launching and knocks back at three Virginia now up to seven threepoint field goals made shot it very well 438 the problem is they have not been able to get stops against this Duke team and Virginia shouldnt feel bad about that because no one has been able to do it this season as duke is the only team in the NCAA that scores over 80 is so time slim knocks down his fifth threepoint field goal of the game five of five from Beyond The Arc but freshman can flat shoot it and adds another dangerous weapon for the Blue Devil Saunders trying to answer K canle nice save there on the Baseline hes had a particularly good game he really has and again does a lot of the small stuff that things dont you dont always show up in the stat sheet but Gillis will become even more important for this team without Malik Brown but finishing my point OB Duke is the only team in division one that averages over 80 points per game and gives up less than 61 points per game their scoring margin is over 20 which leads division one DayDay Ames will give it up Buchanan 840 to go here at Virginia into the corner roie had a good clean look Duke will let that one roll on out and theyll have the basketball Duke by the way hitting nine threes in this one low turnovers low fouls another one of those nights for the Duke Blue Devils yeah and again when youre shooting the basketball at a 52 clip for the game nine of 19 from Beyond the threepoint guard you know is not much that you havent been able to do I mean that you have done wrong in this game throwing the fact that theyre perfect seven of seven from the free throw line its been an offensive clinic for the blue Applause doubl coming off of offensive Clinic when they scored 106 on Saturday kiple hes got Roy on him Applause down on that Baseline nice pass and the stuff by James but how about the cut from cion James where of course you expect for offensive players to stay and space the floor in the corner but with the head turn of the defender seon James decides to cut to the basket gets the easy dump simply because of ball movement player movement doesnt wait around for the ball to be delivered he makes a play moving without the Rock in his hands points in the paint Duke 34 Virginia 14 Blue Devils have dominated on the glass in a huge way as well mcnealy Airborne very difficult angle gets it back and a second opportunity T Murray into the game with a kick out nearly interrupted by canle and now reach out a foul hell get seon James for that personal delivering the basketball at its finest and the cut from seon James allows him to get the easy bucket as the Blue Devils e Music Kim thank you very much got an AllStar team in that studio toight absolutely I mean again once again we are very proud of our little little sister Andrea Carter who started out with us OB she was here with us big Monday we dont have a sideline reporter tonight because Dre is in studio she left us well she retired to Trophy she absolutely did she absolutely did just do spectacular work Seth and Kev as well always a pleasure to have them with us on big Monday buy bottled up and a timeout with 714 to go couldnt get out of there and well be back in 30 all Duke again stop me if you athletic director in ACC history so Virginia at the Forefront of diversity equity and inclusion and a proud as a proud of Lum I have to give a shout out to car Williams recently signing a contract extension here for the great work that shes done at the University of Virginia yeah what a great school it is absolutely gorgeous campus so OB this is what I I got to correct you on that one all right not a campus right ah see I think we have the most beautiful grounds grounds yes and you dont have freshman sophomores you have first year second year right thats athletically its okay to be freshman sophomore but when youre on grounds it is first year second year third year fourth year and now super 50 year I guess thats what its called Im not really sure all right well they do things a little differently in Virginia it seems to work exceptionally well one of the great schools in the country yeah hanging out with Tony Bennett of course the two of them often sit in the suite watching games as Tony Bennett comes to watch his son Eli who is a member of the University of Virginia mens basketball team started his career at University of North Carina Charlotte playing for Ron Sanchez so made the move when coach Sanchez came back from Charlotte Eli came back home with him Ames with another one coming 84 at the line he is 13 and Proctor across midcourt Cooper flag with a double double canipa 17 points flag will back it out the crossover making a move hell draw the foul by Kofi but its such a smart Play Because as Cooper flag tries to back down Kofi he recognizes this guys stronger than me so he immediately Retreat dribbles brings it back out being that hes stronger than me he cant guard me off the bounce so a quick cross over boom and all of a sudden cger founds himself at the free throw line because he recognized where his Advantage was against Jacob kop and as mentioned just won his 10th ACC rookie of the week award uhoh bacon on the line and I can tell you right now there would be nothing better for these fans than to get bacon off of Cooper flag Miss free throws and he makes sure theyre not getting bacon yet and there will be no bacon for you he has 17 along with 14 rebounds his seventh double double get it down low Robinson and he knows exactly what to do with it The Freshman from Peach Tree City Georgia and thats the way you have to finish around the basket missed a layup early in the game where he should have dunked it this time understanding the assignment goes and finishes with two Applause hands Cooper flag again here it comes and left it short and Robinson whos really starting to come into his own at this point in the season with the rebound he really is and got a lot of experience with theah th out as McNeely knocks down another three ball Virginia trying to make a run still trailing by 21 but not waving the White Flag as of yet Cooper Flag by the way over for three from threepoint land K will slam it on the brakes Evans trying to tiptoe his way backed it up there wave that off because the foul came before that Music and 505 remaining here at Virginia and 7352 well we got Arizona and Baylor coming your way tonight following this game on ESPN Baylor has a young man that many will see here his name called after Cooper flag in the 2025 NBA draft by the name of VJ Edgecomb and VJ and Cooper were teammates OB we were in St Louis for the first Jason Tatum Elite camp and I had Cooper flag AJ deona Tyron Stokes BJ edgeone cam Scott and Darion Reed whos at Alabama and of course they had a substitute that group beat Jason Tatum Bradley Bill Pao B Caro jet Howard and cam Whitmore M and so not only did they beat him once they had to wait until the end to play him again and beat him a second time and thats truly where Cooper flag name became National once the story started to fly around about what they had done to All Stars not just Pros but to All Stars people were going have you seen the kid by the way have you seen what this kid can do this kid from Newport Maine he double down on it when he went to USA basketball trials in July and was one of the better players out there K is going to be whistled for a travel and a turnover with four minutes to go and only there six to the game and again the Blue Devils havent done much wrong especially on the offensive end throughout this game as they get an opportunity to get another one of the Virginia guys Darren Harris checking into the game alongside Patrick gumber Darren only had four tickets we took a tally to see who had all the tickets today OB but Darren of course a stand out Ames with a Miss Harris going up with the rebound and it will be Duke basketball so 353 to go duke on their way to a 23rd victory of get down the home stretch of continuing to put a grasp on the ACC Championship home stretch brought to you by All State under four to play here now only five teams five opponents have scored 70 or more in this arena in the last 68 games pit Louisville Notre Dame Virginia Tech and now Duke up to 75 in counting Cooper flag with 17 points and 14 rebounds KH kiple with 17 points hes mentioned Evans with 15 and a big performance here tonight and a foul by Virginia our All State game check in look at a rebounding not an advantage its a blowout 3918 for Duke and thats really where it started for Duke on the offensive glass they had a 90 Advantage early in this game and second chance points attacking the offensive rebounding and getting multiple possessions Virginia never could keep them off the offensive glass and thats where the Blue Devils were able to have separation in this game MD junor makes it 7556 and give Isaac 14 Applause points Foster to bring it across he got some minutes in the Standford game on Saturday and shot the ball really well hell draw the foul yeah and scored in double figures for the first time in a very long time and now opport need to get into the scorebook here attacking off the bouns and John Shire continuing to try to find ways to get Caleb Foster back into this lineup because I believe theyre going to need him down the stretch of course you can never have too many guards but with any team and we see it with Malik Brown youre only an injury away from becoming a mediocre team Virginia was the number one team in the country OB the number one overall seed lost Deandre Hunter going into the NCAA tournament and end up losing the first time a number 16 seed beats a number one seed in NCAA tournament so but that DeAndre Hunter injury was huge for Virginia and you got to have you got to have guys that can replace players on the floor especially when theyre at Port if youre just tuning in Malik Brown injured his shoulder earlier tonight and went to the locker room he came back out you may not have able to tell but hes wearing a sling and well have more on that on ESPN after the game Im sure more on the injury OB be TJ power on the floor for Virginia who was just matched up against Caleb Foster they were in the same recruiting class with the Duke glev was a season ago so as as TJ power whos really not been able to get back into the lineup started the first five games or so for Virginia this year but really hasnt been productive and theyve moved on and been playing much better without him in the rotation trying to find his way back in at 69ine sophomore from Massachusetts look at that sling there on Malik such a superb Defender that will be the Dark Cloud over a great game for the Blue Devils on the road here today but with the uncertainty as to the availability of Malik Brown moving forward is huge for John Shire and his staff knowing how important Malik is to this team both offensively and more importantly defensively and the versatility that he provides were not going to speculate beyond what we already know is that its a shoulder injury thats all were being told as Sharma goes to the line and drills the first one isan Sharma The Freshman from Canada isan charma out the Cory Alexander School of basketball very confident young man OB I tell him every time I see him never let him take your confidence my man he comes in ready to fire as soon as he stops steps on the court shooters shoot Shooters got to shoot 7858 as we approach the twominute Mark and another outstanding performance all the way around for the number three team in the country heres Foster got it up there off the back iron Saunders with the rebound Mason Gillis turning that ankle liming back down the floor and again after already losing Malik Brown we saw them play without Mason Gillis as well hes going to play through it but Im sure John Shire doesnt like seeing Gillis limping around such a steadying presence and a foul here with a minute 42 to Applause go Mason Gillis trying to walk it off but watched him turn his ankle going in for an offensive rebound and a double bonus here Saunders to shoot two and will drop in number one good foul shooter 82 and when hes been on a real Factor 22 against Cy State 19 against Louisville but he was also one for eight against Cal and two for eight against Virginia Tech was playing his best basketball before the injury and then a missed about four games where Virginia was able to win three of those games and when you look at how they were able to be successful its often difficult when you come back to go right back to the way things work Anthony Robinsons grown up during the stretch while Saunders has been out and deserves minutes on the floor Foster that one clangs away and rebounded by Sharma so approaching the last Applause minute power trying to take the Baseline power formerly a pitcher a lefthander yeah he actually is a lefty throws in the high 80s and played a little baseball went out with with the Blue Devils a season ago no longer does Nifty move there by Evans to lay it in hes really had a fine night he has but the best part about it is you see him run back by the bench and you see everyone on the bench excited about the production but Obi Isaiah Evans is a McDonalds allam often times you find find a guy thats that highly rated coming out of high school playing in what could be considered garbage time having an issue with it but not him hes looking to still get Buckets and build on to his resume during his time with the blue double well under Tony Bennett thats 500 games at Virginia only allowing teams to score 80 or more points 12 times the Cavaliers and this year five times including Duke here tonight on this floor got so not the same product not the same product also is we get a chance to see Isaiah Evans run by the bench all of his teammates encouraging him but Ron Sanchez is dealing with a different group when you consider that this Virginia team is extremely young no grad transfers and everyone outside of tame Murray whos been here for 4 years everyone is a junior or below so you consider the fact that this is a very young inexperienced team the transfers coming in didnt play huge minutes in their previous spots so a lot of first times for this Virginia team as Ron Sanchez tries to navigate them throughout this season no Im not alone in saying this in this building certainly but I miss the recent history and the long history of this being such a big game Duke and Virginia here in this Arena like maybe the ACC coming right down to this contest I dont think youre alone in this building for missing that thats for sure well Duke rolls again 8 62 the final score tonight weve got Arizona and Baylor coming to your way now
