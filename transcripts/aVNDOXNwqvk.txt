against Duke four years ago and here we go the cards in the home whites control the tip Duke in the road blues and you just look right off the bat depth Dukes depth or ability to defend could really wear out Louisville who is depleted in so many ways going with their fifth different starting lineup tonight and have really been playing a rotation of seven players since the injury to case in Prior late in the shot clock and Hadley Scoops it to the hoop for two meanwhile this Duke team led by three Superstar freshman the only team in the ACC so far this year to start three true freshman and I think the Duke team if youre thinking about comparisons I I kind of compare them to Kentucky Anthony Davis team where they were incredibly young and talented but they were unselfish and thats what made him so good Ty ree Proctor is having an exceptional start to the year his shooting is a big part of that hes been remarkable I think hes got to be that guy that just knocks down open shots creat space on the floor because the weapons on the floor need space and theres a foul on the floor I believe its going to go against Cooper Music Applause flag who head coach John shy referenced the toughness yeah of Cooper flag in that win against Auburn but frankly the teams toughness John is what stood out to him in that win against number two yeah I I agree its the collective toughness thats also unifying when youre able to pull one out especially in front of your own crowd which was a terrific crowd for a nonconference game but it was one of the best basketball games youre probably going to see all year Dukes already played four games against top 25 teams coming into the day Louisville still receiving votes as heern tries to three and puts it Applause Music in good patience to start thats what youve got to do to feel out this duude defense you dont want to rush you dont want to attack too much good patience good ball movement everybodys gotten involved theyre sharing it theyre reading what the defense is is giving you KH canle cannot answer he bur this teams leading score and has done a little bit of everything this year for Louisville particularly with the shortened lineup due to all the injuries and thats a travel on Javon Hadley and this is not a knock on Wisconsin in any way Wisconsin is is it one of the most successful programs in college basketball over the last 20 years for a reason but Chucky heberg comes here and has more freedom but also more responsibility the responsibility to be a playmaker I think there are some guys especially the experienced guys that they actually step up a little bit more when given more responsibility Chucky heers been one of those guys also has great Applause hair the best in college basketball heres Proctor and malok with the rebound and now some chippiness with Noah Waterman after the whistle and the fans love it at the Yum Center its like the funny one to celebrate the whistle was blown like 5 Seconds prior but we get all feisty and I think part of that is I have to think its partially the Duke effect right like fan bases get excited when you fight back against a Duke and thats part of the hope that I think this fan base is looking for under pack Kelce good start here comes rain Smith one of two College of Charleston transfers to come over with the head coach Pat Kelce in his first year at Louisville Applause did Pat Kelce stop moving at shoot around he did not he did not neither has his point guard to start the game heper off the mark and the tap back is good for James Scott yeah really good start for Louisville they they just have to maintain this this level of attack but also the level of patience discipline on the defensive end theyve been there to get rebounds thats going to be key throughout yeah James and strips and here comes heurn with numbers Smith a three 80 Run for the home team Louisville Cardinals thanks to this three by rain Smith rarely this early do you get a broadcaster layout you know the layout is when something big happens the place erupts and we as bro kers want you watching to feel what were feeling so I shut up there for a while that doesnt happen this early in the game for John Chris rarely happens ever but no its been its a great start and like if youre Louisville you want to build on things you want to build on excitement you want to build on the feel that youre creating in the arena but you also want to sustain it you have to maintain focus on whats giving you the advantage here and its been discipline on the defensive end not in not taking too many chances being in position to rebound making everything difficult not impossible for Duke Proctor a three well contested and Duke scoring drought now nearing three minutes a contested rebound coughs it up flag tips it to his man Malik Brown who is tripped by James Music Scott well you reference it Kelce has come in and in just eight games infused a fan base thats so hungry for a winning program with hope I I look I I got to be honest like its not just a winning program they they they want the hope but they dont want this program to be a circus and thats no disrespect if anything Im Im giving the program respect this is one of the best programs in college basketball history and its good to see Pat Kelce come in here really stabilize and then in in inject hope into this fan base under 10 to shoot and that stops a threeminute scoring drought on the made three by Caleb Foster right back the other way rofs the Freshman is fouled hot start for the Cardinals yeah great energy to start this one Ive really been impressed with the defense but getting out and running playing offense with confidence Music this is what coach is looking for this is what hes saying this is what matters its its almost this social continuity I dont know if thats a thing but sure why not sure make up words conney ruths at the foul line for Louisville the lone freshman on the roster for a team that came into the year feeling very old very experienced quickly that has been diminished a little bit four guys out for the year with injury its hard like you know Matt painer always said get old stay old uh thats hard to do nearly impossible these days you want to have an experienced group but you also need to get time on the floor together I mean understanding how to play is key but understanding how to play together and learning the Dynamics its important flag first touch in the paint pays It Off hes got a really cool demeer and hes one of the most competitive guys youre going to come across but but he doesnt yell and scream about it Kai ruges was fouled on the drive most recent notable injury yep K prior who had been playing really well was a key piece to the early success in the words of his head coach Pat Kelce they are excited that abubacar trior is going to come back at some point end of this month early next month at the latest but boy they have been put through the ringer injurywise yeah I mean obviously theres the obvious on the surface which is case and Pryor makes you better at more competitive particularly in this matchup but on the other side not having bodies to be competitive in practice while youre building a program I think thats one of the bigger challenges for Pat Kelson deep three from Foster and theres a foul on the floor its going to stay here against Javon Hadley and that is the second on the Colorado transfer probably a foul on the grab Im usually good when I see it in slowmo a second third time but Ive got to say the position rebounding wise has been very good which means youre not over rotating youre not chasing the play louville has been disciplined on the defensive end so when a shot goes up theyre there in position to rebound flag coming off that double double in the win against Auburn quiet to start just one shot Proctor fade away that was silky by the third year for the Duke Blue devis yeah that thats one you can live with thats good defense just a tough shot made urn step back three yes sir Music Applause flag thinking about it really tough shot and the rebound roots and thats going to be a foul on Waterman and completely unnecessary I dont I dont know I think Cooper flag really kind of walked him into that one but thought Waterman missed Chucky heurn he was a half second lat on the pass but Chucky heurn was able to create the space and you know theyre theyre battling you dont see all of it thats like taking a half of a sentence with no context and thinking that it means something so you didnt agree with the call no I mean look I think a I would like the blow the whistle and be like yo both of you clean it up I like that one its the cop that pulls you over and gives you a warning and thats a travel forced by by Chucky heer so the extra possession for Duke does not lead to any points and thats what thats what Watermans talking to Pat Driscoll about right now hes saying yo its its both ways he kind of ran in front of me as Im trying to go so I kind of I do I I like the warning Im sure the the head of officials doesnt like the warning but I do that fits with your M Mo it does going against the grain a little bit thats a three for Rose R confidence is compounding you can see it confident group for louville largest lead of the night is quickly cut into on the floater by Foster stopping a 60 Louisville run and for a team that has struggled so much to shoot the three John they have already hit some big ones four a five in the first half but theyve gotten good looks its just a matter of of keep shooting them and shoot them with confidence five to shoot heer Music Applause Waterman fans thought that should have been a double dribble flag Off the Mark rapid Pace to start this game in Louisville and that touched the line its going back to the Blue Devils yeah I I think lilles got to be careful with the pace they dont have the numbers of the bodies to get up and the up and down the floor and really defend the way they need to defend against this Duke team for 40 minutes cuz Dukes going to go to the bench and theres no letup if anything you have to adjust to the different Personnel you have to adjust to the different Tendencies of that Personnel thats on the floor there are actions that lilles prepared for But ultimately you have to understand the different counters that different guys are going to get to within the different actions hes different too much though I bet Im not counting to your point though Dukes already played nine players in this game Mason Gillis on the floor for the first time the Purdue transfer heres Isaiah Evans off the bounce and malawat to Second Applause Chance Foster from Music three the rebounding positions been terrific and thats something they have have to continue to be good on the defensive glass Terrence Edwards from Applause downtown take as many of those as you can get Applause Music Applause and its going back to Duke but hot shooting for the cards five of seven from downtown and they lead it 2112 the way you want to play that that helps you in terms of recruiting we are going to commit to shooting threes miss or make were going to space the floor some might say live by the three die by the three play as if you are who youre going to be thats the way I see it bille right now getting good looks theyre knocking them down theyve gotten to get their defense set when they get their defense set theyre not chasing the play theyre getting defensive rebounds ton of confidence on the floor for Louisville right now best first half so far from three for Louisville this season and Pat Kelce was asked about the threepoint shooting coming off the loss against Old Miss and he said look I feel like eventually water will hit its Mark weve got a lot of good individual threepoint Shooters on the this team at their previous schools eventually itll iron itself out as guys learn how to play with one another as they establish I refer to them as playground Dynamics you grow up and play with the dudes in your neighborhood you figure out each other you make more shots when you know each other the rhythm is consistent they will develop a consistent Rhythm and they will make more shots and then you recruit to how you play meanwhile Duke oh for their last four on this side of the floor I say it all the time how you play as your best recruiter nowadays cion James could not get the layup in and now here comes Edwards Edwards game is like that like he could be wild at times but he could be really effective and sometimes the wild part of him makes him dangerous sometimes to yourselves but thats okay you live with it I actually cover up a JMU last year rign again from the top of the key yeah Id say theyre committed to it the lob the malat and the hammer from the big fella how about that for a response there were some Louisville fans here by us that gave the goo he face on that one that that was spectacular and this is not a great offensive lineup for Duke Hadley rolling to the basket wide open Edwards CES in from downtown really good recognition from Hadley there he he had all the defense in the paint someones got to be open he had the patience and boys to find them James rebound heer Applause numbers you thought something was happening there didnt you thought he was going to let it go stood up heers thinking about it nope Way Off the Mark over the 72 Applause malawat like Dukes got to have to operate to score with this group three Subs waiting to come on and another turnover Here Comes rain Smith Edwards off the bounce and is rejected but a foul first we weve been up and down and you got to credit Louisville for getting up and down with Duke but Duke with this lineup and youve got some stars coming in they had to operate in the half court to be able to score and on the other end Again Louisville do it such a good job recognition sharing the basketball maintaining good spacing theyre playing really connected basketball right now on both sides of the floor hence the Applause lead Here Comes Cooper flag gives it up to kiple through contact puts it in just their second made bucket on the last eight trips down the floor for the Blue Devils well part of it is theyve been playing against the set defense and its a different game up and down the way the Auburn game was played it was a Playmakers game wow wow the reigning Sun Belt player of the year is having himself a first half in Louisville let go flag Up and Under its a really tough finish I mean to go up there hang body control presence of M to kind of sneak through the defense and finish there at the front of the rim he makes big time plays look really easy maybe thats why so many people have him as their number one overall pick theres some guys out there theyre good oh he will certainly not be without competition as this season moves along as flag gives it up to Gillis and thats a three for the Purdue transfer playing in his 140th Collegiate game this afternoon backto back lineup a Playmakers lineup I tend to refer to these groups as the death squad right they dont have a big on the floor theyre going to space you out youre going to switch a lot more and theyll be able to find the right matchup interesting to see if this lineup a smaller lineup for Duke if you could even call it that goodness gracious for the tallest team in the country according to kmom and everyone has a wingspan like twice their height when did that happen they average 67 on this team heres Ruth trying to go over the top of tyres Proctor and its a foul on the Junior from Sydney Australia I think the key is if youre Pat Kelsey its always be on the attack you know both sides of the ball you have to maintain that mindset of we are going to attack were not going to let Duke just attack us were going to be on the attack on both sides of the ball theyve certainly been there on on the offensive Music side well next Sunday afternoons ACC Network womens basketball triple header features Miami and pit starting us off at noon and number 16 North Carolina hosting Georgia Tech and we finish it off with Clemson taking on Wake Forest at 400 pm Eastern all on the ACC Network and the ESPN app 10point lead for Louisville less than 8 to go in the opening half looking for their first top 10 win since 2020 against Duke canle draws a foul and it will go against the College of Charleston transfer James Scott I feel like its unfair to say that kiple is a heady player and he and he has a high basketball IQ because that almost it almost establishes a limitation the reality is the dude just knows how to play we talked about him at shooter around having great footwork why is he so good and Kyle said his Sid said look footwork footwork is one of them and played with older guys growing up and he probably wasnt the quickest guy on the floor so you learn how to be efficient he plays very efficiently gets where he wants without having to be faster than anybody else one of six freshman on this Duke roster but you said something interesting today at shootter around you said when you watch him play yeah something interesting by John Chrisman you feel like he plays like a junior yeah oh like the game is slower for him he doesnt have to play at at an incredibly Fast Pace he doesnt have to run as fast and it be as explosive as everybody else to get where he wants to go I actually said something else I dont know if itd be offensive or not though hes running free tipped by Hadley and now Proctor resets with 20 on the shot clock Proctor sizing up the Freshman gives it to flag those were the finishes he was making with regularity against Auburn thats such a tough cover cuz he just catches and goes and he also gets really low on the drive which is rare for a guy 610 Music Hadley had it J loose heern right plays right time T to shoot Smith contested way off Waterman with five got to get it up Bru will not thats rejected by Malik Brown but first the shot clock violation on a Helter Skelter possession for the cards there are times where you wish you got a better shot up but its almost better that its a shot clock violation than a turnover or a careless mistake where Dukes running out now youre able to get your defense set see the basketball and Louisvilles had success on the defensive end Duke has been the best defense in the country according to Ken pound so far this season I think a big part of that is their length and the ability to defend the three and its funny considering how good nos been from three today flag just staying with it finds kiple and the three ball has not been there for Duke now just three of 13 heern draws a foul on Mason Gillis and two shots coming for the Wisconsin transfer those are two guys those are two guys that have played a lot of basketball against one another just did a different conference and its funny to think of Mason Gillis like he comes from a Purdue program that arguably has been more successful ful over the last four years the Duke produ spit at the tops year in year out a very consistent program and Mason Gillis doesnt need to be a St Saturday ACC Network mens basketball double header old rivals Syracuse Georgetown they square off for the 100th time and then Florida State takes on two lane in the second game of the Auto Nation orange bull classic in Sunrise Georgetown is much much improved I just had them Friday night at against West Virginia good West Virginia team that lville beat but Georgetown will figure it out under Ed they will be a much much better program its a matter of time here too under a little bit more Firepower in DC on that roster canle off the back iron Terrence Edwards pushing for now Edwards against flag and the scoop shot is good Edwards in double fingers with 11 Foster back the other way and he draws contact and two shots and Edwards at times looks a little unorthodox like you know is he out of control maybe I dont know but thats kind of his game I saw it in him last year he was a really tough cover because he made broken plays look brilliant led the Dukes to the NCA tournament in his first season as an every game starter last Music year and that is a theme with Louisville they brought over 11 guys in the transfer portal that participated in the NCAA tournament last year Edwards being one of those well when you get winners its not that they have won its that they understand what it takes to win and thats what you need when youre building a program again success is merely the byproduct of doing a lot of little things right for the right reasons winners understand what thats all about you surprised to see this score with 455 to go the first half yes Im not going to lie about that L about something else but Edwards has been a key piece at its strength by Brown the ninth Louisville turnover open three for foster and he pays It Off from Deep every turnover every turnover turns into points for Duke and thats something youve got to look at if youre Louisville say we we just have to take care of the basketball be efficient offensively get our defense set this score would be a whole lot different if you cut those turnovers in half cut those turnover I mean Im thinking of Im thinking of eight points right now that directly came off of turnovers right third foul on Caleb Foster after that made three so hell head to the bench possibly for the rest of the half but you look at where Dukes scoring has come from theyve only shot at 38 from the floor 11 of their 27 points off turnovers turnovers and and again eight of which were were immediate they were they were options from the turnover right a scrambling defense thats chasing the play and thats what Louisville has to avoid particularly being kind of under staffed so to speak with had only seven guys were really going to go to its like that restaurant you were telling me about understaffed theres nothing worse than an understaffed restaurant I mean I could think of a few things but when youre hungry your first world problems threey old kids are hungry that too that too 10point Louisville Le some of us are decent enough people not to take our kids out flag had a tip James keeps it alive Proctor back to flag knocked out of bounds itll stay here with eight on the timer and the under four time out looming in the ACC opener for both teams you know Pat Kelce talked a lot about his team and and really one of their focuses is is them as a unit and and Ive got to say theyve lived up to that teams dont always embody their slogans this team has so far I think thats what Louisville Fair should should have hope about Proctor with three kick out James RS in a three to beat the buzzer thats Tyrese Proctor I mean you get Space hes hard to cover hard to contain Edwards draws three leads to an open Applause Waterman and now here comes Applause Proctor catch and shoot Evans Off the Mark tapped Away by Cooper flag thats just a heady play by the 17yearold counted in the foul third on Noah Waterman foul trouble becoming a problem for the cards with under four to go in the first half overs feels like this game is a battle and a struggle to score in the half court but those turnovers kind of become that somewhat Fools goal right where theyre able to stay in this game by making easy baskets and transition off of a turtle 13 points off of two too many Louisville turnovers 10 in the first half for a team thats averaging 13 per game and now Cooper flag at the line after the third foul on Noah Waterman he goes to the bench and its a smaller lineup for Louisville now and if youre Louisville you really want momentum headed into halftime I mean you played such a good first half you want to maintain the momentum all the way into half and coming out of the top they have shot over 60 from three thats why this game ballooned to a 14 Point Louisville lead Hadley will try from downtown tap back James Scott Smith and last Touch by the Blue Devils itll stay here a good activity from the quote smaller lineup love to Define small these days goodness as as I try to get my chair as high up as possible to see over the monitors smaller and yet a 611 forward still on the Applause Music Applause floor heern operating top finish wont go numbers for Duke if they want it heper behind the play took out patris deep three and right back the other way come the cards playing at a rapid pace still despite the shortened Applause bench Edwards with FIV Applause Music Applause well defended rebound seon James contact no call three on two for Applause Lille Edwards trapped on the Baseline might have gotten it deflected by Isaiah Evans flag through contact Zips it out to Proctor and heer just calms everybody down with 0 seconds to go smart you can really wear down the defense here with a good offensive possession but also lilles gotten good things off their offensive action in the half Applause court heer spin cycle tough shot off the back iron crowd thought there might have been an offensive foul on flag and now Proctors going to call him it down for Duke flag on the smaller Smith long 60 Duke run but its been over the last 3 minutes not a lot of ma shots during that stretch somewhat of a little break in the game for Louisville but again you want to finit a strong Edwards now effectively Duke can hold for the last shot yeah I I didnt think that was the one I I like aggressiveness that just wasnt the one sometimes Edwards puts it on the deck too soon and then youre almost committed to having to make a play think either way you feel good about this half if youre Louisville cuz you have a lot to clean up and youre likely going in with a lead five on the timer for Cooper flag Proctor with three well defended by Chucky heer and they will not get the shot off and they may have to check the game clock here although Im not sure the officiating crew is going to there was a difference between game and shot clock and there was a shot clock violation now Roger SS and Bert Smith are going to check the monitor the timing issue is under review do you like that they can talk to us now love that yeah I think its cool Applause theyve been doing it in the NBA for a while now its all good but look in football they come and tell you what it is yes no they dont need to do that with every call by the way John how about this defensive effort by Chuck pepper terrific like but theyve been locked in again talk about the unit right thats what Pat Kelce says and their communications been really good their efforts been incredibly high and look Duke understands theyre going to get that reset the point for Louisville on the sideline Duke understands theyre going to get the best from any opponent particularly in conference something John shy said today in shooter around look conference plays different yeah Auburns great you know they play great competition but conference plays just different particularly on the road oh look at this place and this place is itching for I mean just itching for good basketball fans are looking at the freeze frame on the Jumbotron showing n that is what Pat Kelsey so by rule talking to BT Smith Roger just said by rule its when they acknowledge the shot clock violation which is another rule probably doesnt make sense in my mind and it doesnt make sense to anybody here either wearing red when logic it cant be applied it doesnt really make sense but Applause anyway Pat Kelce still Applause pleading going to be tough to do much here Louisville with less than half a second on the game clock Hadley got it off and Duke Trails by four after they Trail by as many as 14 hungry team and and I I feel like a starving fan base for good basketball Noah Waterman back on the floor for Louisville to start the half with three fouls Smith Off the Mark Cooper flag with the rebound he was limited to just seven points on three of eight in the first half you still get the sense hes got to find his no doubt hes also a terrific just playmaker he he understands how to play the game and maximize everybody else around Applause him flag off the bounce help comes from heurn maybe forced an offbalance shot a good read by Heburn just reading the spin and being there as he spins forcing him back over to the left shoulder its tougher shot fading away to your right Hadley off the mark loville on a 5minute scoring drought if you count the last four and a half minutes of the first half as seon James takes it in and draws a foul on James Scott and that is number three on the sophomore from fville North Carolina thir and it was in transition whether it was off turnovers or Miss shots where Duke madey in the first half because really John they struggled in the half quarter yeah the defense was good they were in position to rebound it it was a challenge for Duke also they werent able to really establish a rhythm to the game well later on tonight the Huddle crew will have the annual selection Sunday special twohour show includes breakdowns and Analysis of the accs bulll and playoff bound teams and their matchups coverage starts at 8 Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the SPN out a lot of folks across the country very happy that SMU despite their loss to Clemson last night is in the playoff field thats a I mean weve said it before I love going down to SMU Ive been there a lot when they were in the American really interesting to see what theyll do in the ACC one thing I do know is if finances matter they have it to compete Bley ends the scoring drought with Louisvilles ninth three of the game Music flag extra pass to kiple that is rejected by Applause Waterman inside Waterman sent away seon James recovery and kipple goes right around Smith kipples so good he doesnt have to leave his feet just uses his body creates contact absorbs other contact and barely has to leave his feet to finish oh what is that magic trick wow by heer finding Scott plus one I really like the creativity of Chucky heer when he has Freedom he applies his creativity that you hadnt seen a ton at Wisconsin great pass even tougher finish I also think Louisvilles done a good job on Cooper flag of gapping right where youre showing and getting back right youre not allowing him to to light up a shot youre showing High hands then backing off to not give them a driving lane theyve really done a good job making things uncomfortable for Cooper flag particularly in an ISO situation flag coming off that double double in the win against Auburn 22 points 11 boards no turnovers and he is getting everything he can handle tonight against Louisville and so is his ninth ranked Duke team at large Id like to see him on the Block at some point just given how theyre defending him hes such a good passer you have to think theyll bring a double hes got the matchup Advantage but around the perimeter not as much and thats a foul on heper who is such a gritty on ball Defender no gritty if youre a Louisville fan annoying if youre a Duke fan those are the best kind right they are theyre the guys you dont want to play against but want to play with and you hear how his hometown crowd feels about it only the first foul on the Wisconsin transfer second on the 10 well if you know anything about Wisconsin they dont foul its like Virginia ACC fans know that Virginia doesnt foul under tend to shoot for flag Applause heres Proctor tough Fade Away rims in and Proctor with seven points yeah Pro Proctors really needed I mean hes a playmaker he can create his own shot and at times hes going to have to do just that now Edwards going right back into the grill of kipple and forces his shot down telling you unorthodox in a way tough shots and sombody gets him to go flag on the ground after contact can trapped finds flag for three Applause bang might that be the shot to get Cooper flag going in the second half open three for Applause Hadley proor with a little Jordan shove and now Smith fouled on the rebound Jordan didnt shovel that play stop it youre stick to that story stick to that I always wonder too cuz like there are a lot of plays particularly I me look weve cleaned things up a lot in terms of the freedom of movement which I also believe if you have freedom of movement you also have to Define freedom of contact I think thats a good thing because in basketball theres just contact that doesnt need to be called but a lot of times the little push off it happens because the defense is all over the offensive player so I like that sense you let it go it was a physical defensive play lot of hands and I rues draws a foul on Cooper flag and that is number three on the Freshman threepoint lead at the UN center for the Louisville cards Applause I cant do this the fight against cancer has been in so many ways humbly unifying for so many people and to be a part of V week and all thats been done through ESPN its remarkable well said back at the um Center ACC opener Chucky hurn almost winning it back for Louisville who leads by four should like Louisville picking up and going a little bit more full qup pressure just again disrupt disrupt has a cumulative effect and doing it with seven players in the rotation flag a Helter Skelter shot got his own Miss under 10 to shoot and the rebound James Scott I still think Duke needs to do that more just pick up apply pressure ju just pick the tempo of the game up a bit Applause Edwards well defended by Proctor and theyre going to tag the Junior with his second foul that would be the one thing I would fix with Edwards just to say hey dont catch and immediately bounce catch you know probe identify attack I dont mind the attack I I love his aggressiveness but when you put it on the deck right away you limit yourself where are you going offensively if your Louisville whos won for its last n from three I think its just Chucky heers got a to Tarter corner and make a play if you get a switch you cant pick up your dribble stick with it make Cooper flag work there he is with 10 defended by flag Smith from Applause downtown sometimes the struggles on offense are not because youre struggling offensively its because Duke is locked in and theyre a tremendous defensive team number one in defensive efficiency in the country according to kenp Foster Off the Mark and another rebound by James Applause Scott ruths from the corner hits from downtown just back to the point I think its got to be Chucky heer he hes attracting secondary Defenders those are the guys that make everybody else better going to create scoring opportunities the wrestle comes down to makeing shots Foster tries to respond did that hit the top of it it sure did all right hurn usually so tight with the handle lost it and the first turnover of the second half of the cards it wasnt a great pass from Chucky heurn but he got it there and Cooper flag just not strong enough on the close out sometimes bigger guys like flag are there because of their length but not there to take the shot away or deter it Duke approaching a threeminute drought without a point flag lost it t to shoot Foster with five and was there a kick ball in there foul it theyre going to start to clean up the physicality and be interesting to see how it goes both ways so so if you start to get those calls on the bounce there was one down here in the post for Louisville they got the call and on the other end theyre going to start to clean up the dribble Drive defense that tells me if Im a player I attack off the bounce flag catch and shoot long rebound Foster reload for Proctor and now Edwards tribes out of the double team and is pushed by Duke the second officials start to blow the whistle on on the ball Defenders you have to attack just continue to attack and see how much theyre going to call it and and Edwards did not have numbers right there he he recognized it but D dribbled into the corner and somehow got out of it and got the call but if Im Chucky heer I I got to find away hes not even the game right now theyre going to give him a quick breather he has been playing at a elite Pace they better be Applause Music quick just somebody dribble drive here see if you can get the call Hadley back door pass hady WS with five into the chest of kiple really tough shot wont go duke dealing with foul trouble three players with three fouls Cooper flag remains on the floor and for now so does tyres Proctor I think Proctors got to be your guide it really creates some offense here with the basketball five to shoot Proctor gets around Smith and an empty finish you he hes got that in him that playmaking ability shot making ability Edwards oh yes looked out of control yes regathered control and puts it down those are the hardest guys to cover its like in football covering a broken Play Its hard leads all scores with 15 12 minutes to play Louisville made maining a lead Proctor right to the Rim Yeah I I just I love that they recognize Proctors the guy if you get him in somewhat of an ISO situation there on a flare screen he made the right decision and attacked it doesnt feel like Louisville has the lead right now me may do but led by as many as 14 in the first half Duke has not LED since it was 32 early in this game and a foul very far away from the basket the fourth on Caleb Foster Chucky hurn goes out of the game and you wonder where the offense is going to come from for Duke its Tyrese Proctor two straight possessions then Edwards on the other end keep it it going whos back into the game for Louisville theyre going to shoot a ton of Threes 22 of the 36 shot attempts have come from three theyre going to continue to do that theres not a lot at the rim for Louisville anyway me look at the length for Duke in this is their again quote small lineup what you just did there was so impressive I know was it the you took a bite of a cookie I didnt realize it amazing and you made it through without making one single chewing noise heres he Off the Mark crowd really wanted to see that go down and now Cooper flag Off to the Races flag takes it Coast to Coast thats a big time play and again makes this makes the big time plays look simple great body control of absorb the contact he just protects the basketball with the left hand and then just finishes at The Rim through contact his his simple things are are remarkable I mean this is a 610 guy getting the rebound getting out in transition heads up he knows where everybody is takes the contact dishes a little of his own nice little chicken wing which again Im okay with that cuz the defender on him by the way that was the kth on Duke Louisville in the bonus the rest of the way Louisville shot it well from the free throw line 9 of 11 right now Caleb Foster on the bench with three for the Blue Devils multiple players with three fouls for Duke ESPN plus content is available on Disney plus and we also have three tremendous womens basketball games coming your way on the app and ACC Network next Sunday including number 16 North Carolina yeah I was going to say tremendous for everybody except for the team that has to play North Carolina they give up 49 points a game thats unreal flag really TP take on backto back trips but again po presence of mind he sees a he sees a Defender lining up the steps Edwards got the whistle and is headed back to the free throw line yeah there there are little things that coopa flag does and its they going to get its going to be on flag right and that is the fourth on the freshman and look the reason why thats most important obviously its obvious its important its Cooper flag its most important because hes really been the guy the last couple minutes to make some plays he and Tyrese Proctor have been the offense for Duke and now you take him off the floor theyre going to stick with a smaller lineup so kiple will come on for flag who exits the game one rebound away from backto back double doubles and now how long do you keep him out if youre John Shire there is a lot of variables to that question I mean the the game determines some of that theres also a part of you that that wants to learn how he plays with foul trouble doesnt mean you want to risk losing the game well you got to be careful how you use them do you go offense defense if you can stealing possession here and there purn that is number two and the fourth on Louisville like the the key is the young guy that says no let me stay in you go no you shouldnt have gotten your fourth like thats the first thing I I mean I was one of those player buddies one of those players no no I want to stay its like yeah but you got your fourth like its not that you got it its that you allow that to happen I I cant roll the dice like that wait you told your coach what you wanted con canle comes in for flag and hits one from downtown its a twopoint game we all do just some do it a little bit more B boly than others Applause Music Applause Music Applause what a pass great feed James tagged with the foul that is number one on James good good to get you know kiple Edwards just goes down and hes able to get a shot up but good to get someone else going it was V tyres Pro coer flag but how about that pass from Chucky heer I mean that thats Payton Manning throwing it by the earhole of the linebacker thats chasing the seam route I dont know if I got all that right but sounds like it some football guy is out there right now like its not a seam route stupid whatever it is you know what Im talking about leave me alone well we asked Pat Kelce just about how easily and seamlessly heern has adapted to this system hes playing with a level of Freedom that perhaps we havent seen him play with in his collegiate career well I think finality has something to do with it too its free you know this is it this is a great opportunity in a tremendous place I mean God bless this fan base for how theyve kind of hung in there over the last few years this is a place like I said theyre starving for good basketball and Chucky heurn gets to be a part of that and they should play freely year one under Pat Kelce theres excitement Theres Hope go be competitive right thats thats it be competitive every game and youll win a bunch already have one ranked win this season against Indiana first ranked win for the program since Music 2021 that was aggressive by seion James I mean he he is a freak of a human being physically and everybody whos ever been around that young man will say hes one of the best people you could be around tied at 55 Louisville without a field goal over the last three minutes and Applause Counting five on the timer heper wow hes good by Malik Brown and now Duke has a chance to take their first lead since early in this game its James Two Shots coming for the twolane transfer you John Shire said it Malik Brown just has the ability to get his hand on basketball and you dont youre not ready for it but see on James I mean so physical you cant really lean off on him too much because youll bounce off of him anyway hes built like a middle Applause linebacker and I love the stability he brings can play any position cover any position some flexibility with different rotations for John Shire because of the the kind of the adaptable Personnel hes hes got another guy who started over a 100 games in his collegiate career prior to getting to Duke there are also some guys that are just like humbling like theres a part of me that wants to get fit you know and at this age you live longer then you look at a guy like seon James and you just want to give up like hes just incredible has given Duke its first lead since there was 19 minutes left in the first half and the Blue Devils on a 70 run all without Cooper flag on the bench with four fouls not is Louisville respond here like that back door thing of beauty to R Smith its a great cut but its also a tremendous pass to have your head up to read the defense and then have the willingness to take the chance to make that play kiple inside to Brown feet were moving a little bit but he got the bucket to go approaching the under eight in Louisville cards down two after they Trail by as many as 14 in the first half led by as many as I beg your pardon thank you pardon just saved you onter svel purn CS it up here comes Malik Brown watch out transition dunk for the Syracuse transfer I wonder if you take one here if youre Pat Kelce three from Rose yeah I I thought he wanted one he was calling Chucky he for an over and then you have an empty possession this would be a big possession a momentum possession for Duke Applause Proctor oh tough shot rims down largest lead of the night for the Blue Devils now if youre not going to take the time out as they were going to yeah hes going to have to take it get a good possession because Duke is starting to really find his you have a m jul thats from my mother oh now I feel badly shes probably watching this gameful jacket mom to be back in Louisville Im loving enough to be sincere with people so theres that and honest cards down 6357 620 to go in the game on the wrong end of a 152 run after the dunk by Malik Brown and I think again like you understand its been tough for Louisville scoring but you have to credit the Duke defense I mean they are remarkable with their contesting of shots and scrambling out theyve really picked things up also rebounding on the defensive end they have been locked in defensively in the second half I think the first half was a bit of a wakeup call but at the same time L did shoot 612 from three and sometimes made shots could be fools SC in this half only two of nine from distance EPO with the dagger from downtown 182 Duke run not a dagger Applause yet but close starting to feel it right you the difficulty scoring is starting to make you feel as if Duke has taking complete control of this game he bur off the mark and a foul on kipo that is number two and back to your point doing this with flag off off the off the floor on the bench with the four fouls thats just a tough match up for Waterman I mean you sag a little bit canle can pop that thing off the Applause bounce and I love what John Shire says about Cooper flag its not like oh hes the best hes great hes super skilled and amazing hes going to be the first pick of the draft no he says hes the best competitor we have its great when your best player is your most competitive guy and your hardest worker like that is is infectious and he said he does not care about stats at all I mean frankly I dont think he needs to worry about stats like he does it cuz everybody knows who he is already hes going to make plays and hes going to be involved in everything everybody knows who he is and is fully aware of how capable he is you look at what he did this past summer playing against Tusa I mean he was he was impressive and hes just going to keep getting better and the the more they establish the balance around him with guys like this good action offensive rebound brown lost it and here comes Edwards Hadley off the bals spins around Gillis and the cards arent done yet down eight under five to go and John shy wants a timeout hes pointing to his freshman super flag who is going to rejoin us when we come back in 30 seconds Applause Music Music very early in the Cooper flag Duke era but already drawing comparisons to the great Christian leners I mean when you think about the potential on the floor with his skill set his ability to pass and share the basketball one of the things no one really ever talked about with Christian lner was his unselfishness I mean he was a great player and a great teammate sometimes I think we just compare guys based on who he looks like but this ones fair enough I think I think Cooper Flags harder to despise than Christian ler was back in the day thats a fair point I dont I dont really want to have to like validate that point but I think people get what Im saying like I do yeah Im picking up what youre putting down heres flag there he is first time on the floor in five minutes makes his first shot back to a 10point dke lead and thats just something I mean his versatility I mean he can play like a guard he can play Down Low the feel he has for the game kind of Rivals that like Zion Williamson right Zion Williams had a tremendous feel for the game the instincts were there and then you add the competitiveness and the drive the work ethic all those things that makes him a really smart investment whoever acquires him next Applause heer kick out open three it has been that type of second half for Louisville that could not miss from distance in the first half now just two of 11 in the second frame from threepoint land thats all in a conversation at halftime if youre Duke you say guys like Ws going to find its level theyre not going to shoot like this for two halves in a row if they do goodness gracious so be it kipo off his knee and back to Louisville and that takes us for part of the Duke Blue Devil basketball program and I think thats just an added pressure to be able to live up to expectations individually for a lot of these players but also a as a unit particularly with six freshmen three of whom are in the starting lineup thats something that John sh knows a lot about he started as a freshman had Duke back in the day as well it helps that those freshmen tend to be better than most yeah number one recruiting class in the country coming into the year five to shoot Smith floater rims out and a second opportunity for Music Edwards and that is the 15th Louisville turnover which was what kept Duke in the game in the first half that was just gets himself sometimes stuck in a bad spot tough pass to handle lost ball you want to capitalize on Second Chance opportunities if at all possible Applause Music flag kick out kipple for three Here Comes Applause Hadley much needed from Smith ending a two and 12 minute scoring drout that was a really good simple find from Edwards right just immediate attack draw defense kick out in Rhythm three which is a high percentage shot sevenpoint game two minutes and change flag fouled probably a smart one by Hadley you just want to be able to create scoring opportunities and keep an eye on Cooper flag there he did step a little funny on that left leg just like he gave out Applause on hes going to shake it off and shoot one and one I mean there there are some player like we care about everyones Heth lets let me just start with that but theres just something about certain players when you see them twisted ankle youre like oh like hes one of them everyone holds their breath for hold your Applause Music breath and we mentioned earlier you know case and prior you and I both got to see him play at South Florida and what an infectious energetic personality and player he is you know the game would be different with him here do they make 61 and half from three I dont know game would be different but hes the type of guy that this fan base would love and appreciate and I really felt for him when he went down really enjoyed watching him play one of four Louisville cards out for the year meanwhile tonight the Huddle crew will have the annual Sunday selection special a twohour show thatll include breakdown an analysis of the accs bull and playoff bound teams and their matchups our coverage start at 8 Eastern right here on the ACC Network and the ESPN app major first round game SMU against your pen State nitty lions and then Clemson with the win last night against SMU in the ACC title game they get to face Texas in Austin still good to see SMU in the college football playoff I have hopes for head in state but Im not the big biggest or best fan like Im Im a good fan when theyre good and when they win definition of fair weather 100 like in college basketball whos your favorite team whoever the best team is right like Ive been Ive been a huge Alburn fan over the last few weeks cuz theyre fun to watch right you just you want to watch the whole game that Duke Auburn game I didnt miss a single commercial h rims out of three well get back to Johns zero loyalties as a fan in just a second Malik Brown is walking to the free throw line I think as a player though you you just appreciate especially in this job right people think in our position that were biased I want to tell people all the time is like we absolutely are to a degree because were human like anybody else but when you spend time with both teams you see both teams as people like you appre iate them you feel for them you have empathy for them right you develop an empathetic perspective doing the job that we get to do because you see the struggle from all of them so in a way we root for everybody ninepoint deficit for Louisville Edwards trying to make it seven and he is sent Away by Malik Brown yeah again smaller lineup air quotes like you you have a lot there to contest things at The Rim between brown and super flag yet this is a group that has multiple Playmakers and can space the floor and now you hear the Duke faithful by the way theres a lot of yes there are flag no and the put back jab his fourth double double of the season with an emphatic dunk that was close to being his fifth on an offensive foul but Smith Smith just didnt hold his ground and then he gets the put back dunk and kind of silences the crowd a little bit Scott Smith three no and flag the rebound and that will do it in Louisville a valiant effort by a depleted Louisville team but ultimately too much Firepower from Cooper flag and Company yeah he look he makes the play look he gets to the basket but Smith had an opportunity to really there hold his ground just move it a little too much thats you know its not fair like in my day I would have had to line up my steps and hes just standing there under the rim and goes up and throws it down I really wonder I I want to say this I I really wonder if Cooper flag will get the vitriol of Christian lner or JJ reick if he only stays one year I dont see how opposing fan could build up that much hate in one season yeah like look Im sure there will be plenty of opportunities but its also D its just just yeah kind of comes with the ter its you know that the greatness plays a big role in that right if they werent any good would anyone care Applause no its not just that they won games its how they did it like for decades under Coach K I mean they were they were disciplined they played freely they were Elite in every everything their competitiveness was Second To None which I that all stems from the identity that is your coach like if youre coach is the most competitive guy on the bench then your team should reflect that Duke always has and now your best players your most competitive hardest worker pretty good John CH told us he felt like with this team they were returning to that identity that root of the Duke program which is Steely competitiveness yes and and look you see that on the defensive end typically you see competitiveness on the defensive end more on more than on offense right offense its about playmaking and the better you are defensively the more freely you can play on the offensive end knowing that you could trust your defense and as they get better and better defensively youre going to see them really open up and Thrive offensively particularly in games where Playmakers win Auburn Duke was a Playmakers game it was playmaking after playmaking and Duke had The Playmakers and made the shots down the stretch made enough stops had a unique approach cover malite brown covering Janai broom I thought it was terrific it really disrupted the rhythm of alurn took broom more in the post they just have so many different rotations so many weapons if they can continue to get better and better which is scary on defense games going to get easier and easier on offense get it up got to get it up and thats a foul on Edwards timeout theyre going to call it timeout they are going to call a timeout John sh looked up and saw 21 seconds and Mason Gill is still had the ball in his hands well Duke whos just coming off what we showed you earlier a gauntlet of a start first eight games four of those against ranked opponents on the road against a Louisville team receiving both theyre going to get a little bit of a break in car at word George Mason and then ACC play begins in Earnest at Georgia Tech wild the Duke team that feels like they have the components to win an ACC Championship no they have the components to win an NCA championship and in conference play it is different right John shy said that like what you have to prepare for in the conference is a little different how do you define that I dont know you got to be a part of the program to really get it and then meanwhile on the other side Louisville has six ranked opponents before January 2nd the next ones coming up on Saturday at Kentucky huge game in and going be a lot of eyballs on Nationwide because bville has us time and again early in the they did it tonight that they can compete this season and Im Im really happy to see Mark Pope at Kentucky I think hes a terrific coach hes going to make everything difficult its going to be a different look team hes going to be able to win with guys who are experienced and who understand how to be coach and how to play the game and then I think theyre going to get more and more good talent three ball not there in the second half for Louisville it was what propelled them to a 14point lead in the first half held to just three of 15 in the second frame and they are going to fall to a very good ninth rank Duke clue Devils team who will win the ACC opener on the road yeah really good performance for Louisville you you have to just stop and step back and say okay there is absolutely hope here for the Louisville basketball program under Pat chelse theyre competitive they attack
