white has it here good big man battle in this game between poti and venning venning missfires comes up empty on the opening possession well we spoke with errl Grant he said look ball movement as you take a look at the Virginia Tech starting five we talked about L at the T I think another key uh performer in this game The Freshman point guard Ben Hammond hes going to play key role in this game Hammond has it here stolen away Benning swiped it Roger McFarland slows things down hands off to Chaz Kelly and now the Boston College starting five theyve been rolling with four guards around venning spaces to court out a lot better for Earl grants team down the lane Kelly opens the Applause scoring thanks Doug our Tuesday night ACC double header continues from KY Forum in Chestnut Hill Malcolm Huckaby Jay alter with you just getting started between Virginia Tech and Boston College elel poti first bucket of the night for Virginia Tech a hokey team that is looking for their fifth conference

time of the season yet again all six years it feels like his team gets better as the season progresses yeah and a brown right there beautiful Up and Under move but youre right uh Mike young certainly uh has his team playing well now but a key game for both these teams we talked about it a little at the tip that cut line to make the ACC tournament and right here thats beautiful basketball by Hammond pick and rolled help not there for Boston College and this freshman point guard a for Virginia Tech continues to impress and right now BC in the bottom three so would not qualify for the ACC tournament backs against the wall needing wins at the end of this season vanning twisting turning cant find the Finish low the rebound if its anywhere near the rim Toby low will find a way to the basketball number one in Orange 49 in vertical confirmed uh he jumps out of the gym we saw him at shoot around and hes going to be one of the more athletic players you see not just in the ACC but in college basketball shot clock down to five The Freshman Tyler Johnson cant connect on the Applause Music three heres Donald Han Jr leading scorer for Boston College and now Chaz Kelly back to hand The Freshman Tyler Johnson all overand finds venning kick out open three Kelly cant connect offensive rebound McFarlands fouled and hell get two at the Applause line his previous possession brown right here this is a tough finish up under finish on the other side and then the pick and roll right here a little dribble hand off the help is late and then the Freshman Hamond beautiful Del uncontested dunk excellent spacing by Virginia Tech and McFarland makes the Music Applause first this is an Eagles team that is been in close and competitive games they found a way to win against Florida State but three overtime losses in their last six games if you could have stolen one or even two of those theyd be better off in the ACC standings now backs against the wall they are three games back of that cut line they need to find a a way to win in a hurry yeah an important game obviously not much separation obviously uh down at the bottom of that cut line and the key obviously is to try to get into the ACC tournament to give yourself a chance to go on a run so again an important game for both of these teams tonight as we get closer to March and this is the first year where not every teams going to the ACC tournament the bottom three will be left at home trying to squeeze it in to laow good defense by Boston College to deny it shot clock down to three Jaden young has to hoist from Deep Way Off the Mark and thats a shot clock violation great defensive intensity from BC yeah early in the game thats clearly their best defensive possession uh they forced everything away from the basket the Virginia Tech was really going left to right not going uh towards the basket at all and end result a deep contested three with the shot clock winding down contested three on the other end hand cant connect offensive rebound Deion Brown dug it out gave it away three onone Hammond back to low misses the dunk but is fouled it will get two at the line just getting started in our Tuesday night double header on acc Network BC up by one Music 800 to scient inov the way science Music m e e Home Services Music Music ACC mens basketball is presented by T price invest with confidence a Virginia Tech on the road tonight in Chestnut Hill and they have been impressive away from home four of their six ACC wins have come on the road really good in one possession games five and one in games decided by three points or fewer and you cant put them away three wins after trailing by 10 or more so Mike young Youngs team kind of has a mix of all of it they can win close games games coming from behind and on the road yeah on the road I think obviously the key thing uh any League or any conference you play in getting Road wins really I think is key for a a team that has aspirations in particular this year as the format has changed staying off that cut line and you know he certainly feels like look we want to get to the ACC tournament and see what we can do there obviously what NC State did last year a lot of folks are hey why not but you have to get there and you have to put yourself in that position exactly youve got to be in it to win it NC State is a 10 seed a year ago so anything can happen the wow cuts off the pass hokes trying to get something in transition here but now forced to go back to the basket lewow spins his way for a slam Toby laow showing off the Hops early you cant appreciate his spring we were laughing and shoot around you know you see it on paper hey a guyss got close to a 50in vertical they were throwing him lobs his elbows were in the rim and their coaching staff jokes and said we may have to have him start wearing a mouth guard because hes going to hit his mouth on the rim Second Chance Point opportunity hand K Applause cashion and pretty good look right there for Donald Han off the second chance opportunity one thing were going to monitor uh Boston College is doing a good job on the offensive glass but Toby law weve been talking about it again when you see a guy with a close to 50 in vertical this is what that looks like spring off the two feet and he goes up quick young man that did not start playing basketball until he he was 16 years old originally from London I asked him are you Manu Manchester United fan and he said yes my mom was really a Manchester United fan so that made me a Manchester United fan but certainly a talented athletic player oh theres so many clubs in London I thought maybe hed pick a London Club but all the winning that man you did probably with LA was growing up and his moms a fan so staying loyal to the family team I love that you mentioned Malcolm Boston College four offensive rebounds three Second Chance points but they are just one of their last seven in a scoring drought of two and A2 minutes here and Junior trying to end it cant connect Applause much better job that time by potit keeping Hastings off the offensive glass Tyler Johnson bodying up Kelly re gathers it Lefty hook no

Jaden Hastings and thats all set up Donald H Jr unselfish nice little dump off pass he draws so much attention and then that time Hastings almost took the rim off backto back baskets for Boston College and now its Virginia tacking a scoring lall of more than two minutes open three young no good bounces around young gets his own Miss kicks to Ben Burnham poti going against Hastings shot clocked down to seven thats no good another offensive rebound Burnham trying to cash in and an offensive foul called for a push were going to take a look at the previous offensive possession for Boston C right here rip through draw the defender and then little dump off pass excellent facing and offense and look at Hasting with the thunder right there n Grant has to be pleased on the defensive side and also how his team has attack of the offensive glass I know Mike young is going to address that they got to do a better job on the defensive glass a 900 tip on a Tuesday night you never know what energy A teams going to come out with him Boston College has dialed in defensively great energy in this game here at home jaaz Kelly off the mark from three weve mentioned it a couple of times the where Boston College sits in the ACC standings their backs are against the wall and theyre playing like it Virginia Tech limited to just six points in the opening 8 minutes of this game theyve gone scoreless for the last 3 minutes and 30 seconds re Steiner trying to end that long rebound Falls to Kelly Kelly one on Three smartly pulls it out thats pretty good recovery that time in transition by Virginia Tech and Junior in attack mode right to the rim missed it Hastings couldnt follow Applause it pookis desperate for a bucket fourminute scoring drought trying to take the lid off the rim pull up pop Johnson The Freshman leaves it short well both teams really struggling to get a bucket in this last three minute stretch Virginia Tech has missed their last eight shots just one of

of 4 minutes and 23 seconds right now for the hokes they are struggling offensively yeah both teams really uh neither team really shooting the ball well um 03 from the threepoint line Virginia Tech Boston College 0 of6 I think both teams really settling for jumpers credit both defenses though theres been not a lot of dribble drives uh so again uh both teams are going to have to settle down see if they can get higher quality looks cuz right now early on both teams shooting a lot of contested jumpers both of these teams still looking for their offensive flow in this first half the good news for Virginia Tech very flat to start this game offensively just three of 13 youre only down by three make it five as that rims in Elijah strong his first shot of the night and the iron very Applause kind okis nearing five minutes without a basket they turn it over again looking for somebody anybody to ignite this offense one of the things Earl Grant talked to us about in shootaround ball movement and player movement he said look we have to be patient offensively against this Virginia Tech defense Beetle lines up a three cant connect Miss fires Thursday night right here on acc Network a terrific double header for you ACC womens basketball North Carolina at Syracuse and then Stanford taking on Virginia Tech the hokes on the bubble on the womens side looking to play their way in to March Madness Rex Steiner and a foul called Elijah potit for a moving screen the offensive struggles Applause continue yeah that one really poti didnt even argue it he knew he moved and sometimes thats not necessarily on the screener but that time clearly right in front of the ref potit set a moving illegal screen Mike Youngs team six five turnovers only three made field goals thats not usually a good combo for a road Conference win but again the good news is theyre only down five strong working against Burnham 4 seconds to shoot turn around doesnt fall and another contested jumper and that time uh Virginia Tech did a pretty good job on the defense of glass but its been a struggle for both teams to get the ball into the paint the wild loses the handle it will stay Virginia Tech ball more than 6 minutes without a point two teams that weve said a few times desperate for a conference win and it doesnt have to be pretty Malcolm they all count the same no and again both teams playing getting after it on the defensive end right now again with potit out of the lineup for a Virginia Tech youre going to have to be more patient again just inability to break down the defense and get the paint into the paint off the bounce or pass Danning goes inside and flushes that down its an 8 nothing Boston College run and that is the area right there uh you need to attack if youre Boston College dont settle for jumpers and another turnover strong that rolls in count it plus the foul for Elijah strong all set up by their defense right here off the turnover and then venning beautiful dime that time by Beetle and then strong off another turnover and one body control on point and that time with the left hand Boston College on a many run right now and its all been predicated off of their defense theyve really made a Virginia Tech a very good offensive team theyve struggled just to run their offense and theyve taken a lot of contested jumpers and those jumpers have gone begging Virginia Tech has missed their last nine shots its a scoring drought of nearly seven minutes for the hokes who can ignite this offense for Virginia Tech foul called on Josh Beetle and just taking care of the basketball too hu seven turnovers in this first half for Virginia Tech three of 14 shooting you mentioned a lot of those were contested jumpers good defense by Boston College to force those turnovers and nothing coming easy right Music now well if youre a Virginia Tech try to get some back doors Boston College really aggressive in the passing Lanes Patrick wesler the sevenfooter in Lefty hook rims out as 10 straight misses for Virginia Tech the scoring drought continues its allow Boston cers to open up a ninepoint Applause lead McFarland Donald Han Jr cant connect Applause heres Toby luow aggressive take its the back rim no Applause good Virginia Tech shooting 20 tonight Boston College their last six games has allowed 47 vanning trying to spin his way free turns it over Virginia Tech theyve struggled in the half court set im surpris they didnt push in transition there yeah thats actually I think uh going to be something Virginia Techs going to have to do cuz right now in their half court theyre really struggling see if you can get out off of a turnover and on the offensive side for Boston College fenning needs to be aware the Doubles coming when he catches the ball theyre going to double from the backside Fred Payne scoop to the hoop crafty take from the sophomore this time pain with the Up and Under earlier it was brown that is degree of difficulty off the charts great body control and touch the Finish 12 nothing Boston College run no points in 9 minutes for Virginia Tech and another Miss Johnson cleans up the spill after 13 straight misses finally Tyler Johnson breaks through for the hokes and thats a big bucket by The Freshman get on the offensive glass Tyler Johnson much needed to break this run by Boston Applause College well it has been

uh find a way to win the next play to win that particular game those duck legs kicking like crazy during a 9 Minute 12 second scoring drought that Tyler Johnson just ended the Hokey head coach Im sure not pleased with his teams offensive execution during that stretch I tell you what uh its racing inside right now for him if he looks at these numbers they have not been pretty credit a lot to the Boston College defense Applause foul called on the inside venning and potit its a good big man battle well the good news is uh it feels like theyre down more than what they are again for as poorly as theyve played thus far it could be a lot worse no doubt in terms of uh the score and the numbers that theyre down but certainly they got some things to figure out in particular clear though really offensive end they got to do a better job trying to get paint touches off the bounce or try to get poti posted they go inside to bti kicks to the corner leow off the mark Virginia Tech has missed all six threes theyve taken tonight but thats a pretty good look again uh poti two feet in the paint collapse the defense they get a quality look from three Music Applause venning tough take somehow gets it to go off the window and in and thats a great feel right there by venning again he felt PTI leaning one way just spun right off him great move and touch by Benning to finish Virginia Tech made three of their first five shots just one out of their last 15 eight points in this first half and theres less than 5 minutes left in it Hammond open for three offensive rebound keeps it alive the shooting struggles continue foul called against Boston College and this previous play watch venning again he feels potit leaning to his right right there then hes going to spin back off his left shoulder thats a beautiful move veteran move that time by venning again hes got great footwork and feel around the Music basket crosscourt pass Hammond stolen away Deon brown brown steps on the gas all the way to the rim couldnt finish Applause it Jaden young goes inside going against Ving and he misses Applause Music under four minutes to go in this first half and Virginias tech tech at only eight points shooting under Music 20 fost college has been Relentless defensively neither team has made a three we have not seen a made three in this first half a combined zero of 15 deep three Han junior he ends that nothing but at the bottom of the net in the 16th threepoint attempt of the night is good ball movement its all set up Chad venning making the pass out of the double team Earl Grant can ask for a better start to this game and is loving Boston College a Music Music big e e e e e Music Music back with them in studio during halftime game two of our double header on a Tuesday night in the ACC Virginia Tech the story in this one they are struggling offensively eight turnovers shooting four of 22 from the floor only eight points points in this first half more than 16 minutes play they have just made one of their last 17 shots shot clock down to seven trying to get it into Applause poti banning all over and there to finish it Toby laow John gafty the official says going to look at the monitor to see if this was a goal t well I think hes saying its no Applause good now again Im not sure what hes mentioning here it looks like yeah hes saying thats basket um interference yeah they just took off the point said that was in the cylinder looked like it was going to hit the rim on the bounce and thats a break though for Boston College cuz wow you got to block him out we talked about it near 50 in vertical anything around the rim he is going to just try to go and jump over you so you got to put a body on him if youre Boston College zenning right to the rim for two fewest points and a half in Virginia Tech History is nine versus North Carolina 1935 90 years ago thats not the history you want to set but that has been the first half for Virginia Tech one of their last 18 I mean they finally see the ball go in with L and its a goal 10 nothing going Mike Youngs way right now and then on the other end Boston College I like what theyre doing with Chad venning again theyre posting him at the elbow again uh that avoids the double team coming over if they do it gives them enough time and the vision to see to get rid of it and and hes just going to work on potit Tyler Johnson buries the three first made three for the hokes tonight desperately needed bucket and thats twice now the Freshman Tyler Johnson previous play nice little pull up right there nice three off of good ball movement that might be their best offensive possession in this first half and Junior trying to answer on the other end that falls off the rim no good Music Applause re Music Steiner and the wow walked before he dribbled thats a travel 10th turnover for Virginia Tech in this first half this Saturday mens basketball triple header right here on acc Network the Eagles stay at home the host Georgia Tech Clemson at SMU that is a terrific game at four Easter timing in the hokes at Miami in the night cap yeah that Clemson team one of the more underrated back courts in college basketball Jaden Zachary a Chase Hunter thats going to be a great matchup though against a solid SMU team vanning getting the better of potit in this first half Fades away and hits well hes got it going uh Spin To the Left reverse back to the right hes given it to him from both sides and right now if youre Virginia Tech you got to think about doubling even when he catches it at the elbow right now he is just having his way with Applause po under a minute left in this first half Virginia Tech looking for something positive to go into the locker room with a foul called take a look at where theyre posting Chad bang up right there again theyre putting them at the El ball and then let him go to work he sees the double coming that time it doesnt come uh they can either stunt or go double but I think right now again if youre Virginia Tech the way hes got it going you got to give po some help try to get the ball out of vennys hand wow spins his way free through contact no call all ball says Brian oconnell Applause Music Applause 8 seconds separate that shot clock and the game clock here at the end of the first half Boston College leads by 15 great hands that time by Hammond The Freshman but thats even better recovery though by Chaz Kelly broken up a twoonone looked like they were going to have a layup off the steal by Music Hammond 10 seconds to shoot and another turnover 11 turnovers for the hokes in this first half their season low in a half this year is 23 points they are are stuck at 11 use it or lose it timeout for Boston College ear old Grant Alexs to use it well step aside for 30 seconds Music Music Music Thursday night 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the nothing but neet crew will break down the night in the ACC highlights analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best matchups for the weekend right here every Thursday nothing but net on acc Network well this has been a first half to forget for Virginia Tech we said theyve been so good on the road this season four of their six conference wins have come away from home but Boston College defensively has given the hokes fits 11 points in this first half their previous season low 23 this would be the fewest points in a half since 1996 uh the only good thing about this uh 6xs left is they could be down even more true and Junior trying to finish the first half with a triple the Boston col will head into the locker room with a 15point lead it feels like 20 uh but if youre Earl Grant at 26 points so its only a 15point game and thats the key I think if youre Mike young look for as poorly as they played youre only down 15 and right on Q now that uh lead down to 13 excellent set play to start the second half and I think thats the adjustment right there they got to get the ball into the post into the paint stop settling for contested jump venning who is the biggest bright spot for BC offensively in that first half kicks it out and now back to venning working against poti passes out of the double team good ball movement McFarland finishes it you cant ask for a better passing that time venning saw the double coming from the Baseline thats what Virginia Techs doing theyre bringing it from the opposite Wing saw it got rid of it and then an extra pass two really great first possessions by both these teams might be the first time tonight weve had consecutive makes absolutely Ben Hammond very quiet in that first half finds L wall triggers a three got it all set up by the Freshman Hammond Ben Hammond they Rave about this young man future very bright simple dribble Drive collapse the defense throw it out to LA simple basketball but they need more of that in the second half Kelly in traffic in trouble pull up pop McFarland no Applause Music good and if youre Boston College and Earl Grant you dont like that shot let Chad Benning get a touch in the post and then play through him potit and its three straight makes for Virginia Tech after they missed four in a row in the first half and thats a poor gamble that time by venning really no need to go for that steal stay home right to the rim Donald Han Jr the immediate answer no help that time Benning gave him a little help cleared out the lane but back to my earlier point if youre Chad venning again you dont need to gamble for a postentry pass if you dont get it youre going to give up a layup so you rather stay behind get a little help foul off the ball and this right here again the Freshman uh Ben Hammond nice just dribble Drive draw that time it looked like three Defenders throw it out and that was something that was not seen in the first half made threes and then Donald Han Jr on the other end no help off that ball screen and he continues to play really well for Earl Grant and Boston College how about this for the hokes they had eight points in the first 16 and 1 12 minutes of the first half they scored seven in the first two minutes of the second Im sure that speech by Mike young and also the adjustments I think the biggest thing is that theyve got better ball movement and then theyre getting the ball into the paint a good intensity coming out of the locker room two offensive rebound and they cash in Hammond its good four makes in this second half for Virginia Tech they only made nine shots in the entire first half and just like that its a 10point game and I think the other thing adjustment for Virginia Tech the energy of their energy has stepped up but Donald H Jr contested jumper that was deep off a nice little wheel cut not bad defense just better offense that time by hand and excuse me thats nine made field goals on the game five in the first half already four in this second half ball on the floor a scum for it jump ball possession arrow favors Boston College Eagles up by 13 and look at the footwork for hand coming off one two right into his shot excellent set play and we saw Donald Han Jr out here ours uh before the game one of the more hard workers and you look at what hes done for this Boston College team over the last five games clearly the production with him on the court those are flaring numbers right there in terms of what the team does with him on the court versus off good ball movement and the punk fake goes into wesler Ammon tracks it down and a foul called on hand trying to poke it away from the wow both teams have picked it up on the offensive end its an offensive explosion in this second half after a lowscoring first half Eagles up by 13 do anything Music except oh my Music we go we go almost got you oh got you oh we caught you for a second there hes trying to sneak a picture and Music everything and while here you Applause Music Applause you all right who Applause oh man got some hands Music in honor of black history always tonight we REM remember Charlie lipom who in 1968 became the first black scholarship player in Virginia Techs history libum played three seasons on Varsity average nearly a double double but most known for knocking out Muhammad Ali great story behind this so Muhammad Ali shows up to Virginia Techs campus libcom is volunteered to help Ali demonstrate the famed Ali Shuffle so Ali dares him to try his best to hit him well lipsum BPS the champ on the lip draws blood and Alis takes the blood and smears it on the autograph picture he gave to Charlie I mean what a story and obviously so many stories like that with Muhammad Ali and his work and the love that he had for the people that he interacted with but remarkable story piece of History right there and Boston College was trying to throw the knockout punch in the first half their defense was suffocating they held Virginia Tech to just five made baskets in the first half theyve already made five shots in this second half theyve scored more points in this second half only 11 of the first already 12 in this second less than 5 minutes gone by in Applause it and during that run though Hammond with a corner three speaking with Mike young about uh Ben Ham and The Freshman point guard he talked about his high school and the Poise that hes played with as he goes to the bench right now playing a lot of minutes hardest role I think in college basketball starting point guard in particular in Mike young system and they just Rave about his basketball IQ future very bright for that young man yeah to do it as a true freshman and then in the back court you cant lean on experience either cuz you got a fellow freshman in Tyler Johnson those two have provided big minutes and big buckets for this hok team throughout this season and they only Trail by 10 and Virginia Tech has four wins this season after trailing by 10 or Music more Boston College still in the drivers seat though theal swings it crosscourt pass intercepted re Steiner gets it to low going against Isaiah strong Toby low spins into a double team comes up empty thats a pretty good look that time by L and just unable to convert but and had pretty good post keeps it in play hoks looking for something in transition the trailer dug out by Johnson and now low goes up with it comes up well Applause short brown leaves it for Hastings and thats a big man Jam Jaden Hastings his second slam of the night and thats great patience that time by Brown again waited to the last second to dump that off Hastings Great job running the floor after the hokes made five of their first six shots in this second half theyve missed four in a row now wide open look leow he cant hit it potit bats it like a volleyball player Rex Steiner hoists it up he cant connect Applause they a strong Boston College theyre finding a good rhythm in this second half and thats twice now brown has made nice passes that time again in transition that led to easy scoring opportunities tough take and Jaden young draws the foul take a look at these assists right here again the first one great patience waited till the last second Hasting kept moving got rewarded that time and then again watch the court Vision wait and then dump it down look saw that his uh teammate had position thats nice pinpoint passing that time twice by Donald Applause Brown this Saturday mens basketball triple header for you on acc Network it starts right here in Chestnut Hill Georgia Tech in town to take on BC really good match up before Eastern Time ranked Clemson at SMU ponies right on the bubble trying to fight their way into March Madness and then its Virginia Tech on the road in Miami the hokes battling here on the road against Boston College they only scored 11 points of the first half so theyve already beaten their first half total but still Trail by 133 Music here Beetle that rolls off the rim no good Ben Burnham fights for the board thats a great block out that time by Burnham Rex Steiner swatted at The Rim Benning got all of it strong transition triple this fires Boston College only two made threes tonight two of 13 theyve gone theyve done a lot better going Applause inside Virginia techs also struggled from three tonight three of 14 for the Hokey so both teams cant find anything from distance well you dont mind if they come off of dribble drives but you dont want to shoot contested ones early into the shot clock if youre Boston College I try to get venting a touch in the Music Applause paint and Junior he goes into the paint lays it up and in he thought it should have been an and Applause one and Boston College with the smaller lineup theyre really switching one through four watch any screen pinned down with the exception of vinning Boston College is switching you couldnt ask for a better look Hammond wide open and still cant get it to go that is now nine straight misses for Virginia Tech they had a stretch in the first half where they missed 14 in a row you have two stretches like that in a game on a road it becomes near impossible to find a way to win crafty play from Payne Han junor cant finish the possession and thats unselfish play by strong again realizing hand had the hot hand passed up a three that he could have easily taken to give it up to Donald Han wesler in trouble goes up cant finish it and thats fatigue right there looks like some tired legs for Virginia Tech right there theres three hokes waiting to check in Han Jr leads all scores with 12 backing down Rex Seer goes off the window and in Donald Han Jr he has taken over and that right there thats just a mismatch right there uh him realizing he had a clear size advantage and they just isolated them on the block now Virginia Tech in another scoring drought theyve missed their last 10 this Boston College defense theyve been terrific tonight another block from Chad venning and BC is up Music big thats some good one so far this season what we got tonight see the I see r i see all right its time for a FL g once again lets see those muscles BC if you see yourself on the video board lets hey what you got hey Applause tall and strong too okay Applause Music they she hasnt skipped a couple weeks oh hes hes not try to she just Applause Music what you back the you guys hit the gym on campus I see very nice hey best TV show yourself SE Music Music Applause felt points have been at a premium tonight but Donald Pan Jr has delivered offensively we talked about it in the tip his last six games hes averaging 24 points a game over 43 from the threepoint line uh tonight he leads all scores 14 points six of 15 from the four uh but I think its been his ability to get into the paint and create some easy opportunities thats been the difference in this second half to extend this lead by Boston College and nine points from Han Jr in this second half as BC has started to separate for as well as they played defensively in the first half holding the hokes to 11 points they lacked offense to really put them away now the offense is come to life shooting 60 in this second half thats the recipe for Boston College they werere used to seeing the Eagles play in these close games theyve played in three overtime games in their last six games they had that thrilling finish to beat Florida State but theyve been in control of this game really since tip off and their defense has been the story another steal pay cant finish it foul called though will send pay to the line well right now theyre just being aggressive in the passing Lan right here you got to go back or you see okay all game Boston College has been trying to shoot the G that pass certainly is going to get deflected and again if youre Virginia Tech you have to be aware of how aggressive Boston College has been in the passing Lanes on the other side look Earl Grant and this Boston College defense just continues to pressure and theyre getting offense with their defense well we mentioned it early but Boston College they knew the situation ACC standings they are below the cut line right now would not qualify for the ACC tournament their backs are against the wall they need to string together wins here at the end of the season make a run and they are playing like it tonight came out with great energy and they have sustained it in this second half 19point lead low trying to cut into it and hell get to at the Applause line take a look at these ACC standings the whos lost to Pittsburgh tonight so 5 and 11 thats the team hanging on to the last spot in the ACC tournament so BC can win tonight string a couple more together they can battle their way out of the basement yeah theres really a log Jam down there at that cut line and all these teams know were getting closer to March so time is running out every game counts and this was a big one for both these teams and Earl Grant actually I would say probably his best stat in his tenure as the head coach of Boston College hes 5 and3 in the ACC tournament he usually has his team playing their best basketball and in his previous three years theyve made a run in that tournament yeah and I I I think right now I think the biggest thing as you see ev vening with a rebound looks like theyre going to call a foul so this will go against the hokes BC basketball but the biggest thing is really defensively and I like right now what Virginia Techs going to do it looks like theyre going to extend their defense see if they can come up with some turnovers or disrupt of the flow of this Boston College offense give them a different Music look heres vanning 10 seconds to shoot vanning goes behind the back to beat potit Battle for the rebound one by strong kick out McFarland a three its good really everything going Boston College Way 550 ball right there its up for grabs Boston College comes up with it and the end result a kick back out three got to have those if your Virginia Tech trying to call back into this game nine nothing run for Boston College Virginia Tech has missed 11 shots in a row Applause now Boston College at full control Applause 4 seconds on the shot clock strong muscles it in but cant finish it but Boston College you just said it Huck theyre winning the hustle play tonight off the 5050 ball McFarland with the three it has been all Boston College in this game Music you Applause you Applause Music Applause c c crazy C Applause Music Music Music for Music Music Music the accs committee for racial and social justice in conjunction with its member institutions have identified February 13th to the 23rd as ACC Unity week as part of this initiative members of the Eagles or the hokes joined one another before the game to demonstrate their commitment to see seeing each other as equals and treating each other with respect and dignity at all times recognizing that our differences dont divide Us but make us stronger malol hucke Jay alter with you Boston College theyve been in control of this game really since tip off the hokes have struggled offensively and it continues this defensive pressure from Boston College has forced 14 Virginia Tech turnovers and our grant talked with us about uh changing defense looks at you on that time they extend something they had really not done in this really last uh 5 minute stretch and then they just throw a fullcourt press at them and were able to come up with the turnover so theyre constantly changing of the defensive looks that theyre giving Virginia TCH theyve doubled theyve headed hard on ball screens theyve trapped them sometimes so theyre constantly been keeping them guessing with their defensive looks and I think too when you force so many misses like they did in that first half stretch your defense grows confidence right and its feels like its just snowballed throughout this game it really has and again youre right the confidence that theyve got because theyve gotten easy opportunities because theyve been able to get out and transition off those misses or turnovers good swipe from Ben Hammond the Virginia Tech has lacked offensive finish in this game Burnham lines up the three missed it thats now 12 straight misses for Virginia Tech they had 14 straight misses in the first half a scoring drout of 9 minutes and 12 seconds right now theyre on a 6minute scoring drought and you sustain two six plus minute scoring droughts in a game shoot like that 24 from the field 20 from three the most glaring of them all 177 from the free throw line and I think a lot of that fatigue theyve really spent so much time either chasing uh defensively but you know again credit a lot of it goes to this uh BC defense theyve made it really difficult for them to run their offense right on Q that defensive pressure forces another turnover and we felted in the first few minutes Malcolm at late tip on a Tuesday night you just never know how a teams going to come out and BC they just had great intensity good burst here Hammond the and the Finish would have counted either way Goen to call but its still rimmed in for Hammond well I tell you what the one bright spot for Virginia Tech has been Ben Hammond The Freshman point guard he has continued to battle and impressed with his play and he is so quick that time great anticipation on the defensive end coming up with a steel Applause Music McFarland in the corner fires airball the wild had Jaden young up ahead didnt hit Music Applause him heres Tyler Johnson going against vanning Music no good from Applause Johnson right now Boston College wisely running some clock well think about it this way Huck Virginia Tech has only scored 26 points all night theyre going to have to find at least 20 points in the final 5 minutes and 21 seconds just to tie it its uh its really been a strle and you said it sometimes you know you just come out in these games but obviously weve talked about the significance yeah of the close uh to the end of this season for both of these teams trying to secure their spot and the ACC Music Applause tournament well if Boston College lost this game and lost on Saturday they there was a scenario where they could be mathematically eliminated so this will at least give them a boost here big time finish at The Rim the Freshman Tyler Johnson rocks the rim Deon Brown holding his jaw Applause there and lets see yeah right there again the blockout by young again nothing you nothing malicious there again he was trying to a block out certainly though Ive taken plenty of Applause those uh i taken plenty of those right there and certainly thats no fun but I think again trying to block Applause out 448 to go in this game and and Boston College going to take their time running their offense obviously no rush but to put up a quick shot with the way they have defended tonight 46 might be enough to secure this Applause win Hammond good pass L wow couldnt handle it though yeah just mishandle he had a wide open layup or dunk and then on the other end opportunistic of Boston College and Donald H Jr right now continues to shoot lights out he has 17 points to lead all scorers tonight and thats the type of night its been for Virginia Tech you dont get the layup on one end and Junior makes you pay on the other low gets that off the window Music a concerted effort Malcolm youve said it the last two times up the court to just run this shot clock down under 10 before you go into Attack Mode the foul called off ball Hastings was getting held Boston College leading by 18 strong performance here at home basketball home is this Saturday when the Eagles Take on Georgia at 2 pm the game is sold out you can still get your tickets at s the official ticket partner of DC Athletics Music now Music he Music Music Music Applause you Music Music Music great stat from the great Mike Lee Boston College fantastic sports information director in the shock clock era the first half that was the fewest points allowed in the history of Boston College basketball in the shot clock era the previous low 13 points against Villanova more than 30 years ago I dont remember that game I know I was out on the court you were on the court I was definitely on the court I certainly uh dont remember that I do remember having problems defending Ki KD so Im a little surprised that Villanova was the opponent but nonetheless its been really impressive defensive performance by Boston College as they continue just to chip a away points in the paint look Boston CS has not shot the ball great from the threepoint line three of 16 19 but theyve dominated points in the paint uh 30 points in the paint and they lead by 20 Burnham gets that to drop under 3 minutes left I think whats so impressed impressive about Boston Colleges performance tonight is it wasnt just that first half you know it be one thing if they put up that impressive first half but they have followed it up in this second half with an equally impressive defensive Music performance and offensively theyve done just enough Jaden Hastings with a rack attack hes had three big time slams tonight yeah its just been too easy really its been that type of night and you know really from the start of this game theyve really been the more really energetic and and dominant team in in particular in the paint as you take a look at this right here again unselfish play two feet in the paint and then Hastings with the Monster Jam our next gymnastics meet right here on acc Network at the ESPN app is Sunday afternoon ranked Stanford at Clemson dont miss it Sunday 4 East turn right here on acc Network full core pressure from Virginia Tech and Junior breaks Applause it we tick down to two minutes remaining Han junr heat check rims out Burnham lines up a three this fires the hoky shooting three of 18 from three just never got going offensively and you said it early Malcolm settled for too many jumpers and that three certainly falls into that category burnam makes up for it though the steel and hes foul tonights player of the game brought to you by carvana no surprise Donald Han Jr continuing to set that tone for Boston College this season yeah and we came into it talking about his play over the last six games and a guy that was averaging 24 points per game over the last six he got it going from the threepoint line but his ability to get into the paint and then finish over smaller Defenders it really he continues to impress Earl Grant and his staff deserve a lot of credit for the jump that he has made from last year to this Applause Music Applause Music year good pressure from the hokes and Junior here breaks the Press Boston College 70 seconds away from a critical Conference win keeps them alive for now Jaden Hastings finishes an impressive performance with an Applause alleyoop the question for Boston College is can you replicate this performance down the stretch and win enough conference games to make it into the ACC Music tournament well I think the biggest question in terms of replicating is their defensive output probably the best defensive game they played all year holding a very good offensive team in Virginia Tech to what they did in the first half it really was a career defensive effort for this BC defensive unit well think about this in the last six games Boston Colleges opponents were averaging more than 87 points per game and then you hold Virginia Tech to 36 that I that theres that is a statement performance defensively look we gave a player to game to Donald ham Jr deserving uh but for to me this game was about their defense they set the tone early on in this game and really one of the best defensive performance for Boston College and history made tonight by Earl Grant in Boston College this is the fewest points allowed in conference place since joining the ACC
