you mentioned last two of three were wins for the jackets 70 plus points in those three games that was the struggle in January for the jackets werent able to connect on some shots and was scoring in the 60s and 50s so good sign for Coach Pastor Florida Tech meanwhile theyve lost three straight they started the season 144 but theyve lost six of their last eight games last two were heartbreaking fashion the Florida Tech Panthers from Melbourne Florida facing Georgia Tech for the first official time from the Georgia Tech perspective as this game will count towards their record meanwhile Florida Tech this is an exhibition and their division two schedule is Lance Terry misses the floater and Florida Tech went to basketball for the first time a look at the Panthers starters a lot of veteran players misline up John three seniors a grad student and then a junior this is an experienced group theyre having a special season their most wins in over five years and the name to really look out for is Sean Haupt number 11 he leads the sun in the conference in points and that Triple Falls threenothing Florida Tech early Russell with the step back good looking shot theres a team that can score some points 76 points per game theyre exciting to watch the Panthers really like to get up and down the court they lead the Sun the Sun State conference since he was points allowed Sturdivant with a threepointer that shot has started to heat up for Kyle the last several games hes averaging 10 points a night over the last four and jackets lean sturdivants leadership hes the guy whos been there hes been on the court started many games in his career and then really stepped up over the course of the last five games ball to help he feeds it inside a wrestling battle for it and Debo Coleman creates the turnover hes coming off a careerhigh 21 points Kelly triggers a three and he buries it Miles Kelly had 15 in the win against the Hokies on and struggled he was in a scoring slump and off to a fast start with that triple Kellys last five games hes really been shooting the threewheel hes now 12 for his last 27 down low the layup wont fall added around offensive rebound for Nile Harris and he gets a couple of Second Chance points its an area where the jackets playing small of late with Jim on Franklin being the tallest frontman guy at six seven so they do give up some size on those nights uh the backboard taking care of the boards is important going Franklin well he might give up a few inches in height he has been dominant down low hes had backtoback double doubles hes enjoy Techs best player over this last four to five games and averaging a doubledouble over the last four as well and house threepointer swatted gets his own Miss and lays it in John house again his career at Bradley University the division one level in his third year at Florida Tech and averaging over 20 points a night hopped really has a nose for the ball hes Savvy Savvy basketball player sort of as three well short and Sean Russell senior from London England one of eight international players on this Florida Tech roster well tell you more about that a little later on but Billy Mims was an international basketball experience likes to recruit overseas as that jumper is off the front of the rim coach Mims has it figured out uh you know living in Florida coaching some hoops taking some recruiting travel overseas Ill trade sign me up hes got a pretty good gig Music Franklin faces up carry on the drive to be fouled first whistle of the night yeah Music fifth year at flintech hes the only Panther whos playing on this floor John that was in a scrimmage before the season began back in November of 2018 he played just 10 minutes but there were some other notable names in that exhibition Lance Terry hits the first free throw none more so than Jose Alvarado he had 12 points that night against Florida Tech and he seems to be doing pretty well right now isnt he John Pelicans uh they got a good one hes the competitor you see him on the ESPN highlights all the time hes having a great career so far in pelicans and the rising stars game MVP last night hit the gamewinning shot free throws will be a stat to watch the yellow jackets uh in the win against the Hokies uh limited the Hokies to eight freethrow attempts Georgia Tech percentagewise didnt shoot the ball well from the line there were 14 of 26 but getting to the line was important two threes dont go and now foul on the floor gonna go against Miles Kelly thats his first our officiating crew by the way Jerry heater Adam Flores Music good hands by Franklin quick passing and they find Noble down low on the weak side entry and what a pass by Martin brings up the assist Music Terry bounces right kick out to Kelly pass was off track and rebound cleared by Makai Noble and a loose ball Franklins on it three on one is going to be Jayvon from Sturdivant and Georgia Tech a threepoint lead Shavon grabbed the knee coming down from that one bigger Parts up by one Franklin bang knees on the end of that possession its like hes gonna shake it off hes taking a lot to get him off the floor lately he played 36 minutes on wins tonight in the win over Virginia Tech the Yellow Jacket scored an ACC season High 77 points long top of the key jumper Falls for Elias Martin Jr from Green Cove Florida Applause jackets only played seven players in their last outing coach pastner used to an eight or nine man rotation so short bench and one of those sevens with Jordan Matthew played just six minutes Coleman as we said a career high on Wednesday 21 points a big part of the threepoint assault from Georgia Tech they hit the 11 of 223 pointers eight the first half so far today theyre two or fourth long range Debo Colemans a guy that when he gets hot he can fill it 2 400 points in this high school ball down in Florida storied High School career fourstar recruit good get for coach passner a foul in the lane and thatll send us to break Florida Tech 1310 lead Music in a moment from a canvas Pavilion on a Saturday afternoon on the flats Music welcome back to McCandless Pavilion Florida Tech with a 1310 lead at our first media timeout alongside John Babel Im Wiley Ballard happy to have you with us no were almost as happy as he is former Yellow Jackets there on the floor Jordan Usher remember that AC s championship team in 2021 and Sylvester obanda is well sitting to his right in fact albonda we are told currently living with Joshua kogi as Josh plays for the Timberwolves they were over in Phoenix earlier this month Sturtevant steps inside the free throw line and hits so far Georgia Texan for their nine shots but the problem John has been very good on the glass rebounding negative seven um Panthers with the eight to one advantage and another stat Georgia Tech was uh four of their eight field goals in the first six minutes from Beyond The Arc and I think they got to be careful points in the paint especially early on could establish flow for the jackets off three offensive rebounds for the Panthers converted to six points and thats why the Panthers are leading by one there you see replay got him on the arm Music so how about the line shooting three misses the first Sean house senior from Danville Illinois began his career at Bradley University then he transferred to Florida Tech Music and Beyond Florida Tech being a great school that kind of considered themselves the stem University of Florida theyve got to find astronauts among their alumni but he he rather Seans Father Ted and Coach Mims had a relationship coach Mims recruited Seans father in Winthrop back in the 80s when coach Mims was an associate head coach in Winthrop and Ted ended up being an allconference player so coach Mims said well Ill take uh his son Sean and see what he can do and hes been all conference as well in his time at four to ten second generation recruiting hes got an advantage so the reason hes got 500 plus wins under his belt okay youve been rajada recruiting relationships coach Mims and halp left two with the line hes 88 freethrow shooter on the season you dont see that often and so Sean Russell does not bring it across the floor in time for midcourt I should say so Russell called for a 10second violation Lance Terry will inbound and Georgia Tech a chance to tie or take the lead but so far John this is a panther team again they can score and theyve got a lot of veteran players you mentioned it in their starting lineup they feature three seniors a junior and a grad student played a lot of basketball Moore missed a three on the last possession this time into the lane and hes blocked but also fouled that ones gonna go against Elias mark no they can score the basketball so very dangerous team averaged 76 points per game Georgia Tech theyve struggled this year shooting from the field 41 last in the ACC uh so scoring is kind of a chess match do you want to play Fast if youre a coach passner and try to keep up with these guys or youre just going to win and hang your hat on the defense which Georgia Tech has been very solid with especially over the last five games and you mentioned the pace of play for Florida Tech you look at the division two game and specifically the Sunshines deep Sunshine State Conference its more missing the second free throw but Franklin gets the offensive rebound hes been so good on the offensive glass that three wont fall more another offensive board he cant finish the layup and now a foul gonna go on Lance Terry thats gonna be a second but John Florida Tech averaging 77 points tonight but thats seven out of 11 teams in the Sunshine State conference that league as a whole plays extremely fast in fact the Panthers allowing 72 points tonight thats the lowest or the best in the Sunnyside state conference so its a slightly different brand basketball uh in that League Franklin with the SWAT and Id imagine thats the cell in that league for the head coaches hes trying to get you know youre recruiting a heavy Junior College um field out of Florida a lot of Juco recruits coming out of that state and uh it seems like theyre keeping a lot of them home and Coach Mims his roster theyre from everywhere its a global recruiting effort by hinas status Richard Stewart trainer for the yellow jackets gonna check on him Rich at his 16th year with the jackets 12 and a half to play here in the first half and Ill Sturdivant disrupting the long lob inbounds but not a bad sell if youre recruiting for the Panthers you know he cut Florida with the warm weather Great academic school and then youre gonna play Fast Everyone likes that those thats oh yeah its the trifecta and recruiting right there its a good sell its a pretty tough league as well with Nova Southeastern in there theyre one of the top teams in all of division two eight to shoot tough hook but right there waiting Elias Martin hes now got four points and its a threepoint lead for Florida Tech right around the 12 minute Mark here in the first half an eight of 16 Panther points coming on those Second Chance opportunities Jordan Mecca with the ball and he tried to lay it off to Miles Kelly Miles looked away and thats gonna be a turnover for the yellow jackets thats their first and well step aside Florida Tech shooting 50 from the floor of the Panthers on the road the ACC not deterred we got a tight one here inside McCandless Pavilion Yellow Jackets ahead by one and John each team has been using a different recipe though to score offensively yeah Second Chance points obviously we spoke about it earlier Florida Tech 10 second chance points to Georgia Tech zero on the other side of things Georgia Techs defense turning over the Panthers five turnovers converted to 11 points they have a plus nine advantage on points off turnovers were in a tight match shootings about equal 43 44 from the Field Georgia Tech shoot the ball a little bit better for Beyond The Arc 5 of 10 now for the jackets for 50 percent one similarity both teams have gotten some pretty balanced scoring six different yellow jackets with a made field goal today and Florida Tech has had five different scores of their own already in the early going and thats been the strength of the jackets uh right now they have seven assists on eight made field goals so unselfish play moving the basketball getting good shots against just two turnovers Kelly trying to find some space on Sam Grant who has checked in for the first time in a turnover has to get the ball off to John turgen getting his first minutes of play this afternoon as well Applause already had nine lead changes today Joe Florida Tech looking for a 10 and they got it so Sean Russell senior from London England as we mentioned out averaging over 20 points Russells averaging over 19 per game this year he also is second in all division two basketball and assists Colemans three wont fall Alp gets the rebound and Russells coming off a 21 Point outing uh on February 15th at Embry Riddle so hes playing well yeah he and how both dropped 21 that night and a loss game they had a chance to tie in the final seconds and Russell missed four games in early February to an injury so see him back out here contributing shot clock winding down Franklin with the pick from behind another turnover three on two Kellys three way to Mark its an air ball Music oon in Florida Tech to lead the basketball under six to play in the first half Kelly just put a little bit too much into it had the shoulders squared everything looked good until the result the ball this might be on Lance Terry no its gonna be on Jalen Moore Applause first Music from Birmingham Alabama he had seven points and three assists in the win on Wednesday night entry three balls off the side of the backboard and Terry brings it across for the yellow jackets Music Franklin faces up on Graham Music jackets have hit five threes today Coleman looking for a sixth short Franklins got the rebound the lane clears and he cant lay it in Jalen Moore with some bounceoffs in two Georgia Tech getting in on the second chance points using their athleticism Music Corner Tech had a good defensive possession going they switch everything on the perimeter good length switch at least one per four so they keep offensive players in front of them on those switches but give up some size when youre switching Applause Thompson transfer from Southeast Missouri State he turns it over and Jalen Moore foul on his way down the floor nice to Sean Russell 16 fouls now Russell heady play stop the break I think he knew what was behind him which was nothing so high IQ give one take one for the team Applause and Dara OSullivan Junior from Cork Ireland finished his prep career to Winchendon School in Massachusetts Music and theyre saying its deflected so no backcourt violation the seconds on the shocks watch more driving and doesnt get the roll but he will go to the line Music shots and John we talked a couple times about the international flavor of this Florida Tech Team because they have another sub checking in this is going to be Merit its more makes the first free throw but theyve got eight International Players theyve got three from England one from Ireland those are easy to explain coach Mims coached in the British basketball league for nine Seasons won multiple championships also spending your coaching in Ireland for the Neptune Basketball Club way back in the mid 80s and theyve also got representation from Australia turkey and then two players from Greece all in Melbourne Florida they got more players from Europe than they do from Florida and poked out of bounds by Stephen Merritt Music jackets will have a chance to create some separation here its been its been a tight one in the first half weve seen 11 lead changes the largest lead for either team is four points that was by Georgia Tech Music the Georgia Techs lineup right now am I gonna have to division two level that size has been impactful in the rebounding College absolutely and then Georgia Tech Im the defensive side of things doing the job defending the threepoint line Panthers two of nine from three held to 25 points with four minutes to go in the first half and were talking about a team that scores 76 points per outing and Liz Terry eye off the glass hes now gone seven points tied for the lead of Jalen Moore on the Yellow Jacket side Sean Russell has seven more Terry trying to trap and force another turnover dont sleep on Terrys athleticism hes solid playing downhill likes to play Fast very athletic good bounce had the gamewinning tip uh tip in at the end of the Notre Dame game last week uh hes playing great basketball Frans got to let it go the end of the clock Moore thought he had another rebound and itll belong to Georgia Tech the fivepoint Edge for the yellow jackets three minutes 19 seconds left in the first half 60 run Music for them been a tight game so far the yellow jackets with the largest lead of the afternoon John what does stuck got to see about this first half both teams have the lead for Music to watch yeah Georgia Techs been able to manufacture some offense through the turnovers uh they have a 100 advantage and fast break points so nothing easy seems to be the theme Florida Techs having to earn every basket whether thats an offensive putback theyve only been to the line three times on the one foul on how it will choose one of three so Georgia Texas been solid defensively uh holding Panthers two of nine from Beyond The Arc and just 40 from the floor and thats been a staple for the jackets this season as his defense Florida Tech has not scored in nearly four minutes as Techs 60 run has given them a five point Edge Lance Terry works it back around Coleman penetrating too strong and the rebounds seized by Dara OSullivan oh Music Applause Music Applause all right their leading scorer trying to create nothing DeSean Russell launches a long three Franklins got the rebound one and done for Florida Tech they have hit just two of their 103s and a turnover on the yellow jacket in Mr and those are the plays that that will drive coach pastner nuts just the unforced error youve got veterans on the floor a ton of minutes were in late February playing basketball here and youve got a chance to stretch the lead to maybe seven or eight going into the half and now could be a one possession game if Panthers can convert Music 50 Mark in this first half and a turnover on the Florida Tech side Thrones from the Panthers bench assistants want to take a review at it oh the extended defense by the jackets The Zone stretching out great length on the perimeter active hands forcing the error by OSullivan Franklin good cut for Miles Kelly and a great pass its one of the sharper offensive sequences weve seen from Tech today as their lead is up to a game high seven points 80 run yeah the execution on the cut just really good fundamental basketball a hard cut he sold the fake and then Franklin with a nice twohanded bounce pass in traffic for two outstanding possession for the jackets here you see eye contact Kelly got the defense to fall asleep and add just a crisp hard cut to the basket very simple basketball but very effective he leads the jackets over their last four and scoring rebounding blocking shots and assists I mean he has dominated every column with a box score the last couple of weeks shashawn Russell aggressive Up and Under trying to find a way that wont fall over five minutes without a point for Florida Tech Yellow Jackets continuing their push to extend the lead and lands Terry sinks a three 110 run Georgia Tech Terry had about four or five bounces stretch the D settled no one checked him he said I got it give me three tank has hit six three pointers in the opening half from the logo no Kellys got the rebound and thats one big difference in the second half of this first half if you will Georgia Tech taking care of business on the defensive glass Music and with nine missed threepoint field attempts theres some long boards so Georgia Tech has responded Applause another assist for Jayvon Applause thats his third today 10 assists on 13 makes for the yellow jackets as a team final 30 seconds in the first half shashawn Russell is fouled going up Coleman was there but he had Happy Feet was moving laterally he kept the verticality with his hands hands over his head but with the body picked up the foul jackets up 12 28 seconds remain Panthers desperately need a bucket to keep this one close Music attack still looking for their first points since the 650 Mark they have missed their last six shots three turnovers mixed in there as well Music Russell Lane 88 free throw shooter and he hits it so six minutes and 22 seconds without a bucket now Georgia Tech ahead by 11 can hold for the final shot of the first half Music Applause and John offensively its been similar to what we saw on Wednesday night Music Georgia Tech hit eight threes in the first half I think this is the team Coach master thought if he was going to have earlier this year shooting the ball well up by 11 Music oh man thats cool Im really liking what youre doing with this overall shape shes a little shy right now she understands shes being painted opening shot a car comes in to the front oh Bernie come on yes are you goofing no yes Im good at this Music look at our officiating crew reviewing the Georgia Techs last threepointer about a minute ago they want to confirm I believe it was Terry and his foot not on the line so itll either be an 11 point or a 10 point lead for Georgia Tech your guy Jerry heater John hes focused styled in right there look at that gonna get it right Peter veteran official in the ACC what do they got while in here thats what I had Music one more look at it here yep oh yeah four or five inches that was easy maybe Jerry just wanted to come by and say hello to you but were right next to the replay monitor Music so 18 seconds Music Yellow Jackets looking for one more bucket 131 run to close out the final five minutes of this first half for Georgia Tech Terry rejects the ball screen down the lane lost control of the basketball and now four attacks yet enough time to get down the floor and so they can get this to single digits yeah Terry went a little early on that one was still 39 on the clock so certainly Panthers will get a good look if they can execute because it went out of bounds they get a chance to inbound it shashawn Russell mid Court ahead threepointer from the corner off the backboard and in they say it counts from John turgen just a 21 threepoint shooter they will review it oh clearly away Target go bank shot from the deep corner I dont even know how you do that high off the right was this weekend and some teams will just not play a game at all others want to play and Josh pastner has always wanted to play a game in the midst of conference play and its kind of hard to find a division one opponent this time of year John only two division one independents are playing this year Chicago State and Hartford so slim pickings Florida Tech meanwhile they had a Buy in their conference schedule and Georgia Tech had to come on up here and the Panthers begin its a twopoint bucket out of the half and all of a sudden after they went scoreless for about six and a half minutes theyve scored six points in the last 90 seconds or so and the yellow jackets Will Go On The Road to face uh another good looking Panther team on Tuesday evening Wiley heading up to Pittsburgh first place in the ACC and Javon Franklin with a loud response and leads back tonight we saw coach Mims he had he wasnt aware that the score threepointer at the buzzer was changed to a two and he was getting clarification on that flying a little pressure here well beyond the arc and down this right left side of the lane weve got a foul its gonna be on Javon Franklin thats his first yeah and thats uh thats really where Florida Tech needs to attack that high post area cant really play laterally east to west against this Georgia Tech Zone defense you got to put the ball on the ground be aggressive and get into the seams so thats on the free throw from Makai Noble in his fifth year at Florida Tech from Jacksonville hes now got six points Applause Music in a pretty freeflowing game so far both teams are just six free throw attempts Music communication and Jayvon Franklin takes off down the runway Music kainoble fought thought he had the switch on that play and Florida Tech has remained committed to the mantoman defense they switch a lot on the perimeter and just to break down in communication on that possession a threepoint try off the back side of the rim in transition lands Terry showing off his vertical and all of a sudden the yellow jackets have pinned their ears back John yeah fast break offense getting out one pass ahead playing downhill Georgia Tech looking good offensively an answer from sashawn Russell now itll turn over there for Florida Tech and theyve put together a quick 50 run the leads down to six Applause and Russell now leads all scorers for the Panthers with 11 hes averaging 192 on the season Applause Franklin sturdivin Music low post entry Franklin lost it off his feet Music Applause Music and Russell called for the offensive foul Applause Music thats his second foul so Lance Terry leading the jackets with 12 points uh but getting it done on the defensive side of the ball too moving the feet takes the charge Applause Music Panthers hanging around six point game Wiley Applause lead for Georgia Tech as been as large as 12 Sturdivant Music Coleman trying to get a step he finds one nice pass to Franklin right with Red Basket Kai Noble quit on the play gave up the position of Franklin Debo with the nice shuffle pass Franklin two more Franklin now with 87 rebounds how trying to complete a threepoint play yeah go to the line the third foul on Terry second home team this second half mentioned Sean Howe his father played at Winthrop was recruited by coach Mims his sister is in her second year of Mercer down in Macon about an hour and a half South a year this top hits the free throw she was the Southern Conference player of the year pretty good basketball family youve got their father Ted all Big South Conference at Winthrop Sean a start forward attacking that was Sister Aaron the top players in the Southern Conference Compton 88 freethrow shooter 33 points at Eckerd early on in February and in that game was 16 of 19 from the freethrow line there was a sibling rivalry in the backyard and that family dad and sister and Sean going at it from the freethrow line oh I have no doubt how this second in the conference of free throw shooting also in the top five and free throws attempted and before the layin theyre gonna say Nobles foot was on the Baseline so he steps out of bounds Music jackets hit their last five shots you know something about uh driveway basketball battles growing up oh yeah I had an identical twin brother Mike was Player of the Year in the state of Massachusetts 9596 uh we had our fair share of oneonone battles in the backyard thats for sure I dont care who is playing here in Massachusetts I want to know who came out less bloodied after a battle in the driveway are you you guys never threw elbows did you he went to UMass played for John calipero he was recruited by Coach Cal never played for cow Cal went on to uh coach with the Nets in the NBA but when I went home from Georgia Tech after battling Matt harpering uh every day in practice I think I got the best of Mike in the backyard battles I was ready for him and a travel and what I know were being told by coach Mims only that was his fault I think nothing Nobles arguing that people worry just walking eightpoint lead for Georgia Tech well be back in a minute from a chemistry Im your glitchy WiFi which means your smart home yeah but weve seen some Rim rocking here in the first few minutes of this second half and John this is looking like air Babel out there Georgia Tech I dont know about that thats generous thank you I had a couple though uh Im no doubt but Panthers credit the Panthers hanging around theyve theyre taking Georgia Techs punch they have a plus one advantage through uh just under five minutes in the first half so hanging around veteran team credit to coach Mims and and then this team for sticking around theyve got 16 wins on the season Wiley theyre not going to shake easy Music Muhammad always listed you as one of his Inspirations so I figured at least had a few if I if I had hops like Ishmael Muhammad I might have played for some money Wiley Music oh I wasnt that lucky what a fun team that was though the uh the 2004 2005 jackets that went to the National Championship oh 304 lost to Uconn and a tough game but beat Oklahoma State legendary coach Eddie Sutton final four was in San Antonio Under head coach Paul Hewitt Applause way up there Kelly saves it Music hard to believe 20th anniversary is coming up next year for that team Debo Colemans three connecting great cat in the seventh three of the night for Georgia Tech they continue last off from free John theyve hit over 40 percent of their threes 41 in the last five games including today dude what Ive really noticed is the high quality shots too Inside Out penetration making the extra pass the good to great um solid offense you know I think coach pass would probably say that they got some similarly quality looks at times this year and they just did not knock them down that loss of Louisville comes to mind along the floor I really like what coach pastors done with you know finding his top seven in a rotation sometimes eight uh as a player when youre getting 25 26 minutes in a game youre gonna find Rhythm and the five guys that are out there are gonna get comfortable playing with each other and you can see that in text basketball the last five games oh philosophically ghost passers always said he likes to play you know a limited bench in his 13 years 14 years now as a head coach Lance Terry with 14 points I think the challenge early on in the season was you know outside of Miles Kelly it was just tough to figure out you know who was going to produce for you who could be in those five or six spots in the main rotation fouls can be on Franklin seconds it was a big thing when the legendary coach Bobby crumbles who recruited me his his thing was if youre in my top seven he goes Im only gonna play seven he showed the stats when hes on the home visit and say you know if you come here youre going to play Youre gonna have an opportunity to win and that was his you know point of differentiation you know recruiting against the shashevskis and the dean Smiths and then Bobby had a heck of a career put 25 plus players in the NBA and three ACC titles but that was his thing you know if you come here and play for me youre going to be my guy and there was a trust Factor built in the recruiting Journey coach Mims giving us his thoughts on the officiating tonight Lance Terry coach Mims is all over it were not arguing that there was a foul on that last possession he had it saw Florida Tech with six and a half were picking part in Florida Tech had a six minute and 22 second run without a point in the first half and that ball was saved Georgia Tech thought that was destined for the bleachers off the airball bounce and now a turnover Terry to more and its a game thats been played from the rafters here in the second half Applause you said it all Wiley Georgia Tech attacking the rim sharing the basketball getting out filling Lanes solid basketball I dont know if Ive ever seen that Billy Mims had about a 30second dialogue with us and I said hey Jerry heaters right across from us to go talk to Jerry we you know like we cant help you Music he is enjoying it here maybe not the officiating but again A Sentimental trip for him wearing that gold tie in honor of Bobby Crimson guy gave him this start as a Player working the Bobby Trumans layup challenge camps Jalen Moore is finding a way to connect here Music Sean Russells gonna need to hit a few more of those threes hes already free for six today to try and get four Tech back in this 14 points is close to the largest deficit in Florida Tech has faced this afternoon coach Mims has had tremendous success in this program 18 years at Florida Tech 31 allconference players so thats consistency over time and what a legend Yellow Jackets ahead by 14 another media timeout here in Atlanta Music Giorgio look demo Coleman has sent a new career high with five assists Music 22 makes turn the ball over only eight times and the real story in the last 15 minutes or so of gameplay dating back to the first half Jonathan more to take his had some pretty serious scoring

that a is playing a game that doesnt count in the record although I didnt play him on the road at Mason C school with accounts or not you got a chance to make a pretty great memory Sean Russell cant get his laugh but theyve also lost a couple of heartbreaking games they dropped one of the final seconds last time out that was against Henry riddle lost to Palm Beach Atlantic on a buzzer beater before that Coleman from the logo a little bit of a heat check cant fault Russell fading away and hes fouled as Franklin lost his balance Javon helps him up I cant relate while I I never took a heat check shot I was never hot uh I dont know what thats like dont tell Mike that good sportsmanship Debo helps helps up Russell Russell goes to the line good free throw shooter shooting 87 on the season

basketball he had one Redshirt season that got the extra year also because of kovid its been in Auburn Junior College South Alabama and this will be the final run of his college careers out of Eligibility but hes been a special player for the yellow jackets as he wraps up his time in the NCAA Ambassador he gets the most out of his ability I mean look at the game hes having 13 rebounds to go with his 13 points four assists hes only got one turnover its in great condition hes played 29 minutes in this one and noses rolled the value of knowing your role Music against Kyle Sturtevant there just rushing the shot his team point lead holding their largest lead in the game right now Music Florida Tech kept it close for a while Georgia Techs trying to put them away 6 32 remaining see if Russell can change that Applause we had 11 lead changes in this one but they all gained before the six minute Mark of the first half and it was real back and forth early the Florida Tech who was shooting 50 percent from the field they had seven of their first 14 shots they fit just 11 of 36 Cents thats a 31 percent moving from the jackets Beyond The Arc Baseline cut for Moore lost the handle good hands down low I think that was Nile Harris the layup is good for John turgen sophomore from Istanbul under six to play and Kelly teardrop Target was a little bit slow stepping up too easy now I know the fourth yellowjacking double figures there are five Tech players averaging ten points or more in the last four games behind the back feed Moore couldnt handle it from Sturtevant as that might have caught Jalen by surprise theres an itchy pass Music to stick with Georgia Tech job defensively coming over to help Franklin was spinning thought he had the covered bear there for the dunk but good defensive effort by Mark Music a bounce situation 21 on the shot clock 5 26 on the game clock Terry swatted the first time on the other end of the trim plays it in Terry padno stats now 19 points four rebounds Music get that second shift Point discrepancy which was so large to start the games five to play in the second half house step back Franklin seals him off Russell will have the pass come out funky and thats gonna be an intentional foul on Russell as he tried to grab Miles Kellys Jersey so two free throws in the basketball coming for the yellow jackets Music George Tech up 17 now you feel like this ones the bag Wiley they got it total control right now it feels pretty good here Kelly gonna get a couple of free throws Applause attempts from the line Georgia Tech youre most encouraged by the way you shot the ball in the way your defense locked down after the opening 15 minutes absolutely in a game where the Panthers kind of want every 50 50 ball in the first 10 minutes uh through the first punch Yellow Jackets settled in and have been consistent for about 25 minutes in this one and just dominant Music and stylistically uh the Panthers playing mantoman in the half court really picking up at the threepoint line and you dont feel like they really have anything to to bring to the jackets to get the game Pace going in their favor it was up and down those first 10 minutes is Pullman tried to go up at the end of the shot clock and a big block that time from Elias Martin he said hes one of the tops in division two basketball and blocking shots I think well know when coach passner thinks that this game is willing him when we start seeing a few more subs off the bench I agree with that with the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets uh statistics are on their side when they crack 70 points they are eight and two so theyre looking to make it nine and two on the season when scoring 70 points in the game most importantly theyve now hit the 70 point mark in fourth grade Sturdivant catch and shoot three and hes swirls at home now I got eight points and you mentioned earlier 77 was the season high in an ACC in an ACC game yes Music good job NFL on the floor Sturtevant and Russell were going at it time now Russell will go to the line for a one and one when we come back Georgia Tech in control a third straight that rocking chair would look great Georgia Tech in control is beginning to close this one out final three minutes 44 seconds Sean Russell shoot the one and one Music for Georgia Tech friend Paul maganskis and Jordan Mecca return what are some of those seven you were talking about and the front end is no good Morris got the rebounds Georgia Tech will hit the road Tuesday night taking on First Place Pittsburgh Simon in the final home game of the season is a week from today against Louisville more a threepointer thatll be something he wants to work on in the off season Im sure John hes taking a lot of Threes but it has not hit many this year just four for 31 now on the season by the way Pittsburgh taking on Virginia Tech this afternoon at five oclock Shaws delivered that time from John Target our regular Sean pouch up now and double figures just three of ten from the four today one of six has struggled from Beyond The Arc credit Georgia Techs perimeter defense how coming in as leading scorer Georgia Tech uh answered the Bell on assignment defense 2120 is their last time out tough angle more the off jail and Moore this is the form we saw him against NC State back when the Wolfpack came here in midJanuary also Syracuse hed be a nice addition to the offense to get going for the final four games of the year for Georgia Tech Music Moore has six rebounds to go with his 15 points hes six of 11 from the field again you mentioned it he hasnt shot the ball well from Beyond The Arc of two but this is where hes strong hitting the boards finishing around the basket using his size strength and athleticism those points he scored since that NC State game here in Atlanta over a month ago Music I fell on the screens gonna be charged to more attack theyve got two games left first of which is going to be against last place Lynn University Wednesday night in Melbourne Florida they got a lot to be proud of this season as well they won their most games since 2017 or 15 first winning season period theyll have weigh in that time Kyle Harris Music like Miles Kelly fell asleep defensively on that possession Georgia Tech final minute and a half Fred Paul baganskis well find that in the film session I dont think he will either ball Vegas hits the three and now a ton of substitutions Carol martinov in for Georgia Tech Florida Tech has gonna get a whole new five out there Music nice looking triple shoulder Square nice high release goodlooking Prospect Applause and now Coleman Boyd getting the chance to check in for Georgia Tech and Coleman of senior this year this could potentially be his final minutes on the floor opportunity for him again the new players for Florida Tech he got Hakeem of G with the basketball in his hands pulls it off to Donovan Murphy also a threepointer from Dara Sullivan and theyre also getting our first look at George Nema as well as steel Cleveland oh Braden Daniels as well checking in Florida Tech wants a timeout Music yellow jackets John the way this team has been playing the yellow jackets over the last five games now you look at the remaining schedule the ACC good luck because we all know before Music 3 and 13 and only got four more conference games left three on the road missing Pittsburgh and Louisville then after that youve got Syracuse and Boston College Pittsburgh will be a tough assignment no doubt but you got to feel like the way this team is playing they have a chance to you know win a couple Road games absolutely and its one day at a time you focus on the controllable things you know focus on what you cant control show up day to day work hard team is obviously buying in with uh chemistry sharing the basketball we saw today again defense has remained consistent holding the Panthers to 38 from the field 19 in threepoint land uh if you if you defend and rebound the basketball and the shooting has been coming along at the Georgia Tech team that has struggled mightily shooting the basketball just 41 from the field on the season but through the last five or six games Wally you said it theyre playing better theyre clicking offensively and theyve found the right mix Music possessions in them here a lot in the end centered basketball circles as jamonte Hill is in the game for Georgia Tech but the yellow jackets have hit 100 points per 100 possessions in three straight games and I would guess theyre right around that Mark here today oh well no officially until afterwards threepointer from Daniels Way Off the Mark for the tech could be their final possession of the afternoon Daniels got a little excited we might have to check that check that backboard make sure its ready for next week against the cards some shots I used to throw up in practice here to be fair he did see that shot at the end of the first half fall four Music Applause was Elias Martin I think you hit that long too hey no no disrespect to Daniels thats tough sitting on the bench for 39 minutes men just come in and first touch get a three up and its not easy thats why I always miss my shots second free throw coming from akima G out of New York its the second Georgia Tech and bring it across the timeline and they can dribble it out the rest of the way if they choose Daniels wants the jumper fly trying to redeem himself there in airball threepointer thats an air ball and perhaps its about time to call it a day Hill dumps it home jervante hill with a big finish to close it out and your final score Georgia Tech 79 Florida Tech 56 Babel the yellowjack gets picked up right where they left off on Wednesday and they sleep the week of tech if you will taking down Virginia Tech Wednesday and Florida Tech today yeah Yellow Jackets do what they have to do they take care of home and build on momentum consecutive wins as they go on the road and face the Pittsburgh Panthers number
