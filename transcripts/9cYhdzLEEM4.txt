interior game has to be able to get established early and I think they got to move the ball you got to get Georgia Tekken rotation defensively and I think Wake Forest plays its best when its playing off assisted baskets off the pass and the deakes have to get Hunter Salis going on offense right he had 18 points total the last two games combined he averages 18 I expect them to get him some early offense and here he is with the basketball number 23 in white among the league leaders in scoring at 181 points per game that checks in at fifth in the ACC heres Fon Reed the Gonzaga transfer working his way into the paint five on the shot clock puts it up good defense Inside by Tech Dongo doing a good job of Walling up and Fon Reeds got to finish that play hes got the size Advantage inside freshman to freshman Nathan George found by Dongo inside but he lost the handle 15 on the shot clock Nathan George one of those goodlooking freshman point guards this is a Georgia Tech team that will play side to side theyre very ball screen heavy in their offense two to shoot George has to put it up long rebound Tracked Down by Tech out to Kelly and Miles Kelly with a clean look the Junior from Stone Mountain Georgia has the jackets on the board Applause first well this is the 20th consecutive game ST Force has started this lineup mopy Miller at the point cam hildr H Salis along with Andrew Carr and Fon Reed and there are the two freshman weve talked about Dongo inside George outside what an infusion of talent they have brought into Georgia Tech this year Miles Kelly seeing a big basket early backto back triples and Steve Forbes is going to whistle an early timeout with the early timeout well take the break as well andll be back to the Joel in 30 seconds when youre great your game does the talk in the ACCC our speaks volume three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament win since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one most of any kind its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC AC less than two minutes in Steve Forbes already using a timeout I love it I mean Georgia Tech gets two offensive rebounds and two triples so Steve Forbes is just making sure his guys are ready to play right lets make sure we stick with the game plan got to get on the glass cam hildr left it short rebound ripped down by my Kelly hes not shoted as well this year as he did a season ago but has looked good so far tonight has all six points for Georgia te kapari kicks to the corner N9 nothing start as kaasi Reeves buries it from the corner Georgia Tech works on that all shoot around two to the ball short roll kick to the corner open triple they drill it constantly Applause and kaazi Reeves has really shot it well against ACC opponents this year 41 and going up car off the mark one and done Reeves rips it down settling for jump shots not trying to get in the Gap and trying to make a play for someone else somehow early on weight Force needs to make the game easier for their teammates offensive foul to far gari with the illegal screen he has been a real boost for Coach doys team hes in the last four games averaged 97 rebounds hes Bounty hes active does a lot of good things thats the way you would describe Georgia Tech Doug this is not a team that has a lot of size up front but theyre long and athletic theyre very active and theyre very connected on the defensive end and again dont think about the yellow jackets overall record 13 and 16 down the standings in the ACC they are dangerous having beaten a lot of good teams and they are playing their best basketball right now looking for a third straight win as bopy Miller throws it out of bounds Georgia Tech has won three of its last four and you know Debbie as well as anybody the basketball season is long its four plus months and you either get better or you get worse and this is a Georgia Tech team that has gotten better since November they have gotten better and part of it is because of the play right here of number two the point guard on the top of the floor boy Nathan George has been a brilliant surprise and he has worked himself into being one of the top point guards in the ACC as just a fresh four triples to start the game on fire Georgia Tech gari is only a 177 threepoint shooter throw the numbers out the window 12 nothing start for tack well you think about the difference in the energy in the building from the last time week was here that packed house against Duke with a 900 tip we just dont have anywhere near a capacity crowd and so if youre the Demon Deacons you got to bring your own energy you have to do it yourself well Steve Forbes already burned one time out to kind of wake up his guys I dont see him doing another one right here I mean theyre going to have to work it out and the crowds trying to give him a lift Wake Forest has missed all four of it shot attempts Salis back to Miller off the shot Applause fake Kelly tries to stay with s knocks it away here comes Tech George throws it in the air a little too tall for Dango and it goes out of bounds twice wake tries to attack the Gap both times Georgia Tech gets the steal the three is falling for Georgia Tech early late on the close out four trip at the Joel he has made both of his threes when these two teams met a month ago in Atlanta Georgia Tech made only three threes the entire game theyve already got four and heres a look at tonights play Spotlight brought to you by carvana Kelly has delivered early Debbie I think his maturity All Season continues to grow I think he is uh on my third Team all ACC I think hes earned it by his play and I love his start and his energy early on you mentioned three triples the whole game Georgia Tech only had eight field goals the first half in the the last time these two teams met theyve already got four four into the game Parker Frederickson missed fires from the corner its been pretty much all three balls for Wake Forest to start the ball game and I think thats what theyve been settling for and theyve got to make Georgia Tech play some defense move the ball for some close outs tough running shot by Nate George his first two you alluded to his journey as a late sinee to reclassify and join Georgia Tech right before the start the fall semester didnt play in the first three games the idea was that he was likely going to red shirt he was expecting that he was going to have a small roll of red shirt but uh he has blossomed into a guy do you have him on your all rookie team I sure do I think hes fantastic and now that Kyle sturen is in the game I think the two of them play well together and I think its a good combination of the speed the athleticism the length of George and then the calmness the veteran experience of ster it yeah what a uh as Frederickson has it roll out off the fingertips of Claude And so weak will keep it its not a foregone conclusion that a senior Kyle Sturdivant is just going to hand over the Reigns and be a mentor as he has its worked out beautifully this year its its really good how connected theyve been how mature Kyle sturen has handled his role and how hes blossomed in this role his numbers are as good as theyve ever been Carr has his pocket picked by stur ofan wake recovers and hes been a big piece of such a productive bench for Tech second in the league in points per game coming off the it Hunter Salis finally gets wake on the board and the quick answer at the other end by George Tech theres that explosion up the floor by George ACH how quick they are off their feet how quickly they respond out of the net Salis being proactive earns himself a trip to the line see I like Hunter Salis coming off that timeout not settling for the jump shot dribbling into a switch the first basket the second basket here for him or the second opportunity of getting to the free throw line attacking early in transition here is Salis the Junior from Omaha Nebraska five star who went to Gonzaga spent a couple of years with the zags and its just the latest transfer into w Forest that has flourished under the direction of Steve Forest I read a great story about him today about he played 17 minutes a game against Gaga he played a lot of Defense he didnt have confidence on the offensive end he knew he could get minutes if he played D Steve Forbes has infused all kinds of confidence in him when he was in the portal coach fores was the first one to get to him in Spokane and when they watched games on film they saw wake Force turn the ball over but coach for never getting upset about it he let players play through their mistakes and that was one of the reasons why he wanted to play for Forbes another tough shot by Nathan George the Freshman now with four points and here is Salis you know Mothers Day is not that far from now he is a thoughtful young man who on Mothers Day 2020 Hunter wrote a beautiful letter to his mom Jessica Haynes Jackson on espnwcom and if you havent read it I encourage you to Google it you talk about a competitive player you should have seen his mother play she was something Applause else Sun Passes off to Carr who puts up an airball it goes out of bounds good break for Wake Forest to retain possession with 34 remaining on the shot clock you know I think sometimes you have to change the rhythm of your team on the defensive end when things arent going well offensively so Im looking for Coach Forbes here maybe to do something differently with his team on the defensive end maybe they can pick up full court and get a get their sweat going because theyve not stopped the ball up the floor yet Georgia Tech has been able to push a rare Miss for Georgia Tech now six for eight from the floor to begin the ball game I like that Sals trying to take the game in his hands right now right well he referenced his mom Jessica Haynes was a star at San Diego State played in the WNBA with the Utah Stars Applause stament draws the double Music team Miles Kelly again comes in 32 on the year he is three for three and the lead is 17 miles Kelly shoot till your arm falls off young man keep hunting shots thats his third threepointer fifth for the team Matthew Marsh has come into the ball game for the deakes Salis dumps it off to number 33 he draws the foul we head to the free throw line the Junior from England who has rarely gone to the free throw line this year just one for two I love the naked side Twan game and a hard roll to the rim by Marsh dribble hand off Kelly gets his feet under his shoulders late on the close out and then this is Marsh the sevenfooter going strong to the rim to earn a tri to the free throw line that is the second foul on Tara gari as Marsh at 7 fe1 misfires badly he took a big jump last year as a sophomore he shot 88 from the floor thats pretty good probably 80 of those were dunks of course he has had a little bit more of a diminished role through the mid part of the season but his role is starting to add to the depth of what white forest wants to do he can be punishing on the front line and of course this team was changed with Fon Reeds addition the transfer from Gonzaga join the team of the game against NJIT and really changed the complexion thats another aspect of the uh the bubble talk that we hear about does Wake Forest get more consideration because of the fact that they played the first quarter of their season without one of the better players well the first seven games they played without him and I was fortunate enough to cover their team in the Charleston classic so I watch them without Fon Reed they are a completely different team with him on the floor thats the one thing about the net and some of the metrics is theres no room for the eye test on Improvement how much teams get better Fon Reed has made this team better first two points off the bounce from Cameron hildr 20 217 great force doing a good job of speeding up the game right now on the defensive end bringing two to the ball doing a good job of tagging from the weak side stur ofan offensive rebound no Dongo lost it out of bounds he was the last to touch and so the Demon Deacons trying to protect an undefeated home regular season down by 14 still very early here in Winston Salem I bought three of the same jacket to get the fourth free I subscribed to get a deal on these memory supplements then forgot to cancel well you know recognizing a bad deal is a part of the journey yes Eva would you like to share your breakthrough I got ATTs best deal on the new Samsung Galaxy s24 plus and got to choose my plan yes we dont make you sign up for the top tier plan to get our best deal I still havent gone I subscribe get the newest Galaxy on us with any of our best plans guarant Sunday well have the ACC wrestling championship from carmichel in Chapel Hill coverage of the finals begins at 7 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Sean Kenny and Anthony ress will be on the call we are here in Winston Salem North Carolina Doug Sherman Debbie Antonelli Georgia Tech off to a flying start over Wake Forest in this rematch where in the last meeting it was a completely different circumstance than what were seeing here tonight DB yeah well eight baskets for Georgia Tech tonight five of which are assisted Wake Forest has two buckets no assists and theyre 0 for six from the threepoint line I think they might play through Fon Reed right here on this possession coming off the timeout again wake usually doesnt have trouble scoring the basketball 79 points a game is third best in the league behind only Caroline and Duke theyre second in both shooting percentage and threepoint percentage but theyve not been able to knock down their jump shots to start tonight poopy Miller turns it over here comes Coleman right to the bucket its another two points in transition and now weve got the official calling time making sure everybodys okay IBO Coleman went down but he hopped right back up seems to be all right I mean this is just a a good job by Debo Coleman look how hes up the line makes that steal poopys got to do a better job of getting in the Gap and then revers the basketball or reverse it quickly up from the Music top here they get the ball to Fon Reed the double never comes he puts up an airball with that left hand N9 minutes in Miles Kelly whos perfect three for three gets the ball out of his hands Stan knocked to the ground and the foul is going to go against poopy Miller it feels to me like Wake Forest is a half a pass late on every movement of the ball like either theyre overh helping or Georgia Tech is doing such a good job of reversing sides of the floor I mean they are putting it the pass on the money and they are moving the ball and they are moving through the weight Force defense getting a piece of the pain on their cuts by the way that was just the first team foul against Wake Forest here tonight 9 minutes into the Applause game Applause Dongo steps back puts up a long three and buries it just the fourth made threepoint shot for the Freshman from sagol this year I mean everyones knocking down triples for Georgia Tech three for 10 coming into the game we expect him to get rebounds we expect him to block shots we dont expect him to step out and hit that three to create the largest lead of the night off the bounce Miller Reed back Applause Taps Salis Applause foul and uh our first notice of Teddy Valentine he did not like what he was seeing or hearing from the Georgia Tech bench and immediately said fellas settle down while making that call I think he was asking them to sit down thats the first on Miles Kelly who by the way all by himself Kelly is out scoring Wake Forest right now 9 Music to7 theres TV Tedy along with Ron Grover and Brent Hampton working our game here tonight see Ted Valentine and Charleston quite a bit he and I both travel through the same airport he is a incredible guy and he is very well known obviously around the basketball landscape but what he does in North Charleston for the young people in that Community really goes without much attention and there should be some cuz its really nice what he does Miller great Hustle by stur to knocked the ball away out of bounds back to Tech what a remarkable turn there that the turnover was not converted and then they lose the Applause basketball good hands by Applause Salis good call good d by stur it he made a couple of good defensive plays hes a nonstat guy for them but he does a lot of things to impact the game plus minus always good for Kyle sturdivan although I was happy for him to light it up on Senior Day in Atlanta last time out went for 20 points one off his career high Miller off the feed from hildr for three the central Michigan transfer has his first three points its back to a 14point game well Georgia Tech knows that right now its two players to the basketball theres a hard hedge right there and a turnover F Reed doing a good job having high hands on that hard hch Salis works the Baseline has it poked away Reed kicks it out Miller Quick Pass hildr turned down the shot heres Salis back inside they go to Andrew Carr nice wrap around for the dunk by Reed in the blink of an eye its a 70 Run for the deeps this is a good timeout by Damon St Meer because Wake Forest is a rhythm offense and the last couple of times down the floor theyre starting to get in Rhythm everyone gets a touch through the short corner and the Finish By Reed back inside the Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum Wake Forest showing signs of life with seven unanswered points and Debbie you were all over it to start the game saying pace and Tempo was going to be a big thing and the deakes have turned up the pressure and made the game a little faster lately I think they have to speed it up and theres ways you can get into Rhythm on the offensive End by speeding it up on the defensive end and I think thats helped them here in this last 4minute Applause stretch heres George defended by Miller ball screen comes now drop coverage in the middle third George recognizes it third time tonight he has put up a tough shot from the left side of the lane and converted Im telling you its a clinic in here when Damon Stout and his staff when theyre going through SHO around and when the first bus arrives before the game versus when the second bus arrives very similar the way they do it in the NBA first bus comes guys that dont get to play a lot they get extra shots up second bus has mostly the starters on it are guys that dont want the extra shooting before the game well when your coach is Damon stmy who had such a long NBA career his coached in the NBA last year he was an assistant with the Celtics it gets your players attention and all these guys want to play League most of them think they will play in the league Salis is a potential first round pick hes going to the line for shot at a threepoint Applause play Hunter Salah starting to heat things up for the Demon Deacons its now a 92 run back in Winston Salem North Carolina where Georgia Techs lead has been cut to 12 the head coach of the yellow jackets in his first year Damon styom a lot of folks watching remember how good he was first round pick a lottery pick coming out of Arizona where he starred for the great lud olssen and now his first opportunity at a power conference school as the head coach and he has surrounded himself with a very good staff Debbie well one of the guys Ive enjoyed getting a chance to to meet is Nate Babcock you know hes the Babcock family is a famous name in basketball and certainly in the NBA as well but you know he coached at D2 Grand Valley State hes crossed pass with ISO hes been in the G league and Nate is a tremendous clinician and a great teacher hes clear and he is concise about what he wants the guys to Applause do hes certainly a valuable assistant to Damon Kari back into the game flying with those two fouls Carr the best rim protector for weight blocks the shot Miller from the foul line I mean you get to the nail and transition thats got to be a bucket theres that short roll off the hard hedge you know I heard Damon stoutamire speak at a clinic uh in August down at Florida its a Larry shyatt clinic for lack of another way of a name for it but uh I was really impressed with how much he values screening if you walk the ball up the floor you cant get the ball reversal so you got to push it all the time he loves a ball reversal and they love to play through the short role because it puts a lot of pressure on the rim keeps the ball in the middle of the floor and youre seeing all of those Concepts play out right now in the way his team is scored he knows wake force is bringing two to the ball theyve hit the short roll multiple times and theyre looking to attack and make a play out of there their decision making has been very good early Applause on after a quick start Tech has pulled off only one made bucket in the last four minutes that pressur defense for Wake Forest is thrown them off their game you know we asked Damon STM at shoot around this morning of course again he played for the the late great lud olssen at Arizona and I I always find it interesting who mentors and and who whose voice resonates with players and coaches as they move on in life doesnt have to be within basketball and asked him are there words that come out of your mouth and you think boy that sounds like coach Olsen that breaks the the drought for Georgia Tech but uh Damon STM said the thing that he most took from his time with lud Olen is the attention to detail the screening angle the pace the push rebounding with two hands all those things that he values he attributes that attention to detail Sal is blocked by KY Reeves the Demon Deacons will keep just under six minutes remaining in the half eight on the shot Music clock Andrew Carr loses his footing gets it to Miller two to Applause Music shoot George to the rim fou by Carr BYO went down hard and is slow to get up with Matthew Marsh on the floor its hard to bring two to the ball hes in drop coverage right here hes got high hands but you got to cover the backside tag the roller and thats Dongo who goes High Above the Rim to draw that Applause foul I dont think theres any question that young mans going to be on the ACC all freshman team he has been a revelation somebody who was not widely known coming into the season and all he has done is six double doubles 15 points 14 rebounds on Saturday against Florida State the numbers are impressive and I think when you watch him its even more impressive than the numbers hes put up I agree its his length its his bounce its his motor its all those intangibles that coach St really loves about his team he has the fourth most rebounds this year of any freshman in the country Loft it out of bounds its a really good job of Matthew Marsh staying in a stance and staying between Dongo and the basket making him make a move move he commits the seventh turnover and so Dongo takes a seat here comes some full court pressure by Georgia Tech going to back Music Applause off Marsh hands to Salis finds Miller good action right there on the offensive end for the Applause deeps now theyre moving the ball gari crowd wanted a traveling violation another offensive rebound for Tech and another opportunity Reeves extra pass Kelly got got it Miles Kelly seeing a big Applause basket Wake Forest has got to guard the threepoint line better well he is a perfect four for four and as a team the Yellow Jacket seven out of 13 from Applause distance got a ISO h loves to work in the lane little step back and he gets the roll over kaasi Reed thats his game isolation cleared it out all Wake Forest players got to the other side of the floor for Cameron Applause hildr b gets it back and he is fouled in the lane and that takes us to our next media timeout Wake Forest undefeated at home this year but coach sters yellow jacket still up double figures late in this first half when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks B Mountain Georgia Miles Kelly wow hes been terrific he has shot it with range the first two triples came off offensive rebounds how about the dribble handoff action right here and then his ability to relocate to the perimeter and to the deep corner right now Georgia Tech has spaced out the W Forest defense and theyre late on their close outs they got to lock in a little bit better here well Kelly again was scoreless a month ago in the game against weit leading the way here tonight with those four made threes Kelly had quite an experience over the summer back in July he was one of 48 ACC student athletes and administrators who took an immersive trip for 3 Days Debbie to Selma and Montgomery Alabama they visited several key Civil Rights spots including the Edmund Pettis Bridge the First Baptist Church the Legacy Museum just an impactful trip for those young people ACC Unity right thats a big part of uh the mission of the the conference got a foul on the floor its going to go against Andrew car who cannot believe Applause it that is his second and I believe thats the teams third no its there it is their fourth he has two of the four team fouls against taon Claude George another contested tough runner in traffic what a play Damon STM gets him off the the ball and then he runs him off the Baseline and he just keeps turning the corner off of screens hes got the size advantage over poopy Miller well for the last 40 plus years Georgia Tech has been point guard you and he certainly has the look of the next in that long line here come the yellow jackets again a reachin foul called against HRI who thought he got it clean T Fara gari at 69 was dribbling up hilis saw an opening but hes whistled for the Music foul yeah thats a reach in foul its a big gamble by Cameron hildr right or maybe its just a reaction by gapare after the Applause fact theres a mismatch right here stur of Applause it Reeves again the crowd wanted to travel against him he missed the shot Here Comes Wake Forest under two and a half to go in the first half that should have been a boomerang pass right back to cerent to let him take Fon Reed on that mismatch first time weve seen Marcus Maran number one for Wake Forest in the game tonight Reed with another dunk sealed his Defender and got a beautiful feed from the wing that is what you call a foot fight in the paint and Reed won it heres the mismatch Im talking about now the screen brings the matchups back but they miscommunicate and leaves stur wide open well Reed is known to be the best Communicator defensively and after that he looks to the Freshman Maran who just came in and says what did Marion think they were switching thats where the communications got to come in youre absolutely right and youre right about Fon Reed he talks the most on defense for Steve Forbes Miller in Applause traffic 10 on the shot clock hrth goes in to Reed over his left Applause shoulder itll go the other way Yellow Jackets basketball Fon reads buckets have come on dunks when hes caught the ball on a on a drop off hes got to be able to get the right real estate for his half hook watch the miscommunication right here both guys go with the roller claw and it leaves stur It Wide Open on the top of the floor here is stur Music Applause it Salis up high for the rebound couldnt get it Tech has it waiting for the whistle which comes I mean the UPS on Salis hes been the most aggressive weight Forest player on the offensive end now hes trying to get on the glass well there are four NBA Scouts in the building tonight theyve had as many as 15 or so for a couple of games when Pittsburgh was here and when Duke was here but for Wake its because of this young man who you see the Hops getting a piece of that rebound there are some mocks that have him as a late first round pick if he chooses to come out he still has eligibility Music remaining last Baseline out of bounds play Wake Forest got a turnover Georgia Techs got a cut hard screen Music hard after the held ball Tech keeps it under a minute to go in the Applause half George good shot fake heres another runner in tight it rattles around off the glass and in what a beautiful finish I mean his finishing skills are outstanding around the rim and in the paint floater and Runner Doug you got to love it Ive got to figure he grew up watching video of Steve Nash as a young Canadian kid tell me theres not a little Steve Nash in what weve seen off the move and off the bounce tonight A lot of that and you know when you think about the relationship that Damon satom had with his dad through his NBA connections thats how he ended up here this is not a guy that was highly recruited offers from Seattle San Jose State and Texas Corpus Christie yeah and here he is the starting point guard in the ACC for Georgia Tech he was going to go to prep school he was going to sign with Seattle and at the last second he becomes a yellow jacket and again he didnt play the first three games came off the bench the fourth game and what coach STM has talked about is that he just kept seeing in practice good things happen when George was on the floor and so why not take that from practice and do in the game I mean hes second in the league in assists hes got the best assist turnover ratio remember he didnt even play in the first couple of games yeah first three well the Ally ACC Womens Basketball Tournament begins tomorrow at Greensboro Coliseum with every matchup but the championship game right here on acc Network and the ESPN app our first round cover begins at 1230 Eastern with the nothing but net crew and my partner here tonight will be down in Greensboro for the duration Debbie will be working the tournament once again I hate to tell you how many years Ive worked the ACC tournament but it is it is definitely a big part of the schedule thats for sure itll be a lot of fun be a great tournament with I cant even tell you whos going to win the win the tournament there so many good teams final 10 seconds of the half tough pass off the Applause foot Miller beats the buzzer but it is off the mark this is wakes largest halftime deficit at home this season they are perfect unbeaten here at the Joel but being pushed here tonight his ability to attack the paint go five for five from the free throw line hes got nine first half points hes got a turn it up another notch here in the second half yeah wake made only eight baskets in that first half Tech made 16 and another issue that youve addressed is the fact that how connected is Wake Forest on the offensive end car gets his shot block I mean this is a team that scores nearly 80 points per game but they get in stretches where it seems like theyre more at to go oneonone as opposed to passing the basketball I think when they get a piece of the paint sometimes they need to find the open shooter theyre very good in the ISO game going oneonone especially Cameron hildren Pari sets the screen and there goes George one more time look how spread out Georgia Tech gets the Wake Force defense so theyre turning a corner and theyve got Gap options and theyre really doing a good job of moving the ball and going side to side well Debbie is it a coincidence that Notre Dame Pittsburgh and Georgia Tech three teams that have relied heavily all season on a freshman point guard have gotten better as the year has gone on Fon Reed with two more we have seen that with Nathan George just get better and better and now Georgia Tech having won three of its last four playing another impressive game here tonight yeah Marcus Burton for Notre Dame Bob Carrington for Pittsburgh I dont think its by accident at all I think youre talking about three excellent programs very well coached and its hard to simulate what youre going to see until you go through it sad cleans up his own miss the weight forest team cannot change trade baskets right now theyve got to get some stops they have not disrupted anything about Georgia Tech offense Georgia Tech getting pretty much whatever they want Im anxious to see what the ball screen coverage will look like here in the second half theres a switch in the first half they were double teaming five to shoot George puts it up from Deep Reeds got a hand on the rebound it comes to Wake Forest and here comes Kevin bofy Miller lav up Carr was met at the rim but Music fouled tar gapar picks up another Applause personal this is a nice Advanced pass good job by Andrew Carter run ahead of the basketball in transition and he gets rewarded with a chance to go to the free throw line third five B on gapare sends Andrew Carr to the line 79 shooter and as a team this is another thing Wake Forest does very well fourth in the nation at nearly 80 tomorrow the nothing but net crew will be at Greensboro Coliseum for the ACC womens tournament first round all day and night with pre and postgame shows highlights analysis and interviews extensive coverage you can only find one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN app as Carr makes a pair Demon Deacons just keep getting back into it down 10 in the first half they were down by as many as 22 this is a 6 nothing run for weit thear fouled by Reed and hell head to the line Music well in the win Saturday against Florida state gari was so active we havent seen as much of that part of its foul trouble but just look at the bounce so athletic good job of keeping the ball in the middle of third and attacking the rim Shooters in the corners and because Georgia Tech has done such a good job in the first half of knocking down eight triples W Forest has got to run them off the threepoint line into their Music help the first free throw taken by Tech tonight is made by gapar the former umash Minutemen grew up in New Zealand his family roots are in Zimbabwe Tomley knocks down the Applause second Applause the defense by Reed staying in front of hildred I mean look at the battle on the post right there with Fon Reed hes doing a good job getting to the midline thats for him eight points now for the Junior from Richmond Georgia Tech electing to play him straight up and Fon Reeds got to use that punishing frame in his size Advantage as he gets to the midline yeah hes every bit of 7 ft 240 lbs kapari tough to shoot that over Andrew Carl comes away with a Applause rebound Applause HRI hter Salis with the left hand its an eightpoint ball game first time its been single digits since the game was 9 nothing Georgia Applause tack good good help Miller with a burst of speed great help side from gapare to knock it out of bounds so itll stay at this end with 23 seconds on the shot clock poopy Miller going inside over penetrating sometimes when he gets to the paint he gets two feet in there hes got to spray it out to a threepoint Applause shooter great fate bad pass weight keeps it still plenty of time in the shot clock Salis PS airball youve had success attacking youve been able to get in the gaps youve played well in your ball screen offense but its a 102 run and its a single digit game when youre great your game does the they continue to go deep into their roster for this 102 run and get back in the ball game to the midline no counter overpower at The Rim Salis off the bounce in the paint back to Eon Reed inside out thats how you play that sets up W Forest to have success thats why theyre on that 10 two run and theyve cut it to single digits and you know turnovers have been an issue throughout the season for the yellow jackets and theyre starting to creep up theyve got nine a couple of them here in the second half and thats in spite of the fact that Nathan George has a very good assist the turnover ratio but as a team they can be susceptible to turning it over and this weake defense has been able to do that well they changed their ball screen coverage based on Personnel theyve speeding theyre speeding up the game on this end George doing a good job attacking the outside of Fon Reed and getting to the pain and making a great decision reading the second level just the second made field goal of the second half of the yellow jackets the lead back to 10 car sets the screen Miller gives it back to him wide open hildr for three now remember Cameron hildr is playing with a fractured wrist on his right hand his right arm and its his shooting arm hes played the last six games with it Nathan George always under control hes got 14 points to lead Georgia attch Salis into the lane dumps it off for Carr who throws it down a piece of the paint a penetration and a drop off the Delaware transfer averages 13 points 6 and 1 12 rebounds per game hes got a half a dozen points you see the points in the paint heavily favor Wake Forest tonight on the pullup in and out for by Dango a beautiful pocket pass and a wide open 15footer Salis was shot ready everything but the bucket long rebound has Tech in the front Court Kelly remember he hit three quick ones early a fourth but he has not scored since chance for threepoint plays Cameron hildr got all the way to the hole if you were going to Define Cameron hildr game this is it right here downhill attacking in the paint with contact and one this is the way he balls out right here foul number two on Miles Music Kelly threepoint play for hild Wake Forest is within seven points poopy Miller out and back into the game Parker Frederickson who has said growing up his favorite game was gone said he was a four handicap at one point its the Family Sport hes on defense right now stur it tries to turn the corner cut off by Carr 10 on the shot clock Dongo faces up puts it up air ball and out of bounds off of Tech Wake Forest basketball you have to stay aggressive right here and continue to attack theyve only taken one three in the second Applause half Matthew Marsh has got to look to post up when he has an Music opportunity Applause Salis Juran gets a great screen to free himself from Salis Music Applause switch Coleman with a clean look I like Salis at the top of the offense for Wake Forest I think he can go away then he can come back and get it Music and another chance for a threepoint play for the Junior from Worthing England how does he even get this shot on the glass watch this rejects the screen with contact he cant even see the Applause rim Cameron hildr says one two and Ill take take three already counted the third as he heads to the line hes one of the fourheaded monster offensively for Wake theyve got four guys averaging more than 13 points a piece hrth picking it up here in the second half now into double Figures its an 186 run for Wake what an incredible fight from weake let go lets Music go how will Georgia Tech respond Claude hands it off Gare floats it in good job by kapari to to get into the vision of Claude once he gets down to the paint hildr again attacking spins gives it back out to Carr Carr had the chair pulled out from underneath him manage to keep possession and finds hildred for three and here comes Cameron hildred Applause thats one knocked away here comes boy Miller hes got stent to beat and missed the layup well the weight Forest defense is got the game spent up oh what a response what an answer by George gapare with the slam its back to a fivepoint Applause game cam hildr has wakes last nine points a pair of oldfashioned threepoint plays and then a triple on the last Applause trip Music Music Applause George off the side of the backboard Here Comes Wake Applause Forest Miller from near the logo Music the takeaway Hil behind the back and the layup and Im not sure cam hild feels right hes reaching for the back of his right leg and normally he would go up to the rim but he has scored the last 11 Demon Deacons points Cameron hild reload locates off the penetration inside hits the triple and then off the steel Applause lays it has not taken Cameron hildr long to heat up in the last three minutes and 57 seconds this is the damage that Cameron HT has put on the Georgia Tech Team drives and ons and triples 11 points in this time hes done it in every way possible right here including generating offense from his D but during that timeout he headed back to the locker room briefly you saw in that Breakaway he clutched at the back of his left leg so he is on that stationary bike down along the Baseline and we would presume just keeping it warm so we can come back into the Applause game Nate George Goes to the left hand good D because bopy Miller had to switch back on to George so he didnt get stuck on the post up Georgia Tech started this game with a 140 run and led 264 nice slip I mean youre right at the front of the rim you should just dunk it seems easy enough for me car beats the shot CL and makes it a onepoint game and patient to recognize the mismatch inside now Wake Forest is playing with Incredible Rhythm Applause offensively oy Rees has been quiet tonight rising up for two he just backs Parker Frederickson into the paint taking advantage of his size and length in that Music matchup hildr is at the scores table and with the whistle and the foul along the Baseline h will be on the floor when we come back timeout at the Joel wake for is trying to run its homecourt winning streak to 16 seated expected to be the most of any conference the accs race has been highly competitive on the womens side as well Cameron hildr back into the game after being out and the way he has delivered offensively over the last 5 minutes they could use him in there Music well during shoot around this morning George Tech head coach Damon STM made it very clear dont give up any threes dont help off the shooters theyve only allowed weight to make three threepoint Shots tonight but the Demon Deacons have found their way back in in other ways well I think because of this right here getting a piece of the pain attacking Inside Out Salis and Salis and Cameron hildr have been so good attacking the rim off the bounce this will be the sixth foul that Hunter Salis has drawn on the Georgia Tech defense watch this take right here with contact and this is his first trip to the free throw line in the second half went five for five in the first half first foul on kaasi Reeves Salis certainly can heat up his career high 33 points against North Carolina State last month 12 of 17 shooting that day five for five from the line four for six from the ark hes on my first team ballot I think hes a first team all ACC guard I think hes earned it yeah I dont think theres any question I think most folks agree with you Debbie I love his Applause game Dongo has it knocked Away by Salis whos also an excellent Defender now he picks up Kelly who has cooled off after a quick start Miles Kelly h four triples early and we havent seen him score since here goes Kelly in the lane right on Q exactly we were just talking about how it looked like he had cooled off but I dont think he cools off I think he plays with great maturity and patience the average is 142 per game hes got 14 tonight he and George both leading the way for the jackets Miller toes the line I did not see a single signal I think that that was a long two probably not the shot that Steve Forbes wanted Kelly steps out and starts to heat back up he gets the switch epon Reed off a flare and he drills it five consecutive points and thats an answer by Miles Kelly and just like that its back to a sevenpoint lead Kelly makes it 59 home court record Music intact well weve got seven minutes for Wake fors to determine whether theyre going to move off this last four in and move themselves up the seating line well Steve fors coming out of that timeout goes right to Hunter Salis that snaps a 71 tech run and gets the Demon Deacons back to within five keep in mind oh all the metrics so far are pointing towards Wake Forest being one of five teams in the ACC that gets in right now and then we have the ACC tournament left and dont forget about that thats the automatic qualifier will hildr be able to get to the rim play with something wrong with his leg unable to finish after the steal gapare is fouled hrth didnt seem to have the same lift right here another steel I think Reeves got a little piece of that too third foul on Andrew Applause Carr Don goes pass goes aride backto back turnovers Salis trying to make him pay and he does he does such a good job of snaking and putting his defender in jail keeps him on his hip and then reads the second level and has that quick explosive step to the Applause rim George to Reeves six on the shot clock good close out DG Parkers got to keep him in front Frederickson knocks it away but hes called for the foul with 710 of a second remaining on the shot Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause clock watch this D right here hes keeping kaasi in front there he is is right on the elbow he got him first team or first personal foul on Frederickson just the third against Wake Forest here in the Music Applause half non shooting foul and so the shot clock is reset to 20 as Tech keep possession George just took a shot to the face play continues Kelly finds the open man in the corner kaasi Applause Music Applause Reeds wakes energy and their body language is dipped a little bit they got to pick it back Applause up Hunter Salis hunting another bucket G him two more hes had worked so hard for all of his offense Believe It or Not Georgia Tech has done a good job on him thats how talented he Applause Music is good defense by weit George again a friendly roll on that Ren hes got 16 points and the lead is back to Music six this is a chance for Hunter Sal to catch his breath a little Music Applause bit the pass to Reed was twoo tall out of bounds wake turns it back over to Georgia Tech with 359 on the Music clock the Demon Deacons have cut it to one at 5251 W but the yellow jackets are pushing back when after being quiet after four triples in the early part of the first half goes on a little 0 run and then Nate George he has been fantastic look how he gets to the Elbow off the bounce hes got the float game hes got the runner hes got the pullup J and he manages Tempo so well for Georgia Tech you love the efficiency of Miles Kelly he went for what seemed like 20 minutes of game action between shots but he still got 17 points on five made threepointers again I I point to his maturity his patience and his Music Applause pois George Dongo dump it off and the dunk by Tara gari Music wow you talk about an at man that is an at0 right there for Damon St wow Reed bounce pass back door and with a Defender literally on his back hildr draws another foul and will head back to the free throw line watch how Georgia Tech operates in the middle third incredible interior passing that time wow fourth foul on Miles Kelly thats a big deal for tech there you see the big free throw discrepancy helping to offset the threepoint shooting difference well the 33 second half points for Wake Forest 24 of them have come in the paint they have done a really good job of attacking thats how they were able to get back in the game thats the way they got to finish the game geordan Tech has controlled the glass tonight 3123 but again weight just keeps coming 17 points now for hildr Georgia Tech better be ready to ball fake pass fake and stay tough right here to finish off this game Tech has made its last six shots from the floor that is the sixth turnover committed by George Hill missed the reverse you just have to wonder if that leg is keeping him from being able to finish hes had a couple at The Rim that he usually finishes he seems to be moving okay but like you say those are shots he usually makes switch Kelly catch and shoot gapar down had it blocked by Reed and here comes cam hildr again thats as angry as Ive seen coach d m on the sideline he thought there was a foul Miller has a poked away from behind and here comes Kelly 19 points for Mr Applause Kelly that leads the Yellow Jacket Salis has 20 to Pace the Demon Deacons Reed wide open from the Corner got Applause Music it Justin six made three in 24 tries this year but you see during practice he can make that shot and when you leave him that open he can do it this is what you call Extreme confidence poopy Miller hits it to the corner how about epon Reed even being in the corner at this set right here thats how much confidence he has and Dongo read The Scouting Report and didnt go out thats a shot that you would love for him to take if you George attacked thats a no no yes from the sideline so again here are some of the metrics in this final week of the regular season this is the next to last regular season game for both Tech and wake they will both play on Saturday before heading to DC the ACC mens Tournament begins a week from today in Washington DC and beyond that coach forbs and his team thinking about the big dance and some of the numbers say theyre in a lot of the numbers say theyre on the bubble jool lardy says at this moment they are the last team in and cannot afford to lose this game tonight they had such a convincing win over Duke here and then they lost their next two and they have to stack some wins together right now theyve got a chance here and they got a chance with Clemson and there will be opportunities in DC as well under 2 minutes to go in the regular season in the uh in regulation I should say Kelly is fouled near midcourt thats just the fourth team foul for Wake Forest trying to speed up the game right here putting some ball pressure going for a steal second foul on hildr Reeves able to get it in got to get a stop right here if youre awake and then look to push reaching foul on hildr that is number three on Cameron hildr so youve taken the shot clock from 30 to 22 and a foul now to 11 with a foul you better not foul here you better play really good defense George gets away from the double team finds Kelly wide open Music 43 a big Miss for T Wake Forest with the ball down down by five Id like to have a ball in Hunter Sals hands let him make a decision well Miller made a great decision there through the contact hes got a chance for three and he drives down the lane line with Salis in the strong corner you cant help off of Hunter Salis then poopy Miller throws it high off the glass that post Up Inside by epon Reed took the shot blocker away at The Rim a good finish by poy and a hard foul by Georgia Tech its the third personal on Dongo I think theyre going to take a look at it Applause Doug and boy receiving treatment from the training staff for Wake Forest and you know the Demon Deacons want him at the line hes the seventh best foul shooter in the conference the best on the Applause team yeah I dont think theres anything there I dont think theres anything excessive or unnecessary honestly I think he was stumbling trying to make a play on the ball boy I dont know one of the angles I agree with you but there are two angles we just saw that made me think is he launching himself at him yes that angle looks like it could be a different conversation certainly the partisans here at the Lawrence Joel Veterans Memorial Coliseum want a flagrant that angle doesnt make me think he was stumbling at Music all yeah that angle doesnt look so good for Dongo since they have a whistle on it they can upgrade it to an F1 if its excessive too much or unnecessary unavoidable and again our officials Ron Grover Teddy Valentine Brent Applause Music Hampton so you may have heard from the PA is just a common foul and Bon grber is over talking to Debbie Antonelli who will explain their determination yeah just a common foul they felt like their his own teammate pushed him into boy and it wasnt upgradeable the good news is boy Miller is going to be able to stay in the game and take his free throw to try and complete what would be a crucial threepoint flag wait Forest has never LED tonight it trailed 14 to nothing out of the gate and been playing catch up ever since in this crucial late season Music Applause game only once since 2010 and it was 7 years ago as Wake Forest been to the NCAA tournament Miller short you got to get a stop here Doug you got to make sure you do have a foul to give before you put him in the bonus so you can be really aggressive here trying to get a steal or trap Miller guarding George B screen Dongo George passes to nobody in the corner that is his seventh turnover tonight what a break for Wake Forest now you dont need a three you got to look to score more quickly Id go right in the paint but I want Hunter Salis to have the ball in His Hands In This Moment In the game keep an eye on number 23 in white eldr with it now looks to Carr on the left side ball has not come to saless side at all his possession Miller tough shot bailed out with the whistle wow that is a tough whistle right there for Georgia Tech as wake Force didnt look like they had anything going I think these are the moments in the game where Hunter Salis has got to be a little bit more aggressive and trying to seek his own shot and poopy Miller is going to go to back to the free throw line an 83 free throw shooter who missed on his last attempt that foul was on Dongo his fourth breake Forest can or Georgia Tech can expect full court pressure here Miller two for three tonight made his first two and now uh Miles Kelly talking to him perhaps what are we doing ice in the shooter here right hes defending him now Fon Reed says come on Music Applause man little Music Applause Music gamesmanship big free throw Sunday well have the ACC wrestling championship from Carm Mel in Chapel Hill coverage of the finals begins at 7 Eastern right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Sean Kenny Anthony roess will be on the call boy Miller with a couple of FL free throws a seven nothing run has made it a onepoint ball game with 36 seconds to go Georgia Tech has led the entire game they started out hitting a bunch of Threes at the beginning of the game Wake Forest couldnt get anything going in the second half its been Wake Forest being aggressive in the pain in attacking they changed the rhythm of the game with their ball screen coverage they have forced 15 turnovers and again seven of them have been committed by The Freshman point guard Nate George who has not turned over that much this season if youre wake for us defensively do you attack him again Music here well I think youre going to probably see the ball screen coverage be switch on everything what Georgia Tech wants to do is I mean he does lead the league in assist turnover ratio I I would continue to put the ball in play through him I dont think Damon St is going to take the ball out of his hands at this point in the game and if you attack offensively where are you trying to get the basketball Im trying to attack the paint I want to put some pressure on Wake Forest defense keep keep in mind Wake Forest still has one foul to give before they put Georgia Tech in the bonus so again its staying aggressive looking to take a gamble on a steel but keeping them in front not giving up a three good reset there the possession arrow belongs to Georgia Tech each team has one timeout remaining I would switch on everything here I know wake Force has had success bringing two to the ball lets see after the full court pressure when you get back into the quarter Music Court this is the closest Wake Forest has been at all this game twice in the second half they have pulled it to one point and now Tech Will face full court pressure the long arms of the 610 senior Andrew Carr defending kaas Reed I like it he might turn around here and try to guard guy cut to the ball Reeves able to get it in stur bottled up timeout called the worst place to enter the basketball and a perfect spot for Wake Forest to bring the double car doing a great job of cutting off that passing Lane down the Baseline and Stan to me did a good job not to panic and used that last time out he knew he had one and they couldnt afford another turnover but what a tough spot to receive that pass thats exactly what you want to do with your full court pressure is funnel them into the corner and thats what Wake Forest does Watch Right Here Andrew Carrs body is dictating the pass going into the corner and then Salis and Carr having the discipline not to foul and to lock up in that trap forcing a timeout and when I say it was an in in essence a triple team Im not talking about Coach fors it was the sideline playing the third Defender he had nowhere to go but coach coach forbs was right there just in case so now a tough spot on the inbound right in front of the Wake Forest Music bench itll once again be Reeves to trigger in and once again car Music defending its a tough spot to inbound the ball to it sure is the two point guards stent and George trying to come free Rees a dangerous pass to Dango and he is fouled immediately wow that could have been a disaster on the inbound still got to inbound the basketball and keep in mind uh only 3 second or 4 seconds have gone off the clock they still they have six seconds to get it over midcourt foul number three on Reed this a better spot for kaasi Reeds to get it in when I looked at the clock it had 27 and then 1 second came off to make it Applause Music 26 stur of it travel another turnover forth and Wake Forest will have a chance to take the lead Applause look at Cameron Hills making a play right Applause here Miller gets it back to salus with t of the shot clock Change of Direction Bank it in and the deeps Take the Lead all the way back from down 22 in the first half a 90 run has given weight Forest its first lead of the night what a play by Hunter Salis thats why Ive been asking for him to make decisions and have the ball in his hands in a late game slippage by Georgia Tech in the turnover gives Hunter Salis an opportunity to do this wake has not had the lead all game and Hunter Sal does a great job of getting in the paint following up on his own miss moving without the basketball attacking the middle third and then this play right here putting his defender in jail and high off the glass hes been fantastic all game attacking Applause Music Applause inside there are the numbers on Salis who was such a big recruit out of the transfer portal from Steve fors he went to Spokane to recruit Hunter and E High School coach said you might want to look at Reed as well and he got uh two tremendous players who have booed this wait for his program on the verge of trying to secure a spot in the NCA tournament for the first time in seven years a crucial spot here now theyve got to come up with one Music Applause stop offens ly where do you look for Georgia Tech to go Debbie Im Im looking to attack inside I want to get something going at the basket in the paint Im not settling for any jumpers here I like keeping the ball in the middle third of the floor Nate George the terrific freshman 8 seconds down to six no whistle the tie up to possession arrow stays at this end with 38 currently on the block well Steve corbes is looking for a travel he fell down with a basketball he still had possession on the ground and then slid a few feet that should have been a travel watch he falls and he still has possession of the Applause ball so Georgia Tech they keep 38 on the Applause clock the inbounds is entrusted to Nathan George keep your eye on Dongo here for a l at The Music Rim here we go George to Dongo he attacks Reed puts it in with 410 Georgia Tech back in front and thatll do it for the first time this season Wake Forest loses at home and Georgia Tech with another huge Victory this year
