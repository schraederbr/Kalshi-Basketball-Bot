he can play just about any position on the court and Paxon loic you saw him wearing that headband hes wearing that headband to cover up the 10 stitches that he got in the shoot around this morning this afternoon sounds like a little more than just a shoot around when you end up with 10 stitches Bott controls the tap Radford by the way the preseason number two pick in the Big South Conference under third year coach Darius nles and theres bacock to make it two nothing Carolina Radford obviously under side is trying to play against Armando bot North Carolina did a great job spreading the floor three ball at the top is good and thats Kenyan Giles who averaged eight and a half points a season ago and was an all freshman pick in the Big South he started out very well West and then faded a little bit during the season but then came on at the end and theres Paxton loic for his Force points as a tar heel he answers giless triple with one of his own no early Jitters for these ball clubs here in the first minute of the Season Giles picks up on it looking for some help going to scoop and Ingram had a shot at it I dont think that ball hit the rim Smith a three got it and Wes that is obviously the key for Radford they have got to put points on the board and the more threes they can make obviously the better dcoin Smith by the way terrific player their leading returning score at almost 14 game a season ago Ingram tees one up wow Harrison Ingram how about this ball game from behind the line to Laughter Applause start Smith back out front now and this is Brian Antoine a Villanova transfer who was very good a season ago hes preseason all big South this year Giles splits the double team looking for help in the Lane and traveled with it Jamal Spearman who works with Roger SS and Kell milliner tonight on the whistle Giles is a guy who likes to shoot the ball he is not shy he is not afraid and Ill tell you what if the referees are going to call walk you really got to do something because its practically the travel has practically been outlawed yep four lead changes already here in this ball game and an off the ball whistle Roger rout from underneath and its going to be on Kenyan Giles his first first on Radford West and early in the season we going to tell you that thats one of the things the referees are going to be looking for they want to create freedom of movement so theyre theyre going to call fouls on people who are bumping Cutters as they go through RJ Davis for Bott little twoman game scoop with the left hand and Bott third try good four for Bott Wes when North Carolina drives the ball to the basket this is a problem not just for Radford but for everybody whos going to play North Carolina youve youve got to come and help but you have to account for armanda bot because if you dont its three against one but the one wins with that offensive rebound because its Armando bacer Antoine here is Turner Chandlers a grad transfer from Bowling Green into darus Nichols lineup this year at Radford North Carolina switching just about everything out there it makes it hard to get by and get to the basket Giles against Ingram 10 to shoot now five to shoot for Ru and the jumper good nice Fade Away Kenyan Gil second field goal Carolina though Dan showing you the early flash of transition and pace and Hubert Davis mentioned Pace a handful of times in our visit today and RJ Davis knocks it down from way out front plus he struggled to times last year from three but you know he was a little bit streaky but he shot 36 overall and he was absolutely fabulous in the first half of that exhibition game three minutes gone this first half Hubert Davis has already dipped to his bench a three from out on the perimeter no good off the hand of Smith heres Davis and Carolina in transition little pull up jumper RJ Davis has five W they want to push it Dan theyve got three threes in their first six field goals for their 15 points cor ma Ryan is the noted aim transfer and hes a good Defender hes got a tough match up against an Giles right hand scores they really should consider guarding him at some point Kyon Giles yes hes good hes very good player hes aggressive yep hes gotten bigger and stronger in the off season its one of the things coach Nicholls is excited about with this Third Edition of his Highlanders heres Bott backing down inside lost the handle and draws the foul six early for Bott foul will be on Justin Archer its going to get us to break Armond Bott has got three field goals and all of them right at the rack early in Chapel Hill and reclassified and joined Carolina over the off season and Zaden high from San Antonio has quietly kind of developed a little bit of a a reputation as a guy they think might be able to help sooner than later in his rookie campaign well ha is a guy very bouncy athletic I think that he might be one of those guys whos better than they thought he was going to be but theres no question about how good gdo is bot missed the n one and thats an area where Bott could really improve he gets to the lineup awful lot yep Bradford TR seven now Carolina off to a really hot start hit three threes and theyre seven to their first nine Radford four their first six two of those a triple the defense has been really good at keeping Radford out on the perimeter and missed the three over high and here is kdo excited to see this young man he can really go yep Kau left to shoot kicks it for Davis theres a skip pass for wji his slide in I think La for Bott and that got knocked away Highlanders with the giveaway from Carolina back out front this is J against with bot you shoot the ball let him go get the rebound and now G squaring up Bok fall away is no good and Radford gets a second chance and there goes Archer from close and a leaping Follow by deantre Pierce was basket yep so that will go back to Carolina and Justin Archer comes out of the ball game Chandler Turner returns Turner number 10 or excuse me uh deontre Pierce hung on the rim oh he had his hand on the ball and Kau and there is an offensive foul its going to be on Bon on the Kau Drive Armandos first number one on Carolina here in this you see again Hubert Davis going to his bench early botts going out after that first F Washington in the game yep Jaylen Washington is the sophomore Gary Indiana who averaged 16 minutes a year ago against comp one of the only two bench guys to average in double figures and he did not participate in every game and theres a hand check foul on Ingram and Dan walk us through some of this just because a hand check in the midcourt area again preventing the freedom of movement right well and the freedom of movement is going to be a big thing and that is a hard match up for Ingram remember North Carolinas switching everything so heres Ingram and hes got both hands on him the and thats right in front of the official youre not going to get away with that this is truth Harris the junor wearing number four for Radford Junior College transfer five to shoot Giles with Kau trying to bounce off the pier screen Giles a three and Washington the rebound for the tar Hills Hubert Davis wants his C in transition and high couldnt hang on to it lost it over the in line out of bounds but what a delivery of the basketball by Elliot kadoo well he threw it just I guess a little bit behind him and so its not a great Pass unless he catches it but that gives you an idea of what kdo is trying to do this is a bounce pass and hi just stumbled third turnover in Carolina Harris on the drive and school first Radford bucket for truth Harris transfer from Indian Hills community college but from Mount Veron New York Daris Nicholls said he is a New York basketball player in a good way Ryan the catch and shoot three you cant leave him and you get an idea North carolers pushing the ball up the court if theyre not trying to score in transition theyre trying to score with their secondary break or in their early offense they are really looking for quick opportunities if you know anything about cor M Ryan you know that cant let him shoot a three knocks that down for his first Carolina points well you cant give him that much room Antoine tough shot first bucket for Brian Antoine theres a lead nario almost threw it away Ingram ends up in the seats was Washington he didnt realize Harrison Ingram went over the uh row of photographers the portable chairs and is everybody okay down there 6 7 230 lb coming at your full speed that is not a good sight no theyre going to have to do more than just adjust the chairs over there Ingram is a good looking player yeah out of Dallas and of course start his career at Stanford 7 Minutes in Carolina the sixpoint lead Trenton Walters is making his first appearance on the floor for Radford wearing number two on the drive tough shot Smith for his second field Z won I think youre going to see more of that in college basketball this year with the rule change thats going to make it harder to take a charge in that situation lobin catch for Jaylen Washington and a Radford foul inside and its going to be on DeAndre Pierce well thats a little bit of a break I think for North Carolina because thats a hard pass to throw from that angle yep c will put it in play here is Ingram against dcoin Smith pretty good match up here nice move and couldnt finish nice defense by Smith yep Walters and r on the move I think it would beoo Raptor theyre not a running team but they need to push the ball down early into the corner and a reach foul on zon high will be his first third on Carolina team fouls now Zaden High a little over aggressive that time West because Chandler is not a guy whos going to look to shoot the three from the deep corner and Highs out there hes trying to pressure the ball but you got to know who youre playing against he runs out jumps up in the air and that allows Chandler to put the ball down and draw the foul Yep this a very good basketball team in the Big South they were 21 and 15 a season to go won four their last six and lost to Charlotte in the championship of the C be well they won two games in postseason play and that was a first for them yeah five to shoot Antoine Brian Antoine hes got big league credentials the the opening of the season in an ACC venue wont phase him its a twopoint game Radford going to shoot for the tie and the lead and Antoine cant finish Applause it 20 to 18 inside B caught the catch working against Pierce and deontre Pierce did enough to alri again thats a tough place to make that entry pass Bott did very well to catch it but he couldnt really do anything with it Walters wiring through on the dribble well hes a little guy so he finds himself down in there thats his first idea is to get out D was one of maybe off the ball there but didnt get it here is Smith for the tie and B cot another rebound they tried to lead it to high and turned it over six turnovers on Carolina here in the first almost nine minutes of play on the drive Antoine pierce the rebound and Score first points for DeAndre Applause Pierce its an eight nothing Radford run to tie the game at 20 Carolinas booed the Highlanders by turning it over two a couple times here now thats been the key so far North Carolina you cant score when you turn it over Bott you see Giles or Smith rather defending into the corner Ryans three got it gron you cannot defend something like that Bott has a mismatch inside they come to help he makes a great pass out of the post and then that ball it it hardly stayed in kads hands for a second before he got it to a wide open cornerback line you get that kind of ball movement youre going to get an open three Walters digging in and they get it back out here with Smith against Ryan going to use the pier screen foul line F good boy theyre making some shots arent they West and decoin Smiths got seven hes looked every bit the uh preseason recognition after being second Team all big South last year well this is a tough Bunch Radford yep heres kdo weaving back around the screen leaves it to Bott and one for Arondo inside hes got four field goals hes got eight points and a chance for his second attempt at a threepoint play when we continue from Chapel Music Hill the way he comported himself he was what the the ideal of a North Carolina basketball player should be is he was just uh you know again he was a great representative of this University and of his family and its Hubert Davis said Im not in Chapel Hill if its not for my uncle its just that simple in fact Hubert was the beneficiary of one of what had to be one of the great car rides in America here is Turner and Radford on the attack when Hubert was a little guy Walter Davis and his college teammate for a shoot for Giles here against Seth tremble from the logo air ball so Carolina gets the Stop and theres Seth Trimble the sophomore from monomon Falls Wisconsin with the defensive effort there but Walter Davis and Phil Ford were college teammates of Carolina both were members of Coach Smith who coached the 1976 Olympic team in Montreal Dan as you remember and Hubert Davis is a little guy got the ride home from Montreal with Phil Ford and Walter Davis I mean talk about your young influences right how about that moment Uncle Walter and Phil and theres Brian Antoines Third Field now Antoine when he was in high school he was one of those festar recruits of McDonalds all Amer he went to Villanova he had some injury problems with Villanova but when hes healthy he can really play Ryan airball the triple from the right off comes Smith pull up for the Murray State transfer good dcoin Smith with n four regular field goals one of three unless theyre doing a great job hanging around yep sure are inside turned over again by Carolina seven of them for the Tar Heels archer in transition against Ingram Radford with the lead and adds to it Justin Archers first baset what balance and patience there by Archer West archers last year was one of the leading offensive rebounders in the country hes a very effective inside player but he just picked up his personal foul with a bump he didnt need to use second foul on Archer Hill and were getting ready to see jayen Withers for the first time Harrison Ingram corack Ryan start of the ball game tonight for Coach Davis Here Comes Withers former all ACC freshman pick at Louisville who started over 50 games at Louisville Ingram started more than 50 games for Stanford core match Ryan and his career has started 116 now 117 games counting tonight so not only did they get transfers they got experien transfers Withers and Ryan as we mentioned earlier are grad students I like how you use experience and not old well when you get to be my age you dont use the threeletter word Drive By Davis lot of contact Bon CS it up at the rim and weve seen that twice now Wes and were going to see that innumerable times during the course of the season one of the T Hills is going to drive to the basket help comes but all Aranda bacup does is just go to the basket 7 and 12 to go here before the break 2928 Radford Smith a runner high off the window and good for dcoin Smith hes got 12 now in this first half to lead Radford and were going to have a foul on Pierce this is after the basket basket goes in and that was interesting Pierce draws his second 16 foul on a collision with tremble here Pier sort of trips over R day Javis and stumbles into Trimble that is called bad luck you know if youre going to foul something you want to earn it picking up heres Davis with Pax andic Armando Bott Seth tremble and Jaylen Withers heres tremble on the drive and he got stripped of it another Carolina turnover there eigh and the lead for Harris and tremble swats it out of there well thats the way you make up for it Wes wow I mean theres a lot of you know discussion about how Seth Trimble fits in his sophomore year do things like that you can earn a little more time on the wood youre going to get in less trouble for turning the ball over but he still turned the ball over Antoine left it short heres Davis wji thought about it Trimble heres Withers another very interesting piece for Hubert Daviss team here is Jaylen Withers 11 to shoot on the drive with a left hand Withers first points with thear heel Withers again hes like high in that hes a very bouncy athletic kind of guy he can shoot the three and obviously he can drive it to the basket its pretty good offensive rebounder that North Carolina just has a lot of elements West its going to be a challenge for Hubert Davis to figure out how how old they all fit together yeah I agree with you on that Dan thats a good challenge to have yeah no question five to shoot we go inside a six to play Harris block by bot 21 on the shot clock for Radford again Bott does a great job moving his feet this is very optimistic by haris to think hes going to get it over Armando Bott but the shot clock is running down so he feels like he has to pull up and shoot it but credit Bott was moving his feet and not letting Harris go by yep darus Nichols has done a nice job working through his bench by the way in this first half as well going to catch this and shoot it there is Smith and that is deep and missed everything airball on Radford will give it to Carolina thats the second shot clock violation that Radford has suffered today North Carolina defense North Carolinas problem hadnt been on the defensive end they havent been able to hang on to the ball on offense here did a nice job trailing Davis got the block Raptor leading one and a block on Withers walk us through this because theres our first drive and blocking Cole well if you have a straight path to the basket and he does Withers cannot step in from the side thats called a straight line drive and the officials are looking for that this year but again Wes this is the second time weve seen it Turner is not going to shoot the three you dont need to go out there and attack him drop off and make him dribble the ball yep Chandler Turner 67 from Detroit start his college career Bowling Green Radford the onepoint lead Walters with Turner thats better job by Washington playing back Davis following Trent Walters around and then Withers knocked it away andol Davis L for Washington the catch up strong and fouled and that was Turner I believe itll be his first seven on Radford with five tend to play here in this first half and Jaylen Washington who a year ago was 65 at the free throw line we go to the stripe here now Washington is a kid who really got off to a slow start last year mainly because of injuries I like his potential though free throw good dont forget coming up next game two or game three of our triple header really because Virginia Tech beat High Point earlier today at blackburg to get his crank up Mike Monaco standing by with Randolph chers Dartmouth and number two Duke tonight from Cameron followed by nothing but Ned live from Coach K Court as well and the hogies put 94 on the board tonight Kenny Brookss crew can score now they would have easily gotten by those boner Le womens teams in Stanton Virginia years ago talented talented eighth ranked womens team in the country at Virginia Tech congrat ulations to Kenny and his team on the win look at withs moving his feet against j five to shoot for Radford Carolina in front on the Washington Free throws Harris the drive and a block is called on tremble thats going to be a hard charge to take this year based on the rule change I dont know whether the rule change affects here lets take a look drives the ball to the basket and the rule is that you have to be planted you have to have a establisher position before the offensive player sets his last foot before he jumps into the air and that looked to me like Trimble was late Harris knocks the free throw down first free throws of the night for Radford truth Harris are excited about his defensive Crow as much as anything heres what were talking about to be able to establish lead and guarding position an Airborne player on an Airborne player with the ball the defender must establish legal guarding position before the opponent places the last foot on the floor IE the plant foot before becoming Airborne so thats not before they become airborne its before they plant the last foot got it so its an earlier yes measure as opposed to what weve seen in the past I read an article where Curtis Shaw the supervisor of officials in the Big 12 said that he reviewed a 100 plays that were called charges last year and based on the r rule 96 of them would have been called block how about that Antoine on the drive and a whistle and foul couple of free throws coming for Brian anine I think thats Jaylen Withers so Withers has picked up a couple of fouls here six on Carolina with 417 to play but the thing is West North Carolina has some fouls to give in there they do yes and that might not have always been the case here yes Brian Antoine Dan already told you a 91 free throw shooter of season go now as seven his Villanova career now dont forget thats a jri Villanova thing thats not coach Neptune Kyles done a great job dont get me wrong but Villanova had him stacked like firewood up there on the main line and when you got hurt you kind of lost your spot and Antoine endured injuries in two of his three years there right uh Dan he was hurt a little bit last year at uh at Radford so he has struggled with injuries and the Highlander I think are very optimistic that he can get through at least very hopeful that he can get through this season without injury because hes going to be one of the best players in the big sou yep right for a threepoint lead here had of four minutes to go 12 to shoot theres a nice pass RJ Davis to jayen Washington for his first field goal boy North Carolina can be very dangerous in penetration West its going to be really important for Defenders to stay in front of those guys y heres Giles inside a four to go and thats an offensive foul its on Pierce and thats his third by my count on deontre Pierce with 340 to go an illegal screen y tell you what RJ Davis the delivery of the basketball Carolina within one Wednesday night mens soccer semifinals Carolina Syracuse at 6 Eastern followed by Louis Clemson at eight all matches right here on the home of ACC championships ACC Network all right now Hubert Davis has got some interesting combinations heres one that I think a lot of folks are interested to see Elliot kdo RJ Davis and cormack Ryan with Ingram and Bott and theres Harrison Ingram missed the first two they scrapped to the floor and last Touch by Ingram as he was battling Smith underneath the gold or right Wes and I think that word scrap is totally appropriate for what Radford has done here Y in this first half you know theyve made some shots theyve theyve hit 54 of their shots theyve made some tough ones but my goodness they have really worked hard Carolinas hitting 59 from the floor theres truth Harris and he scor Harris has got six on his second field L ahead of three minutes to play in this first half Ingram fired a pass to Bott and Turner draws his second that is eight now on Radford you know thats Pi teams going to see Carolina at the line here yeah thats really tough for Radford to defend they dont have a lot of size the size they do have is in foul trouble and when North Carolinas going to push the ball up the court like that and spread the court and leaving Bott oneonone against the guy hes got by 4 Ines on the inside thats going to be tough botts got 11 points and rebounds in this first half and the free throw make the 12 all right Dan your boy did a little math in the off season okay Armando Bott 68 career double doubles 132 games 52 of his college games have been double doubles I dont know where that fits in the pantheon of that stat but that caught my ey W in the pantheon of that stat Billy Cunningham 87 of his game wow is that right I think so I think thats what I read 87 of his games are double double the Cy kid now he gets lost in the discussion sometimes doesnt he when you talk about numbers Bradford by one under three to go Antoine trying to keep it alive and Harris Harrison Ingram with the rejection Antoine was by Bott and he thought okay Im going all the way here and Ingram does a great job just jump jumping straight up in the air hes not trying to knock it into the third row he does but hes not I mean he just flicks his wrist there doesnt bring that arm down inbounds heres Giles working in traffic Fall Away good tough shot Kenyan Giles nine in the first half open the scoring with a big three tonight and as been a steadying hand for Coach Nicholls here in this first half theres Davis on the drive well done again d another drive for Carolina off the perimeter again well you cant come off Bott and Davis takes great advantage of that Tar Heels to within one right side this is Kyle Burns a red shirt freshman from marota georgo on the floor for the first time as Justin Archer scores second field goal for Archer thats some pass and some catch in traffic yep Archer remember now hes got two personal fouls bounc to bacock Archer there skipped to the corner Ingram tees a three youre not going to get a better shot than that and Ingram is a guy who can make him left corner heres Burns bounces away bacock collects the rebound hes got eight now in the first half kdo for Ryan look at the Chris bald movement standing three too and were going to get a whistle and a foul on Radford here and they better hope thats on burns it is yep Kyle Burns by the way is a fascinating story a young man who signed with the Bradford program and then had some medical issues he was diagnosed and ultimately had brain surgery a year ago and has worked his way back reenrolled in school and theyre looking forward to having him he is a scorer by nature and with Radford protecting a threepoint lead heres Cormac Ryan at the line theres not a lot of basketball activity West that you can really do when youre recovering from brain surgery so hes got a number one his health is yes hes had a long road back and hes working hard yep second one good Ryans got eight here in his first half as a tar heel onepoint lead for Radford with 90 seconds to go in our opener tonight on acc Network in the mens guard burns on the drive cant finish bot did a nice job altering that hes got nine rebounds here is kdo got caught in the air but enough for Daviss three Ingram crashed the glass Archer the rebound into the corner Smith fallway two and Ingram in Carolina now again in the front Court Davis couldnt get through Ryan and a foul on burns that was a really nice job by cormack Ryan he was spotting up for a three but Daviss pass was not a really good pass and Ryan didnt try to force it he controlled the ball and drove to the basket and he is an excellent free throw shooter one and one or two shots here for cormack Ryan eight already make it nine I just think that as time goes by Ryan is going to end up being a wonderful addition for this North Carolina Squad you see Elliot kdo going off the floor should be a senior in high school corm Ryan is 25 years old hes got 10 how about the difference is 5 years 10 months and 10 days its almost six years thrown away heres MC Ryan bounce pass Ingram and R Dan you talk about what a sneaky defensive guy Ryan is really good distribution of the basketball right there well he made a great defensive play intercepting that ball and then hes got the ability can push it up to court he steals the ball he sees hes wise up to throw it back back and so once the offensive player leaves his feet he goes and gets the ball and then what a great pass and transition well Carolinas got a threepoint advantage and a chance to make it four with 40 seconds to go in this first half dont forget our friends with nothing but net will be here at the break Kelsey rigs in company Joel Barry Carlos Boozer Luke Hancock always good to see those guys heres Harrison at the line they dont make many field trips where we get to see him West no its good front and Miss there lead is three probably two possessions left in this first half anine for the tie and Davis the rebound and Hubert Davis thats the kind of aggressiveness that Bradford has shown throughout the first half yep time out for Hubert Davis hell waddle hell wind this thing down here in just a moment your chains off we can fix it now and youre done and a threepoint lead for Hubert Daviss team weve seen really good shooting both ways here in this first half but Im guessing the thirdyear coach of the triio is not crazy about the turnovers as he worked hes not crazy about the turnovers and I think you know hes going to point out that Radford has shot the ball very well and hes going to attribute that to the fact that they could increase the defensive Tempo but I think this is a situation where you got to tip your hat to Radford they have come in here they are totally unafraid they have been Scrappy theyve made some tough shots but they have been aggressive so basically a 16 second differential shot clock to game clock to wind down this half Paxton woixs come back on the floor with Davis Ryan Bott and Ingram that was the starting lineup wasnt it for Carolina yeah yes it was so okay down in midseason form here youre doing great like its game 30 for you not game one lets see what Carolina does here theyve got ample shooting and options here and eight to shoot Davis starts the traffic hell get all the way to the rim and lay it in thats one way to do it sure is nine for Davis the lead is five midcourt three at the horn by Harris is a front rim Miss but North Carolina is going to take a 4641 and Kenyan Giles with the basketball Giles scored well early but sort of tailed off he had nine in the first half here is Smith hard drive and one nicely done 14 now for dcoin Smith and the foul is going to be on Paxton wji and this is really a nice job by Smith just putting the ball down and getting to the basket and again its going to be harder for secondary Defenders to step in there and help and thats one of those plays where had a straight line path to the basket and the defender bumped him on the side and so thats a foul and the free throw good and Radford to within two to open this second half on a threepoint trip from dcoin Smith Smith is hes only 61 but hes a strong kid weighs 195 lbs and hes used that physical stature very effectively Ingram a standing three at the front Harrison Ingram with eight thats his second triple of the ball game and North Carolina made their first five threes then they missed their next five so yep maybe theyre going to start another streak Turner against Ingram here is Smith against Paxton W Brian Antoine who had eight in the first half Smith 12 LED Radford theres Turner in traffic at school Chandler Turner thats his first points and he is a hes a graduate transfer from Bowling Green and theyre really going to need him to produce on the inside Ingram skip for Ryan thats a three its a back rim Miss look at Ingram go chase the offensive chance now Davis launches to strong bot third try for the Tar Heel guess what hes not going a double double yep sure does and about that Armondo had it blocked I think Justin Archer got a hand through there Archers giv up a couple of inches and 30 lbs but he is a very aggressive tough guy Antoine tough shot Armondo the rebound for Carolina RJ Davis looking for help he backed out on the drive and heres Ryan breakouts alone inside they didnt see him and here he is with the ball spins inside and on Arch he was mismatched against dcoin Smith and Smith was calling for help and he thought somebody was going to come and guard bot so he left him Bott was all alone and you cant give him that much room fivepoint lead for Carolina Antoine will fall away rattles in double figures for Brian anine with Music 10 and Radford so far here equal the task at the start of the second half not surprising theres Harrison Ingram tough shot and almost got the and one opportunity and thats the second time hes been into the photographer yeah third on Chandler Turner its the first of the half on Ingram going to get a couple of free throws at the line lets clean up botts double double here 69th of his career hes now third in the ACC all time he was tied coming into tonight with the legendary Ronnie shaving at NC State who played in the mid50s for the gray fox ever case as Ingram knocks the free throw down and I will tell you the reason I thought about that today was was that Ronnie shavick played in an era of college basketball where tonight were reintroducing you to numbers like seven eight Ronnie shavick wore a number 70 when he played at NC State thats one of the rule changes this year have numbers from 0 to 99 Applause yep Im waiting on the first C to were in 99 now col basketball Giles jump shot good Carolina fans thought he might have gotten a maybe an extra Edge nothing there and now theres a turnover Radford can tie here is Burns and he had it blocked out of there by Ryan really really good play at The Rim tonight defensively in transition by Carolina really a nice job by Harrison Ingram in this particular situation with the fast break a little bit of contact there what Ingram does is he forces Radford to give up the ball earlier than they should yep so he can rotate down to the guy who receives the pass thats really a good transition defensive play dcoin Smith will hand it on the wraparound to truth Harris whos back on the floor along with Burns who played briefly in the first half out front Radford has suddenly gone very small yep T to shoot heres GS long three and the rebound for Paxton will ahead for ran lead inside Bott the catch and score that is a great fast break RS said theyre playing small guys and they just pushed the ball up the court and Bott made that happen just by running and setting himself up on the interior yep and Bot does that as well as anybody in the country heres dcoin Smith now bot the switch and Smith will shoot and it spins out Ingram gathers again Bott does a nice job preventing Smith from getting around it Armondo wants the ball radfords gone small and Harris stuck a hand in knocks it out of bounds thats going to get us to a timeout that time Smith did a great job fighting B off bot off on the inside well and Armando is kind of owning it a little bit here in the second half but heres that transition chance great look from cormack Ryan back to Chapo the this is cleaned and his Tar Heels lead by four at the moment and interestingly enough Wes last year in the preseason polls North Carolina was everybodys number one yep and I thought that put some expectations on a team that was a flawed team they were flawed team the year before they got hot at the right time this year I think much more reasonable in terms of their preseason rankings although when youre at North Carolina you can never say expectations are reasonable these guys are among the premier programs in the country the expectations are always high and the bench now on the floor a little bit Elliot kdo has come in Jaylen Withers as well kdo nice pass Bondo bots got 19 six in the second half weve talked about kadoo and his speed but he showed you some strength right there because he left his feet he was in trouble Radford actually got a hand on that ball but somehow he was able to force it into bacon Burns caught by kados pivots out scor Kyle Burns on the board first points for the red shirt freshman the guy has his P like that you dont want to leave him clear L the b b couldnt finish the soft layup against Pierce whos on the floor he wont miss many of those deantre Pierce now playing with three fouls early in this second half for Coach Nicholls theres Kyan Giles and a scoop and score B Giles is he is not afraid of any no and hes made a bucket full of tough Shots tonight too already I mean he goes right at bot and then right into kdo yep and again if youre kdo you move your feet and you stay on the side of him to try to stay between him and the basket if you hit him with your body thats going to be called a foul Kenyan Giles from Chesapeake Virginia averaged eight points hes got 13 now looking for 14 here in Chapel Hill tonight again hes only 5 11 but hes very well put together onepoint lead for Carolina Withers barreling down and off the window jayen Withers Jaylen Withers second field go but again another one of those grab transfers left a lot of experience he said he started more than 50 games during his career at Lis toos a threepoint lead five and a half gone in the second frame Burns a spot up two and RJ Davison Withers right at The Rim heres Jaylen Withers working on dcoin Smith Pau look at this and a foul will be ticketed to Giles itll be his second Elliot kadoo has got that blur factor with the ball in his hand yeah he does Wes but on that in that particular situation as Im sitting over here watching I mean he made a nice move but I was thinking when he caught that ball keep the ball moving reverse it to the other side Davis catching shoot off the inbounds pass too strong and Archer the rebound for Radford you know West Radford refuses to go away and this game ticks down if it stays this close then suddenly all the pressure falls on these North Carolina Tar here thats Music right H to shoot heres Harris Rolling into the traffic and too strong little out of control maybe for truth Harris 12th rebound for Bott look at this Kau draws the foul at the basket theyre going to give him a shooting foul sure are I think he was fortunate there he got dribble himself right into trouble third on Harris theres really not much room here thats a pretty nice job to surround him almost traveled with the basketball but really good presence of mind to feel that pressure around him and try to throw the ball up at The Rim K miss the free throw every time you watch this kdo kid play West you have to remind yourself he should be in high school yeah good looking Prospect and gets the back in for his first point freshman from West Orange New Jersey played at the link Academy in Missouri they won a national prep title a year ago in part because of his exploits he is a really good ball hander gets everybody else involved and West just observing him here through first half in the first few minutes of the second half he looks to me like he doesnt mind taking risks nope Antoine against bot and a scoop with the left hand no good if you keep taking tough shots eventually its going to catch up D the end to end momentum tonights been pretty good by the Tar Heels and theyve built some momentum here West with some defensive stop yep Antoine back for Trenton Walters now the Freshman from Frisco Texas and Kad is whistled for a foul off the ball itll be his second third on Carolina lets go back to the transition well were talking about transition you push it up the court and you got a guy like RJ Davis he gets knocked off his path but he still has the agility and the strength to recover and get that ball up to the basket and if he misses West you know what happens Bott is standing right there for the rebound Armando Bott does that as well as anybody youll ever see just following the ball to the basket T to shoot for Radford trailing six Walters bounced away Ingram had a shot Withers finally collects now kadoo on the drive to the basket and one how about back R were seeing that this is a North Carolina team that can be very dangerous in transmission how about that acceleration with the dribble hes going at a very slow leisurely pace and then he just explodes Walters the foul tremble is checked in for Carolina you see Giles go out for Coach Nichols Highlanders and too missed the free throw and now we get a whistle as the ball got knocked away I think Radford is in a danger zone right here they need a basket Turner trying to get it in bounds and finally dcoin Smith into the back court but here recently the North Carolina defense has limited to nothing but tough shot tremble on Antoine rri missed their last four 13 to shoot now too with Smith back for Pierce seven to shoot and this will be dcoin Smith Fall Away on Washington good oh my dcoin Smith 6 in the half 18 in the ball game tremble left it short Wes that was a huge shot Bradford Carolina played really well defensively and Jaylen Washington didnt do a bad job he forced Smith to shoot over heres Smith back door rebound and Archer cant finish it inside Withers knocked it out lead for Ingram bounce past center of the floor its a turnover Pierce stepped right in the passing Lane trying to do too much right there Antoine thats a situation where youre in the Fast Break K is on the court get him the ball nine gone in the second half Smith again and Pierce grabbed the Rim second time basket interference has been called on the entreer well dcoin Smith shot clock winding down gets in his bag Dan B away three Radford trailing five in Chapel Music Hill and legends in every program Carolinas got miles of them right theres the national Player of the Year from 1978 Phil Ford hes Carolinas basketball royalty right radfords program by definition is not that old right but the guy on the left David Smith was one of radfords greatest players in an era when they were division 2 and next to him is his wife Pebbles mayard Smith whos one of their finest womens players ever and great to see Smitty as hes known and Pebbles here at the game tonight in Chapel Hill pulling for their Alma moer now coming out of that break with is North Carolina do they go right to our right to Armondo Bop sure tar Hills have pushed it back to seven by the way maybe in our ESPN family of networks the most noted Radford Alum is 98 Gra Marty Smith of Giles County High School and number nine could not be here tonight he is on assignment he did text me to say hes losing his mind at dinner checking in on the game proud of his Highlanders tonight the way theyre competing well hes a dinner the best thing you to do is lose your mind rather than some other party that ball got knocked away on the Davis Applause layup North Carolina has really piced picked up the defensive pressure Bradford they made a lot of tough shots in the first half they made some here in the second half but their percentage has dropped off considerably and Ryan with Bott Zaden High played briefly in the first half and the Freshman from San Antonios back on thats Ingram three ball spun out look at H will get the rebound in traffic and now B cleans it up and draws the foul before he tapped it home and the foul is going to be on Justin Archer that thats his third five on Radford now well one of the issues I think that Zaden High has had in this game is he he looks like he could be a little stronger the Radford guys just outmuscled him there but nobodys going to outmuscle Armando bot first of two for bot good dont forget Saturday morning the ACC huddle crew will be right here in Chapel Hill kingan Stadium 1100 Eastern 1 hour setting you up for BC Virginia Tech halftime shows pre and post and then Saturday night ACC Network Prime Time the battle for the victory bell Duke and Carolina here at Kenan Stadium in the Huddle all day long right here on acc Network and the last time rord was in trouble and they trouble again Smith hit a really tough threepointer heres Walters looking inside at Chandler Turner and hops in the corner heres Giles I really liked his game here tonight too Dan Fearless yeah Fearless but hes in there with a couple of guys who are really big and H cleans it up Bott and Ingram did a really nice job foron Giles into a tough shot spin out three for Ingram radfords getting chances in to cut into this Dan yeah but its all chances against the set defense West theyve had very few transition opportunities here in the second half Bradford one of their last seven tend to shoot and Archer had it swatted out by high and the foul is going to be on Zaden High thatll be the second on the Freshman from San Antonio four on Carolina now cor M Ryan tried to take a charge there and the officials decided there wasnt that much contact last year that might have been a flop right so the flopping rule is still in effect but the officials have been told to only call the most agous ones Justin Archer knocks the free throw down he has five wa they really needed that big Radford but again Radford has had to work so hard for all of their offensive opportunities here in the second half Archer at the line seven rebounds to go with his Five Points now make it six and here comes deontre Pierce still playing with the three fouls back into the ball game for Coach Applause Nicholls Music B now for high Ingram here is Harrison Ingram strong left for Ingram B thats a nice play by Ingram because again if he misses that Armando bot is right there for the rebound lead is nine on the drive and a foul is called I believe before the shot Kellen Miller whistling RJ Davis for the foul his first five on Carolina weve seen Ingram miss a couple of Threes but hes a guy who can all you have to respect his ability to shoot the three and how about this for a 68 guy handling the ball out front beating a guard off the dribble getting it all the way to the goal they are going to award truth Harris two free throws here Music and he has six points for the most part North Carolina with their switching defense has kept Radford from penetrating to the B its two shots good if you can get away with it five team fouls a one and one and not in even the ballpark of the one and one its a two shot foul which quite frankly I was a little surprised to see and certainly not one and one on five fouls so Harris will have the back end of what was called a two shot foul Applause here and he got the single free throw for his seventh point the Radford problem recently in addition to their offensive struggles is they have not been able to stop North Carolina right North Carolina been getting some good shots particularly when they get the ball inside on the perimeter the three no good Ingram couldnt Corral it in the corner triple Giles and the rebound for Pierce hell kick for Antoines three they had two really good looks at it well cant argue with either no no and that three that North Carolina missed that allowed Radford the opportunity to get down the cour and get a wide open shot Paxon woic is on the floor he with the 10 stitches in his forehead yeah thats why he hes wearing that headband Davis a follow away RJ Davis now with 13 on his six field goal won its been a comfortable 13 for Davis he hasnt really forced very much I think hes had a nice night one of three tars in double figures Carolina by 10 its their largest lead of the Applause game nine eight to shoot Antoine a fallway through a it he didnt even try to get by bacock but bacock does a nice job staying in front of what a pass loic sliding Baseline skipp for Ingram return into the corner for Ryan in front of the bench three that corat Ryan can do he has 13 in his Tar Hill debut and Dam ball movement has been very good here at times tonight for Carolina absolutely and this is a situation where corack Ryan is going to have to reset hes got to move on that dribble and knocking it down hes going to make that shot wow this is Cassie she never really picked Carolina debut tonight a transfer from Brown and theres an interesting tie here because Paxtons dad of course was an assistant at Chapel Hill under Matt Dy now with Tom thats Tim P because Doug woic at one point coached at Tulsa Tim Pete played for Tulsa and Tim Pete used to babysit Paxon woic and his brother and his brother thank you and Dan did a little field reporting tonight before the game huh you went over and talked to paxsons Mom Dougs wife L right well I talked to her and of course moms are always looking for babysitters uh particular when you need to go to basketball games and stuff so theyre always looking for babysitters and of course she Tim Pete wasnt babysitting while they were going to basketball games but right she said its hard to find babysitters and its great when you can get one of your there she is Leo woic great get one of the players to do it there you go timeout in Chapel Hill see you guys tomorrow see basketball everybody miss theres a little excited about it uh Clemson check the old scoreboard here Dan NC State leading uh by the way win another favorite in the Big South UNC Asheville of course wonder that Wake Forest Elon game Elon has scored 45 points theres still four minutes left in the first half 45 to 31 so defense certainly optional in that one heres pass great look Ro on Bott the basket full disclosure producer Matt Krauss and me are proud Elon LS on This Crew here tonight love Steve fors pulling for Billy Tylers Team B Away by Giles front Miss and here is look at truth Harris nice pass for Pierce in the dump that is the first Radford field goal in over five minutes theyre now two for their last 12 lead 13 for Carolina Ryan W thats what Im talking talk about W you get that ball you reverse it quickly and the defense is really really put some pressure on the defense to try to react foul on Turner will be his fourth and seven now on rord North Carolina theyve got 28 field goals now and 17 assists in those 28 field goals really nice pass inside and this just a situation where Bott has to come and help out and nobody stepped in in front of Pierce Radford desperately needed that one yep so Harrison Ingram will go to the line here two shot opportunity you know Wes another interesting stat here in the second half is in the first half North Carolina had 13 rebounds as a team Armando Bott had nine of them yeah and in the second half theyve got 15 rebounds and Bott only has four so Bott getting some help from his teammates on the board and arando checks out Jaylen Washington the Carolina so Ingram who hit the first back here to try and finish the two shot try and left it on the rim Washington and Pierce got locked up and a held ball will belong to the tar here thats just a really good job Yeah by Washington nice quick move and since North Carolina recovered the ball in the in the front in the back in the front Court excuse me shot clock doesnt reset to 30 it resets to 20 Davis heres roic Ryan the screen catch and shoot and Washington did a good job in there to clean it up on the offensive glass how about that Dan six to Washington hes made a couple of nice second and third effort plays there well we said he came in with a you know they they fought he was going to be a really good player slowed by injuries turned over to withs no look woic and knocked out of there Harris Will Come Away with the play by Giles possibly he should have looked 16point game Giles to Fall Away Highlanders cant get out of the shooting drought Antoine the three does well thats one of the you know theyve missed a couple of clean looks Wes but that for the most part in the second half theyve been shooting tough tough shots Brian Antoine now with 13 Ratford to within 13 and theres the foul on Pierce that will be his fourth so now Radford has three with four Pierce joins Turner and Archer who also have four thats the 18 foul so Washington will go to the line for one and one he was 65 last year hes two for two tonight W Radford has a couple of big guys who are missing Josiah Harris 67 excuse me 68 220 lb is injured hes not playing yep and TJ n Smith at 69 220 is not playing either because of injury they could sure use those big tonight yep nice pass K served it up for Washington Washington has done a nice job Wes playing on the inside you know hes a guy who fancied himself perimeter player but as he gets more comfortable playing on the interor catches the ball really well in there yep lead is 15 biggest of the night for Carolina anine now heres Burns Runner with a right hand and nicely handled that is truth Harris making another save the photographers have taken a beating down the basket in that exact spot great defense that time by cormack Ryan how about the kdo look here Dan well K you know kdo comes in with the reputation as somebody who can find players inside and that is just I mean thats one of those plays West where he can see whats going to happen before he catches the ball and just releases it immediately that was outstanding hes got six assists in the ball game tonight in his debut for the Tar Heels Giles lot of contact got the bounce hes a tough kid is he yeah 16 for Kenyan Giles you hear about guys who can see the court well Canó certainly seems to be one of them yeah had of four minutes to go missed shot by Carolina recover the roic hell sneak Baseline and score toxon roic now with five under four to go the lead is 15 this is one of these games Ill tell you in a second here Smith working for Radford fallway three and theyll run it to the Baseline thats where its recovered by Archer Giles has no problem launching and the rebound Washington this feels like one of these games where youre going to watch these two teams go their separate ways here after tonight and two weeks from now look at the box scores of their following games right Ryan on the drive nicely blocked by Antoine because I think both these teams are ascending a little bit right here out of game one tonight W I agree with you but the one thing that I would point out is that Radford you know and they theyve got some interesting games coming up theyre actually going to play a game at The Greenbrier yep exactly right theyre going to get Marshall on Friday night theyre going to play at the greenb well talk about that in more yeah the greenb darus Nichols wants to do a little film study in the bunker at the greenb no kidding woic the basket Carolinas got a lead back in a moment starts right here at noon BC Virginia Tech at alumni stadium and then Pittsburgh Syracuse at Yankee Stadium in the Bronx at 330 and then Mark May son Drake you may have heard of him Carolina Duke the battle for the victory bell is our ACC Network Prime Time game from beautiful Keenan Stadium at 800 Eastern Time right here on acc Network the Huddle fills in the gaps in between and always available on the ESPN app good to see number 14 at the ball game tonight up there from Independence High School in Charlotte back in the day when they had the big shoulder pad numbers in Carolina you could see them from the Moon eight to shoot heres Kad on the drive on the basket he so quick with the dribble okay Mr boner in the catalog of Carolina point guard quickness oh wow Im not going to make that evaluation after one game youre not doing that yet early early for that huh okay GS soft touch yeah theres been so many great point guards at North Carolina I think its unfair to compare that kid to anybody I showed you I showed you Phil Ford earlier hes he a pretty good one he was good off the bounce no question about that Hubert Davis had a what Marcus pige on staff in the off season Marcus p pretty good there he is behind Shawn may Wes you were talking about these two teams and as the season goes on looking at their schedules keep in mind that North Carolina as they go through their nonconference schedule obviously theyre trying to get ready for conference play but theyre trying to build a resume that will get them an at large bid to the NCA tournament if they dont win the ACC tournament Radford on the other hand theyre not trying to build any kind of a resume because there is no possible way that theres going to be two bids from the Big South so what radfords doing is playing against tough competition trying to piece things together the only games they really have to win are the games in the Big South tournament and thatll get them into the NCA tournament now and to be honest they were on a collision course for the Big South title game last year against UNC Asheville and got upset by Campbell in the semis at Charlotte so darrus Nichols and his team know exactly the path and I think by playing tonight Marshall Friday night the green bar in the game you mentioned on down the road with well they got games they got games at Clemson theyre going to play at West Virginia theyre going to play uh youre right at Clemson in late December but again they could win all those games and theyre not getting in that large bid to the NC tourament missed the layup stick back off the hand of Elliot under two to go its a 15point lead for Carolina Im really impressed with the way North Carolina just hung in there Radford played really well in the first half they made some tough shots in North Carolina they didnt get the scourage they didnt start reaching and poking on defense just continued to play I thought really good defense in the second half in particular they forced him into tough shots and then they rebounded the ball very effectively sure did Seth tremble on the floor they had eight turnovers in the second half only three in the second half in the first half only three in the second half that helps too yep uhoh bayot of three no good he missed all six of his temps from distance a year ago so technically hes 0 for seven in the last year in change final minute and a substitution here for darus Nicholls and this is a nice touch in a in a ball game like this the head coach of the Highlanders is going to go to the bottom of the bench here and hes going to bring Hunter Castleberry onto the floor David VOR from Hungry Dean lley from Charlottesville and Trevor row a freshman on his roster whos from Syracuse New York and the son of the former orange star mattro will come on here and we were talking about Elliot kdo earlier hes the preseason ACC Rookie of the Year as voted by those media types like boner and me and Elliot kadoo if he wins would be the fourth North Carolina guard to be the Rookie of the Year here are the other three and they are different in each of their own ways but Ed Kota might be the closest to where kadoo is in terms of guard skill Dan well particularly in terms of his ability to pass the ball the assist numbers there for Cota averaged almost seven did Ed Cota 12 to shoot thises Burns Carolinas also gotten into their bench a little bit here of cono the West Virginia transfer who originally is from the UK is on the floor for the first time James is 68 and where is jersey number 32 for North Carolina technically is still from the UK He is transferred from West Virginia just went to school at West Virginia thats right fact he spent some time in his homeland this summer and didnt really get here uh at the same time as the other players but okono is a guy with you know big guy 68 240 lb hes going to provide them some muscle inside that theyre going to need as they you know go down in ACC schedule heres will foul out of the ball game there is James who is from maen head in birkshire is it birkshire or Burkshire birkshire probably over here its Burkshire well just like over there its theater and here its theater no its only in certain parts of the country west North Carolina being one of them I did that for the benefit of statistician Fred Kyer who is from Ptown of course Rural Hall Im sorry the other suburb and heres a three ball thats Castleberry and roic the rebound and Carolinas going to win Tios led by five and a very nice t opening night provided by darus Nichols team Dan really impressed with the way Radford scrapped and when they make shots in the first half they stayed right in it Hubert Davis career win 50 as
