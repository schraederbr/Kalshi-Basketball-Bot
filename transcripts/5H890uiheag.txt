He plays to the crowd He plays to his teammates His head coach Will Wade told us earlier today about Copeland His best thing as he has the ball to begin the ball game is that he provides confidence for his teammates Yeah I I really like the way coach Weights talks about Copeland He had him as a player in the past And look at this Already gets the first assist of the game A threepoint shot from McNeel Yeah Paul Mcneel can heat it up in a hurry a sophomore from Rockingham North Carolina averaging nearly 14 points per game And here is how Luke LS lines up his seinals again this afternoon Chanty Wiggins Le Jones Robert McCrae Martin Somerville Alex Steam This is Wiggins number seven the former Clemson Tiger who has been playing very good basketball lately Shot clock down under five McCrae drives had it blocked by Ven Allen Luben And here comes the Wolfpack in their road red Seven holes in their garnet with gold trim McNeel Brie Copeland Williams and Luben And weve got our first bucket of the afternoon Make it our second bucket of the afternoon 5 nothing Wolfpack Off to the early start Well Scott you talked about both these teams looking for the three ball Florida State doesnt shoot it nearly as well as North Carolina State as they turn it over but that is part of their DNA Yeah thats something they got to worry about Nolles cough the ball more than any team in the ACC They got to protect the ball against this NC State team or they will make the play McNeel Oh McNeels aggressive early Hes got the quick early five points and theres a turnover Darren Williams strong to the bucket Tries to dump it off to Copeland Williams back out front Breed with a quick step around Steen into the lane for the pull up and its seven nothing Pack Wow Pack off to a picture perfect start here First forcing live ball turnovers getting opportunities to score Gets I mean gets this Florida State team that cannot get their defense set Here Applause goes McCrae Second in the ACC in assists and he is fouled as he gets into the lane Trying to stay in front of him was Alan Breed Well like big Rob McCrae he was a big reason why he were they were competitive against Duke And there is Luke L the 35yearold Clearwater native A seminal through and through Played in four NCAA tournaments for Leonard Hamilton for the NLES got his degree in 2011 but then played a senior year and hes so glad he did in 2011 2012 Won an ACC championship The NLES at the time were fairly new relatively speaking to the ACC Hold right now for the null They cant buy a bucket Stuck on that launch pad Allan Breed Williams back out front McNeel turned down the shot Instead its Copelan who has shot a remarkably good percentage this year at 52 Yeah right now you can see Florida States having a tough time controlling their own defensive glass McNeel again off the back iron Copeland keeps it alive and the Wolfpack controlling everything so far Another attempt off the mark by Williams and here comes Florida State Lob it up ahead Wiggins Copeland is a pest and pokes it away He has about a an a steal and a half per game and poke that away Itll be Florida State basketball on the baseline Yeah Florida State right now has to try to get into some offensive sense They got to try to help one another score McCrae lobbs it in to Steam the senior transfer from Division 2 powerhouse Florida Southern And back to McCrae The fifth Wiggins from the corner Its an air ball Yeah it seems like this early start time has got the NLES uh still half asleep Applause Luben backing his way over Wiggins N nothing North Carolina State Well thats what Luben does He does a nice job getting down that block He ranks number one in the ACC in field goal percentage He got to a spot on the floor and threw a nice little right hand hook in And you know the uh way North Carolina State put this roster together in the first year Will Wade theyve got a lot of weapons a lot of different options Five different players including Luben averaging double figures this season Yeah a lot of depth on that squad Theres Will We can see that three time South Conference coach of the year flat out gets it done He was at LSU as well where he won the Southeastern Conference Championship back in 2019 So this coach knows how to coach Yeah First two years as a head coach at Chattanooga when he won his first Southern Conference coach of the year then two at BCU five at LSU and now his first year in Raleigh McNeel among those snipers on the perimeter North Carolina States not shot it particularly well for a team that leads the ACC at 39 and yet they still lead 9 nothing as we reach the first media timeout It has been all NC State in this game Look at that Two dribbles middle come back with the left shoulder kneel But since that time the Wolfpack has actually missed six in a row from beyond the arc It can be fools gold but again this Wolfpack team shoots it very very well at 39 Theyre not going to stop shooting just because they missed their last few No And theyre getting those extra possessions cuz theyre getting on offensive glass You mentioned the seven rebounds Three of those coming on the offensive end So theyre doing a good job Florida State is at a disadvantage on the glass as it is but they just cannot get pounded Theyre a minus two rebounds for the season but if they get beat on that glass by eight or 10 rebounds its going to be real hard for them to win this basketball game Our baseline official Lee Cassell just stopped play Not sure what he saw but head straight over to the scorers table I think there might have been a shot clock uh issue there Well while they figure that out what does Luke LZ do as he is four and a half minutes in and his team hasnt scored Yeah hes got to get the ball into the hands of his primary players here You know McCraes gone to the basket a couple times Hes been close but hasnt been able to finish inside and then get Kobe McGee going as well Hes a little righty strong explosive player He can shoot the triple Try to get something for him coming off of a down screen and get a good look at the basket Well he has gone to his bench with Kobe McGee and Tomo Bassong in but this is a team that endured a fivegame losing streak earlier in the year Picked up a couple of wins before the break and since the break getting into ACC play they have played tough in losses at North Carolina and at Duke So that kind of got the NLES feeling like were heading in the right direction He felt like they came through the holiday break having offc court group environments rabbit share talk ask questions tell your story He said the guys have liked each other Now they really know each other He feels like theyre heading in the right direction Just not starting things off here this afternoon Wiggins got a good look with Song the last to touch and it goes back to the wolf pad Yeah a better look but again a long range shot when youre struggling to get off that launch pad at Mr for first four attempts Youre 0 for two from behind the arc I would have liked to seen even the you know the number one threepoint shooting team in the conference take the ball inside And the other thing the nullles have done very well this year is turn their opponent over Top 10 in the country and turnovers forced Will we the head coach with the Wolfpack said thats our number one thing Weve got to take care of the basketball Williams off the bounce No Ben Allen Luben nicely doesnt come down with it just puts it back through Its 11 nothing NC State Yeah Luben chews glass This guy averages over seven rebounds a basketball game just by getting inside and chewing that offensive glass And I love the fact that with Toma Bong between him and the basket Luben said Im not coming down with it Im just going to put it straight in Right And generally you wouldnt teach a a big player to do that You say gather the ball first and then come down with it Go back up with strength and power But Lubens just so good He was able to do it all in one motion Like you said Lubens got four early points NC State doing a good job keeping Florida State outside the paint McGee with the catch and shoot three And there will be no shutout today at the time Well theres Kobe McGee Weve talked with identified him as one of the guys thats kind of kind of have to try to get something going He and McCrae Well McGee was really good against Duke the other day Made four out of seven So you know he comes into this game feeling it around and out this time though And this is Matt Ael a highly touted freshman from Baltimore 66205 He brings an awful lot to the table for Will Wayade Yeah I think poise and toughness is what what coach Wade told us when we talked to him this morning Some kind of like wise beyond just being just a freshman Well theres Florida State taking the basketball away The Jay Jones into the paint and the whistle and a foul against the Wolfpack Well thats what Florida State needs right Like you if youre getting crushed on the glass you better get some turnovers You better get some steals You better get some opportunities to try to run out Alex Steen will check back in for Florida State and Shanty Wiggins will get his first rest Florida State has good balance offensively as well McCrae averages nearly 14 per game Wiggins 13 a game Jones and McGee also double figure scorers but they continue to struggle at that end Yeah I think thats why they brought Steen in is get second in the ACC in offensive rebounds over three and a half per basketball game And he just wasnt able to go get to the boards to try to get that missed Now Florida States finding a lot of bricks up there at that basket The NLES have missed five of their six from long range Copeland turned down the shot finds the open freshman able around and out Here comes Jones Quickly into the front court McGee is denied by Paul McNeel Quickly back the other way Here comes Copeland And weve got a foul along the baseline These officials are really letting them play Music Well you see in the open court what Copeland is looking to do He makes no look passes He brings a little southwest Philly to every time he takes the court There goes Copeland just heading to the bench for his first rest of the afternoon Into Ael Luben again on the offensive glass Couldnt come up with it Seminals have it Lubens like wrestling an alligator down there on that glass So he goes after everything I think Luben got banged up when he went to the floor Hes walk hes jogging a little gingerly Pick and roll Luben into the corner Arsenal finds Luben inside who draws the foul Theyre really sharing that basketball Well Coach Wade call him Luben a pick and roll specialist And when he got that ball on the roll he immediately fired it to the outside then rolled even deeper into the heart of that Nullles defense Got the ball back and there was nothing that the NLES could do but foul Luben must have took a shot to the face there He had to give the ball back to the official to clear his vision Applause Coming up next on the ACC Network our basketball triple header rolls on in Pittsburgh with the Panthers hosting Syracuse And then well cap the day with Virginia Tech hosting Cal at four Some good action there Now Luben this kid was in North Carolina Really came on in the second half of the season and he is continuing that good play here to the early part of this ACC year Yeah Fourth different school in four years three of them in the ACC Notre Dame his freshman year Vanderbilt as a sophomore last year in Chapel Hill and then this year at Raleigh That sort of thing would have been unheard of in your day Who would transfer from one to the other or back Yeah I dont know if youd be allowed that It wouldnt be safe for you back in the 80s and 90s to transfer from Carolina to either NC State or Duke Scott Williams the former Tarheel Im Doug Sherman here in Tallahassee Shot clock running down on the NLES again and off the mark for the shot cam miles Wolfpack on top up by 10 make it up by 12 They get up the floor in a hurry and Musa Sier makes it 153 State Just something you cant have You got to have some defensive balance You cant give a transition layup out for a miss shot to penetrate this NC State defense has been suffocating NC State is one of eight from three Florida State one of seven Arsenal with the takeaway for State asking the drive Coach love just mad You get the timeout you set up a play you can barely get the ball over half court before you you turn it over They dodged the bullet Not giving up a field goal there And a pregnant pause by McGee after making that three Yeah his second of the game And uh youre right maybe thats the one to try to get these guys going just a little bit here holding that follow through I mean hoping his team will follow his lead Able back out to Williams Averaging over 14 per game He has yet to score Just over nine minutes gone here in Tallahassee Green gets it swatted out of there right out to Ael who buries the three They make a great play defensively but it goes right to the hot shooter out there on the on the perimeter and he knocks it down And theres a good drive to the basket Uhoh Young man went down like a bag of bricks Seven previous Music Well you go inside you get your big fellas swap that thing outside Unfortunately hit it right to a pack uh player and hes able to stroke that triple Instead of giving up two inside you get burned and give up three on the outside Block shot by Sha Mohamd as coach LS has gone big with both he and Wiggins on the floor At the line is Cam Miles the freshman from Chicago His father Jimmy Miles played three years for Homer Drew back in the early 2000s at Valareerezo Cam still calls Chicago home even though the family moved to Orlando when he was a sixth grader So hes very comfortable here in the Sunshine State Couple of free throws and the Seinals back within 10 Yeah Seminal trying to pick up a little further higher out uh defensively to disrupt this NC State attack Williams from the corner Got it Darren Williams the senior from Sacramento with his first points of the afternoon Yeah youre going to see him do a lot of everything And uh he hes just a tough cover He can put the ball on the floor He can drive it to the hole I mean this is guy was a a preseason all ACC performer so you know he can he can play Miles once again shot clock down A contested shot taken by Florida State Turned right back over for the nullles Get it back Yeah tried to make the home run pass down the floor there Theyve been able to get their fast breaks Game going a little bit but maybe too too aggressive by Williams on that on that toss As you can see Will Wade and a couple of his players trying to convince the officials that their player was being held to no avail Yeah but I like this crew right Theyve been consistent Theyve been letting them bang Theyve been let them hold and scratch a little bit out there not blowing up too many whistles in the first part of this first half Somerville has his pass knocked away Arsenota Williams immediately picked up He finds Ael right on the money Well NC State is trying to blow the doors off the nullles here in this first half Applause Out of bounds Kobe McGee was on the end line when he was touching the ball and its now a six nothing run for NC State Yeah Well just a good extra pass Defense cant rotate as fast as the basketball and Ael knocked it down again with the backourt pressure Got to try to do something to disrupt this state attack 248 You couldnt have asked for a better start on the road in the ACC if youre coach Wade Copeland goes behind the back Kick to the corner Open look for Arsenal is good for three The red shirt junior from Bumont Makes it 278 Yeah they have spaced them out nicely in this basketball game They kind of just hitting him over the head with a bag of nickels They just got a lot of different players doing a lot of good things out there Well for a point guard like Copeland it must be a real treat to have so many capable shooters around the perimeter who you can find Its wonderful for this young man He just gives the basketball up One thing I like about it though he hits guys when they where theyre ready to catch and shoot Its one thing to pass the ball but its another thing to pass it with precision This is Tomo Bassong a freshman from Paris Music Applause Coach Wade excuse me Coach Lux is going deep into his bench trying to find some combination of guys that just want to go out there and compete And sometimes thats what you just got to do here Youre really taking it on the chin Just find some guys that want to compete Kind of just start cutting into that deficit Try to get a momentum going to the locker room and maybe anything could happen in the second half Applause able He has a tremendous stroke That is three made threes for the freshman from Baltimore Yeah its diddly and and its a quick release He He doesnt think about it too much Music Another innout shot for the Seinals and it goes back to the Wolfpack Tough break down there Or was that Jones down there along that baseline and made a tremendous spin move That ball was halfway down in the basket before it spat out on the right side We highlighted Robert McCrae the fifth off the top The point guard for Florida State He has yet to put his imprint on this game Williams got it The Wolfpack are shooting the lights out now Coach LS calls Wolfpack played their games The men actually played back in December a standalone game They call it the heritage game against Texas Southern back in their former home Reynolds Coliseum which I think is pretty cool I do know about Reynolds Palise And theres a good bucket for the NLES fighting it inside Thats what I want to see Take a little more fight right to the heart of that NC State defense Well it had been a 151 run for NC State to open up the big lead I love that right there Just a good power move right inside to the paint there Throwing that thing in off the glass Well Tomo Bong the first seol other than Kobe McGee to put it through the cylinder so far here this afternoon Copelands pass deflected away Bon to the left hand Turning defense into offense like the Nolles need to do Yeah you got to sometimes just get a little benched when you know some place where you dont expect it from when youre struggling And look at this one Of course back to back turnovers Abels pass a little too tall for Williams Little life in the building now for the Seinals Yeah what what the Seinals do really well They force over 10 steals a game And then I love this creating offense with your defense when youre struggling to score backto back buckets inside Well no Florida State starters have scored yet 13 minutes into the game Heres McGee who has made a couple of threes Takes it to the bucket Cant get the bounce Check that rip Seems like these nullles have had a couple shots that have hung around that rim but have not gone in Is that Williams again It was Copeland And it looks like we may have a technical foul It is against Quadier Copeland after he made the three Well coach Wade is not happy Now he calls Copelan his yapper and he is really upset with that young man and pulled him out of the game Well he spent his first two years at Syracuse playing for the Hall of Famer Jim Beheim as a freshman and then for Adrien Autri his sophomore year before transferring to McNe State and playing last year and this year for Will Wade And all three of those head coaches know that youve got to take the good with the bad when it comes to Cuadia Copelan Yeah And you know in the young mans defense early on at least sometimes that youre youre kind of talking to maybe you heard something but something on the bench was said when you were shooting it but you got to realize youre up 20 and everything is going really well for you uh in your squad Sometimes you just have to backpedal and head on down the floor and leave that alone because a couple free throw opportunities which they made one out of two and then get an opportunity to kind of run a set play here You dont want to change the momentum of this game needlessly Able got a hand on the basketball to slow down Basson Now Jones into the lane and this time off the window for two plus the foul Well thats kind of exactly what I was talking about The change suddenly in the attitude of the Siminals You get the freebie on the free throw and Jones comes down with a hard block basket They finally got one of those interior here shots to go down and now a threepoint opportunity So this could potentially be a fourpoint play for Florida State A team that was pretty lifeless now showing that they do have a heartbeat Jay Jones with the three points Those are the first points of any Florida State starter here this afternoon The senior from Neptune Beach Florida allows for the NLES to pick up full court Foul in the back court against Bon who has given them a boost coming off the bench The young man from fresh uh from France 68203 Yeah Long athletic energetic Youre absolutely he has been that bench uh bump that they have needed you know with his couple buckets inside the steels pressuring in the back court Theyve been letting that that kind of contact go I was a little surprised that that was our officials today Lee Cassell Trey Stein and Chris Merllo Luben with a terrific pass inside unable to do anything with it Arsenal other than to get it to Williams who misses Long rebound stays with NC State Yeah that State really doing a nice job on the offensive glass and a reach with that McGee slapping at Williams Hell get whistled for the foul Just the fourth team foul right now uh on Florida State So side out of bounds but again killing them on the glass Yeah 217 at last count Wolfpack dominating the glass over the seminals 217 Oh my goodness Yeah they they got to do a better job controlling their defense and flash You cant cant keep playing defense without playing offense Williams hes too big and strong inside Well hes a grown man at 66 Able to score at all three levels and he gets that deep Easy two points for Williams Yeah Red Raider last couple years uses his strength and his size around the basket really well Eight points now for Williams who closes out on McGee Luben and Jones were after it Jones third foul on Le Jones Oh no thats bad news You got to get a sub in for him So youre already down by nearly 20 points and then you one of your key players picks up three in the first half trying to get on the offensive glass but just this little swipe right there when you were trying to get a board that youre not in position for Its an easy call for the officials to make Applause Going to Williams again draws a second defender That means Abel is open and hes got the touch again Now 12 points for the top 25 recruit last year Young man from Baltimore now with 12 to lead all scorers Yeah Four triples Uh doing it from the outside So at some point in time you got to know your personnel You know Ky is what we say in the NBA And the same thing applies here in in college If you got a hot shooter thats knocking down three triples on you you want to make sure he doesnt get a fourth But he he knocked that one down cuz hes getting clean looks and give NC State a lot of credit They are moving that basketball uh and really spacing these seminals out and theyre doing it with precision passes So Ael goes out Alan Breed comes back in front end of the one and one missed by Robert McCrae the fifth the senior from Columbia South Carolina averaging 14 a game still scoreless today Yeah theyre leading scorer just just cant get it done again Williams going oneonone backing down the smaller defender and foul on the rebound Well doing such a good job not fouling most of this quarter and it seems like every time and uh either on the defensive end or the offensive end Theyre getting whistled for fouls So their next foul Mississippi State will be shooting the front end of one and one Going that way Going that way Double team off the inbound Arsenal Applause Music Williams draws the foul Crafty Yeah wanted wanted to show the threepoint shot to get the defender to close out because theyve been getting just scorched from behind the line Then when the defender gets off his feet for all you young players out there you dont want to go around the defender You want to go through the side of the defenders body especially Williams as you said crafty knowing hes going to earn himself a tip to the uh the free throw line He grew up attending Sacramento Kings games at Old Arco Arena where his mom Catherine used to work and he has had an interesting journey You talked about Texas Tech the last two years but he didnt have a lot of scholarship offers coming up through Capitol Christian School Went to Nevada his freshman year and really does credit his head coach there Steve Alford for helping him become a better shooter and a better player And with his hard work his career has really taken off Yeah I I Ive covered a couple of his games last year Uh the kid plays with power He plays with an intensity Hes got a high motor Yeah hes fun to watch Hes like an old throwback player at 66 225 Hes now got 10 points and that has happened quickly Theres a good strong drive Was that Rob McCrae going down that right lane line is So again when you cant get it going from the outside youve been stuck on that launch pad you hadnt scored a point all night long you got to get yourself to that free throw line This little lefty needs to see that ball Just visualize it going through the basket working on his stroke a little bit so maybe his next outside shot will be true Well he was so good in the loss to Duke Three for three shooting the basketball from deep He is a pass first point guard with Florida State but he can fill it up too He put 36 on Stson a couple of years ago for Jacksonville and was first team allconerence last year with the Dolphins before transferring back to the ACC Of course he began his college journey at Wake Forest but he has had a sluggish start along with the rest of the Seinals to this afternoons ball game kind of seemed like the Sims fell back into some sort of a uh a loose press and Luben flashed to the middle and again the passing by state NC State has just been perfect in the early part of this basketball game and Luben caught that ball and he knows what to do with it when he gets the ball below those the letters of the ACC logo down there He sure does Scott Ben Allen Luben leads the ACC in field goal percentage at 66 And hes even better in the second half 77 of the shots he takes after the break go in My good I mean thats thats getting it done I used to thought I was a pretty good field goal pursued shooter at 55 Make me feel like Allan Iverson up there throwing up brick after brick Ill tell you this guy here hes put on about 15 10 to 15 pounds of muscle too since he was uh at North Carolina Grade cut grade five Steam with the assist and the layup by Cam Miles Yeah hes saying his praises and he turns his head and gets burned on a back door layup So a good opportunity there for NC State Now like you say theyve gone back into this zone defense but got a lot of holes inside Luben as the Wolfpack continue to dominate on the glass Almost every possession it seems like they get two and three looks Somerville with a step along the baseline has his pass poked out of bounds NC State ball McGee was the last to touch it Well this was a beautiful back door play by the Nolles there to get a bucket inside Maybe thatll be the one that gets the And after a slow start shooting the basketball the ACCs best percentagewise threepoint team has been shooting the lights out Heres McNeel Jr Another trip Found on Q Paul McNeel Jr who earlier this season put 47 points on Texas Southern Hes now got eight and this is the largest lead of the afternoon Yeah those 47 points he did it on 11 made threepoint field goals set a NC State record tied an ACC record with our own ESPNs Dennis Scott one other So you know this man can fill it up from behind the arc Better get a hand in his face Yeah those are the most points by an ACC player since NC States alltime leading scoreer Rodney Monroe put 48 on Georgia Tech back in 1991 Oh we should mention Craig Dawson in O2 for Wake Forest also had 11 made threes in one game along with 3D Yeah I tell you what uh Rodney Monroe and Chris Ciani back in the uh 80s and 90s we call them Fire and Ice Do you remember those two Cats those guys Tom Googliada Tom Googliata Thats right He was on those squads as well Chucky Browns in the house as well He he he was a little bit before those dudes but he was out there doing his thing Thats when they played in Reynolds and they had the floor It wasnt wood It was like this rubber hardened surface that we played on I remember you and I got to a fight with Oh Brian Demo on at Reynolds one time He punches through more more shves than anything else A lot of jaw McNeel gets into the lane off the hesitation The three by Terrence Arseno hit the side of the backboard Here comes Florida State at the other end Heading to the free throw line will be Kobe McGee Thats what Im talking about Simols play your defensive class and get your transition game going Thats the basketball weve saw them play in the ACC against North Carolina and then Duke last game Rebound the ball and run Music No surprise Will Wade not agreeing with that call Still working the officials along the far sideline as Kobe McGee puts in another free throw Hes got eight points Hes been the best offensive weapon for Luke LZ so far today He went straight up Hes still giving it to Hes up 26 points and hes riding that official like hes down by 10 Well he has taken his teams to seven NCA tournaments in the last eight years that have been played as head coach at VCU LSU and McNe State Of course that excludes 2020 with the pandemic when they didnt have an NCA tournament So there was a quick bump immediately in energy Got into the transfer portal and did very very well recruiting players who fit well together and also who come from winning programs which is a big part of what coach Wade and his staff were looking for Yeah another defensive class and Wiggins controlling his his area down there on that board McCrae to the right hand for his first made field goal this afternoon 4826 NC State Okay I know why youre still down by over 20 but this is a nice little bump of energy right Some buckets inside and some good defensive stops getting out and running 6 run for the Simmons And that ensures this wont be the lowest scoring first half of the season for Florida State They only had 24 against Texas AM earlier in the year Well I love this young man right here I call him Axen Jackson in a pair of basketball shorts cuz hes always moving I mean thats the guy I thought we were going to see from the jump today Now hes starting to pick it up Something about an early tip time Sometimes you dont have a shoot around that morning You have kind of a a walk through or a chalk talk but uh now theyre starting to find their stride here at 100 tonight Freshman Phenom Caleb Wilson and 17th ranked North Carolina host Wake Forest at 6 Eastern Then following that game we will debut our documentary chronicling the 1993 National Championship winning UNC team led by Dean Smith Youll get never before seen footage as well as interviews with players and coaches Thats all tonight on ACCN and the ESPN app I love it Well I would expect you to play Smith was like my daddy He was like my second father Uh when I was at North Carolina I wrote my book I had to put him on the cover of my book Wiggins has been held in check That was actually Shawn Mohamd with the miss shot Thats going to be free throws the other way now Trying to get on the offensive glass Got a little too aggressive coming over the back here Pushing underneath But you got to do something right Like youre youre down by 20 You got to do something to try to get some extra possessions But the officials here this I guess about the last five or six minutes of game time really tightened up their whistles Mus freshman from the Gambia in West Africa at the foul line We should mention NC State playing without Trey Hollowman again today with an ankle sprain but hes making progress The senior missed their last game but is expected to come back for their next game There he is And he was in uniform with the other guys for pregame warmups He has gotten rid of the boot so he is certainly trending in the right direction Yeah good to see these guys out here McCrae you know he had a high jump record as a high schooler in track and field of 6 10 in We saw a little taste of that right there Yeah A little hang time down there around the basket That that being lefty I think just fools players sometimes You gain a little advantage cuz theyre used to playing against right hand did offensive players You get to the left you get a just a half second more to operate Well he won a state championship in the high jump in Columbia South Carolina for AC Flora High School He also played football was the quarterback and wide receiver at times and played high school basketball for his dad Robert McCrae I Darien Williams gets the role for NC State Yeah Im a little jealous of his hop I couldnt jump over a park bench at my best at most athletic Well at 610 you didnt need to jump as much right I can barely get over a turf these days Too many made free throws for Williams 5328 The Wolfpack has been in complete control right from the start Florida State didnt score until after the first media timeout This is the most points scored in the first half since their game against NC Central way back in November Layup by Cam Miles Nice job Miles was hiding out in that left corner and State forgot about him and like a bullet he shot out of that corner and a a great find to get a bucket inside Theyve gone inside more this uh second part of this first half here Getting some uh success with it And Ill be curious to see if we uh get a chance to see Quadier Copeland play again here this afternoon since he picked up his technical foul Will Wade has made it very clear thats a problem So hes been on the bench ever since Yeah he didnt like it I I I think he sent him a message for sure Id be a little surprised if he gets some second half action but you best believe that uh Coach Wades going to give him even a little bit more of an earful Let him know if he does something like that in the second half he wont see the floor the rest of the day McCrae off the hesitation goes around Luben and hangs in the air to draw another foul Is that that birch you were talking about right there Is so explosive off the ground and and you mentioned its like a hang time Well again he is quite capable of scoring but in his Florida State debut He set an alltime program record with 17 assists against Alorn State I mean he is a guy who really makes this offense go Yeah See I talk about how hes such a strong lefthand driver They they overplayed him to take away the left Uh but hes still skilled enough to take the ball hard with the right hand Music Shawn Mohamd back in Wiggins also on the floor for Florida State Yeah I I know Florida State down by 22 right now right But they got a little momentum a little life They found a little something here in these last five six minutes At least they can take to the locker room and feel good about Sonia gets the three off in time and he banks it in Everything going NC States way 5631 the score The shots They were only threepoint shots So he will play from off the bench if indeed he comes into the ball game Yeah Bong was that guy that gave him that energy right He only had the five points but he had a steal He had a transition basket He hard plots walking inside Well Robert McCrae the fifth the ACCs second leading assist man is proactive looking for his own shot to start this second half Yeah Of those 11 starters points he had six of them And then he decided Im a senior I got to lead this team We have to get started faster than we did in this first half He goes inside and gets him a bucket inside And by the way for NC State same starting five in the second Quadier Copeland who after picking up a technical foul in that first half did not play again but he is out there to start the second Starting point guard who has been playing at an allconerence level this season Yeah I think Coach Lux told his team Hey our threes arent falling We had you know 12 points in the paint All of those came in the last half of that first half Lets go inside See if we cant get in He stayed in some foul trouble by taking the ball inside Coach currently in division one basketball back at his alma mater where he played four years for Leonard Hamilton Was a very good point guard back in the day Off the inbound Steen the inbounder able to come in and grab the air ball that was put up by Le Jones And so now Steen made a couple of foul shots in the first half Well go back to the line Yeah thats what Steen does This guy is second in the ACC in offensive rebounds Over three and a half Os Thats like 50 of the Oboard of the total rebounds that he gets You mentioned it Knocked in a couple free throws in that first half See if he can get a couple more here in this second half But hes got to get himself going as well Well hes got to be that energy dude uh off that can uh really kind of set a fire set picks roll hard get this team fired up about getting some buckets inside Theyre doing a good job going inside here Yeah that tshirt I like Steam machine Makes the second free throw Look at more fullcourt pressure here by the NLES trying to get some more turnovers and cut into that large deficit Pressure handled nicely by NC State Cladier Copeland given room to take the three Turns it down Good hustling defense by Florida State Find the open man on the right wing and its missed by Arsenal Here comes McCrae in a blur Pass back to him Deflected McCraes got it Dump it off Steen taken away by Copelan We didnt see a whole lot of Copeland after he got that tech Van called for the foul and that is his fourth But doing good things here as Copelan he when you young digs and Steves not a young player but when you relatively young when you bring that ball down below your waistband bad things happen to you And Copelan was able to use those athletic hands to stole that ball away McNeel under control off the front iron Somerville and McCrae running Its McCrae to the bucket off the window for two Oh my He jumped up and kind of contorted his body with that hang time and used his off hand Remember hes a lefty He used his right hand to throw that thing over the top of the defense Hes the first Seol to reach double figures with 10 Little bit of life here inside the Tucker Center This is a lot more life from the Seinals than we saw in that first half Heres another steal Le Jones and the NLES keep coming They were down 11 nothing to start the game Trailed by as many as 28 Its now back to a 17point ball game Yeah the tuck is starting to come alive too Fans getting into this cuz they gotten something to cheer about Eight unanswered points for Florida State That run is stopped by Darien Williams Darian Williams calm down people Were still in control of this Wants to get make sure that this team realizes theyre in a good place Mr Offensive rebound does it again Alex Steen with the throwd down Thats what I was talking about the energy that Steam can provide there with those offensive boards and I love that follow jam Oh McCrae bad foul 35 ft away from the basket Florida State Well when you think 69 basketball player you dont think hockey but the young man who grew up in Minnesota actually played hockey until the family moved south and he had a growth spurt and he said You know what This basketball thing might work out Yeah he does a great job probably been closing in on 800 rebounds for his career Hes still got a lot left to go in this year And let me just tell you all you can start getting over 700 800 rebounds Uh that means that you have playing with a a desire and intensity You want to clean that glass Yeah And he was also an 1100 point scorer over three years at Division 2 Power Florida Southern Big answer for NC State Yet another threepointer their first made here in the second half And its back to a 20point game Steam working on Luben Bad pass taken away by Copeland who once again says Give me that Bounce pass to Luben in transition and the big man who took the pass about 20 ft from the bucket able to put it on the floor and draw the foul I love that about both Copelan and Luben right Guys with size that have good wheels have good hands You can throw the ball to Luben about just any place on this court He Something goods going to happen to that young man Slooping one of four Wolfpack in double figures this afternoon Steve when he gets that ball down on that block hes got to learn to be a little bit more selfish and try to finish He tried to make that pass along the baseline And I would love to see him try to just go up with some power through the defender and see if he cant get a bucket or get a foul Two for two at the stripe for the senior from Orlando 6241 NC State Toby McGee drive and dish and denied by Luben Copelan steps through right to the rim and lays it in That does not take NC State long after a steal or a block shot to get that thing into the scoring area Nice job by Luke protecting the paint Little friendlier rim at this end as AJ Swinton gets into the ball game and now into the scoring column Yeah the scoring is really heating up for Florida State which is good to see I mean they scored was it 31 points in that first half but uh a lot of those came late Luben give the assist to McNeel Just trading buckets now movement I tell you I I like his size his frame his hands his concentration and his finishes around the basket Here comes NC State again Copeland trying to find a teammate Pass deflected out of bounds Itll stay at this end Last touch was AJ Swinton who just before this timeout able to find the range on the outside Well trying to steal a page out of that NC State book but they knocked in 11 threes Florida State wants to get a couple threes of their own and then the big strong Mac truck going down and played both football and basketball Thats amazing Pretty cool stuff Yeah So the idea is that Lopez you know hes not in basketball shape Hes only gone through a couple of days of practice but they do expect to use him at some point this year The possibility of a red shirt is still there but Luke LZ is enticed by the talent He was a high threestar basketball recruit a fourstar football recruit as a wide receiver and as a point guard Both programs are so happy hes here on campus early Yeah Coach Lou he was singing his praises in our little Zoom call that we had with him on Thursday He just says unfortunately the young man doesnt know any of the plays yet So got to try to get him acclimated to exactly what theyre doing Yeah Part of the reason why hes not in full uniform today is that theyre still waiting for the uniform number eight to show up They get on short I cant believe that they dont have a uni They could have slapped the eight on the back of Well theyve got five different versions and so theyve got to get five versions of number eight Apparently they couldnt get all five Just get like a plain one with a Sharpie and put just draw an eight on the back of it Oh my gosh Paul McNeel Jr now with 14 points And on that last graphic we showed about the multisport athletes people forget about Lee Corso of course we remember him for the last what 35 years on ESPN and on college game day as Arseno scores Yeah this is getting ugly right now Here at Florida State as we have the biggest lead of the day Lee Corso was a great football player when he graduated He was the programs alltime leader in career interceptions as all as well as being their quarterback In baseball he was good enough that the Brooklyn Dodgers offered him a contract to play baseball And then that one season he suited up for the basketball team here at FSU Got into one game and so he is a football basketball guy on that list That I mean it truly is a amazing ability to be able to do that Look at Williams going inside just wrecking havoc with his large frame taking out players underneath But NC State right now he they got a couple dudes on their on their uh squad I think as well that could probably play a little football I could see Williams being like a middle linebacker Hes 66 225 Yeah I can see it You think hes only 225 I think hes probably closer to 240 lbs Maybe 245 Ill let you say that Im not saying that Yeah Well you know hey he could play what Tight end Whats Whats Travis Kelce Isnt he about that that height that size Maybe Travis Kelce might be closer to 285 No question Hes got the build of a football player Now hes hes got the touch of a basketball player Calmly knocking down that free throw there and pushing their 30 point cushion now for NC State Well coming up in high school out in California while you were being recruited by everybody in the country for basketball did you play any football at 610 No I my first love was baseball and I I was a great baseball player home run hitter played pitcher shortstop first base Then my strike zone started getting a little too big Those things to throw that thing down at my knees and I couldnt get down there to go get it Paul McNeel Arsenal active on the offensive glass The former Houston Cougar who played in last years national championship game the loss for Houston to Florida Again one of nine transfers in for first year head coach Will Wade And the majority of them played in last years NCAA tournament Yeah he went out and got some guys that are winners know how to play got some senior experience on that squad He got people in Raleigh real excited about the Wolfpack Oh the six tickets have gone up by almost 15 He brought two of them with him from McNiss including the man with the basketball Claudia Copeland They made it to the tournament last year and knocked off Clemson in the first round Shot clock at two McNeel fouled on the shot Itll be a threeshot foul against Robert McCrae the 5th Yeah I I I just dont understand that for the life of me I weve done a number of games now together Doug and we we constantly see defenders trying to challenge threepoint shots and committing fouls Its its all you got to do at this point right now is stay on the ground and get a hand up No reason to jump at that ball Very rarely are threepoint shots blocked All you got to do is try to get a hand into vision of the shooter not try to get up towards the ball Thats when you start getting guys on the wrist And so now thats the fourth personal on Robert McCrae the fourth or fifth rather And at this point Luke LS down by 30 points is going to keep his leader on the floor He he doesnt have a choice Hes the one guy thats been playing with some energy and you know like you said down by 31 what where theres no place else he can go He does not have anybody that is has given him the energy that McCrae has McNeel gets two out of three from the line A 12 nothing run for the Wolfpack They have tried just about everything I mean theyve tried the the half court zone defense Theyve theyve tried the fullcourt zone defense Uh Florida State just cant find a a way to stop this NC State uh attack Offensively theyve been better but defensively they cant get it going Somervilles pass knocked away Arsenal with the steel McNeel fumbled it Heres Copeland getting downhill and hes fouled Count the basket and one He is a special kind of talented shot He got that ball a good step outside that threepoint line and used his off hand his left hand to start his move to the basket And as the defense comes over he switches back to his right hand absorbs that contact and a great concentration to finish the play Well that style of play he picked up in Kings Essing Park in Southwest Philly It was about a 10minute walk away every day from home This is before cell phones He and his buddies just would show up every day and spend their entire day in the park I think theyre going to get McCrae for another foul Is that going to be five on him pushing off trying to get that ball I think that was a fifth on McCrae Hes fouled out with over 13 minutes to play So Coach LS rolled the dice and came up snake eyes as theyve lost their best player for the remainder of this ball game Able the freshman just into the game and he has to use a timeout Took the inbound along the baseline got double teamed immediately So well take a 30 second break as well and be right Its been that kind of afternoon for Florida State Yeah nothings gone right for coach LS and his squad You know defensively they cant get many stops Offensively can get nothing going Now theyve lost their their best player and theyre just in a world of hurt NC State give a lot of credit where credit is due They have spaced this team out behind the threepoint arc They drive the ball hard to the hole and they get another bucket inside Guadier Copeland going to work Hes now got 10 after going right around Alex Steam Heres Martin Somerville who Luke Lou says despite being a sophomore hes the loudest voice out there If anybodys going to get his teammates going itll be him He sets up Chanty Wiggins who started the second half on the bench after a very quiet first half Hes got his first points of the game Yeah Message received right Like you can either play hard or youll sit And uh I dont think he likes sitting on that bench cuz he stroked a cold bloodooded quarter three All four of his attempts from the floor have been from beyond the ark Answered right back by Paul McNeel Jr 19 points now for that young man I think what is that His fifth triple Somerville off the back iron and out of bounds And thatll take us to our under 12 media timeout where NC State has it on cruise block presented by Food Lion And the fun will wrap up at 600 with North Carolina and its superstar freshman Caleb Wilson taking on the Wake Forest Demon Deacons followed by the premiere of Were Number One the 1993 North Carolina Tarheels story with Dean Smith and the guys and they have some footage I am told that you have never seen before as well as new interviews and other features So its going to be a long day a good day of mens college basketball here on the ACC Network And well so much more to talk about in terms of ACC hoops this year in terms of prospects The the nonconference went so well that as of Friday in the net rankings 13 ACC teams rank among the top 70 in the country Thats the most of any league and eight of those are in the top 40 Yeah there its a much better conference this year 15 teams all with double digits and wins Yeah you got Duke Clemson uh at the top of the ACC standings but dont sleep on Miami Theyve won eight straight games Doug McNeel No into the game for the rebound Maluke for Florida State Well theres another game not on the ACC network that Im really looking forward to coming up at the top of the hour over on ESPN Duke and SMU as the song gets the bucket and the foul Duke of course is 141 but SMU back into the national rankings for the first time in years this week This will be a huge test for the Mustangs when they go in to Cameron Indoor again Thats on ESPN at 200 Yeah and theyre playing some good basketball Well they gave Carolina good smacking and down in Dallas last time that they played And I tell you what I I like watching this Cam Boozer He is much CTV So uh thats going to be a good one Applause Toma Bong at the foul line He has been one of the few bright spots this afternoon for the Seinals Yeah He he had the five points in the first half Hes got he had great energy Kind of got the Siminals going a little bit Breathe some life uh into this squad with that bump off the bench that he provided Williams had it poked away Bong has been a pest defensively today Yeah hes been up in Williams and Williams is using that off arm to push off a lot but the officials are not calling it If they dont call it its not a push off Keep doing it Youre absolutely right I I was the master of trying to get away with anything that I could Of course How did you stick in the NBA for 15 years Wasnt this is my my athleticism thats for sure Im the alltime ACC fouls leader so I I know a few a few things about uh p pushing and grabbing guys Coach Smith didnt mind It worked out more often than not I imagine Well we needed somebody to do the dirty work and uh I I was uh up for that task The funny thing is I dont remember fouling out of many games I I was given five fouls and I think I used four and a half in most every basketball game Muses gets one out of two He was the last addition to the freshman recruiting class for Will Wade over the summer Matt Ael got a hand on it He was the last to touch So Florida State will keep it Well Florida State has kind of gone back to shooting that ball quickly from the outside and obviously huge deficit and I dont think they can come back and win this basketball game even with 10 and 12 minutes to play I could be wrong Uh but they havent shown enough light They havent seen enough defense to make me think that theyre going to do that But what they have to do they have to try to establish something for the next time that they play right So they they cant get sloppy where its just pickup basketball game They still got to work on their sets They still have to be fundamentally sound defensive I guess what Im trying to say is bad play will lead to worse play A good play will lead to better play But the next time they step on the floor there was a nice little shot off glass That was old school like Tim Duncan there Hes on to the board Martin Somerville who last year was the rookie of the year in the American East Conference for UMass LOL with his first two points today Midway through the second half in a game that was immediately seized by NC State They scored the first 11 before the Seinals finally got on the board Wiggins leads the break Good hustle in pursuit by Aier Maluke who didnt play in the first half but the sophomore from Baldwin PA looking for more minutes Yeah and thats what I thats the kind of play Im talking about right Like rushing the ball up the floor sharing it getting on the offensive glass and getting the put back Now they get a theyre going to get a blocking foul here Legal streak Yeah Once or rather Music Well Will Wade has tested his team They survived their nonconference Didnt win every game they would have liked to of course Lost to Texas lost at Auburn lost to Kansas in overtime but they were close And this is a team that starting the day Joe Lardi had him on the right side of the bracket as one of the last four buys in the field of 68 Yeah one of the toughest nonconference schedules in the com country hes not afraid of anybody Hell play any place anywhere anytime Well the Wolfpack was picked fourth in the preseason in the ACC behind Duke Louisville and North Carolina And while some people may feel like Virginia would be that fourth team now you cant just disregard this talented Wolfpack team No you you better not If if you sleep on them like I think the Simols did this uh morning afternoon youre going to be in trouble as they got some talent and they play hard They play together Their passing is uh with precision and they can shoot it and and and right now he talked about one of the top threepoint shooting teams in in the ACC and they are getting after it this this afternoon knocking in 11 in the first half and that trend here in the second half has continued And the uh Wolfpack are expecting in their next game against Georgia Tech a week from today to have another one of their very good shooters Trey Hollowman back from that ankle injury Oh yeah that was a long two right there and almost a threepoint shot on that right side of the floor But Jay Jones makes it 8754 Foul on Matt Able for NC State Kind of one of those delayed calls by the official kind of really wanted to play to just play on Theyve been letting a lot of contact go but when you go to the ball uh excuse me go to the ground with the basketball that it really puts a lot of pressure on officials to at least have to stop the play and make a call at that point Well I think the officials want to get this game over as about as fast as coach blouse would like to at this point That is Abels fourth foul He and Breed both have four The starting point guard for the seminals Robert McCrae already fouling out of the ball game this afternoon And it its tough Youre in the ACC especially at home You you want to have a good showing And Ive been on the wrong side of some of these beatd downs before uh not so much when I was at Carolina but certainly when I played in the NBA and the things that he did during the holiday break and his team together and not just say that they understand didnt know each other but to get them to understand where everyones coming from and uh to get that build that camaraderie do those types of things to be able to survive moments like this when you have a stinker on the Music Kobe McGee Cant make the second And the miss pulled down by Darien Williams the uh senior from Sacramento Williams have a nice game I talked about him being one of those stat sheet stuffers 17 points eight rebounds five assists knocked in a couple triples Kind of a clunky offensive set for NC State Doesnt matter Just give the ball to Williams and hell rattle in the three Yeah his third triple now with 20 points and hes leading all scorers and hes doing a great job Hes one of these guys that they got from Texas Tech who he wasnt the the main guy for the Red Raiders but he was the glue guy for the Red Raiders Able with the steel Arsenal to the bucket and hell have a chance for three Well now theyre just showing off Theyre getting steals Theyre getting transition And they playing like this theyre going to be okay Dont see any problem against Georgia Tech And as much as I like coach David Start his team is just not ready for prime time as of yet Not for the smoke that is Wolfpack can blow on you No the Wolfpack has five different players in double figures steamrolling their way to triple figures Its an impressive group This is my first time getting up close and look at a Will Wade team and I see why hes been so successful everywhere hes gone His teams are motivated and they are locked in defensively and they play with energy and passion 20 for Williams 19 for McNeel 13 for Ael and Luben and 10 points six assists three steals for Quadier Copeland Yeah they they got five guys at double figure scoring And not surprising knocking down this another triple their 16th triple of the ball game 16 triples And and if if Im coach LS over there I I wouldnt know how you would stop all of these triples Theyre coming from all over the floor Able McNeel give McNeel 20 points now Hes knocked in five triples of his own NC State pressuring still looking to force more turnovers on Florida State Well Arsenal just down here with a nice little step back triple and bench loves it And then working hard on the offensive glass there with Mcde follow jam Hes got 21 That old song said Mom M mama say therell be days like this Yep And this is this is where the coaching this is where a good coach really earns his money right Its its easy in the wins to keep guys hungry and motivated and working hard Its a lot tougher when youre on the the wrong side of a 40point beatd down Meanwhile the beat goes on for the workmanlike Van Allen Luben 100 points The last time NC State scored 100 in an ACC game on the road you have to go all the way back to 1991 in a loss at Maryland Wow 35 years later 35 years ago Yeah Well that was on the wrong side of a of a of a 100point game Theyre going to be on the on the right side of a 100point game today I I said 40 points Thats Are they up by 45 Its hard to do math live Its hard for me to do math anytime but certainly live on air So four 45 points Theyve done it offensively Theyve done it defensively They do give up a triple there Stroking it from the outside Jay Jones in double figures now Seols up to 58 points Lubens pass taken away by Jones the senior from Neptune Beach Florida looking for three at the other end and he missed everything And why he probably was distracted is Luben turned the ball over the biggest guy on the floor sprints down and challenges the shot Thats one effort on Lubens part but also theyve been taught you turn the ball over you get back on defense and hustle back and try to make up for your mistake And its exactly what Luben did You know you played a hand in ending the career of Le Joness father at Oklahoma Your senior year Les father Jackie Jones oh was that was the Big Eight Conference newcomer of the year for the Oklahoma Sooners He averaged 157 And your North Carolina Tarheelss took him out Yeah thats right We beat them in the NCA tournament They were number one in the country And Rick Fox hits a runner along the baseline to give us the upset to send us back to the Sweet 16 And Dean Smith said after that broadcast on the air for CBS I really wanted to get this one for Scott so he could play another game cuz you had a rough one even though the Tarheelss beat the Sooners that game and you were able to bounce back and in a losing effort in the Sweet 16 your final college game You played very very well Rough game is is not even the words for it I was terrible in that game against the Sooners as NC State gets another red out for Luben Uh yes I do remember that quite well And I was I fouled out of that basketball game I think it was on the bench with uh five fouls as well And your opponents son has the basketball right now And he knows about that game He immediately yesterday said when told Scott Williams was going to be here hes like Oh yeah that Rick Fox beat my dads team He knew immediately the reference to that ball game Yeah Rick sa saved us on on that one as he did many times throughout the course of that season We werent a very good team as far as Carolina teams go We lost double digits but still finished with 20 wins and got a chance to get back to the Sweet 16 where coach Smith had a a streak of double digit trips to the Sweet 16 So we didnt want to be the group that broke that uh streak for Coach Smith able air ball on the runner Here comes Jones going end TO END JUST LIKE HIS DADDY used to do for the Sooners No quit No quitting Jones thats for sure Hes been balling here these last five minutes Hes going to play to the final horn regardless of the score Showing off his hops here flopping in the win Applause Well we will get you to Pittsburgh for the start of the Panthers and the Orange in just a few moments as Breed buries the three The rest of this game between NC State and Florida first year head coach whose team is about to fall to 0 and3 in league play 79 in conference And the Nolles felt like they had maybe turned a corner coming out of the Christmas break They had played better in their two tough games against the other two teams from Tobacco Road Losses yes but against Carolina and Duke they had shown signs of getting better but this is a big step back so far here today Yeah huge a huge step back They shot 56 against Duke for the game And theyre theyre not even at 40 uh excuse me 407 in this one But its been their defense Obviously youve given up 107 points and you have let NC State who shot 52 in the first half shoot 63 here in the second half from the threepoint line And again this is the best shooting threepoint team in the ACC from NC State but you cant allow them to go off as they have here today Now 17 for 32 as a team from beyond the threepoint line for the Wolfpack Yeah 53 from from behind behind the arc And the fact that you gave youve given up 17 threes like you got to understand that thats what they do You didnt pay attention to the scouting report enough to lock in and say we got to take away their strength and try to make them play in that area between the paint and the free and the threepoint line But dont let them just fire up threes from from out there behind the arc because that was been a back breaker to the nullles today Breed hits the three as uh Will Wade goes a little deeper into his bench Hes got Jordan Snell number zero a senior from Kerry North Carolina out there Colt Langden as well a red shirt freshman from Raleigh is on the floor trying to throw it down on a defender was Leger Jones Yeah Jones has been that guy say Im gonna Im gonna play a full 40 minutes today and you know its been tough and they they lost McCrae about the 13 minute mark Theyre theyre team leader with those five fouls and they have just kind of been disjointed offensively for most of this second half and theyll get him back Theyll theyll figure it out Theyll get in that lab Theyll get theyll get to work and theyll have to just be better next time that they step the on the floor defensively You what what do you talk about We talked about all the threes and then they come out of that timeout and they give up a three out So you just got to you got to figure how to lock into a a defensive plan a scheme and then if thats not working make some adjustments And they didnt make any adjustments from the first half to the second half Music Now Breed is fouled out of the game sending Cam Miles back to the free throw line Applause The foul will send Bong to the line Yeah And I know its you know obviously thats too little too late but you love that effort by Bong right like thats that one guy off the bench coach LS can look to and say I got something with this this kid right here you know regardless of where were at this this kids going to give me the effort and um sometimes as as a first year coach you have you have to identify the guys that not just from a skill standpoint but who has it in their heart whos got that want to whos got that dog in them to keep competing Well Bong has 14 points to lead all seminals after those two made free throws Final minute of play here at the Tucker Center Colt Langden looking to get himself into the scoring column Cant do it Its been the offensive rebounds the drives to the basket the points off the turnovers a lot of hustle plays Able boy he lit it up early Hes now got a a careerhigh for the freshman from Baltimore He has been part of a wild attack from the outside for the Wolfpack Yeah that was that guy You know we we got a chance to speak to Coach Wade before the game and he was very impressed with that young fella He he said hes just a good smart young player that knows how to play Plays with a poise and a toughness for a freshman that you dont see out of many freshman Yeah 15 points now for Matt Ael matches the 15 he scored against Satan Hall in Maui And now with the shot clock off this will wind up being the second highest scoring game of the season for NC State They put 114 on North Carolina Central and they put 113 in a blowout victory on Florida State Yeah Im impressed with this NC State Wolfback team They got a lot of talented players on their squad that seem to like playing with one another where the ACC has been put on notice
