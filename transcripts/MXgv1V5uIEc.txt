Ser it that can certainly shoot it I beg your pardon from distance here this evening so were set for basketball on a Wednesday night here in Coral Gables again with Jack mclinton of Kyle coff the officials tonight Brian oconnell Lamar Simpson Jamal Spearman we are underway and the tip off is in possession of the Miami Hurricanes and Nigel pack to open things up this evening I want to see in the Miami Hurricanes come out very unselfish the last couple games theres been a lot of individual play I want to see them start to share the ball a lot more they did at the beginning of the Season well that was unselfish a nice look from Bensley Joseph into the big old Ms of nor Chad oir and he got fouled on his way up for an easy layup so NORAD omir will go to the free throw line for the first time this evening Miami 6 one the Liu sharks are 1 six they are under the direction of Rod Strickland and if that name rings a bell uh it should if youre a fan of basketball the NBA executive the all NBA point guard remember the New York City Basketball Hall of Fame an unbelievable player back in his day hes come from the coach Calipari tree hes been all over he is 4 and 32 now with Liu but hes been task jacked with bringing this program back get him back to some winning ways for sure I mean when you play for a coach like Rod Strickland such legendary background you want to come up and show out for your coach great unselfishness to start the game by the Miami Hurricanes I love how Matthew Cleveland gets out in transition gets the rebound or doesnt get the rebound gives it up and gets it right back and as Rod Strickland watches on and watches this team here tonight hes got his two boys playing for him as well theres that replay of that last basket for the Miami Hurricanes out to a 4 nothing lead but coach Stricklands Suns Terrell Strickland and Ty Strickland Terrells a red shirt Junior obviously both from Tampa out of the St Petersburg area Terrell transferred in from James Madison Tai transferred in in from Georgia Southern thats got to be pretty darn cool obviously maybe things have not gone the way that coach Strickland would want them to but hes got his two boys out there playing for him thats incredible Jack you know what I call that whats that family business that is its its in the business its in the family business and uh guess hes got an eye on those boys too he doesnt ever have to wonder what theyre up to does he not at all they are under the watchful eye of dad w a popper just got pushed at the top of the he comes up holding his right knee a little bit and hes limp coming back down the floor Miami trying to force a turnover as Liu looks to get on the board for the first time tonight and Miami does indeed force a turnover wga popler from distance and bad knee come back for the three I love I love that about W gets up you know gets up liming a little bit comes down shoots a three from the you hes holding that right knee something does not feel good as Rod Strickland has called a timeout Miami jumps out to an early s nothing lead here tonight coach Lena out on the floor now W is trying to walk things off coach L obviously a little bit concerned about him and Poppers going to go to the end of the bench hes got a pretty good limb to him there lets take a break just a little over back inside the watsco center after a quick 30se second timeout from Rod Strickland the head coach of the Liu sharks Miami jumps out to an early 7 nothing lead here this evening in an encouraging sign for the Miami Hurricanes wga popper stays in the game you definitely want to see that from your best player Im glad hes back out still Applause moving aint nothing wrong with that knee Trel violation on Tai strickly oh I didnt see any KNE toe contact that maybe just got to twist it up a little bit there top of the key I want to see Nigel pull that great shot very you good he pulled it all right one thing about Nigel pack he plays a lot better when he gets going early when hes letting the ball fly early I think coach made an emphasis if youre open let the ball fly transition half court offense let the ball fly cuz hes a rhythm shooter he sees one going he can make three four in a row Amed esah along with tonopa checked in for the Liu sharks some early subs for Coach trickin its obviously just an interesting place where the program is at right like you know they are having some troubles winning uh and just one and six the season although it is it is it is you know as you take a look at it Jack as that shot is Off the Mark and its pulled down by nor Chad oir you know they did beat Texas AM Corpus Christian you take a look at some of the other games right Air Force its not like theyre losing by 40 and 50 you know the the margins have been substantial at times 10 20 25 at times kind of hanging around they scoring some points just not enough not enough efficiency they just not enough and also with you know Coach Ron has a new basketball team you expect that from a new team theyre still trying to understand each Applause other by Cleveland I think he plays his best basketball in transition to the next level that will not change 12 nothing Miami and a look down low that was blocked and getting it back is Nicola japa and theres a foul on the floor that is Nigel pack first Miami foul tonight hes got to get up there and dunk that a lot faster Andre Washington checks in for the Sharks it shows you the speed of that helps side defense by Matthew Cleveland was able to get there help side get a block shot Miami has held Liu scoreless or near leading the first four minutes headed towards that first TV timeout in this ball game will push off on the Baseline Bensley Joseph always plays terrific defense sharks just have not been able to get a quality look at the bucket and theres a fight for loose ball on the floor and theres nor Chad oir to take it Music Applause away Music Applause ohir top of the key 43 and he buries it no CH really improved his shooting ability if you look at that last shot he didnt do a lot of messing with the ball around his hands he literally got the ball and Let It Fly well theres another takeway by Matthew Cleveland and another bucket and rock Stricklands going to call another timeout Miami leading 17 to nothing well take a break nor cadir well back here inside the wats go Center Miami out to a 17 nothing lead their last bucket coming courtesy of nor cadir who it tes going into the break Jack really tried to improve his threepoint shooting this off season look at that so far its paid dividends this early season for sure nor Chad is a gym rat hes putting a lot of reps up in the gym and showing in real life hes shooting the basketball break six for 14 for three this season in eight games a great percentage theres a good there for liou but coming up short and way short is RJ green the guard out of the Bronx theres a turnover by the Miami Hurricanes let me ask you this Jack obviously youve been around some great NBA players you were drafted yourself you played at the highest level is is Nord Chad kind of doing that this past off season as he looks ahead obviously hes not putting you know the cart in front of the horse but it will a perspective NBA team want to say hey can you shoot it from distance a little bit can you give me a little something out there oh yeah for sure the NBA is changing you little see too many bigs in the NBA right now that cannot shoot a midrange or a threepoint shot and norrad knows that he went to the predraft last year worked out and Im sure thats something that he heard we want to see you improve your shot and hes been in the gym its great to see guys that put the work in and reap the rewards and the benefits of putting the work Applause in now Liu unfortunately 0 for five to start this game and theyre trailing 19 nothing and that one will not fall for Andre Washington Miami does indeed come down with a Music rebound Matthew Cleveland with six early points oms got seven popper with a three Nigel pack Buri a three theres a turnover and back comes Miami theyll have numbers C of the other way up top for NORAD oir this is what you want to see from the University of Miami basketball team everybody run the floor after a turnover after a rebound and getting transition basketball thats going to help them when it comes down later in Music Applause Music March well that pass slipped out of the hands ofed asahan theres another look at that alleyoop up top thats one thing you dont have to worry about with NORAD he is a freakish athlete you throw it up there Tom him hes going to get it know the two suns Terrell and Tai check back in for the Sharks think they make their dad look better than this Im rooting for these two kids out here oh its hard not to root for the program as well Jack right I mean obviously Rod Strickland did not have to do this he he did not have to take this thing on right they they have struggled theyre 4 and 32 underneath them hes going to need some time but this is a guy for a long time as an executive and as a player knows what its like to win basketball games finally his shks around the board thats Ty Strickland Ty Strickland for three much needed three hopefully this gives the Liu program a little bit of an energy energy shift as the body language has been down a lot this whole game great move and with Applause a rod Strickland named the head coach of the basball program on June 30th of 2022 he joined Liu from the NBAs gleague ignite the NBAs official minor league system essentially where he served as the Director of the professional path program since 2018 another bucket back toback buckets for the Sharks this time its Eric Aker who had a sensational week last week AER was named the NEC corookie of the week on Monday the East New York n over 18 points last two games the guys are averaging almost 20 points expecting to come out here with complete confidence I want to see him attack the basket more you know they have nothing to lose being down 23 to5 if Im then Im going to let the ball Music Applause fly number three on the way and again its Ty stricklin I think d might have said son this aint going well get out there and take a little charge of this thing you got a good shot Let it Fly Let it Fly son because its not looking great for us right now but its great to get the back to back three expect him to get the next one down and let it go once again cuz if Im him I shot two and I make two Im shooting three four and Applause five nice move by Matthew Cleland there he showed great patience on that shot back down back down back down felt the defender turn around jump shot well if it reminds you of Jordan Miller at all that is the role that hes replacing this season and it was the patience that played off for two years for Jordan Miller and watching him go to work and his ability to kind of move north and south and east and west in the paint and get those layups and those up and unders I mean you know Matthew Cleveland kind of tked with uh doing that this year for The KES almost almost travel Bensley Joseph almost walked and noo cant finish down low got beat and banged Applause up great ball movement tell you what thats some terrific ball movement but it shows you even better defense by The KES you dont suspect that maybe a part of Rod Strickland coaching this team in the program hes building as Bensley Joseph buries a three uh might be the ability to share the basketball this is a guy that ranks 13th all time and assists in NBA history that was a big part of his game man facilitate oh for sure hes probably preaching swing the ball dog swing the ball and uh he says gentlemen if you dont believe me well you know lets go to my room lets throw on a little film of the old man here after almost two decades in the NBA for Rod stck you know what they say men lie women lie numbers dont so 28 to 10 Miami leading under 10 left the play Bley Joseph another three buries it I love to see benley shot improving thats going to be huge for this University Miami Hurricane team as the season continues Miami very much playing under control tonight as the ball is swiped away NOCO came up with it he handed it off to Christian Watson and he finishes with a little finger roll the rim Im loving the way Christian Watson is coming to the Ball Game and affecting the ball game on offense and defense last year you saw him kind of coming in you know shot hunting looking to score but now hes kind of turned into a defensive specialist for this Miami Hurricane basketball team grabbing an offensive rebound there was Eric AER and couldnt finish right there at the rim and vincey Joseph nearly just turned it over in the corner step back three on the way thats too short Matthew Cleveland comes up with the offensive rebound and then he threw it away although this kanes theyre up by 23 you dont want to see turnovers like that happen but you get it right back Im sure theyll forget about it great split good move by Chris Watson wow Strong finish great finish one thing we will say the university Miami basketball team will get from this game is a confidence booster I think thats much need especially in this part of the Season Timeout on the floor Christian Watson few points early tonight the sophomore out of Maryland nice this holiday all right 836 left to play in the half here in Miami tonight its the 15th ranked Miami Hurricanes hosting the Liu sharks there is the coaching resume for the long time star in the NBA Rod Strickland second season at Liu I talked a little bit about his career path today the first round former draft pick by the New York Knicks played for such a long time fun fact Kyrie Irvings Godfather how about that thats incredible it makes sense now you know I used to love watching R stly growing up the way he was able to finish the ball at the basket different types of spins using his body in the paint I can see where Kyrie potentially get some of his finishing ability for oh Miami up big leading by 25 give him 28 Kean George the Freshman where that full had a hair berries a three I thought it was interesting Jack and I mentioned this to you and I Ill bring it onto the air watching Rod Strickland during the timeout right like at this juncture its not going to do any good to scream and holler obviously things arent going well but just teaching you know hes teaching hes hes tapping guys you know on the knee hes telling them what to do instead of you know the the abrace of getting your face like be better hes teaching hes a teacher yeah you know if you look at Raj trickl you paying attention to him throughout his career hes a very mellow type of guy so you know thats kind of translated to his coaching abilities you know a lot of times you also he probably knows his Personnel you know guys receive coaching differently and you know with his personality its the type of guy that a player would love to play for under eight left to play here in the first half Miami up big that three rattles in it out for Tai Strickland hes the older brother of Terell and the two sons of Rod Miami made five of their last seven field goals although I we saw Tai make two threes before that as a shooter myself myself I would love to see him get that Small Hitch out of his shot time for another break Mi me up big here the 706 left the play in the first half from the Watco Center here in Coral Gable Florida tonight with Jack mclinton Im Kyle coff Jack you know a little bit about shooting the long ball baby and from way out there Beyond The Arc when coach Ls teams are really good theyre shooting the three really well theres six of eight in that Department tonight how about that 42 from Deep this season thats second best in the nation man thats very strong especially coming back from a team last year getting up a lot of Threes And its great to see the development of their Shooters shooting the basketball with confidence putting the work in and the ripping the benefits and were seeing results on this basketball court take me back to when you were young when were you like Im going to make it a point of emphasis Im going to learn how to shoot the ball from way out there and do it really well I mean probably at 6 years old you know I was always a smallest guy so I had to be able to shoot the ball to get on the floor I mean you you just keep shooting till you make it till it feels right I mean I cant remember how many times that I switched my form as a kid elbow out elbow in two hands one hand you know just trying to figure it out you know its almost like a science but once you get it down you let that thing fly its hitting the back of the net Kean George with a traveling violation and as Andre Washington will check back in for the Sharks a guy behind this saying EUR step the next time kid from half court thats Laughter why take the playground rules right must be an Liu fan pick it up put it back down after a couple of steps so Miami a big they started the game on a 21 to nothing run now beaten banging down low the hook shot is no good for Nicola zppa the young man out of Serbia a freshman at 7 feet tall there goes wer strong with the right hand just floats in the air man great move great Pace one thing you want to see from wer he doesnt exert a lot of energy and effort which shows professionals GMS and coaches this guy knows how to play the game one two dribbles slow that step down floater across the middle thats whats going to get him paid at the next level doing things like that too boy he came out of nowhere you got to reward him from the U you got to reward him from the Music U Packs got it step back three on the way and tickled the twine and nothing but the bottom of the net side side step cash money and thats I said hes a rhythm shooter he made his first three hes coming down looking for a shot great side step by Nigel nothing but with the botom the net packs got eight points tonight averaging 13 this season every single starter outside of Bensley Joseph whos averaging 93 points per game this season is averaging double digits I was going to say that you know its great to have a team you got Matthew Cleveland at 147 Bley Jo Bley Joseph at 93 you know thats 10 wga at 169 NORAD 16 and nitop pack 13 that shows that any given night anybody can take control of this basketball game game to give their team some buckets Miami the only School in the ACC whose entire starting five averaging nine points per game or better this Music season pack working in finds a wide open AJ Casey who just got stuffed at The Rim by RJ green and the Hurricanes fighting for offensive rebounds omir got one he couldnt finish so back comes Lou two men at The Rim there green and Casey great defense Washington almost had it taken away and then he cannot finish had nobody guarding him now Casey going to work on Strickland still working and had it taken away but he got whacked on the arm with 415 left to play so AJ Casey will head to the free throw line for a couple of freebies were seeing a lot more you know AJ getting a little ISO in the paint you we didnt see a lot of that last year so that goes to show that coach has a little bit more confidence in AJ this year T have put his back to the basket couple dribbles turned around he made a strong move and got fouled want to see him knock down these two free throws be his first free throw attempts of the season for the sophomore out of Chicago and the first halfway down comes out first free throws of the Season wow at least hes 0 for 15 50 this also could be wrong 0 he got to make this one I feel like Ill St him at the free throw line maybe but maybe not oh man got it back Ill triple check it our stat our stat sheet Jack could be wrong but never let the facts get in the way of good story as they say for sure so right now hes 0 for two until further notice until further notice ladies and gentlemen thats the thats the statistics Music Applause lets take another break 355 left to play in the Music half all right back here inside the watsco Center Miami up big 355 left the play in the half heres a really interesting graphic to take a look at Jack how about Miamis bench minutes per game most importantly way bottom leftand corner 124 per game right 338th in division one wow thats tough but I mean you know so Dev was in the details obviously we know coacho relies a lot on his starters but at the end of the day I think this University Miami basketball team they do a lot of things that dont show up on the stat sheet but it is an alarming number being you know that far down in division one basketball oh you hate the foul threepoint shooter but let the see guys be more aggressive coming in you know as the season continues to grow confidence will continue to grow and look for those numbers to accelerate I think I said if I said minutes per game I apologize points per game but bottom line is that Miamis got to get productive there right you know you go back to recent years its really hard especially when conference play rolls around you cant be rolling five guys out there just every night and expect them to get all the scoring so its going to be incumbent upon coach L to see what hes got from that bench and somebody at some point whether its one guy or two guys couple of boys got to step up there for him for sure you want to use games like this is you know being up 45 to 13 expect the coach to put his bench in a little sooner than you know that hes done in the past so look for these guys to come in and really be aggressive and build that confidence up for when you know ACC plays come like you said we going to need a lot of offense From the Bench starting five is back out there right now for Coach leega as Matthew Cleveland misses a baseline three near side approaching the 3minute Mark here in the first half heres a look in towards the paint trying to get it to fall off the backboard was Eric Aker he cannot Here Comes Miami quickly in transition popler a little soft coverage thats easy to the r easy bucket notice how he uses off hand to get that guys hand off of his body a lot of times you know you want to get your hand over top the defensive hand easy breezy baskets he had a little scare early in the first half there and right knee looked like it buckled a little bit bit on him heres the three that one looks good and it is that thing is buried there was Andre Washington great shot hand in his Music face miam 19 of 31 from the field shooting 61 Lius been down here for a couple of days they are coming off a loss at FIU 7459 couple of days ago great driving kick by NAD Applause what a move the one thing about nor Chad he has a motor I mean his gas tank is always on F always yeah we can call him electric he just charges up and hes good you dont need to refill that gas tank at all but at the end of 40 minutes hes usually dragging off the floor because he gives you he does empty the tank by the time that puppy hits triple zero hes about cooked defensely Joseph skies for a rebound Music I want to see Nigel catch that first pass well look at him go look at him go shoot the three o tough Music Applause Music shot Washington in the paint got fouled with 123 left to play here in the half and now checking in for Liu is going to be gzm bajari out of Finland lets see what he brings heres a big body lets see what he brings to the Music table and now Tanana Copa will check in and hell replace RJ green IU just one of their last nine from the field theres a bucket for Eric Aker not very often that Nigel pack finds somebody his size out there on the floor usually looking up at everybody got to shoot it over tonight hes kind of going Toe to Toe with Eric AER as pack gets it and then back out for wga poppler for three on the way and that is no good Matthew Cleveland with an offensive rebound this time and then he had it taken away but with his feet on the Baseline it was Ty Strickland Music look at number 43 got his got his hands on Norad that might not be the guy you want to be trying to wrestle with oh my Music Applause Music Applause goodness little beating and banging here top of the key from Strickland and now wga is going to back down Aur thats a mismatch and a fade away jump shot thatll play at the next level yuck 100 amazing play on once again notice two Rhythm dribbles felt the defender spit Baseline Fade Away nothing but net smooth stroke it didnt look forced at all Ill tell you what theres obviously some terrific college basketball players out there that shot Way Off the Mark I dont know if anybody can hang up there and just glide through the air like w i mean that the hang time just just a simple Step Back Fade Away jump shot just hangs Jack he made something so difficult look very simple thats a tough shot to be able to Rhythm dribble Rhythm dribble half spin Baseline shot and another thing one thing that people dont see is the elevation that wga has on his shots hes a great midrange shooter because he can Elevate over the defense clar EGA having a conversation with nor Chad oir we let 10 seconds left in the first half here inside the watsco center in Coral Gables tonight its the 15th ranked Miami Hurricanes hosting the Liu sharks inbounds pass goes to Nigel pack clock ticking down a hand off the Cleveland dribble drive to the rack the layup is good its a great play call by coach off the time out thatll bring us to the end of the first half here in Miami the cans up big leading 53 Applause Music 18 prime time I think Colorado I think they have a potential lottery pick they have one of the best players in the country on their team and I apologize Im uh blanking on who it is but Miami will go to Brooklyn and take on Colorado this weekend then theyll come home for Lal Stonehill in North Florida and then theyre off and running back in conference play they are 1 and0 in that department so far after they beat Notre Dame last Saturday Saturday conceivably Miami obviously take care takes care of business here tonight if they beat Colorado theyre going to have a really good chance Jack of being what 11 one going back into conference play good position to be in great position lets just hope they show us some love on these polls man I feel like we dont get the kind of love well University of Miami doesnt get the kind of love they should you know we dropped out the top 10 with a loss of Kentucky we only got one loss have some good wins and you know at the end of the day I think Miami now was a basketball school theres a turnover there by Matthew Cleveland and boy having a hard time turning it into points is the sharks look at this so many opportunities theres a foul on the floor man so many open looks right there at the rim lot of quick jumping looks like that game back in the day called Taps tap the ball in the r you cant touch the ground you got to tap it again that 15 1 15 and Strickland misses the first of his two freees on his free throws he has less of a hitch in his shot look at his threes he has a nice little hitch before he shoots the basketball to all the kids out there and even adults out there get rid of the hitch Matthew Cleveland got whacked in the mouth hes got a bloody lip had a little blood running out of his mouth but hes good to Applause go an offensive rebound by the smallest guy on the floor Eric Aker and he gets fouled hell go to the free throw line fouls on Bensley Joseph NORAD wants to get every rebound right there sometimes I think wga had a rebound and NORAD kind of got in there but then day theyre both aggressive thats what you want to see from two of your top players on your basketball team and aers first free throw is good it has been and it will continue to be a point of emphasis for Miami is not allowing the offensive rebounds with the frequency they have this season and tightening up the defense especially again and it cannot be reiterated enough once you get into conference play you know you give up two or three offensive rebounds a game that turn into points could bury you Miami played all of those games last year came down to the final minute one possession games 100 offensive rebounds turnovers 5050 plays you have to win all of those look down low thats a beautiful pass and a finish for Nicola japa hes got great Pace down there he doesnt Rush goes up strong takes his time its a good Finish Well coach larena does not like what he sees in the first minute and a half of this second half so Liu with a bucket Timeout on the floor well take a break good look down Music low greatness Lara did not like the way the first minute and a half transpired here in the second half so he called the timeout that triggered the TV timeout and so away we go coming out of that timeout I wonder what coach L had to tell him there Jack probably said keep the energy up because youre winning by a lot of points doesnt mean you come out flat footed you dont want to start creating bad habits next game were a little startled last week in Kentucky too they played a really good first first half down what five at the half uh they forgot where the gym was in the second half they they came out and Kentucky punched them in the mouth and they couldnt get off the canvas 100 good see that happen again well hes skyed for that rebound and Miamis going to push the ball in transition Joseph working off that high screen from nor Chad oir who floats it up and Bensley Joseph will go to the free throw line for Two Shots you want to keep benley off of his left hand a look at that previous basket what do you see here Jack great patience you know you notice he stopped on two feet Landing has two feet didnt necessarily choose a PIV foot yet made the right pass but a good cut you know you see a player in the middle of the floor pick up his dribble you got to cut to the basket great read by Matthew Cleveland Bley Joseph makes his first free Music throw now N9 of 11 is Joseph from the free throw line this season that was an area of his game that he really wanted to work on that was not up to par and up to his standards last year so now 10 of Music 12 that was eyeball sandwich right there test better shot those quick twitch muscles for Nigel pack and easy layup n Nigels been very deceptive ball handler you dont know if hes slow fast hes hes able to change speeds very quickly which makes him a super Dynamic guard especially being a shooter being able to go slow to fast super hard to guard at any level Dell Strickland just threw that one away thats a Music turnover omir a little careless with the basketball then he finds wga pop down low who got knocked to the floor itll be Miami basketball that was nearly strip from omir didnt see the manand coming from behind him there top of the key got to be a little bit more protective about the basketball its kind of like a lazy handoff and thats what happens you get up this many points sometimes that hand off when youre strong with the ball hand off to your teammate you get a little lazy you dont want these things to happen no matter who youre playing Nigel pack step back three no good nor Chad oir with the offensive rebound kicks it out the pat and the shot clock resets to 20 boy Bley Joseph just got fouled he had his Defender going left while meanwhile he was going the opposite way he must not have got the Scout report benley Joseph is a lefthand basketball player every play hes going strong left you got to kick the ball out of his left Music hand Copa and bajrami check in for the Sharks ball deflected just a little bit now Poppers got it and going up strong boy he tried to finish Music wow man he is such a high flyer lets look at this replay here oh my gosh he almost used them as a bit of an elevator there at the end 100 Music you know we is so calm he comes down gets fou on the dunk jeez facial expressions dont change you know something like that even if he didnt make the dunk Scouts and people are looking at that like wow this kid is a freak of Music nature popper with 11 points tonight now averaging just a little bit south of 17 this season per Applause game hes made 21 threes this season as wga Poler thats amazing hes Sho Le he is shooting the leather off the basketball and one thing about wga shot if you watch it it looks the same every single time Ro Nigel pack just threw that Applause away kind that sloppy carelessness just a little bit up so much up nearly 40 in this game heres a three quick trigger oh in and out tonopa has got to be saying what on Earth you want me to do poer with a behind the back pass to omir who works in the lane in a fade away jump shot from from the free throw line I dont know if Ive seen that one before from omir its a great move you know being able to cross the ball over in traffic spin back and Elevate balance a lot of times you see guys spin back and theyre not balanced nor Chad went up super balanced and we got the result we wanted three balls good for Eric AER you notice that Eric AER shot that basketball he shot it with no hesitation straight up straight down smooth rotation now we got five guys coming in we talked about these bench points for the University of Miami they got 15 minutes now to really show what theyre made of be a wholesale line change for Coach Len Anga coming up jakai Robinson Christian Watson keesan George Michael noo and AJ Casey are all going to check in for Miami and this is going to be an opportunity to forget about the scoreboard and play basketball lets take a break with 1438 left to play Miami up big here in Coral Gables tonight Music Center and wga popper you know hes comfortable shooting the ball from anywhere and when I say anywhere uh I mean how about this pregame with Jack mclinton sitting next to him and then he gave you a little look Jack thats crazy I mean dont tell me I cant make for Mary said I mean being able to make that shot with nowhere to really land a lot of upper body strength a lot of Arc its a big shot by W Papa hes a shot maker though he looked at you and said dont tell me I cant cant make it from here Im going to make it from here and he made it from there so uh you might not find it hard to believe then when hes on the actual hardwood hes pretty much comfortable as soon as he gets across half court hell Bomb It Up from anywhere and make it for sure and then like I said earlier if you looked at that shot in that last clip the shot looked the same as if he was shooting a free throw or you shoo a regular threepoint shot the making have a great basketball player and a great shooter now meanwhile here for the Miami Hurricanes good ball movement AJ Casey top of the key is three rattles in and out but coach Lena is now going to utilize an entire different five and these are Five Guys right now Jack get rid of the scoreboards in the entire building because somebody here has got an opportunity to prove to coach L that they belong out on the floor and they deserve more minutes 100 you got 13 minutes and 40 seconds to come out and really showcase why I potentially should be in the game a little bit more and thats great from jakai Robertson I me he may pay the least amount of minutes scholarship players and coming in transition shooting a shot being confident thats what you want to see well see how they handle themselves out on the court as Robinson makes the bucket and on the defensive end he goes up there and gets a Music rebound if you are coach and youre watching this sitting Courtside what do you want to see from these guys right now Jack what are you looking for you want to see them to play unselfish Miami basketball cuz you dont want to come in as a substitute and youre looking selfish cuz it stands out like a sore thumb you want to come in show Coach playing hard defense playing unselfish University of Miami basketball and right now were seeing an unselfish play for an bucket good for Casey hell get an additional one at the free throw line sophomore forward out of Chicago Illinois a little bit last SE season scored a careerhigh eight points earlier this year against NJIT played 29 games last season he was the 50th best player in the country a couple of years ago coming out of high school as jakai Robinson gets called for a blocking foul AJ has huge upside you know great size scoring ability athletic you know look for him to be a breakout player this year a fourtime All State pick in high school in the Chicagoland area and running shot fading away no good for ahed esah Kean George fires away too short quick trigger from George you know that although thats a quick trigger I liked him as a freshman to not be scared to shoot that shot having that confidence thats the first thing that matters shooting the basketball in and out for the big fella Music and Michael noo just got wrapped up down low Micha no look wrapped up down low see what you did there you trying to rhyme on that one or what no just come natural huh I cant rhyme a single thing pal I dont think so see Y for the three off the double screen little hesitation and hes going to the free throw line isnt he I love see see Watson you know size and athletic ability hes really good at getting to the defender using his body upper body strength to create the contact and go up and make a shot sophomore guard out of Maryland the St John College High School in the DC area for sure I would say the DMV breeds the best basketball players of the country I dont what do you say its hard to arue against it okay you know you will find some great players in the New York tristate area maybe the New Jersey New York area you start putting those allstar teams together uh the DMV up there theyre theyre going to go to to Toe with anybody in the country theres no doubt about it 100 shout out to DMV baby probably helps that LeBrons kids are being funneled through the Los Angeles area school programs but you know Southern Californias got some good high school basketball definely has some great players Music I saw LeBrons oldest boy just got cleared for basketball activity with USC right thatll be really cool thats another generation of James is that are you know starting to grow up and play ball heres younger boy might be better than the older one is that if Im following that correctly thats what people are saying but at the end of the day you never know you know the media they say certain things and its all about you know why watching and looking out its a crazy people like us in the media jack mis up big 1128 left the play tonight starting five looks pretty good to me Jack you take if youre if youre coaching starting the program you take those five by chance might the build around that a little bit 100 and it shows like weve always said Miami plays their best basketball when theyre playing unselfish you know having Five Guys you know bizs at 93 but having Five Guys averaging double figures at any given night somebody can get out there and get you a bucket and this game is about getting buckets baby tell what I wouldnt know what the heck I was doing but you give me those five I might win a game or two or three or four just make sure they get to the gym and say go get them fellas touch out there great Touch by the world Co great touch and you want to get him reped soon because were going to you University of miam is going to use him you know during the ACC season again its 74 26 these are crucial minutes for guys that do not see the floor a whole lot huge minutes its a great finish by Strickland getting in the lane getting over to big fella its not an easy shot to Music make Robinson takes the hand off from kesan George and hell handle the point guard responsibilities and that ones taken away Robinson just never saw the man that he was looking for and theres a foul foul and the bucket is good for Andre Washington he just never saw that Defender when he passed that thing yeah if you look at that last play Miami was very very stagnant and obviously you know in practice these guys may not play all together at once but oh five going back in for about two and a half more minutes I would imagine H you might be looking you could be kidding what the heck I you know this is a funny thing I know the stars are coming in licking their chops and then you have the opposite of energy of the guys that was on the on the on the floor getting subtitute it out the energy is like really but at the end of the day you got an opportunity to show your worth and bad turnover is being stagnant it doesnt add up to playing time so the starting five are back on the floor for Jim Lena with 1020 left to play in tonights festivities o going up up top for omir I saw that easy but you you notice the difference in the movement of the basketball its hard to guard a team thats constantly Music Applause Music moving heres one for you and you hear coach Lena talk about this a lot and you could be able to explain what this means jack he always talks about playing defense right you got to play good defense and defense turns into offense young kids might be thinking what do you mean right I got to get the ball I got to score that thing Ill take care of but what does that mean when you hear a coach tell young players defense will turn into offense you know its one of those things where you know defense isnt the the popular thing to do tiring too but defense keeps you on the floor you get stops you get the ball back now you got an opportunity to score like I I said its the less popular thing to do but look at a guy like Bley Joseph Bley Joseph has kind of turned himself into an offensive threat but in years past hes been a defensive specialist and got on the court through his defense at the end of the day to get to shoot the ball you got to be on the court defense is what gets you on the Music court Jason steel freshman forward out of Flushing New York checks in for the sharks Matthew Cleveland with 14 points Music Applause Music tonight so now Cleveland and omir have a team High 15 for Miami nor cadir another double double with 13 rebounds tonight he had 13 and 13 against Notre Dame now hes got his fourth double double of the season the 55th of his incredible college career that did not start here at the University of Miami he came down with that 5050 ball and now they go up top for Cleveland could not finish with his offand his left hand ball rolls out of BS its Miami basketball both of these team are playing very hard right now thats what you want to see obviously the score is 79 to 33 but both teams are playing with high level intensity obviously coach RJ Strickland is down right now but him watching his team play and still playing with high level of intensity thats what you want to see and same thing with Miami being up this much sometimes you could play kind of nonchalant but theyre still playing with great speed great Pace being aggressive and playing together oh Nigel pack a three buries it that was a oneonone double cross step back to the corner by Nigel pack but when you got game like him pack him up when you see that is that all instinct ual or does he know what hes about to do is that is that a feeling out process there I think with you know being in the gym having so many reps it becomes instinctual you know when youre doing drills crossover crossover crossover its like a cone drill hes being a great shooter is its one of those things that gives you the the added value oh great split by n Chad in the NBA thats the m one continuation but back to Nigel you know when you do it so much it becomes second nature to you yeah its impressive to watch theres a lot that happens very quickly and he can manufacture a great shot and that is just not easy to do its a mark of a really talented good player omir misses the front end of a one andone Music opportunity LAs playing a lot of oneonone basketball right now they need to move the ball get some movement get Miami moving a little bit only one and done shots going on the Liu basketball program a bad pass there and a turnover by Miami and a shot on the other end good for AER I like freshman comes in plays strong plays confident hes averaging a ton of points a game last two games hes averaging almost 20 hes got 13 here tonight so hes averaging 139 points a game as a freshman playing some really good teams hes played UCLA playing Miami playing FIU some really good teams great pass pepperon Columbia great pass by W on the Baseline you know a huge rule of basketball when you get to that corner you always want to have another man opposite corner its almost like your outlet cuz when you get to that corner you got the sideline you got be the line behind you thats almost like a Defender so you want someone to be in that opposite corner cor for an outlet ah nice move there really strong finish at the rack by Andre Washington hes been very I want to see him be a little bit more aggressive you know hes getting to the paint at will quick timeout this ones going to trigger a TV break 8439 Miami leading Nigel pack lot more can you say about this dude man hes been unbelievable for the Miami Hurrican a step back three get out of here get out of here step back pack we are back inside the watsco center 635 left the play tonight with Jack mclinton Im Kyle seof its good to be with you all right now it looks like the starting five for Miami will be done for tonight the five reserves that we saw just a few minutes ago are back in for the Miami Hurricanes and AJ Casey nearly turned that ball over but its in the hands of kesan George and AJ Casey for three and that is way too short short they better come in with more intensity and not turn the ball over cuz I can see these starters coming back in I think coach L was the type of coach that kind of do some type of stuff to prove a point to let you guys know nothing is guaranteed you got to be in the game ready to play basketball its amazing to think about Jack and obviously you really wont see these five on the floor again throughout the course of the rest of the season unless down big or up really big but sneakily this is about as big as Miami can get right here amazing huge team youre right very true its about as big as they could possibly get and you know theyre 67 66 you know the wos obviously got some size to them but if you were going to put the biggest five on the floor for Miami is George this is them its very true especially at their Music positions AJ Casey looks good this year hes put on a little meat Michael noo is going to be one of those guys you get the nutrition and all those programs in college put on another 25 lbs of muscle yeah he hes a natural born specimen you can just see how his bodys built he walks on his tippy toes you know some things you just cannot teach hes strong to the rack you dont want to see stricking get back to the Lane you know just just got in the lane finish with the layup now he gets right back to the basket there got to be better on ball defense and better help defense theres put that ball in his arm like a football and just took it strong to the rim and he got fouled so well go to the free throw line This is Tai Strickland Music hes got 12 points tonight averaging a little over 12 first season so hes right on Pace and hes going to best it here this evening striplin pretty good from the free throw line too 23 of 30 this season now after that made bucket good shot you want to come into the ACC B basketball school and although youre losing you still got to get him up and him being you know one of their better players a dynamic player you want to see him to continue to be aggressive and now keesan George will go to the free throw line and this is a double bonus territory now for the Miami Hurricanes very smart by Kean George notice the defender had his arm on him Kean used his off arm to pull up the guys arm so the ref could see it and he made the call he played a career high 22 minutes at rup Arena last Tuesday in that Kentucky blowout of Miami tied his career high by scoring Five Points and tonight kesan George has eight so thats a new new career high young man yeah young man AER The Freshman very quick with the basketball when he puts it on the floor that was a quick move there and that was indeed a foul boy New York City point guards boy yeah super quick Shifty confident I have not met one New York City point guard that did not think they were the best point guard in the country did you play a lot of ball in New York City during your day just by traveling there yeah for sure whether it was pickup or organized obviously you go to camps out there you know my first year at college basketball went to SI College Upstate New York so we would go down in New York City go out there and play in the summertime and its that area man it breeds great basketball players as well shout out to New York City but I still got DMV as the number one place for basketball if if somebody has never been if you ever get the opportunity in the summertime to just go to Rucker Park in New York City and watch what happens there the basketball the young kids oh no who what is hes just swinging from there he about brought that puppy down man yeah angry for a second and like you said in previous games before weve seen him kind of go up a little bit small he went full length out big dunk took the basket down dunks like that and plays like that you know during the ACC season that gets your team going you want to see a lot more of that from Michael noo coming into the later part of the Season he almost got himself a block but if you ever get a chance to go to New York anybody watching youve never been and you get a chance to go to Rucker Park to watch you know what what they would just consider like their organized street ball type stuff the fans that go out to watch him as you get another look at that noo dunk it is he went full force full nice little twist on there look little and one yeah Ruck apart energy is crazy 100 not and Im not talking you there might be 20 fans on a chain link fence watching theres benches in there hundreds of people will come out to watch pickup basketball it is amazing and some of the you know the greatest talent in the country will go pick up a ball and start playing and its amazing its very very cool for sure thats how you get a lot of confidence you know playing out there in the playground growing up as a kid thats where you got the best run is at the playground it wasnt you know you didnt go in a gym and youre outside scorching Sun trying to stay on the court cuz if you lose theres a lot of people out there youre not getting back on the court right its a very real thing too like you know it it would almost feel like a little old school this a 15 16y old kid that rolls up and he proves he can play with the big boys theyre going to say you know you can keep coming back and playing with back yeah we going to pick you up next time you get here run with us you know stuff goes a long way man its very cool the good old days I feel like the new kids theyre always in the gym now they dont know what its like to be on the playground scorching Sun stripping up your knees coming back in the house tripping on rocks tripping on rocks face dirty backboards a little crooked chains inside of the Nets no Nets hey is there a better sound uh oh oh I thought the Christian Watson was about to throw that alley up too is there a better sound setad of the Nets the chain if youre out on the playground you bury one from Deep on the chains especially hot ch Music chains with the double rims for some reason the chains always on double rims yeah if Im Christian Watson Im stepping in and shooting that basketball great move by jakai being aggressive Michael noo for three it rolled right off the front of the iron hey youre right by the way you want to be a good basketball player go find a playground double rim no give in a chain you start making those boy youre going to go somewhere I grew up on the double rim with no give no give you better make it nothing but net or give the ball to the other team thats too funny walk over another jump shot the end of the day I mean I like him taking that shot maybe thats not the best shot in the offense right now but you know you got to get him out at some point and Im sure hes made that Ive seen him make that shot hes made it before hes got to make a defensive play right here Washington dribbling and dribbling and dribbling and and he dribbled it out of bounds and thatll trigger a TV timeout with 233 left to play as we wrap things up from the Watco center tonight now lets take a look at the Miami upcoming schedule a big date with Coach primes kind of sort of not really Colorado Buffalo uh thats coming up on Sunday ESPN 2 make sure you check it out Miami and Colorado the buffalo very very good after that Lal Stonehill North Florida so four more nonconference games and then on January uary 3rd buckle up baby and grab those shoelaces and yank them a little bit tighter as tan George gets a bucket and thats thats not s what at the South basketball team they had a very crafty guard that had a 40 piece the other night Philadelphia guards you know weve been talking about the DMV weve been talking about New York City we got to give Philly some love Philly produces a lot of guards but once again like I said DMV bre the best basketball now one thing well be able to agree on and we agreed on everything so far tonight you take the East Coast in the west coast you cut it right down the middle east coast is always going to roll them boys out west I like East Coast you talk to a West Coast guy I have a friend of mine derell Wright the LA guy hes going to put his soul that California has the best basketball wow we we might need to do a little East Coast West Coast game we they should do that kind of like in the McDonalds AllAmerican Game yeah you know for the high schoolers mhm mhm cuz they kind of just break them up right its not really regionalized yep did you play that game oh no I was a one star in high school come on really yeah man I had to work my way up one star I might I might have had success story oh yeah for sure no stars but its not you know at the end of the day I think the stars and the ratings I mean its not about where you start its about where you stop as long as you keep progressing and moving forward you know anything is possible and I always try to teach everybody dream bigger and be an active dreamer because you could be whatever you want in this life life yeah you just got a believe a thought and a belief are very very close with so far because a belief is nothing but a thought youve been thinking for a long time I always think about what Michael Jordan said for years he says the one thing that nobody will ever understand about me and theyll never understand it cuz nobody saw it as I was working when nobody was watching thats the key nobody was in a gym you had no idea where I was but I had a ball and a basket work with no eyes thats going to get you to Pride great shot by Kean shooting the ball with confidence hes got a career high 13 tonight hes having a very nice night one thing about Kean he going to keep shooting the ball the Roar of the crowd the are coming in for the Miami Earth lets see lets see which one of the guys on the court for
