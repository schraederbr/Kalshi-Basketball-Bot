percent and hes been a great leader as well NC State wins the opening tip first matchup in 10 years between these programs only separated by 50 miles down I40 Music Applause heres to quavion Smith launching a deep triple to start the afternoon weve talked about it before but he has a green light coach Keats wants him to be active and free hes also doing a really good job of getting other people involved doing things like six steals last game six assists so hes doing a lot of things to help the offense heres the starting five for Billy Taylor Max McKinnon gets his first start of the year and Halloran comes up short Applause Joyner in transition finds more cell on the ice streak on Tuesday but he did not miss a three he couldnt follow great Outlook to Irvin hit that bucket theres joyners made two really nice defensive plays the first possession he got beat came back and made a nice block and on that last possession he did a real good job of that fouling and creating a tough shot same starting five for NC State thats Tuesday they were on fire and it was contagious early on they missed a couple of good open threepointers theres a Miss from Sherry for three first start for the Mechanicsburg Pennsylvania product weve got douche on back tying his shoes so its four on five rebound Joyner and now more horses joins the party Music lets double knot those laces Applause clavion Smith Fresh Off six assists finds the Horseshoes nice job by Clark keeping it inbound that offense with uh get back there late just wasnt in sync both teams yet to hit a shot from the field as it stays here with NC State Kevin Keats offense boy theyre clicking on Tuesday five players and double figures and a 392 record against nonconference foes right here at PNC I tell you coach Keats really likes this team they got a lot older they got a lot bigger theyve got more depth so hes excited you know the 30 start you know its great and I see how uh how good they are when they go to the Bahamas Elon strikes first to three from Max McKinnon you know we talked to Coach Billy Taylor before the game he said he wants to just stay in it he wants to hang around uh he saw where Oscar P got ran out early with all of NC States pressure so far though Clark responds with a triple NC State shooting at a 38 percent from three thats a big one to start this game no doubt about it Jack Clark If you look at all the players that have played at NC State hes one of the guys that has the prettiest shot his technique is off hand is perfect you know he just needs to get a little confidence and get going but Casey Marcel and John Clark are going to be the guys that really how good this NC State team can be its going to be dependent on them tertiary scoring for NC State Irvin does not touch much on that shot that comes Clark elons getting back defensive and really well today Smith Blows By everyone Smith can do it so many different ways was very patient he didnt take the quick jump shot and uh now he gets a steal conference sophomore great dish okay thats what youve seen maturity of Berlin Smith we made that pass were in years past last year he may have looked to force the action thats what coach Keaton Wolfpack want to see his game develop for him Music didnt have anything patient hey hes a slender guy but he plays extremely strong with contact doesnt bother him and you have to defend the threes TJ Burns checks and that gives him the layin Music theres Haller in the Belmont Abbey transferred with the Eternal brute forced by Smith the Belmont Abbey program is littered all over the Elon apartment is full and Coach Billy Taylor alltime assistant in Iowa Leonard comes up short in a step back yeah thats his shot when he gets in there hes strong hed create enough opening to get his shot off not a shooting clinic in the first four minutes Smith though great find and a block a beautiful play by baby T but Casey couldnt finish McKinnon with the block his first career start at Elon product out of Brisbane Australian Applause Harry for three he Applause Music he likes to attends sophomore with a big trip Eli great job looping the ball around finds the open shooter knocks it down

of the price he was charging Music my dad instilled in me I always put the people before the money be proud of offering a good product at a fair price I think hed be extremely proud of me Music Billy Taylor hired at Elon April 15th brings his family down from Iowa from her longtime assistance with a great program with the hot guys I really enjoy talking to him before the game he talked about what was most important it was building the culture he said the wins and losses they will come but Im trying to instill a special culture Elon Muses the Ackerman acronym salt to Define their programs selfless is the big word in that and after the 45 of Phoenix of two foul on DJ Burns just checked in the game theyre going to try to get us the ball Applause to tell you thats what he could do hes got great foot working quick spin for being a guy as big as big as he is he has good quickness and hes got obviously great strength Burns did not hit a shot on Tuesday but thats a good sign for NC States bench scoring you know when hes in the game because he is going to play limited minutes theyre going to look to get him the ball on the offensive end burns the reigning Big South Player of the Year at Winthrop the ball on the post good feed look at the big man go to work its just a little off balance there but Jack Clark with the nice steal right back to Burns good pass Applause we told you coming in NC State could shoot the rod best field goal percentage 54 in the ACC yeah theyre shooting the ball at a high clip but Ill tell you to really share on the basketball a lot better this year very unselfish in the first three games and last year it was Billy Taylors Iowa program that led the country in field goal percentage sort of fitting how it ties together loved watching those Iowa teams just always looking to shoot for three passing the ball kind of like an old school version of teams in the 80s and 90s with Luca Garza running the show for an elite top 10 program now Smith takes howler into school Applause jinxed in the pregame talking about great offenses a little low scoring here early Sherry again nearly had a second tell you Halloween did a nice job beating his man with penetration and finding Sherry but he couldnt knock that one down very nice penetration a hand in his face and Smith knocks down his 101st three say its hard to guard them fastest to a hundred threes and NC State history Zacharys out of play that shot right there is one that uh Billy Taylors not gonna like he doesnt mind shooting trees but not so fast in the shot clock that is NBA range for for quavion Smith not much you can do thats good defense hes shooting from about 25 feet but thats thats what the baby T could do he could beat you so many different ways and the question for Smith this year hes shooting 33 from Deep if he becomes more of a threat that makes his inside game even better oh theres no question you know before that he could do the more its going to open up for guys loose ball back to Burns and hes fouled a lot of bodies reaching in there thats on Andrew Junction the Mississippi State transfer Music OJ Thomas out there thats a quick look for him he hasnt seen playing time this early in the first time in half of the games Kevin Keats was very proud of the assist maker travion Smith on Tuesday s six steals its not just points for Smith well you know hes uh hes matured as a player and he knows that the more he can do the better it is for the team and its really going to be better for him you know next year when he looks to up to the NBA and it leads to this team assisting on nearly 54 of their shots thats a lot of good point though Ill tell you what Im an assist guy I love that so when I see that 534 that gets me excited youre going to win a lot of games when youre passing the ball and sharing it the way NC State uh has in their first uh three early games and the balance scoring is Big too you think back to Iowa last year led the country in double figure scoring State now three to four starters that can get you 10 every night yeah you know you know youve got one guy that can get you 20 plus its the other pieces jarkar Joyner you know really having a good start of the season but its the Casey Marcel its the hardest loss where are they going to get that 34th Jack Clark those are the guys theyre gonna have to step up and we know what uh Smith and Joyner can do but what about those other three thats the difference between being at the bottom or the middle or the top of the ACC top of the accs been run by Caroline and Duke the last couple of years might be a different story here in 23 video getting excited for ACC you just dont know whats going to happen theres always a team or two that surprises everyone how about Virginia Tech 50 start doing very well in the MTS this week middle mid tournaments traveling violation on Elon its called Elon needs to really take care of the basketball not turned over you know theyve got four early turnovers and thats something coach Taylor wants to kind of emphasize the keep down at NC State its one of the best teams in the country at forcing turnovers leading to 28 fast break points a game yeah theyre back in court again Smith and Leon pass another great defender they create Havoc its really difficult with regards to get the ball up to the front door to get into offense heres

so it feels so far away Music first year coach Billy Taylor sent his team to Italy this summer a nineday trip to bond in in various places in the great country but what an opportunity for a new program to come together what an opportunity to go to Italy you know I I was fortunate enough to play three years over there but when he took over to be able to have team bonding and what he talks about creating the culture just a great opportunity not only on the court but off the court for these guys to get to know one another were in a coachs clinic for local children in Italy as well taught the game back to other thats so important so nice you know for these kids to learn that theyre very fortunate to be out there to be able to give back especially John Bowen another transfer for Elon and a Belmont Abbey and a block by a horse did a good job he held his position and then went straight up for the block kidding me I dont know how you stop it I dont know how you stop it in college I dont know how you stop it at the next level in the NBA he just has so much of his repertoire against Pizza in so many different ways on the offense event its a Jimmer for that type of shot the confidence the Charisma and he pulls it off they think he is fearless he is one of the most confident basketball players Ive ever seen before Elon heads to the free throw line what is the ceiling for sequavion Smith he talked to NBA Scouts this summer elected to return and pull off plays that are incredible yeah I mean hes projected a first round I mean he was uh fortunate enough for NC State he came back here he just creates space elevates you know the one part of his game that he needs to work on and weve talked about it is you know becoming a little bit more of a playmaker getting other people involved but you know right now hes projecting the first rounder and I think NC State fans along with Coach Keats they were very fortunate to get him to come back and not be uh be in the NBA right now one of the angles even for quavion mentioned is I want to be a winner I want to go out as a winning ACC program get back to the tournament thats amazing how much in one year he has changed he was a freshman that came in had a great year scoring this year hes a sophomore but hes the leader of the team make make no argument about it this is his thing he wants to win joined by Chris corciotti who had many years dishing it out to some of the great players at NC State well I was fortunate to play with some great Shooters great athletes and it was a fun four years no doubt about that thats a fivepoint swing for Smith himself we noted earlier but 102 convert threepointers and hes just a sophomore even early yeah I mean he scores at bunches you know when he gets confident lets it Fly who can put up nine 12 points real quick now a pass off the Steal Applause nice dish to Marcel knocks down his first thats an 80 run spark bites for cuevo thats basketball that is good basketball you see the majority of Smith he didnt Jack that shot he looked for an open man and put in the corner for three thank you took a while to get up here we started out around 1959 Applause

people that can make that pass Russell Wilson Phillip Rivers I mean those are two guys that I can think of to make a pass like that is very difficult Elon tried to save but Jade Michael stepped out of bounds youre right though thats a quarterback vision for Joyner to Loft that ball 80 feet across the courtroom first of all you have to have the confidence to throw it you have to be able to look up and see it and then to deliver that uh is really incredible thats just a beautiful 90foot pass could I mention a quarterback in Chapel Hill with that type of Passover Absolutely Ill tell you Mayors havent just one heck of a year or not maybe a Heisman candidate Drake man all of a sudden not many quarterbacks in the country are better than him hes fun to watch I know his father and uh him Caleb Williams of USC two Elite quarterbacks yeah no question Elon trying to stop an 80 run for NC State heres an open three and Watson knocks it down two triples oh yeah theyve had some open looks the United States had some breakdowns on defense just Elon hasnt you know really knocked down the ones that needed to NC State Keystone on 10 fast break points and having a workout of a traditional offense here at worksheets jump ball possession Elon is that a palm on top of the ball there yeah that was that was just a block of palm but what you saw on that here you see the open three the knockdown but on the other hand youre gonna see comparvians gonna get double teamed a lot of times on that pick and roll and he made the right decision but Duchamp couldnt convert heres Sean Halloran a fourtime conference champion at Belmont Abbey division two basketball Music Elon did touch that last hey elons running their offense theyre getting good looks theyre just not knocking them down but I Im sure coach Taylor hes happy that theyre just going side to side inside out and NC State cant be happy with the open looks they theyre uh Billy Taylor was a great player at Notre Dame Applause Music he had seven inches on Halloran who held his ground Allens a tough player as you mentioned fourtime conference champion and uh you know he made the nice move to follow Billy Taylor um you know thats a credit to Taylor you know when he got the job Halloran wanted to come with him you know hes a tough little point guard waiting on Smith exits in just under seven minutes left in the half spills those minutes for the moment question without Smith on the court how does the offense operate for NC State I think this is when Joyner steps his game up and says you know this is my time to be a little bit more aggressive all right Halloran draws the blocking foul that is only the fifth team foul in NC State Joyner does a real nice job of pestering the point guarding creating pressure it makes it very difficult to get into your offense you know all point guards want to be able to make that first pass to kind of get the engine going but Joyner always makes that very difficult how about this Joyner with two fouls he exits 20 seconds after Smith left and now traquavion returns little quick little breather for baby tees thats all he wants anyways might be a 38 minute night from sequavion here Applause Elon having trouble getting into its offense on this possession clock to six Halloran forced up with three rebound Bowen kept his dribble oh finds Watson no good chance rolls in Natalia Watson was in there just grinding it out good second effort NC State not doing a good job of taking care of the boards well give Elon credit Smith makes a man fall this ones Watson 12 points a game for Elon hell be a big Target today for the Phoenix while in the open three hes still getting really good looks good getting good looks its not its kind of like outside its uh 29 degrees its kind of affecting me sitting around it yeah but we need the fire and courtyardi here to heat up fire out there youve been a player in these moments after one game scoring 107 in the next game its not clicking how do you find that consistency in all games are different you know but but you hope that some of it carries over a lot of that is confidence Music everybody s get on Elon right now in a little one three one zone so something a little different Clark breaks that zone a nice pass from Smith saw him in the corner of his eye made a real nice pass over the top remember untied his career high six assists on Tuesday that Vision will be important for instance very important its also one of the things hes gonna draw so much attention that hes gonna have to make those passes and he has really started to learn to do that Bowen forced up a prayer and it bounced out look at Smith Truck Halloran offensive Savvy play from the senior no question he Halloran just guessed you know in that point when a guys coming downhill at you thats more just a guess Im going here and you hope you beat him there yeah not quite sure he was set but uh Ill give him credit for staying in there remember in college basketball this year if a defender back pedals that can maintain the charge thats a new role in college basketball theyll have to be set Dr Caribbean didnt lower the show a reaching foul here nearing the bonus Applause now in the oneonone situation Music position all right so both Joyner and Smith with two fouls in this first half and Elon to the 11 not the type of rest that sir Cleveland wanted today no you know its for Coach Keats hes got a great backboard and does too he doesnt mind having one out of the game but when theyre both on the court it makes it tough coming up at

Elon Phoenix eating up from three five triples today yeah theyre shooting the ball getting really good looks I think NC States playing very good on ball defense but theyre not really playing away from the ball way too many uncontested shots that Elon said including two triples lots of Club charge for the Missouri transfer now DJ Burns enters the game look at this battle for the rebound and Elon comes out with it hello in the dish great Hands by Thomas Applause youre all smart yeah didnt have the numbers it was two on two very smart to bring it out and set up these next three minutes with LeVeon Smith and Sharko Joyner both with two fouls yeah theyre gonna have to go inside theyre gonna make a conscious effort to get it inside for the big one Thomas cant get the balance but the steal now the bucket wow another offensive board hopes around that ball is just all over the place thanks Billy Taylor says hey lets slow it down bring it up the court Elon had five turnovers early theyve been much better with the basketball since and its got them back in the game NC State the second most fast break points in the country they capitalize on opponents mistake its in the lane Music its Thomas Thomas has been around the ball all day both on the offensive rebounds loose balls hes been very active foreign Applause just to watch him shoot hes got one of the nicest shot his off hand is perfect its just a beautiful shot he just needs more open looks thats because youre a grinder report she got here three hours early to check out the shooters and I thought the game was at noon and it ends up being at one oclock so I was very very early better to be early than late my friend Owen cant get the land and look who right on top of the ball its your its your man LJ Thomas hey hes given some really solid minutes hasnt done a lot on the scoring on the offensive end but hes done a lot of little things hes getting a lot of minutes on the first three games he hasnt played uh you know big minutes but in the first half here he is certainly logging minutes with uh Joyner and Smith with two counts Breon passed just a couple of years ago he was the male athlete of the Year here at North Carolina football and basketball standout yeah just a great athlete very smart player and hes uh hes that third guard thats going to spell Joyner and Smith and that times the three of them will play together foul here on Elon still too away from the bonus Phoenix foul trouble today after a tough loss on Thursday night four point loss against North Dakota here at home good so its one of those things of basketball thats underrated you know teams that dont foul are successful you know theyve got five thousand Ill go two minutes to go what it does it keeps actually stay out of the bonus Thomas cant get the three keep in mind Sam Sherry was poked in the face early in the first half hes returned four for the Phoenix Music Applause tremendous ball pressure from NC State but its led to open shots coach Taylors got to be very happy with the way his teams playing theyre not a great shop who is late late in the shot clock both teams under 35 from the field lets let some fly early a friendly bounce you know again I dont think its a terrible shot but too soon and its run the offense lets get player movement Watson fade away oh look at that fight for the boards remember no trevion Smith no charcoal Joyner both in foul trouble so shell operates so that was a great shot by Casey Marcel he was in between do I pass it or do I shoot it and at the last minute he shot it and knocked it down NC States defense is clamped down holding elons scoreless the last three and a half minutes nice fine to Halloran Sherry stops the scoring run Ill tell you hallorans a tough little player like you said hes got the headband hes Jackie confidence hes not uh scared of the moment hes poking the ball with five seconds Marcel for three ends the first half for the Triple Seven threepointers for n state he came out soon got a lot of good looks Marcel as we mentioned had a huge game with six of them against FIU and hits one at the Buzzard well go to halftime a 10point lead for NC State no Joyner no Smith no crop music was rolling the economy was great Billy Taylor hopes he can bring back a hundred years past here tonight when you said that I was hoping you werent going to say between 87 and 91 I was playing with that alongside Chris corciani who noted his years 8791 here at NC State by the way coach I was born in 93 so I never watched you play live yeah youre a young pup tell you Elon right there opened up in a 131 theyve played mostly mantoman the first half but they have had possessions of Zone a heck of a pass by Watson so Joyner and Smith back on the court with two fouls for NC State and joyners impact has quickly felt uh hes something special down there on the defense Ben he didnt have great position but his athleticism got on the rebound went Coast to Coast hes one of these guys Evan hes so strong when he goes to the bucket if you bang them Smith with some pressure on defense and leads to a turnover seven giveaways for Elon today Applause Joyner great effort there on the rebound head up looking to see what he has all right I can blow by and lay in Joyner is a transfer hugely impactful out of Ole Miss twoyear starter give Levi Watkins NC States assistant coach who played here under herb sendik years ago when he came he brought Joyner with Joyner you have a chance to compete right away for minutes and rebuild his program another oh Lord his day to leave the squad heres DJ Burns doubled elects not to use the timeout and pulls him off the hook say when he gets it down there hes got to make his move quick before the double team comes nice pass a bit strong number three Watson couldnt hit it now Joyner Cuts in Music rebound Burns knocked off of burns leg how do you feel about the pace of the second hand well the pace is certainly NC State space the more possessions up and down theyre deeper theyre stronger uh you know thats what the way Kevin Keats wants to play well Ill tell you whats been nice to see in the second half for NC State is they only had four offensive boards the whole first half theyre doing a good job with effort going to the offensive glass foreign triple attempt Sherry now drives in and hes fouled on the way up DJ Burns has to be careful already foul trouble for the guards and burns picks up his second thats the one concern with burns on the court on the defense then you know can he guard can he defend you know a lot of times you see Harry nice clothes out but a little blow by by Sherry Sam Sherry earned the start for this particular reason coach Taylor wanted more athleticism at that stretch forward position because weve seen Elon all night run a four guard lineup and Challenge mahorsich and burns defensive yeah Sherry is is what we call long you know hes got good size but hes got big long arms a lot of people dont realize that really helps you on the defensive end when youre trying to block or change shots see Im sure he only averaged two points in one rebound the game last year but big minutes down low Elon had seven players jumping the portal last offseason so he rebuilt rosters and Smith knocks it down from the coachs spot cant leave him open Joyner found him Smith shot it with confidence and knocked it down three triples for chaquavion see his threes are fun to watch too he shoots it effortlessly some people cant even reach it towards once in one of the the REM to be kind on a cold afternoon in Raleigh heres a steal Halloran takes it away senior drives and converts a beautiful great defensive play by Halloran he follows It Up by taking it in Joyner right on his back and he was able to knock it in dude Sean Halloran is a scrappy basketball player I would not want to see him in the YMCA in 10 years if you wear a headband you better be confident and good and he certainly is heres the three shots rattled out offensive board Sherry a lot of close misses for Elon thats a smart foul by Helen yeah theyre very smart you know join our head numbers here you see Halloran with a nice defensive play and then uses his body to keep Joiner away very smart clever play by Halloran Sean Halloran LED Belmont Abbey in scoring last year hes the career assist leader for the Crusaders 500 dimes in his tenure Ill tell you thats throwing throwing the ball but you know he comes here first year coach Billy Taylor hes the guy that he needs to lead this team hes played in a number of games hes got the experience bangs bodies downstairs Burns exits Sprints the D2 National Tournament multiple trips to the sweet 16 foul here on the horse thats his first hey elons playing a nice game theyre down 11 theyre playing smart the thing thats really kept them close is theyre taking care of the ball you know they had five early turnovers and I think at this point they have seven only two cents great Point NC State is driving off turnovers their first 19 a game and the horses wanted another one there and thats the way coach Keith likes to play he likes deflections he likes being in the passing lanes and he likes the defense to create their offense maybe not a fast break score but one three open shots its a lot easier scoring when the defense isnt set up and youve noted how effective NC States offenses when they force the turnovers they havent had that same success today Halloran great time and a tongue wow beautiful look Ill tell you came off that pick and roll saw the cutting Man

weekend and here since NC State among some of the best so far in the comments well you always want to be undefeated you know NC State you know theyve played some teams that you know probably arent going to be at the top of their conference but you can only play whos on your schedule and NC state has taken care of business so far you mentioned who youve played so far well coming up how about this matchup number six Kansas who defeated two a couple of nights ago thats a heavyhitting competition we will see how good NC State is next Wednesday when they play Kansas Jalen Wilson Big Time 25 points against Luke he had 33 against Southern Utah that will be the first big test for Kevin Keats in the Wolfpack thats the start of the bad boy mowers battle for Atlantis Wisconsin in that tournament plenty of big opponents you could possibly play yeah thats what these kids they love that and well see just how good this NC State team can be each team trading Labs because youre right that strengthy schedule always amps up this time of the year was once conferenced to our second week of December it really gets Amplified as my Orchard says well thats what NC State didnt have last year this year with bonds and Buchan inside they can dump it in there to get buckets from time to time Music take a big picture too having a guard Armando big cotton North Carolina hes at post score to that show and some of the best teams in the world yeah theres a little question is with epilepsy theyve got a third big man that they can use for fouls turnover for Elon no live ball turnovers though its limited NC State in transition well thats what they gotta really like is that they havent turned it over that its led to easy buckets here you see big douche on very patient using his size and strength that fake pass the Williams heading towards us and it had Duncan turn his head right and thats what you want to do you want to gather yourself you want to be patient theres not a rush until that double team comes and he did a real nice job down there alone Music Jack Clark sitting on 13 points hes been the leading scorer for NC State today now the Pratt will lay up a moment ago by a senior fiveyear difference between Marcel and Pratt pass and finds McKinnon wow thats lucky when the ball goes up good defensive play and lands Ray to McKinnons lap for the easy Deuce each team with nine assists today he told me that number coming in Elon be a very happy camper yeah and also you tell me that theyre not Towing the ball over like crazy I would think itd be a closer game threepointer by Joyner and we have a flopping call thats a Class B technical on mahorsich which means free throw one free throw if this call stands ducheon and Junkin were battling back and forth they got tangled up and um and I was watching in the front Court I think a lot of us were watching in the front Court yeah and then back by the free throw line there was that Rumble in the Jungle no but thats the emphasis this year is flopping anytime theres flopping its not a personal foul but uh it Awards the other team a free throw so a oneteam warning and then that class B technical doesnt count to your personals like you mentioned but all of a sudden you give away free points that can add up you know I think a lot of players yeah but there was contact but there also was a Emmy given out there possibly Applause good jobs best supporting actor as Marcel picks up a foul and now this NC State crowd a bit on edge you know Marcel body was a good position chest to chest you know thats the way its taught chest to chest here you see him moving tell you thats a pretty sound defense right there Casey Marcels got one that uh he was right about two fouls for Marcel Joyner and Smith can Elon capitalize open three Watson double figures they have way too many open looks for Elon there you see just off a downstream cut to the corner open look theyre over there be effective with the three ball there back to back doubledigit games for Torrence Watson Applause Herbert did a great job there boxing out using his body perfect technique for a rebound Ed Squad more hardships tried to sneak one in there that didnt look good from the beginning that looked like a turnover that was waiting to happen fortunately for NC State they regained uh possession thats like driving bumper cars around the track hoping it works out you see the three here for Elon just a simple down screen for an open uh three six triples for Phoenix Elon averaged six threes the game last year so with 12 minutes left thats a good sign if youre an Elon supporter Ill tell you coach Taylors got to be happy down eight just under 13 minutes theyre playing solid taking care of the ball theyre in this ball game that was zone defense Smiths been unafraid to shoot and thats why okay hes tough to guard when you have to play him 30 feet from the bucket now nearly a steal and thats the impact as this call gets reviewed I just gotta love the F up there and he knocks down the Deep 26 footer here I mean look how far he is away boom with confidence but then he comes right back sneaks in from almost a steal I think his foot was inbounds it looked like it possibly was the call is upheld by the way tremendous camera work like they knew the steal was coming he stayed on to play Beyond and really led to the turnover

Clark was in the right place ball turnover turns into a bucket hes the best defender on NC States team there it comes up with a big steal and finish at the other end NC State 28 fast break points the game those are the plays we havent seen as much today yeah they havent gotten out not a lot of turnovers that have led to easy buckets but Marcel you know his defense is uh Splendid was always guarding the best defender last year and well see that again this year wants a foul and he gets his wish NC State gearing for Fast Break points they lean on the bedroom AC forcell sending us to a

Marcel cuts it out but Joiner stepped out of bounds Ill tell you and the NC State has not done a good job here in the second half attacking the once we won theyre holding the ball they aint able to get penetration in and kick it out it just seems like the balls not moving against that one three Red Zone this is one of the first times NC States faced a Zone all year and Im curious how you prepare for that and how you adjust to it mid game well its one thing to prepare for but until you see it in the game but you know thats the kind of thing coach keeps he needs things to work on early in the season the first three games theyve looked really good not a lot of teaching moments but Im sure that hell work on the uh one P1 offense in case he sees it especially in the Bahamas look at this distance Smith airballs the three yet Kevin Gates theres no stop in the green line he wants Smith to take that shot yeah he wants him to be aggressive you know hed much rather see a shot like that late the offense not early and you know that was late but as good as Jacobian is thats part of who he is and you dont want to take away his DNA hes Fearless he can get on a run and scoring bunches you know sometimes you gotta take a little bit of the bad as well hes hit two of those deep threes tonight 50 from the 30 foot range if you will the NBA experimented with a fourpoint shot from that distance Id be curious if that ever made it to the college game Cannon spins the lane nice pass to Irvin Ill tell you the Lord the old school way just grinding it out and weve got a seven point game here Elon heating up seven of its last nine from the field obviously theyre gonna stick in the 131 theyre gonna shade and find Smith oh its Ross strong on the jumper Elon can make this a ball game Power into the could he blows by Jordan wow coach Keats did not like that they didnt get back fast on uh defense and Halloran made him pay time out NC State will take the timeout how about Elon in a

things happen when they share the sugar so you see hell Halloween hitting Michael and McKinnon finds the wide open Earth second half theyve done a nice job getting everybody involved nice Cuts this is the story of the game elons so efficient from the field in the second half but avoided turnovers and now its a fivepoint game and I said all game long they were getting good looks they just didnt knock him down in the first half the second half theyve been very uh effective then insert this matchup zone defense the Joyner boys five for the bank okay thats a tough shot against good defense went up off the uh yeah whats the saying good defense but better offense always beats up off the long legs shot it with his left hand to knock it down and join her hes a shot maker for sure has seven to compliment to Cleveland with 16 Clark with 15 Applause Applause nice dish were having a lot of contact and its off of NC State you know theyve been a very patient offensively theyre not letting the pressure get to them here you see Joyner with the blowby gets caught kind of in between what hes gonna do and lays it up with his left hand just a very difficult shot against good defense two seconds on the clock and Watsons wide open now that cant happen you know theres a number of things thats just a defensive breakdown with two seconds left youve got to make the team taking it out underneath you got to make them throw it out four and a half court you cant leave the basket undefended and typically guarding the inbounder helps with that but NC State gave him space to find what park with a Nifty pass and Marcel makes a count and thats a big shot but great Vision by Clark who was kind of being forced out on the Baseline found Clark that slid down in the corner and knocked it down NC State 11 triples today they hit 15 on Tuesday so that part of the offense has come to play yeah theyve shot the ball kind of reasonably well today early in the season you know theyre knocking down shots youve got to be able to score the basketball Applause a rare Miss for Elon in the second half 58 percent open three just bounced down this place would have gone Bonkers thats what NC State wants they want to push it up Elon cant get set up in the zone get a good look theyll take that every possession Applause is denied just a good defensive play but Halloween just kind of slithers in there finds a little room but wasnt able to finish good recovery hallorans the version of JJ perea for the Elon Phoenix he just finds his way he doesnt just blow by you but just gets there whoa Watsons heating up 19 points oh yeah NC States got beat on both out of bounds on the news wont be a happy one Watson was only a 420 game score in Missouri in the last two years but he has exploded today heres Elon back in that zone defense Applause hes big strong down there he hit the offensive glass but he is a monster down there offensive boards great for NC State Music and Elon Bunch thats lost three straight they want to hang around here in the second half and they have theyve done a really nice job in the second half knocking down shots goes right through his Defender that was Smith was trying to get the call there but other strong and straight up this matchup in 11 years fivepoint game five minutes to go Music hey break down this zone go right into the middle of it and Clark hits the jumper Clarks just a great shooter one thing to be able to knock down three points hes got a real nice midrange game and hes the perfect person to be late in the middle on the offensive attack prince who stayed against his Zone you know whos watching this tape Jim behind February 14th at Syracuse lets see a lot of Zone coming up but he likes to play and they got it perfected it over the years you know that zone that serves this place is very very difficult to score against its a smart foul by McKinnon only the third team foul on Elon because Billy Taylor mentioned a pregame his team has to find a way to respond to a big run theyve limited the explosive points for NC State yeah mainly because theyve taken care of the basketball but he did say said NC State scores and bunches we cant let them just score the Montana runs and NC state has it you give credit to Elon Watson almost got his hands on it same for McKinnon here my horse should triple hold on Applause okay nothing report so far thatll be interesting to see if they go neighborhood look at that because uh Duchamp did swing his arms and lets take a look you know it occurs after the play thats one thing but when after the play hes oh okay watch the face there of McKinnon you know they knocked the ball out of his hands I want to take a look at that one yeah lets take a media time out and come back with answers four minutes to play Big call coming up in a seven point game NC State any longer Music free 11th will be Applause living room three in a hockey players head Applause whats your 11th Music do you remember Music

basketball move so thats not the one its just after the play its about the malicious nobody got hurt lets play ball theres the swipe one and the slap for the other and I sort of like that neutralize it equalize it out Music doesnt need to be a foul on how to play with it let them know that it happened in the third two technicals NC State keeps possession too thats the big number with 404 to play I see him Elon stays in the 131 stay work the ball to Clark very well in the last possession time Smith teams up a prayer and Orchards the Ford back to work Ill tell you the best offense here in the second half has been going to the offensive glass dushan doing a good job on the uh Smith Miss but a lot of second effort points on the offensive glass front she stayed in the second half six second half points in this half alone Elon needs a bucket Irvin great find to Watson gets his own board and free throws for Watson wow that was a great feed by Urban at the top of the key found Watson streaking couldnt miss it but he stayed with it great effort hes gonna get uh two freebies here Florence Watson only started eight games last year a key bench contributor for Elon that was the fulltime starter in his Fifth and final year to the freethrow line Applause booing one because of the score and two the visiting player misses two free throws ChickfilA sandwich for everyone in attendance they want their Salvage Music Morgan Freeman and ChickfilA backtoback creative Fatheads here from the home crowd Billy Taylor ELO came in here Applause and I didnt think that with three minutes to go you know itd be an eightpoint game remember partner the oddsmakers had to set a 26 point games so Elon has proven some folks wrong and hanging tough today they said were going to take this 45 minute bus ride to come to Raleigh to win three minutes to go weve got a ball game oh a breakdown the zone defense lets give it NC State fits in the second half and a long step back is knocked in sell us 15 points been score in the second half its got to be Marcel and Clark guys stepping up in games and Marcel has done that in the last two game stats he sold the kitten turns the corner and lays it home beautiful hey elons done exactly what they wanted to do here in the second half theyve been very patient and its been 10 wins since the Phoenix sorry 10 years since Elon picked up a power five win over South Carolina Clark looks to extend that streak of the jumper Thats The Sweet Spot in that zone Smith found Mark but thats where you got to hit right about the foul line against all zones you mentioned Syracuse the spots that hurt that zone is always right right at that free throw line NC State searching free 40 start before things get real tough at the battle for Atlantis this week I cant wait Wednesday Ill be ready to watch that one Irvin the open three and an offensive foul thats a big one on Junkin where is the ceiling for NC State because they learned a lot in the first four but the next four is a whole other level well well find out a lot on Wednesday when we get Kansas Music won the whole lot there against the state may have gotten one but yeah well find out a whole lot about NC State on Wednesday but this team is exciting its mature theyre a lot bigger than last year older um and Im sure coach Keats and really see what they can do possible opponents Wisconsin Dayton Kansas and maybe others depending on how you win or lose Applause final minute for Elon Halloran a risky pass but he finds McKinnon who dishes it to Irvin and he hits they have shared the sugar finding the cutter doing all the little things again they may not come out with a victory but theyre going to feel good about their future elons outscored NC State in the second half bucket here may clinch it for the Wolfpack Music open free okay big possession for the Phoenix Elon needs to try to get a quick shot up here Watson opens three thats a big forward by horsesh you want two of nine from deep in the second half Elon needs the foul here they need the clock is their enemy nice land for Clark and a timeout for NC State to set up its defense well take a quick timeout come back for the final 30 seconds when we return this might be the most emotionally charged match of the modern era so black girl Hockey Club is all about building a community Music Applause Music Applause Music NC State leading by 10 thanks to some tertiary scoring options Casey Marcel 15 and Jack Clark eight big points in the second half yeah Jack Clarks been the guy hes been the answer for NC State they struggled a little bit against the Zone but he was able to find his spots and really put the team on his back here in the second half final 25 seconds for Elon Urban contested three he wanted a foul and that four by my horses will secure it for NC State a 40 start Applause dushans boards on the offensive end a bit big clue that one sealed the game but his offensive boardings been really nice yeah he provides he provides NC State with toughness and he comes in there and plays with energy plays hard hes able to score down there you know I think uh dushan and Jack Clark have been the two guys today that have really come to play and you know theyre the ones that showed up and Nancy state looks to build 40 to head to the Bahamas and like we said youll see you know well see how good this thing is Kansas coming off a win over Duke this week top 10 under coach Bill self Music Joyner and Smith take a breather in the Final 14 seconds okay this is a little thing but thats I think its so smart coach Keiths taking out his back for 14 seconds if anything were to happen you know the season the Orchards misses the free throw so a point shy of a doubledouble horses thank you NC State starts 40 an 11 Point Victory as Clark Marcel and Smith lead the party in double figures yeah I think it was impressive uh showing Quincy state to kind of blind it out get a victory like this but also give credit to Elon they came here ready to play and uh theyve got a lot to build on so when
