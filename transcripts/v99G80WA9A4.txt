the big time Swagger 16 points per game and on the other side featured for Pitt wow jamiri is Burton a big talented power guard around 64 youre gonna love his old school midrange approach in the ACC Doug hes getting 20 points per game Music we are set for basketball with first place in the ACC on the line Federico Federico jumping Center against PJ Hall and its the Tigers the basketball first in their tiger orange and thats not purple that is regalia trimming those unicorns I didnt even know thats a color regalia regalia and of course the Panthers in their home whites PJ Hall found the senior for the Throwdown Hunter Tyson averaging 15 and a half per game has his first two of the afternoon and when you play Clemson theyre the best threepoint shooting team in the ACC that pulls the defense out Tyson got three on the Baseline Big Time finish coming back out to Elliott into the corner for three a round and out for Burton this is Chase Hunter red shirt Jr from Atlanta who has grown into that starting point guard role this season for Clemson Paul tease it out a little strong on that one Clemsons been shooting the basketball so well from distance this year Panthers meanwhile line up with a whole bunch of new faces weve talked a lot this year about how well Jeff Capel and his staff have done in the transfer quarter remember last year Applause Jeff Capel said that our scoring was not good enough they were dead last in the ACC will theyre up to 75 points a game scoring is not a problem met at the rim by Federico who was called for the foul but I love the action as the Freshman Ian shefflin found the cutting TV on the back door and thats the kind of Rim protection that is so impressive from Federico you know hes like uh heres a comparison how about quick capella of the Atlanta Hawks Elite Rim protection he runs the court hes a lob threat and hes going to get better and better because hes so Young the basketball and he picks up his first personal foul and Hunter Tyson one of only nine players in the country averaging a double double this year Tyson 15 and a half points 10 rebounds per game which is third best in the ACC ninth in the country and now that he is healthy hes had a career Mark by academic Excellence significant broken bones the last couple of years a facial fracture two years ago missed five games then played with a mask kind of broken clavicle last February cost of eight games but perseverance 10 he has improved and now playing it in all ACC level the other thing he brings is a little bit of toughness he talks crashes the attitude for this Clemson team Applause is Reverend Galloway off the bounce I look at this matchup and feel like Pitt has a substantial advantage on the glass especially in the offensive boards Panthers are on the board thanks to the triple from jamarius Burton offensively a lot to like for the Tigers High skill deep Playbook they run a ton of set plays but never forget the fact that they rely heavily on threes 39 top 20 college basketball shot clock down to six away this time finds the range he is on the board in his third stop after five years at the College of Charleston and last year at Boston College now his seventh year in college he is 25 years old and hes not the only one in the country there are nine guys 25 years or older playing college basketball Applause game Music was at Iowa State the last two years whyd he transfer to Pitt why did they let him get away he wasnt even in their plans and hes exploded this year hes got a really good chance to be all ACC ENT its another third stop guy a couple of years at Ole Miss then last two Asia said in Iowa State where he did not play for the Cyclone PJ Hall is on the board 85 Clemson with the early lead one of the reasons Doug that I expect an even match up pit has really good guards I think thats their advantage and I really like Clemsons big guys cards versus Biggs the real good contrast with style Nelly Cummings has his cash deflected hes coming off a marvelous game to win over Virginia eight assists to zero turnover and his recovery sets up Henson for three more five points for the sixth leading scorer in the ACC the Panthers have won 10 of their last 11 during that time scoring has not been a problem nearly 79 points per game Applause going to be called for an offensive foul The Freshman Ian sheffling sticking his chin in there and the charge against number two and white Music timeout here at the Peterson Events Center Music all college basketball coaches in every conference will tell you do not put any stock in the preseason poll well certainly this year the ACC at this point youd put no stock in where Clemson and Pittsburgh were picked to finish because right now both teams are undefeated through four regular season ACC games and Doug theyve done it in completely different ways think about this Clemson developed their best players who are seniors theyve been in the program theyre older they understand what is expected and pit on the other side they hit the portal Gold Mine their best players came in from other teams once again though theyre veteran guys think about Vincent Cummings and Elliot for Pitt average 40 points per game Clemson this doesnt happen every day but maybe we had a glimpse at the end of last regular season when Clemson won its last four regular season ACC game to chase under with the turnaround so that means theyve won eight games in a row at ACC play in regular season games thats an alltime Clemson record and dont forget the tigers are a charter member going way back in the Atlantic Coast Conference theyve had a couple of starts like this in their history we talked about the Rick Barnes team back in 9697 the last time they went 40 they won their first five games and ultimately wound up in the sweet 16 and then you go back to the 8687 team led by head coach Cliff Ellis Horace Grant was the the star player that year they started off four no that team also wound up in the NCAA tournament what weve seen out of Clemson Tim makes you think this could be a tournament team I see both of these teams playing the NCAA tournament I dont think what theyre doing theres no smoke and mirrors theyre fundamentally sound their top back defense and they have all kinds of temperature on the offensive end Nikki sabandi is coming to the game this is Nelly Cummings off the bounce left with short PJ Hall the rebound and here comes Clemson Galloway pushes it into the front Court freshman guard Josh Beadle who is coming to the game this is the redshirt freshman the chaplain who goes to work along the Baseline and lays it in all right how smart is that shuffling seeing that Federico is at the top of the key covering Hall he knew that theres no post resistance at all chaplains a 67 sophomore from Loganville Georgia they started his college career off with a bang 20 points 14 rebounds in his Collegiate debut back in November against the Citadel foreign picks up the dribble needs to find a teammate Savannahs in trouble two to shoot he puts it up and that is a shot clock violation and how good is the defense by shuffling he has the beautiful low post Kevin McHale move at one end and on the other side he stops Cummings in one on one he doesnt look like an Above the Rim athlete Doug but he certainly has good footwork Beetle tough pass threading the needle its another layup for shefflin kind of interesting sometimes your scatter reports focus on the headliner so much that a guy like sheplin comes in underappreciated gets off to a quick start 60 Clemson run coming out of the timeout weve got a foul against Chase Hunter who has made a big jump this year fully healthy Redshirt Junior out of West Lake High School in Atlanta and he has his game rolling and with that Tim no surprise his confidence is at an alltime high turnover Beetle tries to track it down the officials confer and Lee Casal nearest to the play says itll go the other way to Pittsburgh Applause the pits are really good oneonone team I love them in high ball screen action their spacing is Elite and against Clemson if you could spread them out a couple things happen if you find those driving gaps more importantly I dont trust Clemson on the defensive glass Scheffler clears the Cummings Miss foreign Clemson run Applause this is a trip that you try to get a nice roll of the basket for Henson hes going to be a top cover for Clemson Applause Nike Sandy misfired he had perhaps the highlight of the year so far for Pittsburgh in the win Tuesday against Virginia the big slam dunk Galloway cut off by Federico the Fallen takes an extra strength a step and is called for traveling Chase Hunter was always a shooting guard even some small forward but with the departure of two point guards from last year he stepped into the starting role nice midrange game good touch but think about not only does he need to run the offense which is new for him hes got to chase the opposing point guards hes run off screens nonstop I think conditioning has been a massive Improvement for Hunter and with the transfers out of Nick honor to Missouri hes playing well for a much improved Tigers team and alamir Dawes hes averaging 11 per game at Seton Hall there were minutes in the Clemson backcourt available this year and so Beetle has stepped in RJ Godfrey who we have yet to see has stepped in but its Galloway coming from BC and Hunter stepping up his game that have really seen the biggest jump yeah I agree with you and and I want to take a minute to focus on the play of Blake Henson we really enjoy talking to him tug and when you you look at those shoulders on him its not surprising that in high school he was a tight end he was recruited by a lot of SEC schools including Georgia and LSU and he said that the physicality that he learned as a football player helps him when he drives to the basket and he absorbs contact he seeks shoulder to shoulder contacting and that helps his finishing among the things he shared with us is he was offered by a number of SEC schools to be a tight end to play football just like his brother did his brother was a big time football player as well Evan was a tight end of South Carolina while also playing Hoops for the Gamecocks actually he was a reserve wing on Frank Martins final four team in 2017 but from what we gather and talking to the coaches Blake wasnt so much wanting to deal with the physicality of football he likes being the tough guy in basketball but in football he said you know what Ill let other people play that well Ill tell you what his PJ Hall scores inside for Clemson Blake Henson apparently recently said the coaching staff if we make it to the Sweet 16 can I play Spring football for Pittsburgh they immediately said no but then responded well if we make it to the elite eight well talk about it thats good thats a good deal that helps everybody out and as a matter of fact cat narduzzi the pit football coach is in attendance here this afternoon Clemson on an 80 run I see a great future for you Music tomorrow at two Eastern on ABC and the ESPN app will have the FCS Championship game between North Dakota State and South Dakota State at Toyota stadium in Frisco Texas the Bison of the defending champs but the number one seed is the jack rabbits should be a good one tomorrow at two Eastern theres the head football coach here at the University of Pittsburgh Pat narduzzi see if we can get him to turn around hes been here since uh well before the game the Oakland Zoo which filled up as soon as the gates open started going dudes when he walked in first I thought they were booing somebody and then you said wait a second thats the football coach of the Panthers and the students are making their way back to campus coming back from their Christmas break classes resume on Monday and so I think many of them took advantage to be here this afternoon Coach narduzzi received a lot of good information about his former players Kenny Pickett is playing very very well as the playoffs approach and also the big news right no doubt about it as Burton makes one out of two force uh his cardiac event in Cincinnati on Monday night has been the story in the country and were so glad to be able to share continuing good news on his recovery at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center and of course the folks here at the University of Pittsburgh remember his days fondly applying for Coach narduzium as a matter of fact he was a AAU basketball teammate of pit point guard Nellie Cummings they play in this building for Curtis Aiken they had practice here and then played games elsewhere theres Curtis Aiken the former pit great longtime radio analyst for the Panthers he coached a team called the Wright brothers including Nelly Cummings and Demar Hamlin and Curtis was telling me before the game that Demar Hamlin was good enough to play division one college basketball maybe not at the ACC level but he was that kind of hoopster as well as being one of the top football recruits in the country so happy for the news about his recovery and had a chance to uh to go up with fans today and sign a banner in honor of Hamlin and the line was very very long Doug I remember 1971 being a young kid in Detroit Chuck Hughes for the Detroit Lions died on the field its the only time thats happened and when when I saw Hamlin go down it just sent shivers thats horrifying no question about it were so glad that he continues to regain his health field I think that Pitt may want to consider some Zone Cummings after the takeaway Panthers trying to get Roland down by nine Comics uses the screen its a Bandy penetrates tries to dump it off Ben middlebrooks got a hand in the pass Burton with a great shot fate Burton loses it and then the foul call comes you heard the skin on skin contact and Burton looked at the official and said what took you so long I agree with that it was a late call but today at shoot run Jeff Gable was saying that our advantage has to be on the offensive glass pit has long athletes they attack and lets take a look underneath theres a little push by Hall he had good position and going up Burtons got that old school game he loves the midrange Middlebrooks was straight up and down but I thought it was a good call foreign on the floor is going to go against Clemson and against their promising freshman RJ Godfrey coming off his best game as a tiger 106 rebounds at Virginia Tech in the win over the Hokies on the fourth had a couple of block shots as well all that in only 16 minutes but the post script is he also had five fouls and fouled out of that ballgame well it shoot around Brad Brownell was telling RJ said look youve got to play without knocking people to the floor hes got a pretty good football bloodline too go down jamarius Burton marries the three foreign on the year coming in you see two out of three so far this afternoon draws pit back to within a half a dozen I think we lost it on the way up nicely done defensively by Guillermo Diaz Grand Burton for three got it double figures for the grad student out of Independence High School in Charlotte Hunter Tyson answers with a triple and quiets the crowd Tyson likes talking doesnt he we have seen that Swagger from him all year its 68 217 pounds putting together a season worthy of First Team all ACC when when you walk into a tough environment you want a guy like Tyson to say Im with him bad pass by Burton and the foul on the entry pass against Guillermo Diaz Graham earlier today we talked to Burton and and I I term him as a tough cover he studies DeMar DeRozan of the Chicago Bulls and hes always seeking that midrange game at the other end youve got a little sit down and shut up music from Tyson you know Federico is back in the game it was a good idea to go into the paint with him on the bench but he brings shot blocking keeps shooting those jump shots guys BJ Hall goes to the jump Hook and the length of Federico was no problem all right Applause heres Greg Elliott Burton he is now three of five from Beyond The Arc with a head of steam no everything but the Finish Id like to Pace of this game for Pitt they have not been efficient offensive wow Federico theyll miss the land well savandy is considered by Jeff Capel his sixth starter and he is electric coming off the bench over 1600 career points Applause under eight minutes remaining in the first half there you see Savannahs numbers in the big win over the whos on Tuesday including that highlight real slam dunk four to shoot Paul fires hurt to Ellie on the pullup overhaul no and Hall pulls down the rebound the three losses for Clemson this year there were two issues that they had to address to number one slow starts check that out really good start and the second one was poor defensive rebounding theyve been great so far Paul slipped the screen and then the reverse to avoid Federico well PJ Hall played through a stress reaction all last year and his left foot had that surgically repaired and then in the offseason had a knee injury hes still not back to a hundred percent but hes so much better than he was a year ago Applause all right contact on the drive in the pass and that is foul number two against RJ Godfrey Music BJ Hall a top 50 recruit coming out of Dorman High School looking to lead Clemson to a 50 start to the ACC season its forever its bow time Music so lets enjoy the work of Pitt basketball and Jeff Capel has been on a really interesting run think about this one in three record in November they got crushed by West Virginia and Michigan and lost a close one to VCU a lot of fans here were ready to move on from Jeff Capel but since then theyve responded 10 of 11 wins a massive success story one of the best in all college basketball and Doug he really pointed to that West Virginia game with a lot of new players as as being a time that that he felt like they were really down but he never lost the optimism that this group could come together he liked what he had seen out of them but even though they beat Alabama State on November 20th and one and three they struggled in the first half of that game but eventually it started to gel and we have seen the fruits of the labor and in this day and age with the transfer portal I would assume as a coach you just dont know how the pieces are necessarily going to fit but at this point after that rough start the the panther pieces have fit perfectly they have and top six players on the Panthers are all transfers 13 different schools and theyre number two in college basketball inexperience its just theyre not experience for Pittsburgh they see four of those five guys are new to the program this year jamarius Burton was with the Panthers last year after making his second transfer a couple years of Wichita State one year at Texas Tech but again these are older guys they have done a lot of winning at their previous stops and they are not looking elsewhere they are very much present and trying to make something special happen here in Pittsburgh this season thank you rising up Vincent got three more wow so when I when I look at the play so far of Henson and Burton this teams undefeated in League who do you pick as your all League guy because they they certainly both get an argument for it offensive foul against Ian sheflin well to answer your question Tim I dont think theres a wrong answer between those two guys Burton and Henson have both been so valuable and so good for Pitt that assuming youre not going to put them both on the first team whichever way you go at this point again we got a long way to go were two months into a fourmonth season either one of them could be a first team I was trying to put together a team and and even though its January 7th I know some people are going to be really mad at me for leaving out their players Armando Baker is the obvious one I think Tyree Appleby is as well from away um Isaiah Wong is on Miami and hes been Stellar I personally picked jamarius Burton because I think hes a little bit more of a catalyst and playmaker and and the one guy that I would say is obvious is Hunter Tyson now now who do you pick do you have Burton or or I took Hinson I mean we did the same exercise and because youre a former first round pick they build your graphic Ive just got to tell mine I said its written out of tissue there but there are other guards who I would put into the Mix A Lot I love Isaiah Wong I have been on the Wong bandwagon since he was a freshman like Kihei Clark in Virginia to quavion Smith at NC State Caleb love had a good game today for North Carolina in the win over Notre Dame with 18 points love may be the best NBA Prospect in the league but maybe a little bit inconsistent over the last week good ball movement Clemson very well attached and now on 12 made field goals Tim nine assists Applause all five starters have scored but the thing I like the most about Clemson plus 14 points in the paint they are totally inside up now heres a five pass possession and thats the way that you take a good defense and neutralize them look at the Spacey get inside kick it out everybodys looking to turn a good shot into a great shot that was the best offensive trip for the Tigers so far Tim you mentioned earlier Brad Brownells Club is 16th in the nation at 39 shooting from Beyond the threepoint line which is tops in the ACC and actually if you add in Alex hemenway who is missing his fourth consecutive game because of plantar fasciitis he has is at 50 their usual starting five for Clemson are 42 percent from threepoint line I agree with you hemenway is their best shooter they go from being really good to right from Beyond the other and that plantar fasciitis is hard to deal with Doug plantar fasciitis is a Latin word that means sore on foot Ive had plantar fascia it just it hurt I dont know what I dont know if its a tendon or a muscle or it just hurts that University of Michigan Education coming into play uh clearly the the folks here in Pittsburgh and Jeff Capel not liking that call saying what how did Blake Henson use his chin to follow the elbow of Reverend Galloway who gets one out of two from the line on rebound comes to jamarius Burton 3124 five minutes to go in the first half in this matchup of ACC undefeated Applause Hunter Tyson is doing a fabulous job defensively on first long two by Cummings Off the Mark Hunter Tyson who can be a rebounding machine with another board Applause Galloway back to Tyson wide open you know they shoot it so well from the perimeter because of that ball movement they get a lot of wide open looks toes on the line take a little half of a breath just relax and shoot it like its practice be shot ready and take it in Rhythm heres Elliott well you know that young man from going way back at your camps in the Detroit area Greg Elliott is just uh hes a gem of a person Jeff Capel said that he is an elite leader great shooter hes a winning player Doug Greg Elliotts first three points of the afternoon has brought the Panthers back to within four in this showdown of ACC unbeatens at the beat font and coaching Studio coming up at the half much more on that dominant win by Alabama plus questions still there regarding Duke thats a lot to like about Clemson offensively well I love their spacing and their patience offensively ball screen situations they dont panic set they look across the floor and find open Shooters theyve been able to knock down the three three I agree with your fonts Brad Brownell is the most underappreciated coach in the ACC all he does is figure out a way to win and by the way Tim McCormick Im working with a big guy you big guys are high maintenance oh boy you know let me tell you a funny story about Seth when I went to Five Star Basketball Camp when I was in 10th Grade Seth Greenberg was my coach and he never threw the ball into the long post back then shoot it guard dont go inside well you were a parade AllAmerican who clearly were able to overcome your coaching at five stars Applause named for both his father Jerome and his grandfather Paul so we understand it 88 years Young he is watching from his home in Atlanta this afternoon grandson and his Clemson Tigers up four with three and a half minutes remaining in the hand with this lineup Burtons got to take over Galloway well PJ Hall grew up in Spartanburg South Carolina in a basketball family his father Jerome plated Wofford back in the late 80s and early 90s over a thousand points and 500 rebounds hes number 40 there and he played for a team that was coached by well there he is now is a division one official but Wofford had Mike Young on the staff the current Virginia Tech head coach and he has stayed in basketball Jerome Hall is an official who is uh in the Southern Conference among other leagues obviously they dont ever put father and son on the same floor together but they were in an event Greenville earlier this year where Dad Jerome officiated the game before Clemson play and they just love the sport of basketball and very very close so PJ used to go to games with his dad and they would talk about what happened during the game and BJ said that hes learned to take advantage of angles and his dad always said dont get a foul in the first four minutes hes not going to be happy in his BJ has two fouls already dads gonna have something to talk about after the game now PJ is so appreciative for the upbringing that he had you can see on his face Tim when we spoke to him just how special those trips to watch his dad officiate college basketball games were when he was a Youngster well you got free popcorn on your referee the unsung hero in this game has been Ian shefflin and I think hes a luxury item but this Clemson team struggled on the glass early in the season and when they moved Hunter Tyson to the small forward position they immediately became a better rebounding team thats more minutes for shuffling Chaplin with six points in that starting role again the tigers are flying without Alex Hemingway theyre sharp shooting gar he was out of the foot injury Ellie Cummings now with four points Brad transfer out of Midland Pennsylvania about 40 miles from here Lincoln Park Charter is so happy to be back at school for his final year of eligibility high low pass from Hall taken away here come the Panthers with a chance to tie or take the lead Applause right Applause dont be surprised Pitt fell down early against North Carolina by double digit they fell down early against Virginia by double digit came back and won both of those games beetle and one of the twins wound up on the deck because of a cleansing foul back off his Guillermo Diaz Graham Music BJ Hall picks up the first foul and as you see there the winner will gain sole possession of first place in the ACC a couple of days ago we had three undefeated teams in League Play but Miami suffered its first League loss leaving these two as the only one standing for now stepping to the line Guillermo Diaz Graham he and his twin brother are young players that definitely want to work hard when practice was over todays shoot round was over they both were the two guys that stayed on the court shooting with their coaches well Guillermos the older and taller of the Twins and actually acts like it even though they are twins he is really he carries himself like much older that I didnt get but he carries himself in a manner that hes the Big Brother both literally and figuratively and they not surprisingly have an innate understanding of where each other is going to be on the floor and where theyre going to be really is something else people again if youre Clemson hes not the guy you want shooting that threehole and he has missed his last two playing very good shooting team doing its first lead now its up to three on the straightline drive by Burton advertise Burton and Henson leading the way for the Panthers and Nellie Cummings Applause so school is in session for Burton and he said that in watching film he feels like when he drives Clemson is going to go into drop coverage especially in pick and roll thats perfect for a floater and a midrange game and dont be surprised by Burtons Elite scoring against North Carolina 31 points he missed a couple free throws late though and he said it was too much adrenaline yeah he said that he always has to think about what his mom tells him to catch your breath focus and take your time at the free throw line listen to Mom hows Marius along with Hunter Tyson are the reigning Co ACC players of the week because of their most recent performances with those 31 points where hes 14 to 17 from the floor Santos misses Guillermo Diaz Grand I want to find out for my mom how come she never talked to me about adrenaline well did your mom play at Alabama a m she may not maybe doesnt have the same insight jamarius is mom Kimberly does she has coached shes also a referee the Burton family also all about basketball we enjoyed our visit with jamarius this morning as well as Paul Jerome Paul next to the free throw line 610 Junior from Spartanburg South Carolina Applause and hell get the bonus well we have a college basketball triple header tomorrow afternoon on ESPN and the act and were featuring the first two games number 24 Ohio State swearing off against Maryland in a big one in the Big Ten at one Eastern then number two Houston is in Cincinnati taking on the Bearcats in the AAC Perdue is the best team in the Big Ten at the end of the year I think Ohio state is going to be number two well that freshman plan this is something else and Bryce sensibaugh is one of the best bucket getting freshmen in the country well theres the skill of Guillermo weve been hearing about putting on the decks broke down the defense and helped get Savannah an open look he just couldnt make it would love to see a twoforone opportunity for Clemson if they go quick I always wish they did that more in college like they do in the NBA foul they say on the floor as Hunter Tyson tried to dunk again watch the ball he lost it and how can that not be a bucket how can it not be a bucket and a shooting foul it should be an and one here I think that maybe they called it on the floor before the dribble Applause and it is Hunter Tyson for one shot we talked a little bit about the fact that camarius bird had that 31 against North Carolina how about the fact that Hunter Tyson had 31 and 15 against NC State right before New Years the last tiger to do that Horace Grant its pretty good Horace Grant arguably the greatest of all Clemson Tigers when you have any discussion about Applause programs history Horus is involved in every discussion well here is the younger shorter Diaz Grand twin at six feet 11 Jorge rattles it home I bet theyve had some Fierce oneonone names over here it may have started in the crib with a Nerf who you never know well that would have been back in the Canary Islands Spanish islands off the coast of northwest Africa they dont have nerve Hoops in the Canary Islands are you sure about it pretty sure okay oh well younger brother makes a pair of free throws they are the ninth set of pit basketball brothers the last the antiguas back in the late 90s Orlando and Oliver Chase Hunter with a basketball for Clemson down by two Applause All Hands it off to Galloway to Tyson now its 10 of the shot clock Chase utter puts up the three ball hes no good Galloway with the putback no and soaring in as the Freshman RJ Godfrey five seconds left in the half Elliott with the dribble gives it up the shot beats the buzzer and goes through for Pittsburgh calmly done by Nate Santos the sophomore from Geneva Illinois and that gives Pittsburgh the lead heading into the locker room Music the folks you will see eight days ago here in this building or rather excuse me the last time out when he went to 31 points 26 of them came in the second half for Clemson so like Pittsburgh which has been a second half team this year Clemson has those Tendencies as well Nelly Cummings with six to shoot in a tough spot Henson comes to him and puts up an air ball heres the big warning for Clemson fans though pit and really good in the second half they dropped 45 on UVA in the second half 42 against North Carolina they get better as the game goes on and in both of those games they were down by as many as nine points in the second half against ranked opponents before coming back to win those games flying from two points up now make it four points up jamarius Burton now with 16 to lead all scorers this is the largest lead of the ball game for the Panthers Applause all in Federico banging inside they get it into Hall I like the idea of trying to push the tempo against Clemson that way you can maybe hit before they get set up because theyre a half court defense is really good Applause off the front rim it went halfway down and then trickled off the iron one of the underrated skills that Ive come to appreciate watching Clemson in person is theyre very good at contesting shots Chase Hunter after a quiet first half young man averaging 14 and a half per game draws the Tigers back to within two if Pittsburgh gets on a little run I wouldnt be surprised that Brad Brownell goes to some 23 Zone just to give a different look Applause Hinson runs into Hall and the foul is calling hes going to go against the Freshman Ian shefflin he and hall both trying to wall up but youre going against guys Blake Henson in this case who knows how to get the shot off and know how to draw contacts six seven 230 all kinds of skills he spent two years in the SEC at Ole Miss big producer he was a double figure scorer in that year and when when you think about what these players are going to do someday I got some bad news he said that he wants to be a sports analyst a basketball broadcaster great hes very hes very nice working with you Tim I hate hearing that well uh Blake we talked about his football roots and the fact that he was recruited heavily by SEC schools as a tight end his father Denny was a 65 standout in basketball in the 90s both at UCF and at Indiana State had a number of stops as an assistant coach in division one basketball and asked Blake at what point were you able to beat your bad dad Denny one on one and he said I still havent beaten him because my dad hasnt played me since I was 16 because Dad knows whats coming his dads no fool dont dunk on your dad Reverend Galloway buries the three out of this Clemson starting lineup he is the only one who doesnt shoot it at a rate that really jumps at you Revenant 33 percent part of a marvelous shooting perimeter attack for the Tigers Applause Galloway is an interesting player so what what did you say his age is he is 25 years old to put that in perspective hes older than Trey young Jason Tatum and Luca Dodgers Applause theres another one of the older folks experienced players in this game Greg Elliott having a nice game Federico may have gotten a piece of that on the way up and then he indeed he did and he was the last to touch so Clemson will keep the 24 seconds on the shot clock if I was going to pick any player that I knew would make a jump shot I would choose Greg Elliott his form is textbook you know he does like a gymnast that comes off the balance beam he lands in his Footprints like he sticks the landing on his shot I think its such an underrated skill and Pittsburgh does along that Baseline he works from one corner to the other and if you lose track of him hes likely to knock down that shot shot thats a shooting battle Ben Middlebrooks sophomore for Lauderdale at the free throw line next Saturday the Panthers and the tigers are on acc Network Pitt will square off against Georgia Tech at three Eastern and then Clemson will host number 16 Duke at Littlejohn Arena be interesting to see if the Blue Devils are still ranked at that point they did win today in Boston College but only by a point and this is a topsyturvy ACC yes Clemson and Pittsburgh the only two remaining unbeatens everybody else for the most part has at least two losses including Duke Doug one of the most under talked about subjects in college basketball Im fascinated with the transition with Coach K not being there anymore and the impact on the players the staff and all of college basketball its been completely silent Duke is so much different I think that theyre going to be very good by the end of the year but theyve got a ways to go theres former Duke associate head coach Jeff Capel who is a terrific player as a Blue Devil as well as one of the most iconic shots in program history said hes a hero when it goes back there right well you know what when Jason cable his younger brother goes back to Chapel Hill he is greeted as a hero former Tar Heel and as Big Brother played down the road on Tobacco Road and Duke is similarly greeted when he goes back to uh Cameron Indoor its a neat Basketball family we talk about the families and how from generation to generation the sport is passed down people certainly have that as much as anybody I just wonder about the conversations when theyre growing up at the dinner table breaking down trapping defenses and Diamond press Federico Federico off the dime from Nelly Cummings first two points for the sophomore from Finland his teammates call him fetty but when he does work down low were going to give him that respect and give him the full Federico Federico now the first love Academy in Washington PA theres little Brooks five minutes into the second half Federico gets a piece middle Brooks again and hes going to have a chance for three it looked like Blake Henson is going to pick up the foul everyone timeout here at the pit at the peak Clemson and Pittsburgh battling early here in the second half Music Monday TCU takes on Georgia the defending champs in the college football playoff national championship game presented by a t coverage begins at 7 30 Eastern ESPN Doug Sherman with Tim McCormick and Im sorry to bring that up to him as a University of Michigan alumnus I know you dont want to hear that matchup I am I called Delta yesterday and canceled my refundable flight I was so disappointed look Michigan I I think they could have beaten Georgia but if you cant beat TCU then you dont belong there and Georgia is going to run I I I think that theyre going to be dominant I mean Im picking the the Bulldogs as well espncom had us pick before the playoff who would win and Im sorry I picked the horn frogs over your Wolverines wow I apologize thats a good call look if if Michigan has two pick sixes and they get the ball twice on the two yard line and they get zero points and lose by less than a touchdown I I dont sleep at night anymore no I know I understand I get it so instead of being there in person rooting on your Wolverine saying go Blue youll be back home watching it with the rest of us on Monday night heres Nelly Cummings for the Pitt Panthers Bari is Burton off the Jack step Applause three to shoot Henson was a contested three no problem my goodness even with Hunter Tyson white in his room plus 12 from Beyond The Arc for pet thats the reason they have a lead right now they are out shooting Clemson who is really the best team in the ACC shooting the ball Pitts also had quite an advantage in Fast Break points nine nothing so far in the game but as we showed you coming out to start the second half Clemson has done its best work in the paint for this very good perimeter shooting team and finding the ranges Josh Beatle after he missed a couple in the first half he says dont forget about me Applause come find some space its a nice looking shot that is a veteran former all Patriot League player at Colgate who knows how to play the game the other thing that Cummings does very high assist turnover ratio he seems to understand what his team needs and delivers fourth in the ACC an assistant turnover nearly two and a half to one Reverend Galloway turns down the shot finds Hunter Tyson for three were seeing some exceptional offense Brad Brownell said that when you play Pitch offensively what they want to do swing it side to side then swing it side to side again then go to work Applause double team on Henson lost it on the way up on second effort missed the rim would stand defensively inside for the Tigers Chase Hunter left the ground thinking he was going to dunk it and hell head to the line to shoot two after Federico fouled him so you like point guard playing Ive got some good stuff to show you here theres the midrange shot shoot it over the shot blocker great lower body control Tyson from Deep great form hes got great confidence Swagger and I want to share with you I want you to keep and Ive noticed it for both of these teams because they have so many upperclassmen theyre very Advanced defensively and I learned a lot about defense from watching Bo Ryans teams at Wisconsin the best defensive teams cover with their hips and their legs they they really do a lot of their best defensive work from the ground up Im seeing a ton of that both ways from Pittsburgh and Clemson okay and that is coached correct I mean that doesnt just happen young defensive players use their arms and their hands older players learn to use leverage hips cutting off angles and really being good on The Scouting Report both these teams are making their opponent go to their left Burton lost his footing but a foul is called on Revan Galloway if you want to think of Pittsburgh defensively I think of Ben Howland what a great coach he was you think of you know the fact that that Jamie Dixon was so good defensive do you think these guys even know that that Pitt used to play in the Big East the players no even though they are older I mean its been a decade more than a decade since Pitt was in the Big East and since Jamie Dixon had it rolling and Dixon left what in 2016 so its been a while Dixon was here for the transition of the ACC but no I assume these players dont remember that Applause Evans Galloway off the front rim Santos who hit a jump shot right before the halftime buzzer clears the rebound for Pitt I smile when I think of big Monday yeah I miss it I miss those days no rap to retain biller Sean McDonough from the seat of his pants Burton gets the rebound hes now is begging for the ball back he should have shot it Thomas picks up another assist on the three ball from Guillermo Diaz Graham let me say it again these teams are tied for first place in the ACC thank you another chance off the offensive rebound Galloway no Hunter with the rebound and hell bring it back out with the shot clock reset once again to 20 Chase Hunter is foul Applause it is so nice to have the bounce back at the Peterson Event Center for this game between Pitt and Clemson doing it in different ways the Panthers and the Tigers play in a good one for first place in the ACC just as we all expected here in this second week of January Clemson and Pittsburgh playing each other for the spot say that again Clemson and Pittsburgh playing for sole possession of first place in the ACC you predicted that before the season right before me and all the other media you have people and coaches well I will say this that Miami and Virginia are the best teams that Ive seen this year and I think that everybody would agree that North Carolina Duke have the most talent but one of these teams here on this court will go to bed tonight feeling really good about being 50 undefeated with sole possession of first place and what a nice job so far by Chase Hunter you you look at his size its a big point guard super athletic eight points three rebounds two assists zero turnovers and this is his first year as a lead point guard oh and hes also got to cover their best player and look at the adjustment first time weve seen 23 Zone and its really extended good opportunities to drive for Pitt thank you got a mismatch inside trying to find Guillermo Diaz brown with seven footer instead they go to the corner and Santo has a rematch long rebound back to number five the big mismatch in this game is that Clemson struggles on the defensive glass and Pitt is a killer in the offensive rebound Department yeah outside of Hunter Tyson whos averaging 10 rebounds per game usually need to pick it up to Marius Burton now with 20 points hes got Pitt back in front and after having only one lead change in the first half weve already had five here in the second half lets go Applause Music Paul has it Rim out you know what I mean by all ACC team Im feeling better about jamarius Burton being on there well of course young my goodness averaging 16 points five rebounds four assists shooting it at 44 from the yard remember he he said he studies the play of DeMar DeRozan of the Chicago Bulls always seeking contact trying to get a little bit closer and his mom was his coach when he was growing up and one of their first games he was really upset and frustrated was crying his mom said stop crying were here to win a ball game were not here to play we are here to win no nonsense and he shares a lot of the things that his mom tells him he finds himself telling his teammates later on the floor on the rebound good position Inside by Santos shefflin picks up the foul his fourth personal and the fifth against Clemson youre in the second half 9 41 remaining in regulation and as you see on the score there on the bug Clemson 40 Pittsburgh 40 the only two unbeatens left in the ACC this season Santos from the left corner and a strong rebound grabbed by the long arms of Guillermo Diaz brand Applause theres a lot of people watching this game thinking that these teams are pretenders Chuck is not true this is a really high level game both these teams have played well Burton well Joe dinardi has Pittsburgh in the field of 68 this week as an 11 seed they went a week ago from being completely off the bubble on the other side being off the bubble on the good side thanks to backtoback come from behind wins against top 25 opponents meanwhile Clemson is just on the other side of the bubble if Joe says it I believe it and that clearly went off Chase Hunters hand and in spite of that Clemson keeps possession lets see if the Tigers take advantage of the break PJ Hall Applause Joey brackets says it as you say Tim it must be true how about a bracketologist but I I am a bubble master and I I study Club started studying very close and I believe that both of these teams look like NCAA you know you can take into account especially with this Pittsburgh team that they got off to a horrendous start they were blown out by West Virginia I watched the Michigan game in which they were annihilated by 31 points and then all of a sudden a tough loss to VCU since then theyve won 10 of 11 this is an older team this should not be a surprise Applause in the middle third of the Court there may be rim run opportunities inside for Federico if they run it again Applause trying to work on PJ Hall back out to Elliotts five and he buries the triple the Marquette grad transfer as you said Tim if hes open hes going to knock down that shot foul off the ball Federico winds up standing over PJ Hall and picks up the foul notice the spacing the best time to knock down a three is off a delivery from inside why Doug when youre growing up you go in the backyard with your dad or your coach and and they just feed the ball from where under the basket or from the wing thats where players shoot the majority of their shots thats exactly where Greg Elliott wanted the ball right at the middle Elliott now in double figure Pittsburghs lead is three and a foul against the Clemson Tigers and no surprise its on the precocious freshman from Suwanee Georgia RJ Godfrey well RJs best friends with his younger brother Grant who is 63 and a senior outside linebacker at North Gwinnett High School in Atlanta who is signed with the Kentucky Wildcats to play football next year plenty of star power Burton with the ball is a great playmaker Henson as well those two average 33 points a game Pinson draws the foul and will shoot two 6259 Pittsburgh hanging on with under eight minutes to play Clemson 59 back at the Peterson Event Center with Tim McCormick Im Doug Sherman and Tim what are the tigers done so well here today to be in position to maybe win this game I think that their work on the defensive glass has been Stellar when you think about Pitt theyre punishing in earlier games this year when you you look at the South Carolina loss Clemson gave up 19 offensive rebounds they got beat by Iowa and gave up 17 offensive rebounds so far in this game its been pretty even points off the glass and Pitt only has eight offensive rebounds total been a clean second half so far both teams playing well pretty much from the start and we have gotten out of this matchup so far what we were hoping a competitive game between the two remaining unbeatens in ACC play and please dont be surprised by the the fact that Pittsburghs playing their best ball in the second half against Virginia it was a second half Clinic no turnovers done the whole game the second half and they scored 45 points that was the reason they won Pittsburgh comes away with a ball nice pass by Henson to get it to sebanding finds the trailing Santos who thought about it now brings it back out to sabandi Burton comes for the basketball and has it Applause youre gonna get a steady diet of incident and burnt down the stretch of this game as it should be burden to the corner Santos again from the corner misses the three off the front heres the defensive dilemma for Penn youre scared to death of Clemsons threepoint shooting if you extend the defense they have the ability to put the ball on the floor and get to the rim Clemson has gone cold no field goals still for six minutes and Counting and an over the back pile against Godfrey Godfrey to knock down a couple of threepointers against Virginia Tech you could see for the look on Mike Youngs face thats not a discounted report and if he starts making threes thats not even fair the only two made threes on his college career for Godfrey came on Wednesday at Castle Coliseum a game the Tigers won 6865 they had five and double figures including the Freshman who sits down with those fouls got through has star written all over him at 67 225 he doesnt look like the typical freshman team what happens when he goes through the strong man training that Clemson does every summer they pushed Ford F150s and they lift heavy bags and carry them around campus apparently this past 700 Tyson won that award and TJ Hall says the only reason I didnt win was because I was rehabbing some surgery otherwise I would have won said Applause notice the spacing no pit players in the paint until they go shoot Burton leans in to draw the foul and he will head back to the freethrow line Applause what a year for jamarius Burton hes an attack guard to get to the rim guy fifth year of college basketball spent two years at Wichita State one year at Texas Tech and he handles his business like a pro double when we were watching it shoot around he went through there was no joking there was no laughing they had some music no singing by Burton then after a lot of the players left to get their pregame meal he went through a very specific routine of shots that he would take in the game he came over and talked to us like a pro great handshake really good eye contact gets his treatment this is a guy that that has been mentored and tutored and and somebody taught him how to act like a pro you mentioned singing I did hear Nellie Cummings singing pretty damn hes got a pretty nice voice I heard Greg Elliott too but these guys dont turn up to be Pros someday there you go theyve got a musical in history perhaps the future now Ian shecklin has fouled out of the game for Clemson there he is after taking the seat with 607 remaining Music Applause Burton is a 78 freethrow shooter on the year and he makes it a sixpoint Pittsburgh lead with six minutes to go Pittsburgh has been the better defensive team especially in the second half Clemsons offense is not working Hunter has to pull it out Gallagher a charges called against the BC Grant transfer Music and Pittsburgh will get the ball back for the chance to build on their largest lead of the game Watch the defense below the waist they keep cutting off with their legs moving and getting in front and trust me that hurts to take that charge right in the chest Burton going one on one on the low post lost it and a foul is called against Chase Hunter Hunter does not like to call that was made by Greg Evans and so that is his third personal foul try to think of a word that describes bird here it is what do you think Doug Macho okay hes a macho ball player but we hear this thrown around I think junkyard dog I mean hes that kind of ball player and I just enjoy as weve talked about for the last hour and 45 minutes to wait Henson and Burton attack the game of basketball and as long as were talking Old School Big East basketball We Gotta Throw Georgetown in there and the original jyd Jerome Williams now with Jerome I would have said hes a manly player but yeah I I like Macho I I like manly I like jyd free throws for number 11 in white hes going off again here today give him 24 points again the largest lead for Pitt on an eightnothing run did you ever think at the beginning of the year youd hear a crowd like this in the Peterson no and it is quieted for the Moment by Chase Hunter and Clemson uses a timeout to talk things over having drawn back to within five with 5 19 on the clock natarello has organic broccoli blueberry Blake Henson and jamarias birth continue to stamp themselves as one of the great onetwo punches in the ACC this year a double dilemma for Clemson is dealing with Hinson and Burton because they can impact the game in so many ways their studs in transition theyve got midrange theyve got threepoint ability and theyre also unselfish and willing to get their teammates involved remember top six players for Pitt how all older mature players that have transferred in once again the winner will take sole possession of first place in the ACC moving to fines and oh in League Play pass stolen by Chase Hunter first turnover of the second half by the Panthers see Hall try to get more involved I know that Federico is a shot blocker but goes side to side and get him a shot at Cross Court good look for Galloway Clemson has won for its last nine all right Applause first by Jim Marius Burton I dont know what else to say Ive used all my superlatives this guy is just a killer off the dribble always playing in attack mode he suffered a torn ACL way back in 2016 when he was in high school at that point a lot of the high major recruitment went away a chance for three for PJ Hall well Tim just as you said Clemson needs to make sure that man is involved on the offensive end Paul has a lot of all League ability as well if you go around the ACC and you talk to the coaches and ask him about DJ Hall theyre all going to say the same thing Id love to have that guy on my team you know whether hes a starter a scorer a key Reebok he just knows how to play and he takes care of his business thank you on the eve of his season beginning he was at his older sister Fairs wedding she got married November 6 to uh Major League lefthander Ryan weathers but because PJ was still rehabbing from surgery he was going to miss that opening night game anyhow they worked him back into the lineup still not 100 but his minutes are not being managed anymore Applause Ellie Cummings left it short and there is Hall strong for the rebound under three and a half minutes remaining Applause Music Clemson back with it too Clemson is so good using those elbow screens sure that Jeff Capel is saying to himself okay guys we dont want to be so patient weve got to run her off and dont change things Hunter has adjusted well to being a point guard this year but hes still got that scoring Jeep Clemson led by as many as 10 points in the first half pit led by two at the break and have built the lead to as many as eight but for the most part Tim McCormick this has been a highly competitive game with neither team seizing control two older teams that understand defense so much at stake well once again Ive got the ACC standings here and and it shocks me because over the years weve come to see North Carolina Duke up there and Virginia and Miami certainly worthy to be on top but this game right here in three minutes and 12 seconds we are going to have a team thats 50 and in first place all by themselves and I would expect a ranking for the winner of this game on Monday Clemson with a chance to retie or retake the lead Music would try to get something on the perimeter with hall because that pulls the defense away from the basket especially Federico Federico right heres an opportunity to go inside freshman Chauncey Wiggins has come into the game for Clemson and they go to Hall against a double team Federico blocks the first attack now to the Freshman Wiggins with a huge shot off the window to tie things up biggest tiger basket of this game ladies and gentlemen were tied up were 222 to go Wiggins averages one and a half points per game barely plays on a regular basis and Coach Brownell calls his number at the right time he clears the defensive glass and now Clemson can retake the lead this needs to be a long five pass possession get everybody involved you get a little bit tired at the end of the game maybe Pitt will break down and give you an open shot its been a quiet second half for Hunter Tyson this is Galloway 7169 Clemson offensive foul against Burton Applause giving me a beautiful delivery two defenders in the paint and getting to the rim still memory wow wonderful balance for Clemson offensively with four and double figures today now without Ian shefflin The Freshman fouled out with under 90 seconds left in regulation out of bounds itll stay right where we are so Bandy was the last to touch let me point out once again if if you drive in your Clemson they shoot 39 from three thats the best in the ACC ENT timeout Clemson here at the Peaks an invention idea but dont know what to do next go to inventhelpcom to get started today we have Representatives Nationwide who will explain the invential

against jamarius Burton doing some film work in preparation for this game the thing that stands out the most about Clemsons defense is their physical if you play for Brad Brown now youre going to be a mantoman guy and to take that charge is just its so important remember Clemson is not a great shot blocking team but the charge acts exactly the same as a block oh in and out everythings but the bucket Clemson on a 90 run after having gone over five minutes without a field goal first tough shot over haul 7171 this totally feels like overtime to me Chase Hunters draws the contact and scores over Nike shovandi Clemson back in front itll screen date is the best part of their offense Id run it again with Federico and see if you can get a live opportunity for him here it comes Federico sets the screen Burton blocked by Hall shot clock at 10 24 seconds remaining in regulation pitch got to go with three seconds to the lob and no Federico could not Corral it Clemson has it Pitts got to give up the foul Clemson playing keep away and now the foul is given by Blake Henson Tyson is not the guy you want to follow this is a veteran player that can really stroke the ball pit got the shot that they wanted I thought that could have been a foul clear out against the guard theres the lock threat we called for thank you Applause 30 second timeout 30 second timeout back with some big free throws from Hunter Tyson at public wreck were on a mission to make Comfort look good it starts with our best selling allday everyday pant a first of its kind technical pant thats more comfortable than jeans

Carolinas RJ Davis he has had a quiet second half but nonetheless Tim its just oh by the way another DoubleDouble 13 points 10 rebounds for the man at the line the beautiful thing is you watch your captain and your leader with the game on the line to be first place in the ACC alone only a graduate student from Monroe North Carolina quiets the Oakland Zoo Applause this makes it a two possession game if he makes this one the Tigers are in the drivers seat something to the rim and now foul Applause Burton now they go so bandy for three was two to play he makes it block stops with nine tenths of a second and they will go back and see if any time should be put back on that clock foreign first bucket of the ball game from Nike sabandi makes it 7574 Music a lot of credit for the drive and kick Piper nice recognition they were going to need a three at some point now whether its point nine or maybe a little bit more Applause the ball ball game is basically over if youre able to get to your teammate a touch it theres not enough time got to be able to somehow get a tip but I dont see any way that Applause in this situation here that Clemson is not going to be able to get the bomb up you know this might be an opportunity just roll with the money through the court right as long as you dont throw it out of bounds untouched thats the thing to do if youre in trouble if you dont have anybody open immediately just throw it to the back court and Pittsburgh wont be able to do anything about it the last time Pittsburgh beat Clemson was all the way back in January of 2014 Pittsburgh won that game 7643 Applause hes thrilling Road win here today prior to today Clemson had beaten hit nine straight Times by an average of 16 points Music being able to put length on the ball with Guillermo Diaz Graham your best Target right now at the other end is off with 11 on the clock Clemson can inbound it theres the toss its knocked by sabandi into Galloways hands and Clemson sits alone Atop The Atlantic Coast Conference Applause what a gutsy performance second half things werent going well for Clemson offensively
