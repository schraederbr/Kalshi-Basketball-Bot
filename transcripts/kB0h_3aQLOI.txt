comes into the game tonight just about set the tip off here at Young Center Louisville 6 and 12 1 six in the ACCC Blue Devils 134 42 in conference played two games in the loss column behind Red Hot North Carolina which won again last night Roger airs along with Remy Stallion and Joe Lindsay are officiating crew Roger tosses it into the air and the Blue Devils when they freshman guards and Mitchell back in the lineup along with Jeremy Roach Bowski inside there and there is Mitchell making his presence felt almost immediately something we heard a lot about Loa was was just being solid that wasnt a solid start solid is at least make the offense work take Rhythm out of the game on the offensive end with simple Defense Zone just not doing the job starting lineup you just saw for Louisville the eighth different one theyve used this season as Curtis Williams makes his first start and Brandon Huntley Hatfield is the first bucket to even the game of two Dukes done a good job of just pushing Tempo getting into things quickly not allowing defenses to get set thats going to be a great challenge for Louisville tonight Bowski is an excellent passer got it to McCain for an open look but he couldnt knock it down and thatll be a jump ball in possession will go to Louisville there is Kenny pay in second season at his album mon is 3 and 24 in conference play he inherited a very ult situation obviously far different from the one that John CH inherited at Duke Kenny trying to find something to build on trying to build some hope and bring some young players along a couple of transfers to augment the process and theres his best player Mike James with the ball and Kenny telling us before the game I five or six Mike James wouldnt even really care about the positions we would just go letting fly from the corner and theres a three ball from Curtis Williams The Freshman from Greater Detroit area I think something you look for too is house SM money body language and Louisville kind of has that the start giving up some easy opportunities early but offensively playing with confidence Trey white bumping roach along the Baseline as Whites first foul there is John shy under Shire you see how well they played at Cameron indor that one loss coming last time out against Pittsburgh but under 500 on the road and there is Mitchell and Mitchell has both Duke baskets been simple breakdowns defensively too when youre making shots on the offensive end you do you ask your guys be solid see man C Ball simple fundamentals communicate and thats been one of the challenges for Kenny pay getting these guys to talk and get connected together on both sides of the Applause floor shot clock get down toward five theres Huntley Hatfield working through a couple of Blue Devils and a look for Clark from the corner and another three ball and this is not a good threepoint shooting team but louil hit a couple early well well some might say thats why theyre open reys I mean thats Scouting Report so youre going to protect inside youre going to show help but that kick out thats worked well for Louisville so far and Philip palsky shuffled his feet and its a Duke turnover in the Blue Devils going off to a slow start against Pittsburgh doing so again theres Clark who shoots 33 from three but as a team that hasnt been a strong point for this Louisville offense but confidence early really important for Kenny Paynes team but also you have to be Ginger with how you you discuss them thats going to be Steel in the back cour yeah you see Lille has shot it better from the perimeter of Le well part of the thing is youre going to tell your guys youre going to get these looks so youve got to shoot it with confidence and thats a confident stroke I dont care if he missed it good time to shoot a three in transition The Freshman Williams who was a runner up for Mr basketball in the state of Michigan after playing at Brother Rice where were you at 99 to whatever I stopped playing to say thats a good time to shoot a three in transition how many times I got taken out of the game for doing that you would have you would have loved playing for me John because Im all about letting that thing fly heres Phil py on the business end and a great look from roach yeah that Twan game ac they have mult multiple players Tyrese brocker got much better at it but I think Jeremy roach is one of the best in the country at playing that ball screen offense he makes good decisions has good instincts Steel by McCain Caleb Foster goes strong and it wont go park comes away with it for Louisville and here come the Music Cardinals and itll be a block inside as McCain is called for the foul I mean this action is really difficult to defend and this is the the connectedness youre looking for communication you have to have communication on the ball yes but backside needs to see the action read the action take that I mean thats just too stinking easy nothing on that side of the floor nobody over that those are the things that that hurt you more than you know when offense comes easy for Duke they play with a different level of confidence they get into actions quicker that means youre going to have to defend even more actions in the half court and that wears you down you know we mentioned over the course of the season Louisville hasnt shot a lot of Threes havent shot it particularly well one thing they have done exceptionally well is get to the free throw line as Williams makes one of two were you close to saying they make a lot of them too they shoot it well they get to the line and you should want to say it then Jinx him like you did its okay so were already starting with that youre believe in an announcer Jinx how about how about the lack of an announcer Jinx with Mitchell coming back into the lineup after for missing a couple games with a knee and hes got a half dozen already well the reality is they like the match up whether its Mitchell or filipowski they like the match up theyre going to get and Williams left that one quite a bit short so First Media timeout and Louisville off to a solid start they take a onepoint lead as coaching Chang is going rck patino the year with David padet Chris Mack and now Kenny pay and over the last four seasons lville has struggled into two under pain he is 10 and 40 has caused a great deal of consternation in the city among their Lums whats the future how long can they stick with him theyre looking for theyre looking for Hope and progress Josh herd the athletic director has you know talked about trying to stack up some positive moments not going to make a decision based on one game win or lose which is a wise way to look at it is the Blue Devils get a three ball from Jared McCain to take the lead but the way colle basketball is now you have to show some progress you have to show it pretty quickly so that you dont sort of fall into the malays of feeling like youre not going to be able to turn it around yeah and a place without the history meaning a place that isnt Louisville a place that isnt UCLA as sky Clark gets another one its easier to Define what progress really is here progress is wins thats the hardest thing progress is outcome Tyrese Proctor back into the game or into the game for the first time tonight didnt start and he has an assist immediately finding Philip hsky second dunk for Kyle tonight yeah and Im saying this and you and I talked about this I played at UCLA two of the worst years in school history so so theres a lot of context behind it that I understand the challenges of building culture building a program when the reality is not what your history tells you it is Hunley Hatfield is called for the travel and heres Kennys record he knows its not good he wants to win as badly as anyone I mean this guy lost his life hes part of a national championship team here he was part of winning teams at Kentucky certainly and at Oregon as well has a great love for this place that is a really important thing Proctor on the floor hes been aggressive twice he has an assist and a bucket they need him to play at that level with this team is going to reach his potential well hes got to be a hes got to be calculated but he has to be aggressive right he has just consider the weapons and use the space that he has lley Hatfield cant finish off a really good feed from Clark tell you have Proctor and Jeremy Road this just too easy what a pass from filipowski whos an excellent passer for big man and uh pay has been positive but he is not pleased a lot of easy buckets for the blue Philip palsky finds Mitchell thats four dunks already for n yeah and that was one heck of a look away I mean his eyes took two Defenders to the right and it just opened up the paint he makes great decisions hes got poised with the basketball and thats just what makes him such a tough matchup Mike James looking to Williams heres Trey white transfer from USC pull up and the buck Trey Whites been really good since coming back from injury hes been consistent but again going back to you know you can get production as an individual but until the team starts to find it this might be another I mean till the team starts to have the discipline that you need to be solid which is what K pay talked about wanted to be solid defensively didnt need to set any records didnt need to go crazy dont need a million Force turnovers just be solid well thats been the biggest challenge because the initial action for Duke to start this game has worked the second foul on Trey white the man who was fouled is the Freshman sea Stewart from windir Florida bouncy guy shy told us this morning that they want to get him more involved and he was going to see some time tonight good cut to the free throw line early hes not a great free throw shooter has had a lot of opportunities yet its kind of like a KJ Adams right undiz kind of plays like a big slasher physical strong you know he broke Zion Williamsons program record for standing vertical leap thats pretty impressive is that like beating yours or mine right no no its not John beat Reese is 28 in John thats a I would say thats a firm grasp on the obvious my friend I was like a good athlete in high school then I realized everybody was like that McCain just picked up his second foul and Jared who last nine games just played outstanding basketball averaging 16 points per game shooting 50 from the four well you dont really become a good shooter until you seek it out I mean thats just the reality you could be a good shooter by making some shots but theres something different when you seek it out with confidence it changes the def defense it opens up opportunities for teammates even as a decoy youre creating opportunities Tyler Johnson hes into the game for Louisville and the ball go off of him freshman Guard from Brooklyn hudley atfield trying to deal with Philip palsky who just bullies his way to the rim but it rolls off and ruville has it down by five heres Johnson whos a crafty passer good creator for his teammates Hatfield cant get it to go nothing but blue jerseys around and Duke has had success here in the half court just running their stuff you know if its not the first option they progress through it then thats how you build the continuity with the Personnel on the floor Lille showing him a little Zone L shoots over the top theres Stewart with an offensive rebound fresh 20 for the Blue Applause Devils Proctor getting a piece of the paint and tyres Proctor has showed up to play tonight well hes also showing a maturity and a Poise and its something that you you cant say enough about because maturity and Poise help you maximize other guys on the floor which just makes the game that much easier for you John I love to watch him play I thought he just really you know reclassified came in early last year really young guy really got it into the season went along to deal with some injuries early this year but he just has a world of talent that ones a little bit long how about Rose through their knee appears to be just fine skying for that offensive rebound and mville cant afford to give up that many second shots as roach gets in there cant get it to go steuart fighting Huntley Hatfield Brandon pulls it away and here come the Cardinals sky Clark has been off to a good start tonight good offensive follow Hunley Hatfield with the bucket if youre able to turn the corner and at least get that secondary Defender to engage just get it on the rim give your offensive rebounders a chance to get something back Music in Scott Clark sporting a new D tonight its a different look its worked well for it hell continue on if he keeps his Pace up hes already hit a couple of Threes a good pass and the foul was called on the Freshman Tyler Johnson his first we go to the Under 12 with the Blue Devils up five the end that cant happen thats on us what happened was Duke got in a hole they fell behind N9 nothing Henson hit some shots got going early and they really couldnt handle him from that point forward I asked John at the end of shooter rout today is that as angry and as disappointed as youve been as a head coach and he said yeah and the reason was not just because they lost and not because Henson had some fun after the game but he said he felt like that that was the type of situation that he wanted the team the program as a whole to be mature enough to handle that it was a game that needed to be won with maturity and they didnt always show that now they were missing Mitchell and roach and that was tough but as the foul is called here I think on Ryan young whos into the game picked up the foul but that was what was disappointing to him and he wanted that discipline and maturity to be evident tonight yeah and I think its interesting how game start seemed to matter more now than ever because you are trying to build continuity and you want to control or dictate how the games played the game was played the way pit likes to play up and down and Duke was was chasing throughout so what you want to see is the maturity from players who can stop the momentum limit the Rhythm be disruptive by controlling the way the games played Duke was never able to figure that out Mike James turned it over number 23 Zan Payne the son of Kenny pay is into the game got his first start over the weekend against Wake Forest played 17 minutes young got trapped along the Baseline now Duke swings it to Mitchell weille much more active on defense than they have been early Proctor has has a look from three and he barries it yeah that thats the thing Duke can move the ball so well cuz they have so many weapons and when you skip P you get long close outs attack that close out somebodys going to be wide open heres pay from the corner and hit the rim twice and wouldnt go how often when you see a team somebody gets doubled if you can pass out of that double you have the advantage in the offense now the defense is scrambling and chasing and college teams dont typically scramble as well as the pros do Ryan young just working on the smaller Caleb Glenn who made it difficult for Ryan and forc the Applause Miss eightpoint game as we hit the 10minute Mark pay extra pass now xans got another look and thinks better of it Crow wanted him to let it Applause fly and along the Baseline Tyler Johnson The Freshman scoring and off the inbounds ru will forces the turnover pains on the floor and he calls a timeout thats the kind of energy that this young Center crowd some coming to their feet now and whats been a difficult two years for Louisville but thats the kind of energy and effort they want to see and theyre still in it down by Music six you and auto owners help make it possible its the best thing thats ever happened to me excuse me third best thing Auto Owners offers disc accounts for Life home car and business insurance because the more you protect the more you should save thats simple human sense who says you cant go for bold without going broke get the brands you want the prices you want whenever you want TJ Maxx where you can always afford to be you to the ma blil fighting scratching clawing thats what you want to see because you mentioned it one of the breaks that it feels like the Blue Devils have a much bigger lead thats just thats a lazy inbounds pass and zamp made him pay for it look these are the type of plays when you want to Rally a fan base theres still a good crowd here everyone that talks like the skys falling here but its a good crowd here and and you do have to show progress but you also have to show consideration for the game and playing your tail off is a big piece of that no I still think he should have shot that three so do I sky Clark working on Proctor working the screen from Glenn Clark oh did everything but go in I mean between Mitchell and filipowski I dont know how he got it off filipowski misses Jaylen Blake ISS into the game tried to bat it off the backb and got a foul for his trouble its his first so youre talking about maturity and what you want to see from duke if if youre John shy get into your stuff get into your action right dont get complacent because complacency is how you get beat and and it it doesnt matter who it is if you think you cant lose to Louisville if you dont have your head on straight you can they have had all the success in the world when they got into twoman action theyve had all the success in the world against the half court Zone just be patient mature and Tyler Johnson sort of got muscled and stepped on the Baseline itll be a turnover for the Cardinals also like when teams with so many weapons explore five or six different actions or maybe four different counters for one action explore things and develop some continuity that Music way Proctor again Tyrese Proctor off to a terrific start he has come off the bench and he has nine sometimes the answer is simple see man see ball just lost sight of your man and brocka gets an open three Music Applause lley Hatfield tries to give Clark the screen Brock and Philip hsky both knocked it Loose Johnson collects him but now the BL Devils have it and Johnson will make matters worse but getting called for the foul thats his second you know the more you watch basketball and I I dont care any level but it it is certainly kind of trick down to the college level its more about read and react its more about instincts than anything else a lot of the sets you see get you into a situation where youre going to have to read and react right you make a play this is how they cover it heres your counter make the adjustment and play thats something I think Duke could do very well but Proctor found his man in the corner and Rach knocked it down this Blue Devil team among the best in the country and assist to turnover ratio not great in that category G sandre exceptional so far tonight at nine assists only three turnovers Clark misses Philipi got shoved in the back no call and Huntley Hatfields there to put it back dke can be good in that department because of the space they have particularly when you have a good passer like Kyle filipowski around the Music perimeter CLK got the roach that time kept him from shooting they cant keep Proctor from going that was no good but Philip palowsky would Chase it down I think Skip passes and flare screens are some of the tougher things to cover in the game today the way youre trying to take away the three and take away the paint filipowski particularly strong in yes like that skips Proctor in the lane hell go to the free throw line foul is called on Caleb Glenn The Freshman from right here in Louisville how about Tyrese Proctor making his presence felt well theyve created a good Rhythm on the offensive end with their ball ball movement and their trust in one another when they play this way this is where you start to see the real potential of this Duke team just has to be weed on the other end used but under sold the word continuity getting Mark Mitchell back is just another Weapon Its balance its depth but again continuity you want to understand how to play with one another understand each each others skill sets and abilities and when you can start to play off one another actually not play off of but play for one another thats where you start to see the potential come together and I think so far today if they can put together their their the weapons they have on offense with toughness on the defensive end this is a final four caliber team Mitchell after missing time with knee injury Proctor coming off the bench tonight Duke shooting 52 of the team largely thanks to those two guys as Proctor is our first man into double figures tonight Proctor has a look his face tells me theres something there theres confidence theres conviction which means he he doesnt sweat coming off the bench hes going to play his thing and do his play his game do his thing either way product of the NBA Global Academy in Australia Jaylen Blakes working on Mike James James gets the better of it the foul is going to be on Blakes more mens basketball coming up next right here on the ACC Network go to blackburg house Seth Greenberg built Boston College in Virginia Tech Hoke hokei Hoke High theyve lost just one time home this season that is coming up as soon as we are finished here in the Ville does he make you say that every time you do a Virginia Tech read uh I just do it out the goodness of my heart or one less thing you have to hear about on Saturday well be at Arkansas by the way for Kentucky and Arkansas are you inviting me is that if youd like to come always Jeremy roach knocks down the three and roach come back and picture form his second thats their largest lead of the game 14 points I love when they get to that twoman game with Philip Pas and roach and just clear the side youre going to score with either one of them James maybe Rush that shot a little bit air ball goes out of bounds and Duke can build on his lead I mean if you have this kind of space I mean what are you going to do the other thing thats coming is a skip to the corner so youve got skip to the corner you got a match up you like with Kyle filipowski and that thats the idea is create actions that give you options and just know what those options are and be instinctual enough to get to them quickly theres another skip Fosters back into the game you know it was about this point a little bit earlier in the first half against wake four Saturday that wake went on a threepoint shooting barrage louisvil was in the game at the moment and sort of wilted under an avalanche of Threes Duke has done it with dunon by compliment of Threes theyre up by 16 now heres Williams hit one early and cant get it to go and here comes roach and Jeremy will go to the free throw line hes grabbing at that ankle but is on Mike James its his first the other thing is you cant say enough about making baskets early when you make baskets early you get your defense set you rarely get beat in transition but but rebounds and run outs its a whole other challenge for a defense thats still trying to figure things out theyre still trying to figure one another out they learn how to win you know something something interesting is sh was talking today about handling the you know es and flows of a season with maturity Y and this game tonight after you you know were kind of frustrated as a team with the loss to Pittsburgh on Saturday he was talking to the team about you know you dont have to come out and expect that youre going to Blitz them you know 14 to nothing out of the gate just play the second play the possessions and and play discipline and and let the lead grow as you played your standard and thats sort of how the first half has played out right now it has they have been patient about it if you continue its like body blows in B in in boxing right body blows to me on the basketball floor are long skips and long Closeouts if you can force long close out that to me is a body blow where youre going to wear down an opponent whos constantly chasing the play who never really has the advantage on the defensive end and is playing a constant scramble thats your most vulnerable Point as a defense so if you think about those body blows Dukes been able to do that to start the game theyve been consistent with with it and now theyre starting to expand upon it you know theyre um theyre taking Jeremy roach back toward the locker room he would mentioned he grabbed that ankle after after that last foul and we going to go have a look at it we getting late in the first half foul was called on Jared McCain thats his third heres the roach Drive hes had a knee problem that has kept him out this time what at least what he grabbed yeah uh was his ankle his right ankle landed on the foot on the way down and hopefully theyre just going back to retap that Music E White fires from the corner its no good stewart back into the game that was a really can push the lead to 20 that was a really underestimated contain and contest from Kyle filipowski in space if he could do that defensively without fouling thats remarkable another skip pass and the extra one H McCain in the corner he couldnt get it to go and now James on the Run takes prer to the bucket and steart blocks with that vertical Le but its a go 10 I dont know about you Id probably do it just to let you know that I could theres theres something about it its like when a guy shoots a shot after the whistle and they just swipe it off the backboard from above the square Im sorry that still impresses me or intimidates me either one both Dono yanovich is into the game number 13 for Music Louisville Maine as his pocket picked by Johnson from behind James almost stepped out of bounds on the sideline heres a strong move from The Freshman Johnson capitalize on numbers if you get to the paint watch what the defense does if you have the Poise to get the ball to the paint keep your head up good things are going to happen I never had that boys with the ball to be honest youve seen Louisville fight back in big depths since they did it in Chapel Hill couple of weeks ago got down big got back within five in the second half for the Tar Heels pulled away Philip palsky cant find the Music range and Louisville TR to go on a mini run here James lines up a three and there it is a quick seven nothing spurt the Cardinals and John sh takes the time out there there are corrective issues that you need to address on the defensive end and it cant be that if you dont score on one end you fall apart defensively good job for Louisville fight been fighting on the defensive end attacking off the bounce playing with confidence I said house money youve got to play with that conviction so far L they fight to stay in this game good to see Jeremy roach has returned to the Duke hun tyres Proctor and rhs have combined to score the last 17 points for the blue Devils the only thing thats gone wrong for Proctor tonight is most recent foul was changed and given to him rather than Jared McCain and even that worked out would have been McCains third and only the first Proctor but those two guys had played exceptional basketball and you see the leadership from the sophomore from Australia talking to youngster Shawn Stewart whos played well early on but you mentioned uh John maybe a little complacency after Duke built that 18point lead maybe it was a little easy for a while and Louisville to its credit answered with a seven nothing run theyve gotten good shots but they havent had good rhythm in their shots almost as if the open looks came too easy they got to move it a little bit create a good Rhythm and start to build something again here to close out the first half and theres Mitchell strong and one they basically went blocker blocker right there they had two guys on the Block throw it inside to one you got the advantage on both blocks and just go to work no help really no Dig Down thats just going to be too easy for Mark Mitchell Dono yanovich the Miami transfer final four team last year transferred to Louisville this year didnt play took the red shirt last year Miami continuing his career here overpowered by Mitchell and the leads back to 14 how was the last time you said that took the red shirt fought the NCA fought the NCA and got eligibility thats what they did Hy Hatfield I think Philip palsky caught one in the kisser Hunley Hatfield now with eight this is what I want to see what Duke does I mean where do you get to what you like that thats yeah thats a good shot hard to say no to that I just feel they can get whatever they want I I really do I feel like their actions are tough to defend the way theyre being defended slip screens have been there good passing long Closeouts but ifv pal is going to pick a PO and hit open shots like that good luck I think he was a little annoyed by the last defensive trip Bowski the three the rebound you know 7f footer will bring it into the front Court himself surprised Mitchell a little there is a what a skip pass Proctor couldnt get it to go how about Philip palowski now saves it to Mitchell strong to the basket and Mark will go to the free throw line theres a reason in our meeting with Kenny P concerned about Skip P you just see it and part of it is its their ability and their discipline and space in if you maintain spacing any sort of Ball action towards help Defenders is going to suck them in that long skip leads to a long close out which is your your immediate Advantage John that foul was on Tyler Johnson thats his third hell go to the bench sky Clark returns Curtis Williams The Freshman who got his first start tonight for the Cardinal also returns its hard to avoid fouling if youre chasing the play defensively youre just youre a step behind youre chasing youre out of position and its often secondary Defenders that pick him up what a return for Mark Mitchell tonight double figures in the first half already as duke has a 16point lead Mitchell has a dozen Music Proctor almost gets a steel Louisville will maintain possession 16 on the shot CL those are things you look to build on to defensively just fighting through screens right just having a sense of urgency defensively to avoid getting screen and take yourself out of the play proor fights through it gets a hand in the in the passing L Mitchell and roach who missed that L to Pittsburgh if combined for 22 points in the first half sky Clark finds a little room Clark now has Music Applause eight Caleb Foster pretty quiet first half gets his own Miss now roach lines up long one thats no good hes grimacing a Applause bit far finds a little room Huntley has knocks down the midrange jumer itll be interesting to see I mean roach is definitely Grim grimacing a bit on that ankle likely got ret taped hes back in the game but skot Clark didnt waste any time and just attacked him thats what youve got to do unley Fields really playing his best ball highly regarded recruit started his career Tennessee slow by an injury last year been coming into his own over his last nine games averaging over 14 points and about eight boards and hes on track for that tonight Brock are working on pry white I mean ill advised pass Here Comes sky Clark who kind of stumbled in there and I think hes going to get bailed out with a foul being called on Jeremy Music roach line 55k shoot for Music one yeah Proctor just got in trouble down there and was looking for help anywhere he could find it now Clark misses the front end of the 1 and one a 78 free throw shooter and were headed toward the last half minute of the first half first half controlled by the Blue Devils but Louisville not out of it theyve continued to fight back showing some grit down by a dozen see if they can get a stop here filipowski misses off the front of the rim and styles had a little bit of an up and down shooting night and Louisville can get the last Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music shot filipowski switches Clark goes by him and Sky will go to the free throw line with three seconds remaining in the first half his first foul Mark Mitchell called for the foul thats his first line for the cars number 55 H shoot Music Music two these guys missed a couple now weve got a great womens basketball double dip for you Thursday night here on the ACC Network starts at 6 Eastern fla State ranked 23rd in the country taking on Duke then at 8 Miami against 20th ranked North Carolina both games also available on the ESPN app Clark finds his customary range gets one its an 11point lead as duke will try to get a shot off long pass in and instead Clark will he it from half cour and its a little bit wide left little bit of a sloppy end of this first half but the Cardinals have scratched and Claw and stayed in it sky Clark leading McCain Caleb Foster Jerry roach Kyle filipowski and Mark Mitchell the same five that started for Duke for Louisville Trey White Mike James Brandon Huntley Hatfield who had a very good first half Curtis Williams out there along with skot Clark okay misses a scramble and Road comes up with it is first shot of the second half hes no good Huntley Hatfield and a strong first half scoring 10 points gets his sixth rebound of the night quiet inside to Huntly at field White open for three Im surprised with Jeremy Ro clearly struggling on that ankle why sky Clark doesnt try to get him in space and make him defend waiting at the scores table right now is Tyrese proor had a very good first half for Duke and see if hes going to get rachu is certainly favoring that ankle as he comes back on defense foul is going to be on Caleb Foster for the bush I think youre right and Proctor in roach out Roach obviously frustrated well he was really playing well Jeremy Captain fouryear starter for the Blue Devils will go to the bench Clark finds wide open try it again from the cor and this time hes got it Trey white something about that inside out action where youre stepping into the shot your shoulders are squared it becomes a higher percentage shot I also think theres better rhythm in that shot only white second field goal of the night came in averaging 13 and a half points per game Bowski kicks it off his foot but he I think he got pushed foul is going to be called on Brandon Huntley headfield its just good stuff I mean that that kick out kind of like a skip pass youre Square youre stepping into it which means you see the basket and the ball coming its an in Rhythm shot it becomes a higher percentage three WIIL hit five of 12 from behind the arc showed you a graphic earlier in the game theyve shot it better better over the last four or five games of course of the Season havent taken or made that many threes and the percentage not that great Philip hsky wipes away the shot of Curtis Williams and here comes Kyle leading the break himself Little Euro and lets see Roger SS will talk it over with Joe Lindsay and theyll call the offensive foul its like no you make the call you do it you do it feel like this a good opportunity this is where you get these calls nowadays youre not going to get this if he takes off to shoot the shot because we we we did the best thing possible which was help eliminate the block charge on plays at The Rim youre seeing more athletic plays at The Rim which I love but you can still earn that Im going to tell you theyre more apt to call that because of what they took away at The Rim theres white scoring his second straight bucket by the way be remiss we didnt mention that was a really good defensive play by Mike James to draw that foul and Louisville has closed within six whites hit a couple of buckets here part of starting this second half its gone the way of Louisville come out created a good Rhythm been strong on the defensive end then offensively good ball movement good patience capitalizing on a Duke team that has really struggled to score the basketball Rees over the last 5 minutes well last Point came at the 245 Mark of the first half were at 1745 now 5 minutes with without a point started off hot made just eight their last 26 shots from the floor as Philip palsky and Mitchell talk it over Jeremy roach started the second half after turning that ankle late in the first half wasnt able to go so now theyre without man who many believes best point guard in the country and their closer he look a lot of time here but this is a an example of what shy was talking about about showing maturity when a team makes a run at you and its the type of thing that Louisville needs to kind of be a Cornerstone in a building block and Mark Mitchell answers as he has pretty much from the opening Tap tonight and Mark Mitchell has that Advantage he slips it they just throw it right inside but but again you youve got to have something you can build on with or without Jeremy roach on the floor and Im just looking for body language really strong tough body language Im not sure who that is on the Duke team they run the double team has hell bang it off the side of the backboard and look whos open again its C from the corner and he cant find Applause it and the foul is called on Huntley Hatfield thats his second and Jeremy roach icing that right ankle thats frustrating I can tell you as a player when when you work its not as if he just got better and showed up and started playing today no you work you rehab to get yourself back to a point where you can play at this level only to turn your ankle in the first half and here he is on the bench ice at an ankle filipowski found Mitchell inside he was fouled by sky Clark look at dejection on the face of the Duke Captain it says a lot and its tough because hes their leader hes not the most vocal guy either I always think thats a challenge I mean where does that vocal leadership come from yikes here McCain off the side of the backboard Here Comes Clark no call Proctor hits the deck open look from James how about white skying for the offensive board Here Comes James strong move inside hell go to the free throw line thats where you start to pay attention and say all right whos the aggressor we always say aggressor always wins but the reality is Louisvilles been the aggressor here to start the second half they found something theyre confident they feel as if theyve got Duke on their heels and theyve been attacking they do a good job getting to the free throw line they have all season now Mike James who is an excellent free throw shooter at 81 little ACC Network programming reminder Thursday night 10 o eastern time after our womens basketball double header nothing but net all the highlights the coverage of the womens game you can only find one place right here in the ACC Network Kelsey rigs who hosts all the shows yeah just say she she might end up on a few promos tonight too hard worker excellent Ander craft and Dukes a little rattled right now offensive foul called and the Blue Devils will have it back kind of typically speaking when you chase on one end and here you see dukee kind of setting up in another man you chase on one end you force on the other thats kind of what its been here to start the second as Lo just continues to pick him apart just a tremendous look from James to beat that double team and Huntley Hatfield puts it in hes got a dozen weve got a fivepoint game and this crowd at KFC youngon is not a full house but theyre making noise the lowski cut off on the Baseline Brock her for three and its over the top of the backboard and the Cardinals will have Applause it louville really starting to find it on the defensive end great rotation taking the pick and roll away but again starting to play for one another games not that easy when you try to do it all on your own Lille good defense good offense star to come together Duke 2015 and Kenny of course by John calip Perrys side for a number of years at Kentucky when they won that 2012 title with that great team with Anthony Davis yep I I really wonder after seeing stuff like that what have I done in my past ball I mean look at the success these guys have Applause Music had as weve mentioned Kenny Payne under a lot of heat here they can pull off a game like this it would go a long way toward alleviating some of it shot clock right at the end and cl gets the bucket its a threepoint game Duke leveled up a little bit defensively they were physical they were commun ating but again this liver team to start will be the aggressor re ball from the corner wont go and thats killer oh was lost out of bounds this was good stuff I mean good defense from duke almost I should say but really skot Clark just made a tough shot and when you allow an a lets say perceivably inferior team safe to say to be the aggressor you become extremely vulnerable particularly when Jeremy roach out yeah there some energy in the building now and theres a belief and an intensity Caleb Glenn number 10s into the game playing some aggressive defense heres Proctor driving inside is McCain and the whistle and there would be a foul called I believe theyre going to get Glenn and thats something I thought about in the first half was was his Duke really getting to the free throw line enough now part of it was they got great looks from the perimeter but sometimes that can lead to complacency youre not really building upon anything youre not really exploring every option I think if Duke can get more long Closeouts and get to the paint maybe get to the free throw line those become those body blows we talked about in the first half McCain just soft enough for just his fourth point of the night over the last n hes been averaging 16 points per game hes had 20 plus in four of his last nine takes the moment knocks it home the lead is back to five heres Jeremy roads watching his young back for counterparts trying to fight off this game aggressive louisvil team heres Williams good look to white white puts it up hudley Hatfield with the Applause follow well lowski tries to quiet the crowd Proctor will try and hes got it thats really big when when Louisville is starting to climb into this game climb back into this game almost as if theyve been in control here the second half just think Louisville offensively has been so aggressive assertive and actually playing with a little conviction on the offensive end proor up to 14 Clark gets bying finds a man in the corner its Williams he made one of those early in the first half Philip palowski almost falls out of bounds Proctor has it safely Blue Devils will get it in the front Court sky Clark doing a good job probing just getting the ball where he wants it to go now Clark and Philip palski getting a little physical as Clark giving up some size mitell got hit no call Hunley Hatfield has it here come the Applause Cardinals have Feld goes by Philip palski and theyre going to get Brandon for the offensive foul now theyre say stepped out of bounds oh yeah I beg your paron y glad thats a no call he did step out of bounds but I dont know if I i Id be claiming that was the block if I was the ball hand I dont think filipowski was S I think theres no question about that that is a break for Duke just accepting that perspective has something to do with at least yeah mitell DK you very much all right so Duke got back got quickly into an action where youve got a little pick and roll pick and pop situation to go with the basketball you make the right decisions but good spacing on the wings keeping that paint vacated from a defensive standpoint boy Mitchell has been good coming back from missing a couple of games with that knee missed only one shot tonight hes got 16 points and Blue Devils still holding them off and heres Mitchell they are too stay with the basketball just kind of roll to the basket easy stuff but just feels like John Cys got to script a little bit more with this group you mentioned continuity but but that also means guys learning how to play with instincts right see and feel things on the Fly its not something theyve been able to figure out yet Mitchell knocked it away Hunley headfield as Philip palsky was guarding him Mitchell there to help him out out heres Kyle working inside go palski a little bit of a tough night shooting the basketball is three of nine theres white driving again scoring Trey white got like to like ball screen and L Kyle phow Mark Mell communicated whether thats going to be a switch or not confusion often leads to an opportunity for the Applause offense sky Clark defending that roll man and Proctor goes right down the boulevard tyres Proctor has 16 hes really smooth with the ball it feels like he he covers a lot of ground with very few bounces too so hes efficient with the ball in his Applause hands inside 12 minutes to Music play Ty Lord Johnson The Freshman back in number four for Louisville heres White now heres James skyart driving again gives it up to Hunley Hatfield excellent ball movement and penetration from the Cardinals you got three different guys that put the ball on the deck to do something with it defense rotates they kick it out long close out sky Clark attacks makes the right decision easy done Del lowski off the pass fake he misses rebound by Mike James James wants it back wants to attack in transition bowsky there to cut him off for the moment James driving whistle and youre starting to see some frustration from the Duke bigman Kyle filipowski as hes called for that foul his second the pit game on Saturday came back and played an outstanding first half but late in that first half on this drive while picking up the foul turned his right ankle came back into the game started the second half but it was obviously not close to full speed you see its wrapped now and the Blue Devils who about 5 and A2 minutes left to go in the first half had an 18point lead has seen Louisville fight and scratch and Claw its way back in it theyre within six right now in the second half Cardinals have made five of their last seven shots from the floor while Duke has struggled mightily most notably Kyle filipowski who has only three field goals tonight Philip Housey averaging over 18 points per game yeah its dejecting not only for Jeremy roach but but for the rest of the team as well who sees a guy go through a rehab process with the knee gets himself back theres excitement he and Mark Mitchell coming back and then the ankle but at some point youve got to look at the rest of the guys on the floor and say whos going to Knuckle Up and thats what I I just havent seen yet who thats got to be Im not sure James its one of two from the three free throw lines in fivepoint Applause game Bowski using that pivot foot brilliantly in Kyle filipowski thats the way to answer thats the way an AllAmerican candidate answers well its also the way a good coach answers coming out of timeout you need to find something something you can build on but also get filipowski in the game go to your best player and go let him make a play hes just four of 12 from the floor tonight but Duke will need him down the stretch strong move inside and Mike James will go back to the free throw line when when youre assertive about where youre going to go I mean this was obvious they threw the ball right inside now I thought Kyle Philip pasy had a number of jump hooks there but he got an even easier one at some point thats going to lead to a dig down or at least help and likely a long close out with which is thats what they were able to really capitalize on early long close outs or skip passes long Closeouts and attacking off the Applause Music bouns that was Louisvilles 10th free throw attempt of the evening made just five of them now six out of 11 for a team that second in the ACC and made free throws third and free throw attempts and with Duke now at 16 fouls it might be an opportunity for lville to continue one of his strong suits and drive the basketball strong suit for the Blue Devil tonight has been the play of tyres sprocket EXA what we said though you start to help up right on the slip youve got to help over skip Pass open look for Duke another drive and another drawn foul as Tyler Johnson will go to the free throw line This is there there it is screen quick roll roll as to stay with the ball youve got to help over now skip pass over the top cuz Kyle filipowski makes good decisions and its good passer and Proctor knows its coming so hes shot ready thats a high percentage three how about on this end though just drive it yeah how we going to win drive it dri foul you move it move it if you dont have it but keep driving them Johnson shoots better than 80 from the line makes that one Philip palowski while hasnt been the highest percentage night from the FL does have four assist hes hes a terrific passer for anyone but particularly a man his size well hes got a good feel so so he understands where guys should be too and the more you play the easier that part of the game gets I always said playing the Euros were 12yearold kids playing with a 24 second shot class they learn the game probably a little bit better or at least have a better feel for the game because of that lot of high school kids dont develop that until you get to college cuz you finally start playing with shot clocks Proctor to the bucket again tyres Proctor scores again Proctor now with 21 points what a performance from The Young Australian I love when they just continue to explore options in the ball screen you got multiple guys who can slip and roll other guys getting involved space terrific look from Johnson to find Huntley Hatfield and hell go to the foul Music Applause line boy Johnson just has the feel of a point guard from Brooklyn doesnt he I was just thinking about that too because it it thats like the mindset there head down shoulder into a Defender drive Music it its probably your best opportunity offensively too but getting beat off the bounce breaks down a lot of your principles defensively unle half field makes the first more Hoops coming up next well go to blackburg Boston College Virginia Tech 900 Eastern Time Hokies have been very good at home Huntley Hatfield makes one of two you know hes just a rebound away from his fifth double double in his last 10 games hes really and he you might have heard he said a bad word frustrated by missing that last free throw but the Cardinal still in it and hes really been playing well of late Mitchell huge size advantage on Johnson and couldnt get it to go gets it back and this time Johnson will fouling it was really no chance for the sixfooter to deal with the 69 Mitchell yeah if I was Johnson I would have foued a long time ago he he did go out early in the first half in the first half with three fouls so you want to be a little careful but thats just a matchup you have to try to avoid I believe that foul John was given to Clark though it was certainly Johnson who was who got caught in that match up against Mitchell who makes the first free throw have you noticed Huntley Hatfields traps right you understand traps on shoulders yes yes Im familiar with the term just make sure you know I theres some sometimes do you think youre dealing with has it been that long john yeah well you know Im Im looking whether youre filling that suit out or not yeah well maybe in the wrong spot wrong spot this is true but his traps are remarkable I mean like there are dudes where you look at it and say wow like he dont skip leg day oh he must do a ton of shrubs every day ninepoint lead for Duke but James thought about it now hell go right to the bucket Johan Stewart got a hand on it its off the Blue Devils and Louisville will keep it with 18 on the shot CL I like that because the mindset is a big aggressive attack but if you just patient enough to let other Defenders kind of clear the property there let your offensive gu space and then attack off the bouns covering space is difficult James thought he had draw a foul showing some frustration now needs to get back and play defense as the Blue Devils have a chance to stretch the lead double figures again and its an offensive foul on Philip palsky as he tried to find the man in the corner and Kyle picks up his third if he just shot that it would have been a block but on the pass I mean I think its a great play youre in position yeah was pretty close that thats one thing Louisvilles defense have been so much better late in the first and then in the second half about getting rotations there sooner now it does mean skip passes are going to be there but some point you got to give up something that shouldnt be a layup that was xan Payne back into the game hes made a couple of hustle plays tonight Johnson cant quite get it to fall and hell go back to the free throw line this right off the bouns like I think one of the hardest things to do in college basketball bite weight while youre looking around right youre always worried about a ball screen everybody just sets ball screens especially if offense breaks down down just covering your man in space is one of the most difficult things and for louville that might be their best offensive option foul was on Caleb Foster s a little surprising we havent called his name much tonight Caleb scoreless couple of assist as Johnson makes the first free throw cuts it back to eight body language can tell you that theres just something about Duke right now they know theyre not the aggressor and it feels as if they just want to survive Music tonight Johnson has eight points for the Freshman made all four of his free throws now hes working on Foster Proctors had a brilliant night turns the corner against sky Clark and heres a Music whistle Sky Clarks going to pick up his third foul I dont I dont even care they in a way I think sometimes fouling in a possession like that is disruptive right Duke hasnt had a good Rhythm not since earlier in the first half and fouls like that theyre just annoying he had a line to the basket in a way its not a bad foul B Pals going to get a quick breather as we the 802 Mark yep next dead ball under eight well go to the media timeout give Kyle just a few more seconds here as they ready him for stretch run here in Louisville stretch run not far from church downs and Tyrese Proctor has 21 points to lead all scores just for sky Clark into his fourth foul Im surprised they didnt call a foul on the screen from Stewart thought Defender was sky Clark was right on Proctors hip tried to get over took a little hip and a little chicken wing and they they call that so often thats why when you see it its a surprise they dont call it bror misses the first free throw Clark will go to the bench for those four fouls Curtis Williams returns proor has matched hes about to get to his career Applause high Proctor missed them both go thats clear and bounce just clear and ball I mean this is where they been at their Music Applause best shot clock under 10 James finds room telling you just clear and let him put it on the deck go go beat your man cuz at some point if you cant contain the basketball if you cant win your battle defensively you become really vulnerable these fans wanted to see fight and they found some of it offensive rebound by McCain heres Proctor we head toward the seven minute Mark Proctor step back and another bucket hes got a career high 24 points in the leads back to eight something about that Rhythm dribble you just know its going in shot that one with confidence James almost lost it gets it in the corner to White Good Help by Stewart to cut off the drive along the Baseline Williams nearly lost it puts it up for three and nothing but Duke jerseys underneath see thats the one thing they cant settle for if you get a kick out three because you ran good action you beat your man you created a long close out then take the shot but but it cant be massage dribble into tough threes for Louisville to be competitive in this game a little bit of a youthful mistake here from Williams The Freshman Proctor puts people on the deck and cant get the shot to fall and is tipped up it in Mark Mitchell and somehow someway the lead is back to double figures Louisville really needs a bucket Johnson goes all the way and thats what theyve done well tonight get to the free throw line boy Furious action here Louisville just keeps fighting back and when Duke needed a Tyrese Proctor yeah that was really big we could have put two really good Clips together yeah to the Young Center crowd tyes Brock has been terrific career high in points and threes and part of it been the patience relocating get to the open spot getting those shoulders set shoulder square feet set shooting it with confidence high percentage threes and when you make a few you start to feel it a bit you get that confidence roll and then when you get to play off the bounce its just fun hes played with a great rib them and truth be told theyve needed him Jeremy roach out of the game with the ankle K philas had his struggles and yeah he has been Sensational Dukes been waiting on that look hes had to deal with some injuries this year himself but this is a highly talented dude we saw him had his best late last season and this looks a lot like that but Duke is not out of the woods the crowd has no reason to be quiet just yet as the Freshman Tyler Johnson goes to the free throw line and he makes another one I like Tyler joh I like dudes who can get places that you dont want them to be on as a Defender he can just get the ball in places it almost becomes a set if you can run something to create enough space for him to just beat his guy you you become dangerous hes in double figures with 10 now can Louisville slow down Proctor and Mark Mitchell whos back from missing a couple of games at 209 for Applause Music him Johnson almost got a hand on it think McCain might have gotten away with a little push off five on the shot clock Kowski over the top of white Kyle gets his own and white got a hand on it its probably a smart foul Sav to Sure dunk foul is called on Trey White you know that was just such a good decision good feel from Kyle filipowski he knew in that situation the way they had to help over and help up the next pass should have been the the pass for a three well it was Mark Mitchell and Mark Mitchell Dove and on the dive he took a Defender with him and then it was an ISO situation for Kyle Philipi so good recognition good feel say its a good feel play right there Philip palski going to the free throw line for the first time tonight thats a problem and he misses there it two shots there crowd Applause wanted the one and one as duke is not yet in the double bonus but the official signaled immediately after the foul he was going up for the shot he said it was a two shot foul when the foul was called The Crow believes a mistake was made and the crowd will now say ball doesnt lie dont lie all right she Applause so Louisville in the home of Muhammad Ali rope do all night do they have a fighting finishes Hunley Hatfield goes to the line hes fouled hes got a double double tonight 17 and 10 fifth time hes done that in the last 10 games I me good job I mean Phil palsky just late on the Hedge hes just there to have to stay with the basketball little pocket pass to the roller and hle Outfield just like everybody else for Louisville theyve been aggressive thats an aggressive assertive attempt at a finish one of two from the free throw line tonight now two of three theres a look I would say theres more fire on the Louisville side than there is on Duke fight and survive thats what I see one of two again as Mitchell gets a rebound sometimes when youre the favorite youre supposed to win youre coming off a game that frustrated Duke like the pit game on Saturday night and it stays close you start that mentality start trying to avoid disaster we cant lose to these guys Louisville meanwhile is gaining confidence as time goes on shot clocked inside nine filipowski to work filipowski the left hand and the follow for Kyle filipowski thats just a thats a tough ask to cover that in space cuz hes just so good with with his body creating absorbing contact getting it up on the rim and keeping his head up knowing where the balls coming off even with the struggle hes got a double double 11 and 13 Johnson maybe not his strength there now hes got to be patient to the point where he can get space in space thats where hes going to be at his best and thats also going to want to draw thats going to be what draw multiple Defenders and then start getting Duke to chase the play a little Applause Music Applause Music bit trying to dribble through the double team and is probably bailed out by forus call and the foul is on Johnson thatll be his fourth I like to see it in Applause slowmo Kenny pay might have taken that a little frustra ation on the scores Music Applause T well now Johnson who has created a lot of plays for the Cardinals cant worry about foul trouble at this point but he is now playing with four Proctor whos done everything well except two free throws tonight D gets another chance to Stewart as the offensive rebound and pro will settle things down I overuse the word Rhythm but the real is when you create a good rhythm with ball movement on the offensive end you make a higher percentage of free throws too lowski against Trey white gets in the paint and hes fouled by white and Kyle will go to the free throw line we come back for the final 352 from Louisville Cardinals down by nine three lead on Louisville this man pretty even in the second half 352 to play here ree Davis and John chrisen with you so look lets candid about this its been a rough season for Louisville a rough two years theyve got one ACC win they have played their rear ends off here tonight they have a chance give them a finish maybe win this game what do they need to do in the last 352 well first and foremost offensively attack attack attack but be coordinated in that attack Define the the the areas that you want to create an opportunities for guys like Johnson and sky Clark get them in space get others to clear maybe play backside blocker Maybe short you know for with the bigs in terms of Huntley Hatfield clear space clear the open block cuz theyve been able to win off the bounds and then defensively youve got to think about what youre willing to give up but youre not going to let Tyrese Proctor youre not going to let Kyle filipowski win this basketball game talk about what skipster may be willing to give up if Duke makes threes down the stretch so be it but youve got to risk something if youre Louisville in the defensive end Philip palski just five of 15 from the floor tonight he does have a double double he 13 rebounds and thats his first made free throw in three attempts so the lead is now 10 doesnt feel that way it doesnt the field goal drought that you saw Louisville has stayed within Striking Distance largely from the free throw line theyre approaching a 4minute field goal drought and man they use a bucket right Applause now Trey white work on Stewart hle Hatfields been really good tonight goes over Philip palowski and Stewart with those springy leg swatted it out of there and the Louisville bench ins sist and it was on the way down lets have a look yeah Im going to say that was probably all the way down what do you think first angle I said clean block that one looked like all the way down well again go back to it youve got to attack use Huntley Hatfield but if hes just going to occupy the block it actually hurts you Clark uses the window in the field goal droughts over and theyre back to within nine Hy Hatfields been good but not when hes your primary offensive player throwing it into the block Im not sure what you get out of that no defense chases they all just watch they get the rebound and run the other way but off the bouns that thats where Dukes been Applause vulnerable proud is really giving it to the officials about that last one McCain from the corner and a big shot from Jared McCain hes got eight yeah and thats what we talk about what are you what are you going to give up if youre going to put the emphasis on Proctor and Kyle Philip paly James strong to the bucket and hell go to the free throw Applause line this is a big shot for Duke I mean you got to have guys youre going to have to close out on Kyle filipowski but for Hunley Hatfield to make that just that closing from the opposite side of the floor that thats just something that you may have to live with nobody likes to accept that but you cant cover everything when case Point Duke has better Personnel theres no answer for Kyle filipowski theres not much of an answer for tyres Proctor so youre going to have to give up something that was Philip Pals fifth assist and he just picked up his fourth foul on this end as Mike James rattles at home yeah officials have done a really good job of allowing the wall up but youve got to get square and go straight up you get sideways theyre going to call foul James hits them both back within 10 now Louisvilles going to show a little pressure in the back court theyve shown this a couple time but its really not to be too disruptive its just picking Applause Music up BL Devils will be patient Kane hands it to Mitchell that was almost a dangerous Music pass hand off to McCain turns the corner McCain to the bucket he scores again hes made a couple of big ones here to hold off the Cardinals as were headed toward the twominute Mark making it three is one thing but off the bounce that type of finish that was remarkable and the turnover for Louis Proctor is going to slow it down take it easy though McCain McCain was asking for it cross court on the right side I think had he got it gotten it he would have let it fly we havent gotten to that time and score portion of the development yet lowski all the way thats a tough ask is it not cut F Kyle filipowski 30 40 ft from the basket with his ball handling skills but also his ability to Applause pass and Louisville feeling little desperate now were inside 90 seconds to play and Dukes going to come in here and hand the Cardinals in all likelihood another double digit loss but I tell you what this is youve said it several times today as weve been talking this is a results oriented Place rils won three national championships on the floor they expect to win but they can be proud of the effort tonight and there there has been some some development some growth tonight well I think you also have to accept truth in your reality which is where this program historically was what you experienced over a 5 sixe period and what youre trying to get back its not easy and I and I said this before I played at UCLA I transferred to UCLA cuz I wanted to play for a national championship we had two of the worst years of school history theres nobody more frustrated than the guys that put the Jersey on and the guys that coach those guys they give everything that theyve got they want to win more than anybody but when youre an outcome oriented you know University program its really hard for people to understand let alone value a process that builds culture that allows you to win at the historic levels that theyve won before its so much to it and the question that ends up that will have to be asked and answered by all of the Louisville Administration most notably the athletic director Josh herd are the they building in that direction is there enough progress that has been shown is there enough hope in the program this is what they have coming up many of the games on the ACC network not the highprofile game like Duke certainly there will be a highprofile game at Clemson Florida States playing much better Virginia seems to have found a little something Syracuse to Georgia Tech has a win over Duke yep so its not going to get any easier particularly when youre about to fall to 1 and seven in conference but one would think that part of that progress in Hope and foundation will require some wins yes coming down the gut of the Season how you get there thats a great question cuz I see things on the floor that Im saying you can build off of this but the hard thing is at a place like Louisville where youve won championships where you expect to compete at the highest level its a blue blood program you get it toss all that out the window in transfer portal in nil we get that but youre still a blue blood program which means the expectations are there process and success within the process just its not as Val not valued as much 44 on the shot clock if youre tuning in to see BC and Virginia Tech theyre starting on the ESPN app well be taking you to blackburg and just about a minute and I dont blame fans for wanting what they want its part of why the crowd is the way they they are when theyre good Hatfields been really active another double double tonight Music Applause Music Applause Clark hopefully atfield has it back and hell get a chance for a threepoint play he has 20 points 11 rebounds tonight the other thing is like beginning to do this you know we dont just talk to coaches we talk to human beings and people always think you have a rooting interest and the reality is we do we root for both teams you see them both as humans right you see their vulnerabilities you see what what hurts them you see how hard they they want this like right I theres nothing Kenny Payne wants more than to succeed here this is his school this is thats Im saying like theres nothing he wants to do more here than succeed and make everyone happy and get everybody excited about this program and where it could go so so its hard to see people struggle when particularly as players too like so much of how you define yourself is based on what you do as an athlete I always say my my experience at Penn State was better well why is that well we were better my basketball experience had more success tied to it were defined by what we do on the floor whether we want to accept that or not so I do I feel for for the players who are are scratching and clawing clearly theres not a day taking off theyre not chilling theyre trying to win so its I feel for but at the same time I do AC I do accept the expectations I accept the demands on programs particularly when things have become more and more of a business and thats going to be a challenging shift for a lot of Music people 361 remaining here tonight much needed win for Duke after the loss to Pittsburgh Blue Devils have a tough game coming up back in Cameron against Clemson on Saturday and a road game at Virginia Tech before the first Showdown with with ACC leading North Carolina on February 3rd Su youll be there has not been announced would be stunned if thats not the case yeah I mean look thought it was a safe assumption and would object yes strenuously the one year I got to call that game it was for radio no one was in attendance its a real kick in the Pants Co year I was still happy to call the game but I was like man would have would have been a lot better if this place was Applause loud be interesting to follow the health of Jeremy roach because it goes back to what we talked about continuity can they build to get to where they need to get really as a program by March sky Clark misses and Duke can dribble it out out Tyrese Proctor really answered the Bell tonight Proctor with 24 points four assists and a handful of really big shots when louisvil was challenging and the Blue Devils are going to go back to Durham with a 8369 win and with that that is a blue devil
