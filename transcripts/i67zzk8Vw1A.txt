700 wins John Shire in his first year as a head coach and picked up a very big win over North Carolina 48 Hours yes he did hes got to have his team turn around now and play in this environment of course Miami the same situation after knocking off Clemson and Clemson and away we go with the Blue Jays the Blue Devils second time in two games Ive done it get it out of the way early with the Blue Devils winning the opening tip and keep an eye on Derek Lively the second what an outstanding game friend he had against Carolina on Saturday coming out party 14 rebounds eight clocks Applause Musical Battle down low Mitchell cant convert loose ball to Lively and now corralled by the Kings first play of the game they went inside the Mitchell they thought they had a size Advantage turned out not to be Isaiah won the kick nor Chad ONeill if you had the first bucket of the game being an old mirror three on your bingo card youre a big winner that is his second of the season on 11 attempts what a start the starting five for the Blue Devils and again this has changed in a couple of weeks Dukes a bit of a different team Jim larenega talking to us about that today Derek Lively the second and a hold of their control the steal by us and he throws it down with authority of the nothing Miami good test for the young Devils on the road quick start for the hurricane around for both teams after their Saturday games Lively is fouled on his way to the bucket and will be heading to the line watch these quick hands of these guards are outstanding take a look defense collapses A little sloppy there by Proctor whos really stepped up and Wong gets an easy one long averaging better than 16 points per game at the line Lively 14 rebounds eight blocks in the win over Carolina on Saturday a look at the Miami Lineup an experienced team including a terrific player out of the transfer portal Nigel pack from Kansas State yeah only five foot nine but hes the Dynamo Dan you know what I loved early they ran a play for Derek Lively to get him going on that pick and roll try to capitalize on that motivation of that game on Saturday night Miami Ebola a team that really shares the ball looking for the high percentage look theyre not the biggest team in the world how about the back door cut by Jordan Miller and hell be going to the line if you havent seen Miami played this year its really a thing of beauty they do share the ball they move it side to side take a look right here Washington fake back cut look at all that space in the lane and you see how far Lively was out on the perimeter guarding uh omir so heres Miller at the line fifth year senior from Middleburg Virginia had 19 points and eight rebounds against Duke at Cameron in the loss a couple of weeks ago and theyve got four guys who can really fill it up oh theres no question and and the way they play Dan you pick a different goto guy every night well to start for the Hurricanes up six less than two minutes in Proctor the 18 year old from Australia doing a lot of the ball handling Jeremy roach playing more off the ball in recent games and has scored 41 points in his last two games phillipowski misses recruit Mitchell misses the follow it stays with Duke theyre trying to get that ball side to side spread this defense out Applause and Proctor to inbound it boy nice split of the double team there by roach but a little strong off the glass Applause good Pace at the beginning of this one for three 101 Miami Applause why do dermatologists worldwide recommend La Roche young team on the road and theyve been punched in the mouth here early tonight by the hurricane and they have to respond theres no question the key on the road and the ACC is just go toetotoe the first five to ten minutes and theyve got to respond right now quick start by the Hurricanes no subs for the Blue Devil Sean Shire just wanted to slow things down let everybody catch their breath Applause and a turnover roach travel and of course hes the one veteran guy theyve got out there hes out there with Four Freshmen around here yep and remember this Dan these starters played a lot of minutes on Saturday night 35 or more from four of them Duke beating Carolina on Saturday Miami winning on the road at Clemson what a change in midair there by omir and he comes down with a rebound hes a quick jumper too long with a clean look yeah Miami getting anything they want right now the Lebowski great look Mitchell met at the rim and count the basket I believe Doug sermons is saying count the basket now did a Miami player have his hand in the cylinder from beneath the the basket thats what he saw from his vantage point take a look right now Applause and Ill tell you this thats the fourth time that Duke has gone off youve got to go up with Force against this team theyve got a size Advantage theyve got to play to their strength Dukes got two seven Footers on the floor and phillipowski and a lively omear the fiveman from Miami is just six seven Poplar and down with the rebound Lively we say omir is just six seven but physical great energy Sun Belt player of the year last year at Arkansas State Lively and now Duke seems to its have found its footing a little bit the last couple of times down the floor and theyve got to take advantage of lively and philipowski at The Rim you can get Lively on the run and pick and rolls and I would play philipowski in roach twoman basketball I think thats going to be their strength as the end of the season plays out longer great look Miller short on the three and Duke ball as roach brings it over Jacob Granderson has checked into the game now for the Blue Devils Applause see right now Dan its its got to be row and they got to just call the second timeout wow so long timeouts used in the first four minutes and 15 seconds by the Blue Devils big minutes Saturday against Carolina and a big test Miami has come out on fire here tonight heart pounding design the hurricanes have an eightpoint lead over Duke and prior to every practice at Miami the 10 commitments to Miami basketball are laid out on the Baseline and I asked coach laronega which one is the most important tonight against Duke and he quickly said would you ask the Lord which of the Ten Commandments is the most important in other words they are all important but he did emphasize the need to rebound against Duke so were going to take a look at commitment number five we will block out rebound and run Miami is 150 when they out rebound opponents last match up against Duke friend they were out rebounded by six coach was not happy with that how would you evaluate the rebounding efforts yeah its 44 its still early Dre but I love the idea that he has those commitments down because you see him every day and it becomes brainwashing and Duke a terrific rebounding team especially at the offensive end and theres some evidence right there a couple of Taps by Kyle phillipowski but he couldnt knock it home no its like the fifth or sixth basket theyve missed inside but you have to play through Kyle in the post I like the idea coming out of that timeout watch this offense they they face the floor beautifully omir got it back or just great hustle to run it down yep second quick jump rebound for him and Derek Lively cant let that happen Isaiah Wong and the follow by Miller holy cow this right now is a toughness issue for Duke and theyve got to figure it out it happens back to 10 for the hurricane and they had might be on the lob and they missed them Proctor hounded by Nigel pack Lively a three two strong and Poplar wraps up the rebound Jordan Miller who flushed it at the other end last time down in my mind friend as underrated the player as there is in this conference hes going to be a pro absolutely you know hes going to be an NBA small forward or two guard watch this kid the former First Team all Big 12 players with Kansas State last year yeah I got a chance to watch him a lot now right now Dan I still think youve got to play through the roll post they have a size Advantage but they have to play with more strength and toughness throw it in thats it Miller these two met up in Durham a couple of weeks ago and each managed to score a lot on the other filipowskis got the size Millers got the speed in the in the weakness exactly the first play for each team was to Miller or philipowski and I would go to Kyle as much as I could turns the corner pulls up at the elbow and buries it Music talked to us about William poppler and shoot around today a guy who didnt really start playing basketball until the sophomore year of high school was a baseball player tremendously talented all kinds of upside he may be a breakout candidate next year a round and out for Granderson oh and I liked the way he describes him its like hes going to be here next year you know and I like that and omir travels to turn it back over to Duke okay lets go back we talked about Lively being open on that pick and roll take a while but watch right here now this is this is Miami and look at the spacing and driving this is going to be fun to watch these guys subs for both sides Anthony Walker a fourth year Junior if you will from Baltimore has come to the game as has Bensley Joseph 62 sophomore terrific Defender hes on Proctor Ryan young with the ball for Duke the grad transfer from Northwestern Jalen Blakes is in the game as well again wearing the Batman mask because of the broken nose second turnover for Proctor and thats not a good sign because he has really started to mature as a combo point guard with Roach boy roach ran just went to the bench and hes getting ready to check back in again barely sitting the weights runs it down we should mention no Tariq Whitehead again tonight for Duke still working his way back from that leg injury loose ball long on the deck Proctor as well how about that Proctor throwing it through the legs to a teammate thats in the cylinder basket interference says Doug shouse filipowski saying he never touched it I cant review it at this point in the game now the bright side is I like that Duke is starting to attack the basket did he touch it he says he did it but the basket is waved off youll get a pretty good look right here oh I dont know I dont know well this was Frans first time seeing Duke in person this season did a lot of work heading into this game and Fran youve got some things that you think Duke can and needs to do better to keep getting better this season yeah shrink to play but Dan they run a lot of stuff they dont run anything great yet but if you shrink it then you play through filipowski outside uh inside roach on the outside pick and roll them and I think those are the two best offensive options and then what does copilots mean copilots means youve got roach youve got Proctor they play off each other they take God they take they can take care of the ball together youve got to get Derek Lively involved in the offense Hal off to dunkers spot lob plays and then this guy this is how youre going to fix fix that rotation is getting the reef wife and head back soon well give them a great option Off the Bench it looks like they have settled on a starting five right now but theyd love to get 20 to 25 minutes a night from a guy whos got an unbelievable amount of time no question he can give you a third score no doubt about a little zone now how about that yep and Walker just kind of pushed it up on the rim but it wouldnt go down it is a 10point lead for Miami Duke has already had five offensive rebounds in the game but they have zero second chance and I think theyre going to start to finish I like their activity at The Rim theyve also got five turnovers which is a major problem Walker and knocked Away by philipowski and back come the Blue Devils Applause roach off the back of the iron off his leg and now Miami ball a little ragged here this is Harlan Beverly fourth year player from Detroit Applause some good options Off the Bench for Jim larenega Joseph Beverly Walker yeah this guy Bensley Joseph he went toetotoe with tilapowski in prep school They Know Each Other Well AJ Casey a freshman from Chicago into the game as well so Miamis already gone nine deep look at the range here I mean there is no such thing as 2D for Nigel pack coming up next a great game out of the Big 12 we will take you to Lawrence itll be Jalen Wilson number nine Kansas hosting Marcus Carr and number five Texas in a big time Big 12 matchup between two of the top teams in the conference and in the country and you know Marcus Carwell as I do the young man from Toronto is having a fabulous year for the longhorn it should be a great one theyll meet again on the last weekend of the regular season down in Austin 23 zone now by the Blue Devils hes so good he is hes such a good player in so many different ways Jordan Miller the kind of guy you know he can have like a 1477 night on you he can beat you a lot of different ways so Im going to say this again where is Kyle philipowski in this offense right now Ryan Young banging with omir Mitchell gets back to loose ball Blakes is wide open and now well it did belong to Miami but not for long boy its like a bar of soap out there right now yeah it has a lot of 50 50 balls out there no question about it look at this we need a little we need a little music yeah but youre right the size of Advantage is for filipowski with whoevers guarding him I believe so yeah and and that has happened some some this year Miller turns it over boy nobody nobody can control the basketball right now Applause philipowski for three there you go yep Id love to see a lot of twoman basketball Proctor and Kyle roach and Kyle filipowski you know the play down the stretch that won that game was that side picking role that free Jeremy roach at The Rim put him up four against Carolina and Dukes staying in the zone yep Applause Miller in and out phillipowski the rebound Ill tell you John Shire is doing a lot of walking a lot of pacing and he cant like how loose theyve been with the ball thats seven turnovers omir everything but the Finish oh hell want that one back Applause Mitchell good defense by omir and its out of bounds to Miami I love Mark Mitchells energy his enthusiasm hes a slasher but I do believe hes got to look inside first before he puts that ball on the floor in traffic and Im not being critical Dan Im seeing it from a coachs eyes you know if youre a Duke fan you know the two best scorers are roach and philipowski Applause back and Wong in the backcourt for Miami one of the best back courts in the country I would think to experienced guys who can each put up big numbers I love the way theyve played together this year no question they are a fun team to watch the way those guards move the ball an elite eight team a year ago and of course pack listen a part of that Scoops it up that was a pass and Miller will finish and I think we you know somebody lost a shoe Nigel pack lost a shoe so theyll blow the whistle to allow him to put that back on and thatll mean the under eight time out as well Miami up 11 the book on Kyle filipowski when do we come back health insurance commercial take one watch the mobility on the perimeter can drive to the basket and finish hes got a low post presence weve seen it early today because hes got six rebounds wants to spin inside and then of course weve already seen him knock down to three but hell pick and pop right here with Tyrese Proctor and Dan Ive said it and I think that hes got to maintain that aggressiveness get involved in this offense make sure that they get a chance to play through Mount philipowski inside hes got five points and six rebounds in this game tonight a guy who John shires he told us earlier today he kicked him out of practice once in the preseason did not quite see that extra effort that nasty that we have seen throughout the regular season from Philadelphia but he has certainly developed into one of the best freshmen in the nation yes he has and you see right here roach and philipowski trying to play twoman basketball John Shire Also may be looking for a combination that will click Jaden shoot the Freshman from Yorkville Illinois is into the game plays sparingly as we get a foul call going against the Blue Devils right now and John Shire may be looking for shoot to knock down a three or two and try to spark them offensively oh that thats his game theres no question about it freshman from Yorkville hasnt played a ton of minutes but he can light it up that was the reputation in high school Dan you cant have nine turnovers in the first 12 minutes an expected to beat a team like Miami this is a 113 Zone but its really a traditional 23 long has it rejected by Lively Music well they tried to run a lob play there for long but Lively was waiting in the lane and they decided not to throw it at The Rim into Miller off to omir its its counts the two officials were looking at each other and the signal from Doug sermons it counts and a foul this kid is six foot seven tall but hes six foot seven wide as well take a look at what he does in traffic theres the back cut the dish and watch him absorb contact and finish inside lets bring Andre yeah Dan I talked to Jordan Miller right after shoot around and he said in the first match up against Duke he said we didnt finish plays they have so many shot blockers in so much size it was our first time seeing it he said we should be able to finish and make plays in the paint better tonight against Duke we just saw it absolutely we have seen a lot of evidence of that omearas six seven 250 and has 10 double doubles on the season roach from the corner short on the three filipowski the rebound Applause and a good decision right there to kick it back out they got more time on the clock good job of offensive rebounding with back on and Lively spins kicks Proctor blocked Florida Applause defensive toughness by Miami this is what they are about and what a scene here in Coral Gables right now Haynes by 16 Roach Miami ball Applause the contrast in Styles is one thing the contrast and experience is evident right now take a look the kick out the block shot and Poplar you know we know hes an energy guy hes a defensive presence on the wing and I love the idea what you talked about earlier they think hes good now but they think hes going to be terrific in another year hes playing with a lot of older guys who get more looks than he does but hes got a lot of ability a corner three way too strong from Casey Duke has missed eight of its last nine but a bucket and a foul when they desperately needed it from Jeremy roach he saw the opening he got to the rim and he played with some Force right there foreign Beverly back into the game now for Miami Poplar has gone to the bench friend with his second foul when youve got guys like Beverly and Joseph coming off the bench Im not sure its that big a loss for Jim larradegan hes just standing there Dan like a professor 73 years old the coaching is done for the most part during practice and first time nominee for the Nate Smith Hall of Fame congratulations and best of luck to Jim larrenic absolutely Applause gonna play that zone with Miller at the foul line you got to bring your big guy up and not allow him to just attack easily Applause Granderson the sixth year senior into Mitchell Lively and a goaltending call count the basket Mark Mitchell gets the ball inside Dan and he double pumps you have to watch this you got the size Advantage go right at The Rim dont double pump youre a big strong guy huge come out of the zone now Joseph rejected by Lively something hes doing more and more often in recent games Mitchell no filipowski with a follow one thing you could say about Kyle filipowski hes got a lot of skill but he does have toughness and right now if youre a Duke youve just got to get this deficit manageable I want to see some more fight and toughness long has it knocked Away by Lively got it back and Miller nice cut into the lane and hes fouled thats a situation where I thought Miller was not going to be able to get a quality shot right here but watch how easy this is Dan in the middle of the Zone see Derek Livelys got to come up here once he goes up those two forwards go to the basket you cant let Miller operate at that high post area Miller in double figures already in this game the 18th consecutive game he has had 10 or more points his season High 25 against NC State pay tomorrow night and ACC double head up at seven oclock Eastern time Armando May count on the heels well take on Tyree Appleby and Wake Forest and Ned itll be Kentucky and Arkansas from rough in the second game at nine oclock Eastern should be a great night of Hoops on ESPN and streaming live on any app what a job Steve Forbes does last year alondus Williams comes in from Oklahoma and hes the ACC Player of the Year and Appleby Terry Appleby averaged about 10 points a game last year at Florida hes been just absolutely Dynamite I think wakes last three losses all have been by two points I mean the top say seven or eight teams in the league tightly bunched and thats another reason why this game is so big roach lost it the turnovers continue to play the Blue Devils and look at the burst of speed and transition long with the Finish thats 10 Duke turnovers already and this game is all about those turnovers Applause roachs trying to create a little space left it short again long in transition and fouled by Lively Isaiah Wong going to the rim strong each of his last two times down the court watch this Dan do you think Isaiah Wong is worried about the sevenfooter no way hes going at the rim and attacking Miami has been on the attack from the getgo Music at the college game day guys of course Seth and Fonz all right listen Miamis fantastic at home undefeated how about Duke shooting under 27 in the first half its incredible after the Rivalry game a young team coming here not ready to compete Seth a good example of that theyre being beaten 144 points off the offensive glass you got to validate your big wins to me I looked at this game like an NCAA Tournament game like you win the first game 36 hours later youve got to be ready to play and I am sure John Shire talked to his team about that human nature is hard to deal with Fred weve all been in that situation you get a big win you talk to them about validating it and all of a sudden somehow some let human nature takes over and Miami I agree I agree you know they had a great pep in their step today in practice these four guys probably are going to have a pep in their step soon good game we got some Marlins here left to right Jazz Chisholm obviously El Garcia Jorge Solaire and thats coach John Jay who enjoyed a nice long big league career and went to the university exactly yep theyve had great baseball Through The Years you know to get back to what Seth said when we saw my uh the Duke Blue Devils come in today they had a pepiness yes they were upbeat positive coming off the win and then its ten to one two minutes into the game yeah and the biggest thing Dan has been to turnovers they have to cut those turnovers down 10 turnovers that Miami has turned into 12 points Applause young looking inside for filipowski they cant get on the ball and another turnover number 11 committed by the Blue Devils theyre playing like the ball as a hand grenade with the pin out and they have to calm down right now again Duke defeated to Miami by two just two weeks ago with Cameron but Jim larenegas always had a lot of success against Duke he is seven and nine as the Miami head coach against Duke well theres a good reason for that brand theyve always had guards that can attack those Duke Biggs the pressure mantoman defense you think of guys like Larkin and Rodriguez Durant Scott more recently cam Augusta and they know how to play Duke had some good players most of the time too coach Elles got older players for the most part on his team and here they are in transition again Wong adjusted to midair but couldnt finish with a left hand young a touch down low and he finishes tremendously efficient player the grad transfer from Northwest yes and grandison is their best post passer all season long a good find inside for Granderson and Young Miami almost as many points in the paint as duke has overall right now and now Jordan Miller called for an illegal screen Applause as we were talking about Jim larenaga 79 against Duke as the Miami head coach the other three guys tremendously accomplished coaches with terrific programs and goes to show you how tough it is but Jim larenagan also Mike Ray at six to nine having some you know we call that modest success yeah modest success Applause Proctor all the way to the rim cant finish it I wish Mike Ray the best as he enjoys retirement in a couple months five on four omear comes up with a loose ball and is headed to the line will Kirby say it a few times today this kid is quick off his feet not once but twice and this is a good example of why length doesnt matter sometimes when you have a guy with this kind of athleticism at six foot seven the guy went to Miami prep from Nicaragua became the first player from Nicaragua to attend a D1 school on scholarship went to Miami prep went to Arkansas State put his name in the portal and kind of a natural comes back to Miami this is spending some time here the last couple of days this is a great International City he is a good player enjoy watching him yeah we asked Jim Miller naked what do you like best about coaching him and right away he big smile and he goes his personality everybody loves him 17point lead for the hurricanes Mitchell by one hesitates and hits and a chance for three I like that good job by Mark Mitchell he got to the paint came to a good two foot stop gathered himself pump faked it and then went strong watch this right here two foot stop omir leaves his feet and a good Finish By The Freshman from Kansas City Kansas guys had a couple of big scoring games 17 and 115 and another no more though for defending on the wing a guy who can play a number of positions defensively you know Dan in college his best position is really as a four man but not on this Miami team because of philipowski in Lively I think he would be hed be a Jordan Miller type for this set for excuse me for Duke hed be a Jordan Miller type for this good team back threw it too high for omir and young flying down the court and thats the first time tonight Duke has scored on two consecutive possessions and a great pass by philipowski good job by Young to run the court and Isaiah Wong Jim larenegger Miami will call timeout with 57 seconds left to the first half and dominated by the canes but its down to 12 foreign Music Dukes got four losses in a play this year all of them on the road everybody knows if winning is tougher on the road theyve lost in some tough places they are down 12 a very young team hard for young teams to learn how to thrive away from home just no question they had a chance to win the Virginia Tech game they were blown out at NC State Dan I one of the things Id like to see right here from General aronega if they do it is the two for one and in order to do that you got to put this ball up at about 42 on the clock to get that second possession back Miller two more and hes got 14 thats a professor on the sidelines right there if Miamis able to get the defensive rebounder even if Duke scores theyll get the last shot Applause boy philipowski for a big guy how about that agility yeah no question about it and theyve got to find a way to keep getting in the ball the biggest thing is post feeding him against that pressure Applause shot clock turned off closing seconds of the first half that Jim lareneggers got to be really happy with Applause five seconds Applause no way Nigel pack gets downhill omir sneaks along the Baseline and the length is overrated when you have that kind of athleticism 4026 for Miami overdue Andrea is with Jim larenega Coachella 11 forced turnovers in that first half how would you describe the defensive effort yeah I think we were very active with our hands we were swarming the ball pretty well we got off fire just a minute ago and he said a lot of things went wrong but the biggest issue is we are playing soft theyve got eight offensive rebounds theyre getting layups theyre running on us in transition he said we have to be tougher we have to compete if we want to get back into this game yeah and I think Trey the key is going to be I want to see the first five minutes for the Blue Devils and see if some paint got scraped off that locker room wall inside omir with the offensive rebound and somehow forced it up and in powerful young guy again we talk about that length of uh Duke but its not physical length just yet that guy is physical 67 and hes been playing against one of two seven Footers all night long roach into filipowski got it back lost it looks for the foul call Miami the other way pack the kick Poplar from the corner what a start for the caves again that summarizes this team remember what we said Nigel pack did not score in the first half had an easy opportunity for the layup and he passed it up Applause they bolted out of the gate quickly at the beginning Applause yeah and the carry is called there on Proctor thank you Applause eight offensive rebounds Miami turned him into 16 points Duke had nine offensive rebounds but it wasnt nearly as effective converting on them and just one for eight from three the Blue Devils not a good threepoint shooting no theyre not and youre not finishing inside because they are playing soft inside Dan I think John Shire was right I mentioned a couple times the double pumping inside you talk about a tough competitor that this guy was and this is not the team he wants to see on the floor right now coming off an emotional win over North Carolina Saturday at Cameron and they walked into a hornets nest here tonight didnt they and again this Miami team is good 94 in the league they are the ranked team they went to the elite eight last year theyve got a lot of players back from last years team Applause stolen away still loose finally the held ball the possession arrow will keep it with Duke well I like the idea that that Mark Mitchell went on the floor but Jeremy from roach Rods right here this ball is on the floor you got to go dime on this ball and and Mark Mitchell finally with a little bit of grit and I think John is you know as a former coach I want to see these Duke kids grow up and I think right now if the talent is there its a little bit more of this toughness that weve talked about foreign Applause look how open Lively is right here youve got to find him he said that in the first half Dan that pick and roll was there but youve got to have vision wrong with a baseline jumper Ill tell you that is always an automatic for a shooter because when you practice that inbounds play in practice he always shoots it so it becomes second nature 70 run to Miami to start in the second half Music this week is your chance to try inbounds play watch Isaiah Wong but when you work on this play in practice five on o the guy coming off the screen always shoots it so hes used to catching it shooting and I bet in practice even 50 he makes a eight out of 10 its a natural reaction when youre that open on that play 20 players are on the wooden award late season watch list Isaiah Wong is one of the Pyle philipowski and others flakes is into the game and now for Duke Proctors gone to the bench Mitchell were ejected by omir shot clock at six phillipowski no omir the rebound Applause Pat got the switch finds the open man in Poplar will scoop up no and off the rim Drift Away by wrong well he just wrestled it right away from Lively that that play indicates the game tonight right there then a little double clutch for natural pack and his first points of the night yeah but Ill tell you Isaiah long thats that playground play when its 10 all and you got to play to 11 because one guy wants it and Wong does this is a tough hardnosed team Applause roach slips a little bit on the drive now the kick to a wide open blade Lively the rebound hell kick it back out and roach will knock down a three just the second of a threepointer of the night nicely done yeah nicely done by Derek Lively if hes not going to dunk it kick it out look for a shooter when I watch omir play you see that screen hes been this size his whole career he knows how to play against Lane and out of bounds to Duke you know when you think about him at being six seven Dan hes been doing this his whole career you know when I remember PJ Tucker when he was in Texas guys this size know how to use their frame to push those tall skinny guys out of the way hes been doing that forever played some baseball when he was a kid and again six seven 250 the Sun Belt Conference Player of the Year and defensive player of the year a season ago whats that tell you hes a doubledouble machine even at this level Ryan young back into the game for Duke Roach and philipowski it hit him he had the right idea but it ricocheted off Miller and then hit filipowski on the way out of bounds well when you talk about toughness remember Kim laronega is from the Bronx from Parkchester so he knows a little bit about toughness take a look right there that ball its last to touch when the ball hits somebody out of bounds and it did hit phillipowski the handoff to Pat and Blakes down with it Purdue good job by Ryan young thats the second time tonight hes beat everybody down the floor the transfer from Northwestern 18point lead in Miami four and a half into the second half Amy nine and four in in the ACC due date and four back on the drive is fouled itll be on philipowski We will step aside tell you a little bit more about Jim larenago life and career in the game of basketball he has had from his playing days right up to today Music 73yearold Jim larenagers who showed you going to break he was a player coach on his freshman high school team as a 14 year old grew up loving watching Bob cousey and play for a legendary High School coach in New York City he did he played for the great Jack Curry who went over a thousand games he actually coached Kenny Smith and Kenny Anderson Jim larranega wanted to go to Boston College Bob Cousy came down to watch him he didnt have his best game he said and after the game Bob Cousy said to him hey whos number 42 on your team that happened to be Kevin Joyce who later played in the NBA and he said kid youre not good enough youre probably a division two player Jim lareniga went to Providence to play for Joe mullaney recruited by Dave gavitt and in this first game against Boston College he had 38 and then had 28 in his second game and then it was drafted by the Pistons in the sixth round of the NBA draft but but found out he didnt have a guaranteed contract it became obvious she was going to be cut at the end of training camp and he said you know what I got some opportunities maybe to get into coach he took them yeah and he hes so hes so old school he told us today that he doesnt watch a lot of basketball except for the ACC and he goes to bed watching Gunsmoke we were actually talking about baseball talking about the Marlins players being here and I said were you a Yankee fan growing up and he rhymed off almost the entire 1961 Yankees but he said I dont watch baseball now and I said what do you watch he said I watch us meet in Miami yep I watch the ACC I watch movies and if he came over to my house at 10 oclock at night I watched God I watched Gunsmoke to help me fall asleep exactly and hes not going to sleep well hes not going to go to bed early tonight because of the way his team is playing Im telling you this is a feeling when you get when your team is on fire because all the all the stuff theyre doing Dan this its practice yeah its its the classroom and thats what he is hes a professor so nor Chad omear one for ten from threepoint range on the season two for two tonight young with the layin lets go to Dre W not not trying to date myself here guys or reverse State myself but what is God it is a Wikipedia page its a its a old western TV show that us old guys Dre used to watch probably in the 60s I could I go back to the 60s not not as long as coachell but so friend would you say its as entertaining as Miamis offense has been tonight lets put it this way my the way Miamis shooting tonight I think they they would wear they would farewell more entertaining in any Western yes I I think if coachell has a choice later on tonight between watching this game or watching Gunsmoke I think hes going to watch the world watch the way that his players have performed so far tonight now he is old school right is there anything that we can show that shows how old school he is do you have a money clip I do not have a money I dont even carry cash anymore hes got a money foot Applause you know Ive known him 40 years and uh heres what you said best today at practice you youd want your son to play Oh youd send your kid to play foreign Applause you guys just mentioned the money clip from coach laronega but also earlier in the game he yelled out onto the court to AJ Casey to tuck his jersey in so still sticking to some of those old school Concepts on the court hes had a lot of success in Miami in the lead eight last year when an ACC tournament title with Shane Larkin and a bunch of great players that was a terrific team an older team a tough team some similarities to this group very much so and you know if you think of what hes done here like Mark Few at Gonzaga Scott Druid Baylor the transfer route to get guys to come here by the way it shouldnt be too hard to recruit Miami good Hustle but then Ridley stepped out of bounds well looking ahead Miamis next game they are back here with the Washington Center Saturday night hosting Louisville you can see that one on the ACC Network beginning at seven oclock Eastern time now its a 20point lead but you can tell because were right Courtside a little bit more toughness and ferociousness from duke the last couple minutes they have to kind of string some stops together now Joseph as well short finally might have gotten a piece of that one by the way Miami a week from tonight in Chapel Hill yet against Carolina point eight of a second on the shot clock this can be a catch and shoot but its got to come out of the shooters hands quickly remember the play they ran earlier here it is got it off thats execution right there I mean thats a really clean look on the same play again and Wong a little bit frustrated he didnt knock it down first sell out of the Season here in Coral Gables and are they having fun so far those big guys are open on the pick and roll but theyre not being seen and bleach fouled on a threepointer Champion by Harlan Beverly Beverly didnt love the call feeling that maybe Blake sold it a little bit broke his nose and practiced January the 17th and hes been Batman ever since this new team has not had a full Squad but maybe half the season Dan they dont have Whitehead back yet and we late getting healthy roach missed some time uh see that qlay kick out right there not a big fan of that now oftentimes theres contact up top so the call is good Nigel pack back into the game now for the Kings there are the injuries you were talking about roach missed four games Blakes playing with a broken nose Whitehead was out with a broken foot at the beginning of the year now his missed four in a row with a leg injury yep and and Tariq Whitehead can really give them some scoring on both on the perimeter and hes a power guard Miller way too strong on the three Applause time left but Dukes got a string together some stops and scores off the foot of roach fortunate to bounce the blades Id love to see those guards turn the corner and pick and roll with their head up those bigs are open on the roll right here take a look now keep your head up Blakes tried to do it himself and young over the back for the foul Applause time out on the floor with Miami leading by 18 and they honored their alltime greatest player before the game tonight player in Miami history is Rick Barry one of the greatest players in basketball history playing in civil his senior year no threepoint shot kids average better than 37 points per game War number 24 but graciously allowed it to be quote unretired this year so that Nigel pack could wear number 24 and there you can see Pax got a little uh a patch on his jersey with the Rick Barrys name and number honoring the fact that hes wearing yeah and Rick Barry is is to your point one of the greatest players to ever played the game of basketball he was Rick he was Larry Bird before Larry Bird Walker soft touch with a midrange jumper and Miamis lead is back to 20 one thing I enjoyed about Miami start to this half is they did not let up they came out of the way we were hoping that wed see Duke get after it and Miami look at this easy steal and the weighin by Beverly is Blakes Telegraph yeah and now its 22 and it looks like Blakes is coming out John Shire has sent Jaden shoot to the scores table this is the danger that were watching this is a talented young Duke team but this is the danger in college basketball of old versus Young and a very hungry tough Miami team and here they go again watch out oh Amir lost it on the way up thats got a hustle back on D rochter knocks down a three and how about a fivepoint swing just like that about the only mistake hes made tonight wow his two threes thats his career high coming into tonight in his career two threes hes made two tonight he might have been thinking about how he wanted to dunk that on the way yeah Harlan Beverly says I got you yes thats the perfect example Dan of the spacing we talked about theyve done a lot of things well tonight we havent seen the beauty of the offense but right there we have a very good offensive team 11th nationally per Ken Palm best in the ACC Applause young with a drive omir got a piece of it but hes called for the foul and more Chad OMeara the first nickel Rockwood to get a division one scholarship watch him work inside it doesnt matter that hes on their size he doesnt know hes on the side hes complaining against big guys his whole career and getting the job done and then tonights a bonus to Jerry on the top one for ten coming in hes made two threes averages about 14 and 10 hes at 15 and nine so far tonight and how about the sweet assist beautiful onehand pass made famous by Pete carrill and Prince and you know why we teach the onehand fast hand because it comes out of your hand quickly remember how in junior high yeah two hand pads no backyard cut we throw the one hand wrist pass how about 15 assists on 23 Mayfield by the way I thought that was the best possession of the night for Duke ending up in the free throws by Young with patience and ball movement and with that rebound nor Chad omir has his 11th DoubleDouble of the season puts the brakes on almost turned it over pack up top off the backboard and its Duke ball whos taking lob right there boy and Dukes just been loose with it all night long and the turnovers turning into layups at the other end beautiful basketball at Dukes expense this is a very fun team to watch Applause born you think the Blue Devils got a lane to the to the goal and Miami seals It Off Proctor no and again here they come in transition Beverly Applause long rebound out to pack great to see Beverly out there miss most of last season with that back injury oh boy oh boy stop it on a dime but couldnt knock it down he did that Saturday at Clemson perfect footwork Applause young nice extra pass and the flush for lively Applause still a 20point lead Applause ER negas calmly on the sideline trying to just settle his team down talk about well coached weve watched him during timeouts too its funny like halfway through the timeout hes got nothing else to say hes done talking to the team yeah but what I love about this guy is 90 of the coaching comes in practice and then he just watches his team execute it its like artistry another steal numbers again Applause the route is on in Coral Gables Applause Miami keeps turning them over and adding to its lead fog Allen Kevin mccullar in Kansas hosting Texas here Seth I expect Texas to deny Jalen Wilson and Grady dick that means Kevin McCullough is going to have scoring opportunities its got to be shot ready on ball reversal cannot wait for this matchup less than 30 minutes away back to you Dan Kevin thank you very much we are the same always great to watch a big time matchup from the fog and having a great NBA doubleheader coming your way on Wednesday night itll be the first place Celtics taking on the Sixers at 7 30 Eastern time and then Kyrie Irving is expected to make his debut for the Mavericks as they take on the Clippers in the night cap the second game of the doubleheader former Duke rank Carlos Boozer and two basketball playing Sons yes his sons are outstanding prospects seen him at USA basketball camps and uh youll hear from the Boozer boys before Jaden shoot thats what I guess if your name is shoot you better be able to shoot you better not be a 31 free throw shooter I know that yeah and thats what we do youd really have to change your name yes to Dean memminger oh how about if his first name was I can and hey knocks it away getting involved in both ends of the Court man wow another turnover that will be 18 turnovers on Duke tonight and how many times have we seen Miami go down at the other end and convert yeah no question but watch the ball movement here theyre going to be theyre just a poetic now to Wong was seven on the clock nice little shot fake Poplar steps in and knocks you down cant do it better now you remember what hit Jim Meyer David told us today about Poplar midrange hes murdered Lively at the other end yeah coach LaRon eggerson right now the best part of poplars game is that pullup midrange jumper when he figures out theres other ways to score look out oh man I looked at him as a Dirty Work guy Poplar with a dozen a night Wong beautiful feed and the finish for Walker theyre just so much fun to watch in the half court not this time Pursuit Miamis done a much better job in the second half two keeping Duke off the offensive line no question and watch how they grind Dukes defense out now Walker spins and lays it in with all the highlights theyve had tonight that one might be the best of them roach at the other end Purdue and he got that because they are so good at spacing the floor and playing Five out well what an outstanding performance at both ends of the course of the Hurricanes tonight Miller cradles it and the follow is there wait a minute pack hes five nine he cant believe he cant believe it either and yet another turnover Applause let him too far Music well this is watch this now youre talking about great footwork right here Anthony Walker getting it done and then I dont believe what I just saw right here take a look at this oh man you know what I like about him he didnt score in the first half Dan he never changed his expression the guys in the white and the orange are having a lot of fun tonight its a much different vibe on the other bench foul called on Joseph youve been talking about that beautiful basketball all night we have to speed it up for you Dan but at least you get an idea of how beautiful this offense can be when virtually everybody touches It On The Possession wow now up to 20 assists on 30 made field goals tonight an outstanding percentage and again this is no fluke this is a really good team A ranked team an experience team and a team that needs to be reckoned with the rest of the way in the ACC and John Shire and the Blue Devils they knew thats coming in they only beat him by two at Cameron a couple of weeks ago this Miami team is theyre legit well theyre theyre Kryptonite for a tall lanky not great shooting not great ball handling team like Duke right now because the way they play offensively a defensively is hard to guard they wont take a bad shot Music offensive foul on omir lets take a look now how Duke is doing on the road brought to you by Conrad four losses in ACC play the turnovers were I think a critical Factor take a look right here they come out on the road and you have to play clean basketball and thats not a description that I would have for this young team tonight Dukes rotation still evolving rolls still evolving a little bit where is Miami they know exactly who they are thats exactly right yep its hard you play and this is the pitfall of playing a team with so many freshmen roach the kick Blakes in the corner Granderson look at the rebound by Poplar and hes fouled by roach to take us to the under four timeout the Miami Hurricanes having fun up and down the roster up and down the bench here in front of a sold outcrowd attractions Music within 20 minutes away Marcus car number five Texas on the road at number nine Kansas bonds yeah hes got to get going in this last two games 15 points total for a guy who leads his team and scoring in 16 can now wait for this showdown back to the party in South Florida Dan it is that Kevin thank you very much we also cant wait back to the hotel maybe maybe hang around in that lobby area and watch that Kansas Texas yeah guys this crowd has been absolutely incredible and we saw Rick Barry earlier I was just asked this question Fran Im gonna pitch it to you yes between Pete Maravich and Rick Berry Music oh thats a good question I think I think I oh man I would have to say overall Rick Barry in his pro career he was just uh you know Pete Maravich is the alltime leading scorer in college he was a great NBA player but Rick Barry won an NBA title with not a lot of AllStars on that Warrior team back in the late 70s I tell you what whoever you choose the consolation prizes not bad I agree I agree and those guys did it when there was no three points think about that although Rick Barry did play with the threepoint line in the ABA 7652 Miami and by the way after Rick Barry left here they they did without basketball for 15 thats right yeah the program was shut down from the early 70s until the mid 80s Mitchell from the corner and a lively will finish you know he hasnt been spectacular tonight but Derek Lively does what he does hes done a good job on the glass who played with good energy last year Big Win around this time in Carolina then they go to Virginia lose or at home against Virginia lose by one this year get an emotional win over Carolina on Saturday but we dont want to imply that I mean Miami came out and they took the game to Duke from the opening possession of the game here today Anna and remember Miami had a tough road game at Clemson Saturday they had to get back here and get ready for this game Applause and the next game for Duke at Virginia on Saturday not an easy task well obviously Whitehead coming back will help them some they have to eliminate turnovers If you eliminate that you give yourself seven eight nine ten more field goal attempts maybe more a game Anderson has to force it up and I think a foul was called before the expiration of the shot clock and it was itll be a foul on Miamis Harlan Beverly again coming up next a big game at the fog itll be Texas and Kansas cant wait to watch that one minutes from now here on ESPN and also streaming live on the app Applause some long faces on that Duke bench right now as theyre going to drop to 177 and eight and five in ACC play so they will be two games back in the Lost column of the leaders Clemsons still on top yes at 103 pit in Virginia nine and three Miami will be 10 and for NC State wolf Packer good 94 and then Duke will be eight and five well that NC State team Kevin Keats theyre finally out from under that NCAA probation youve got turkwavian Smith DJ Burns a load inside I love watching yeah hes kind of like uh oh you know and Ill tell you what a job that Jeff cable has done to Pittsburgh tremendous tremendous job they got a kid now the kid Nelly Cummings played a Colgate and is having a historic pit career how about their step back from the corner by Joseph Granderson with a weak side rebound and coach laronega was like what are you doing yeah and were up 20s yeah there hasnt been a whole lot of that no there has not no if youre John Shire yep what are you talking about with your team when you gather them all I think poison toughness on the road and you got to show about you gotta all you got to do is show about 10 plays you know you may go over and watch the whole tape with him and that would take three hours Ive been there but maybe you just pick out 10 plays and say this cannot be us whether its a 5050 ball earlier in the game sloppy passing remember the soft drives the double pumps the talents here and the maturity on the road has got to continue to evolve would you want to play him in the ACC tournament no if theyre at their best oh no score actually flattering Duke a little bit right now Miamis led by as many as 26 Poplar oh my God the exclamation point on the knife Id say hes popular Applause and thats a travel on Christian Reeves but we got to get a look at the popular slam oh yeah take a look watch this young man from Philadelphia flying through the air now I want you to take a guess watch this might be right about this as he heads into his junior year and you know what Dan how many points is knife attack have tonight five yep does he look like hes still having fun absolutely yep doesnt he yes he does he got a lot actually Ill watch him on tape I think of him as a glue guy Defender there were 14 lead changes to the game between these two teams two weeks ago the canes LED from wire to wire tonight and theyre serenading the Blue Devils out of the building a whiteout a sellout and a good time whos had by all who support the king so why not why wouldnt that go in for eventually Joseph one more turnover and the final seconds will tick away what a performance by Miami Music Applause the ESPN rewarding performance brought to you by Capital One we could have picked a bunch of different guys nor Chad omear you talking about putting in a good days work at the office yeah no question
