when they play in twiddly Winks Stanford doesnt want to lose to Cal and Cal does not want to lose to Stanford might be a new league but its an old rivalry no question about it very unusual to be playing this game in December but going to be intense 21 is Jaylen Blakes for Stanford he was his player at Duke and now a much bigger role here with the Stanford Cardinal Renos first three of the game perfect you see right there Stanfords offense three deliberate picks with Renault until they got what they wanted he was involved in all three of those offensive actions they know to get him involved either on the roll or on the pick and pop 36 from three is Francis Maxim wo and not afraid to shoot it oiah sers rises up and dunks it 4 nothing Cal 5 nothing Stanford and call me crazy but give Renault credit for that he rotates over and takes away the layup causing the hesitation and the turnover sto yakovich Off the Mark and camon clears it for Applause Stanford now Blakes working against petritis gets the screen same play they just ran cour you see Renault on all these ball actions now theyre going to bring it over for a post entry watch the attention he attracts Rena is perfect hes got a three hes got a turnaround two and if he gets no attention theres the result oneonone he is too much to handle they got to send a second guy confidence soaring for last years most improved player in the Pack 12 St yakovich splits the defender left hand deferred maybe but the clean up is there by Marty Soko and thats good downhill action for the Bears get the ball to the rim create some mismatches and you see the offensive rebound and putback the bears with enough size to deal with with Stanford in the paint Blakes pulls up and Stanford off to a Tor start great looks great oneonone effort early on from Stanford now sto yovic doesnt use the screen and goes right at Renault slips loses his footing and out of bounds ball goes to Stanford and Dave thats the second turnover cows had attacking Ren probably not a good business decision when you get in that deep find a shooter or shoot the floater before you get all the way to Music him Blakes had a limited role at Duke last season and flourishing here for first year coach Kyle Smith Reno that is news he missed his first shot Soo high for the rebound Joshua Ola Joseph have cut off black here inside misses and Reno called for the Music foul so max Reno picks up his first foul and jovon blackshire the transfer from Grand Canyon where he helped Grand Canyon go to three straight NCA tournaments will go to the foul line not a whole lot of contact there thats a cheap one three years ago blackshire was the MVP of the wack tournament in helping Grand Canyon earn an NCA birth and he had a devastating knee injury and has found a new home here in Berkeley grew up in Oakland so hes back Music home Stanfords made four their five shots only missed one early moments good adrenaline from the Cardinal Great Looks oneonone Music breaks beautiful hesitation and you get that because your defensive big has to stay tied to Renault and you end up with the finger roll layup in the lane the Cardinal really sharp on their Applause execution H Joseph off camon runs down the rebound Stanford trying to add to their lead up 114 Blakes really pushing it Ryan agarwall in the corner and hes good boy Cal is going to have to do something to disrupt this Rhythm that Stanfords playing with it doesnt matter if its in the half court or in transition Cardinal moving the ball knocking down shots great back cut oh Joseph met at the by Reno and a jump ball cow will keep it that was two guys meeting high up there and thats a big play because that could be the second foul on the seven footer right here this is what you want to do back cut attack the rim REO doesnt commit the foul up top but definitely some contact below no call Cardinal very fortunate that wasnt his second foul another foul on the floor that foul that they just called was that they didnt call was more of a foul than the one they called him I agree with you 100 but were not wearing Stripes no were not agarwall picks up his first foul I like the aggressiveness from Cal not afraid to play The Bigs oneonone inside attacking the rim not being afraid of the sevenfooter Ola Joseph kicks it out sto yakovich goes back to him ol the Joseph spinning goes up does everything but goes in and the ball goes off Reno and I think Cal is going to keep it been all Stanford so far they barely missed and the Cardinal up for theyve both taken seven shots but Stanfords made six Cs made one Cory whats Cal got to do to get the ball in the hoop absolutely nothing theyve been playing good basketball theyve had the same kind of look Stanfords had they just got to stay the course theres no way theyre going to go 14 all game trius misses from the corner C runs it down and at the same token if Stanford finishes this game at 87 from the floor Ill buy you dinner how about that well that would be a first 87 thats your Applause goal Blakes kicks it in the corter camman is open no good and Ola Joseph gets it for the Bears CS missed their last five shots stovic finally on the board he averages almost 19 a game great body control taking it right at the sevenfooter good finesse putting it in the left Applause hand Reno didnt even look at the three cellers goes downt Rises and Soko with the block and here come the Bears stovich Rises but blocked by Blakes and Ryo on the other end what a sequence for the Cardinal a lot of great basketball right there started defensively with Cal but then Stanford making a great defensive play of their own and the big man running the court needed to be rewarded black shirt gets the Bears back in motion and Travon blackshire picks the pocket of Blakes and then Blakes comes back and blocks it what a Music recovery sers left Applause open and a foul on camon coming over the back this is the kind of effort you want when you get your pocket picked you cant give up on the plate Blake Sensational runs him down pins it to the glass and at the other end the Cardinal in attack mode but thats what coaches want accountability you make a turnover go make a Music play Jeremiah Wilkinson in for Cal number zero hes the man with the ball hes a freshman alop to ol Joseph who couldnt finish but a foul on the floor Ola Joseph goes down hard Music the good news is hes getting up Dave Cal recognized that one 31 zone right away they went right into their set and they threw this back door lob there you see the screen hes got a clear path but gets a piece of him and he goes to the floor pretty hard B was on number 10 Chisum okara former Harvard player who transferred to Stanford Music Applause Music sto yakovich misses everything and Lee Dort whos checked in 34 the ball goes off of his Applause Music hands Spencer Mahoney The Freshman who was recruited and red shirted at Washington some state for Kyle Smith last season in for the Golden Music Bears Reno against Dort the left hand floater the tip by agall no good Dort clears it Music sto yakovich over Reno with the big fella on roller skates he knew he had the mismatch great ball control beautiful move Cal down just Applause six the left again this one good Cory he is good with either hand and he talked about how much more polished his game is than last season its plays like that the smoothness the confidence when he gets the ball he knows hes Unstoppable Wilson Way Off Dort right there blocked by agall but a Applause Music whistle a smart offensive player always knows when theres a mismatch and what youre going to see is acknowledgement get the big fella on roller skates Rock them to sleep and then you raise up but at the other end no double team crab Dribble To The Middle nice little floater in the lane we talk about his touch thats one of the things thats hard when hes up there shooting that ball hes by himself so its all about the touch and the Finish Rau said he didnt have a good left hand when he got to Stanford and he really worked on it and now hes almost ambidex you know the thing about that Applause Music is wed like to welcome all of you that watch North Carolina and Georgia Tech on the ACC Network Dave Felman Cory Williams youre at hos Pavilion for an ACC thats right ACC game between Stanford and Cal it been all Stanford early led by Maxim Reno The sevenfooter Who has nine of stamfords 18 Cal has come back it is now 1811 you know you were talking about renaults left hand that comes out of necessity you play against good coaches and good programs theyre going to force you left so you remove Applause that Benny geler for three no good a fresh 20 for Applause Music Applause Stanford Blakes off one foot got it I mean believe it or not theres not a lot of pressure on a shot like that one foot fade away as the shot clock is winding down but still a tough Music shot Wilkinson a lot of contact oh theyre letting him play today Music Dave Talia turay was the trailer he gives it up hes a freshman number three Blakes again Bo Blakes has taking some difficult shots right now hes being leaned on to create things offensively oh blacker drives in draws the foul what a handle my goodness Stanford on top Stanford assistant Eric Rano who was a standout at Stanford and locally at the meno School in Meno Park Javon blackshire at the free throw line the former wack MVP tournament MVP a Grand Canyon and helped Grand Canyon and the Lopes go to the NCA tournament three times heeling now get a break and 22 Christian Tucker the senior from Chandler Arizona comes in as hot as Stanford started Cory its only a sevenpoint game and that lead is direct as a direct result of that six for seven start from the floor knocking down threes and layups Oar the Stanford transfer out to josea cers back to oara and oar draws the foul going right at the big man Spencer Mahoney either way you look at it great offense by Stanford to end up getting some free throws with the shot clock winding down but if youre Cal you want to go just straight up contest this and get the stop not commit the foul if youre Kyle Smith how long do you leave r on the bench I think right now early on if youre ahead two or three possessions thats time where you can rest your sevenfooter anything big happens and you sense a momentum shift then you come back with him but right now Stanford they need to develop offense with him out of the game the more players that join the party the better off theyll be down the stretch and in the Music season 2213 Cardinal this is the earliest by the way these two teams have ever played never played before Christmas before Wilson The Applause Freshman now Tucker Wilkinson has averaged 20 points the last four games and tries to get the heat up again Music the nice shovel pass and Tay left alone and he is clobbered and he will go to the free throw line good interior passing Cory by the Cardinal yeah the ball movement for Stanfords been extraordinary guys arent forcing anything theyre looking for their teammates once and then looking for their teammates twice theyre getting to the free throw line just by getting the Bears out of position Applause tal Tay freshman good a Sunday afternoon our ACC Network womens basketball triple header starts at noon Eastern with number 10 Notre Dame taking on Syracuse and then SMU squares off against Florida State finish up with number eight du coasting Virginia Tech at Cameron Indoor Cal so far just 47 from the field shoot 23 its going to be about mental toughness for the Bears theyre getting good looks they have to keep shooting and thats another thing they need to continue to do attack the rim Tucker great pass to Lee Dort who got fouled so Lee Dort will go to the free throw line and Tay picks up his second foul Lee Doo played at Vanderbilt prior to coming to Berkeley great interior post player not a good free throw shooter and as sure as I say that the 53 free throw shooter Cory knocks it in Dave you you jinx everybody if theyre good and you say it they miss if theyre not you say it and they make it thought I should shut up Maxim Reno back in with his nine points he makes both look pretty good there 2415 Stanford and Dave you feel like if Cal can put together a few defensive stops they can get right back in this game this crowd student section ready to explode theyve got to get some stops healer cut off by petrius Applause now oara and sto yakovich wanted him called for an offensive hook which he may have done Cory but instead they called it on stoak well thats your fielders choice on that one St yakovich kind of puts the knee out there I dont know not a lot of contact to be honest with you could have been a good no call Music healer has it swatted out by Applause Dort as I said earlier I love the presence of the cow bigs theyre not backing down theyre blocking shots theyre trying to dunk on people this is what you need a great second line defense point guard drives and send it over there to the cheerleaders Stanfords got to get a shot up three geler does no good and blackshire with the rebound Rus hits the deck and knocks it in petrius makes it 2417 beautiful move by petrius Cal having no problem getting in the lane stensons first shot way off the mark back to back stops for the Golden Bears this could be a big possession offensively Applause stovic lost the handle going up and he felt he was hacked Stenson second three on the way and that ones good well you talk about a momentum swing Cal is about to draw it closer with a monster dunk but at the other end Stanford able to Music convert St hard to the hole and lays it in I think he just lost the handle on that dunk Court I think so and you can see he had his mind made up that second trip just now hes going to the rim hes going to start to assert himself and make a Applause statement petritis Dives to the floor great hustle thats what petrius does by the way he plays at about and Cory on a personal note I will tell you that uh in 1996 the first sports center I ever did in Bristol Connecticut was with steuart Scott and I was terrified and steuart Scott a lot of people dont know what a nice person he was to younger people trying to make it in this business we were doing the open and I was terrified Corey as you could expect as you know from working with me and I said hey Stu Im a little tight man if theres anything you could do to loosen me up I really would appreciate it Reno misses everything and so as the open comes up Cory he says everybody making his maiden voyage is Dave felin Im to Scott and he goes Whoa man whats up with that afro I had a red afro it was big he goes that things kind of out of whack and it made me laugh and it loosened me up sto yakovich down the lane and it it made me relax and I realized voices would come out of my mouth and I could speak and so I always had a soft spot in my heart for Stu Scott who kind of took me under his wing for that Sports Center just a tremendous guy no question about it thousands of great stories about who he was as a person and obviously we know who he was as a professional and and you know he and also Stu Scott deserves credit for sticking with who he was right I mean he did broadcasting the way he wanted to do it and there were others that challenged him on it and he did a fantastic job so great that we are honoring Stuart Scott and his legacy and theres our old buddy right there and I know Cory a personal note with you for vwe uh from your hometown absolutely Craig Sager uh bavia alone you know obviously a lot of people know Craig and hes another one of those great people who fought valiantly against that dreaded disease and you guys wore the same number too me week is special well be right back its 2723 Stanford Music Music we are back and continuing our vwe theme Cory I know theres a certain shout out to someone very near and dear to your heart you father you want to mention yeah shout out my dad uh you know 2 and 0 versus cancer beat it twice and uh definitely the MVP of my life and just want to send a shout out to him the whole family supporting him and his fight and you know we all out there unfortunately know someone battling cancer so we know what theyre going through but its great when you get the wins you know what your dad did he raised a good kid so hes probably pretty proud well tell him that tell him that I will Reno has 11 but Stanfords Music 29 the tri is cut off Ola Joseph with nowhere to go Rises and hits one over Cam and despite the hot start were now at a two possession game the cow bears like Nova can just give it time it always works Reno with a rare Miss and if youre Maxim Renault you got to make sure you keep dropping those but right here this is a good oneonone move jab step spin in the lane but the most important part is the touch the Finesse at the end the onehanded hook C with a chance to draw even closer after a terrible start the Bears have made four of their last five shots oh the Joseph going right at Renault put him in the mix beautiful oneonone move absolutely nothing Renault could do about that one Bears within Applause four and now two thank you Cory Petrus blocked Blakes from behind cow with a chance to tie it or take the Applause Music lead goal tending and the Bears now lead Stanford count the hoop to sto yakovich I love what Im seeing out sto yakovich hes a shooter but when its time to tie the game hes not thinking about jumpers the last three or four possessions hes going to the rim making plays for Cal Sensational effort and despite that blistering start we got a whole brand new ball game right now tied to Applause Music Applause Music Applause 29 Blakes for three got it big shot for Blakes you get the inside touch Cal not respecting his jumper had to let him know a little bit right Music there St yakovich after a slow start has eight and hes just challenging everybody at The Rim well Stanfords dropping back into that two3 zone and theyre inviting Cal to play handball and search for an open shot but Cs not doing that at all they want to get to the rim Music blacker with the superb handle pulls up for three here comes agarwall and Music Stanford cammon goes Baseline Music Applause shot clocked down to five breaks with another three hes made two in a row he is feeling it huge buckets for Stanford we felt like we were at the Tipping Point Just moment ago but Blakes trying to slam the door here in the first half Blakes has 12 Stanford back up by six Applause Music black here no good camon with the Applause Applause rebound Hampford has the mismatch in the post if they can find it sellers for three a threepoint barrage two by Blakes one from Sellers and Stanford trying to get some distance absolutely nerves of Steel by Stanford Cal makes a run and the Bears answer with not one so far off to a great start in this first season great coach always about the details a great teacher of the game wants players that are willing to learn and listen puts his guys in positions to always s Brinson The Freshman weighs it in boy he is lightning quick with the ball in his hands going back to Cooper flag I did get a chance to see him up close and personal he came in against my beloved wild cats in Tucson Arizona came in our house and put his feet up on our coffee table so uh tremendous Talent his skill set on that kid is through the roof hes going to be a great NBA player so hes rude hes a rude guest agall with the offensive cleanup he started two for 11 and still finish with 24 big buckets down the stretch didnt shy away from the moment and hes had those and hell continue to get those for the rest of the season but hes not hes definitely going to be a much better player even a few months from now could be much improved sakovich defended by sers well in fact the turnover now sellers up above everybody and lays it in so yakovich trying to do a little too much in the oneonone got to respect the Zone hes had success getting to the rim but take it as it comes to you Stanford by 11 oh Dave how big were those three threes Stanford was able to knock down once this game got even completely shifted the momentum so yakovich in too much traffic thought he might have had a whistle there sellers for three Stanford lighting it up from Deep a 162 run by the card talk about a lot of coaches say they have a balanced attack but here you see Stanford they got the sevenfooter inside hitting you with the layups and now the perimeter players have gotten started four threes here in just the last few minutes Wilkinson nothing in Stanford has numbers now as Wilkinsons back five on four now theyre back to even strength and you see the difference in the two offenses Cal forcing things in the oneonone Stanford letting the ball do the work trying to find open looks agall for Music Applause three final 25 seconds of the half and sto yakovich throws it away turnovers and bad shots the last three minutes of the half have been the difference for Cal they made a nice run but they havent gotten stopped or taken care of the Basketball Stanford will go to the halftime with their largest lead they up by 14 Music Blakes with the runner and now its a 16point margin Blakes got cooking with backto back threes and there you see the floater in the lane putting the exclamation got to turn up the defense and for Stanford dont rest stay aggressive the 16point lead by the Cardinal right now their largest of the Applause Music game they go right to Rell sosco giving up a lot of hype Blakes for three Hammond with a rebound didnt realize he was wide open Kicks it out to sers and petrius with the rebound not a bad shot by sers but maybe work the ball around off that offensive rebound to tris nice pass inside and Soko couldnt finish it and good Hustle by is ptis and thats your best weapon when youve got a sevenfooter in there shoot the Applause Music Applause Music floater Ros already hit a couple threes but passes on that one and an offensive foul called on Jaylen Blakes we mentioned the high like and the hustle of Rus petrius he does all the little things get over take position keep your hands out of there does a good job of absorbing the contact may have sold it a little bit but the end result is a defensive stop for the Bears One play at a time they want to try to climb back into Music this trus for three over Reno no good but sasoko with an offensive rebound blacker now for three and he hits great sequence for the Bears they get the offensive rebound and a clean look but theyve had backto back stops and thats a great way for Coach Madisons Club to start this second half agarwall spinning and lays it in talk oneonone hes more of a perimeter shooter but hes also a solid athlete Cal with the mismatch right Music here black her shirts over right now nothing like a sevenfooter to make sure you put a little extra arc on your pullback jumper thats 59 shooting over 71 just a little over two minutes Cals been able to shave a little bit off this lead agarwall battling it and Stanford keeps it well this first bucket this is just shooting practice wide open Dead on Center but right here with the big man on roller skates hit him with the step back its a tough guard when youre the youre a sevenfooter and youre supposed to guard a lightning quick point guard like that quickest player on the floor good luck Tak a a lot of confidence to shoot that a turnover by Mahoney and sto yakovich and sto yakovich just took his eyes off the ball went right between his legs and out of Music bounds now Blakes working the twoman game with rno Reno for three and Maxim Reno from distance oh hes such a weapon he likes to set ball screen so he can pop out and right there most centers just dont have the footwork to get out there and defend the three Reno with 14 to leave Music Stanford black inside no good raino with a rebound and a foul on Stanford I mean what do you do youre kind of in no mans land you got the high low you have to stay in and with Reno youve got to be in his jersey he is too good of a shooter got to force him to drive foul was called on sellers for Stanford blacker spinning around but couldnt get it to go the tritis causing all kinds of problems for Cam and thats what its going to take for Cal that extra effort trying to squeeze as many possessions as they can out of Stanford agall all the way had two big buckets for him right there just taking the point guard all the way to the Music rim blacker made a bad pass and camman was there to steal it Music Music and Soko called for a foul reaching in on Reno so well take a break Cal better offensively but they got to stop Stanford where he led the Cardinal to four straight NCA tournaments and of course a final four appearance under former Cal coach Mike montgomer all kinds of Synergy between Cal and Applause Music Stanford Ryan agarwall will go to the free throw line came into Stanford just kind of as a set shooter and really has turned into a good Defender and rebounder didnt play much uh under Jared hospit uh is has really found a role here with Kyle Smith Applause hes had six big points here in the start of the second half that have kind of kept Cal at distance and agall with 11 now who tried this great job helping out his Fallen teammate now Tucker for three got it so Christian Tucker trying to bring the Bears back Music Applause Music knob inside the cam and beautiful pass from Reno you see coach Smith up on his feet applauding the ball movement knowing his guys are making all the right decisions sharing the ball Stanford is good doing a good job coryer protecting the Rim Yeah they havent you know theyve got a cushion so they can be a little more aggressive defensively but theyve done a good job of making sure theres a no layup rule in effect right here you see the pick and the pocket pass got his hand on the ball theyve got the mismatch well Stanford able to recover Music Applause stovic no good Lee dor tried to dunk it no good all Joseph third effort no good breakes blocked by the trailing lead Dort boy what an athlete Dort with two huge plays agall Knocks out of bound Cal will keep it I mean theres not a bigger stronger player on the floor than d right here this is what you want he doesnt convert the layup but at the other end just a denial almost hit his head on the backboard great effort a lot of times guys hang their head after a Miss shot but not dor hustles back makes a play a foul on agar wall from reaching in behind here third agal found himself being posted up by Dort Ill give you a question how many pounds do you think hes giving up in that extreme agal the D 50 he had no choice but to make the foul smart play cuz that was about to be Shaquille ONeal was referred to as barbecue chicken Stanford now in the zone communicating Music Applause a foul on Evan Stinson his first foul Stinson an interesting story they thought about red shirting him came back and played his first game in the last game against Utah Valley made his first shot finished with seven first shot was a three hes a good player and they realized they need to use him so iay on the red sht a and stensons playing this season D another offensive board cant finish but draws the Music foul fou is on Reno his second checked that on camon so Reno doesnt pick up the fou they give it to Music camon he coming up next our Clemson SMU Championship coverage continues from Charlotte with a 2hour pregame show and then well have a command center presentation of the game with four different camera angles and realtime player and stats after the game well have a complete breakdown with coach and player interviews and you can always watch on the ESPN app no better way to watch the ACC Championship Applause Music Applause Blakes inside but a reach in so Blakes draws the foul thats three on Music petritis Blakes has 14 points but this is his first trip to the free throw Applause line played about nine minutes a game Cory last year in a limited role for Duke and comes here a major factor for Stanford its just about for a lot of players the opportunity to show their skill set playing time definitely not easy to come by at Duke University always loaded year in and year out but you can see by the way he plays hes definitely hes hes a hes a nightmare Defender if hes guarding you on ball you just kind of want to get rid of the ball he just so quick and tenacious I he makes it take a tough shot petrius fouled underneath and thats just another many hustle plays by Rus petritis and Cal needs two or three more guys on that level in terms of energy because what you want is to get the single digits but you see the tenacious effort sticking his hand in there going up for the footb back he just won an extra possession for the cow Bears just off Pure Energy second foul on Applause Reno the TR just knocks it down and for Cal the formula is try to get the single digits if you can get there by the 10minute mark youre in decent shape but theyve got to do this in pieces get this lead to single digits and then try to make a Applause Applause Music Applause Music Wes tough turnaround too short dor going right at raino but got stuck under the Hop and I like that play go at Reno try to get the third foul on him they werent successful but it definitely was an aggressive approach Stenson was not ready for the ball and Reno threw it to Applause Music him Talis two R comes in and Reno is going to get a quick breather coach Madson up calling this offensive set for Cal he knows how important these possessions are still plenty of time in this game but he wants to see his team execute G has missed their last seven shots make it eight and not nine cuz Lee Dort cleans it up wow so forceful in the paint Dort making things easy on the Miss three Applause Music aara called for an offensive foul and nice defensive job by Joshua Ola Joseph last time when coach Madson is up zling but now hes had an entire time out so hes probably given him a couple different looks one for man one for Z but make no mistake about it Cal needs to make a five or sixo run right here try to set themselves up its a big play Stanford and a manto man actually theyre in a Music Zone Wilkinson the frost for three no good Stanford gets the rebound Blakes comes down with it sometimes freshmen have a mind of Their Own Music Applause Music aara inside the har transfer with a nice hoop a lot of contact on that Applause Music layup Tucker no good and an offensive foul on Cal this a point of emphasis right here youre going to see Dort set the screen and kind of roll and thats why the the young man was so wide open first foul on Lee Applause Music Music Dort Oar cut off and finds T who finishes poor communication by the Bears somebodys got to rotate over and get inside that if youre going to double big to Big the other three guys got to react to that Cory would its shock you to know that the cow Bears have two assists two yes and no I mean theyre scoring a lot on individual efforts a lot of guys taking the ball in their hand and doing their own thing but even on times like that where theyre trying to connect it just a little bit out of sink by comparison Stanford has 14 agar walls just picked up his fourth foul he has 11 points and it looks like Kyle Smith going to get him out and put in Aiden cam well the difference when you talk about assists I believe that assists flow from the big man teams that play inside out they usually have higher assist totals because the bigs attract attention and it starts the ball movement right now the leading scores for Cal are two perimeter players well Reno for Stanfords dropped in 14 Dort no good sto yakovich offensive rebound and put back sto yakovich in double figures with 10 now now he has Music 12 over and back on Blakes maybe a little momentum here for Cal it has to be and theyve got to take it however they can get it defensive stops turnovers big plays just little lack of focus is that heel hit the line and thats going to be a violation but this Zone that Stanfords been in kind of a 131 its giving Cal some trouble they dont exactly know where to attack it Music St yakovich contested three no good sers comes down with it and that three was partially blocked the D still almost came up with the ball camon with a running hook and Stanford up 6649 Music Applause oh blacker jovon blackshire with some trickery Up and Under Maxine R now he is a crafty point guard hes been making plays all night but for the Bears its starting to become about the defensive in they got to start putting together multiple stops turn over by the cardner its all about recognition when you get an opportunity to create something and there you see the blow by and the Up and Under sometimes you dont have to go over the big just go under finger roll action Music St yakovich cut off and then blocked by Reno got it back though shot clock on 12 is blacker fires and a foul on Music Stanford a camon picks up his third foul and puts Mar Soko back to the line he did a great job of just hold holding his ground and causing that defensive foul and Cal two free throws sooko is a great story why he makes it Cory I will tell you he comes from a tiny village in Molly and hes given all his niil money back to this Village he helped find a well to get clear and clean running water helped build a hospital and a school its amazing story and he goes back every summer to help them Tonga Foya is the name of the small village in mly just a tremendous young man started it while he was at Michigan State and has continued it here at Cal well you figure hes already winning at adulting right now if youre that great and youre still young his future is going to be even better most young people dont have that kind of for Music foresight great rebound by cam Music Reno puts it on the deck and gets fouled going to the hoop you played a great game says his dad is a tough critic but hes you like Paia cuz you feel maybe he kept you out of the NBA no Paia in a list of other gentlemen are the reason Im here with you today uh part of that 1996 draft that NBA draft that I believe was the best NBA draft in history pachic multiple times Allstar great player and you ran into him today at the game and he concurred with you that it was the best draft interestingly what he told me is he said he didnt know he was going to get drafted but now looking back at that draft class he does feel like it was definitely a special one tons of talent in that draft class alen ion number one overall pick did you tell him that you felt maybe he he cost you an NBA career and was there some tension no no tension at all no tension at all he wasnt in any of the draft camps like I said he didnt even think he was going to get drafted but uh that 96 draft I mean you look at that class so many superstars MVPs World Championship players Kobe Bryant Paia Steve Nash Ray Allen and interesting note Stefon Marberry Jr is on count not suited up today walk on on the team Sensational draft class I believe 23 underclassman came out that year 96 Stefon Jr Stefon his father was just an absolute what a groundbreaking type of point guard that the league hadnt seen the physicality athleticism so theyre going to take a look at this last play Cory heres what happened Music Cory so Ola Joseph may have inadvertently hit Aiden camman with an elbow and I think thats what theyre looking Music at well you have these situations where theres obviously contact then it goes to a question of intent and right here I dont know how you purposefully hit someone with an elbow when youre trying to get a rebound Id be surprised if theres anything other than incidental contact here yeah on the play it is a basketball they agreed with you Cory but thats why Im here paig is over there and Im here with you cuz this is what I do everybodys where theyre supposed to be worked out it worked Applause out bears trying to extend this pressure Stanford doing a great job of reacting to the pressure getting good shots all night they havent been rattled not a ton of turnovers Stanford AAR bumped from behind Music six team fouls so the next one Stanford will be shooting oneonone Music Blakes grabbed by Wilkinson Wilkins said Blake sold it and if he did he sold it well cuz it is a foul on the Freshman Jeremiah Wilkinson and now Blakes will go to the free throw line because Stanford is in the bonus great execution by Stanford 10 seconds to shoot they get their two best players in a twoman game and Blake smart enough to draw that foul and get to the free throw Applause Applause line Flakes with 18 points now to lead the Applause Music Cardinal Wilkinson went right out way now thats a tough move right there oneonone against the seven footer C getting downhill not afraid to attack the rim its just been on the defensive end theyve given up some big shots Reno for three and the big man is good again it is so tough when you have to leave him to help out defensively because you just cant get back to him in time and at 72 hes up there shooting that thing all by himself hes 17 points and three of four from Applause three R out backto back threes good Stanford has their largest lead and Cal takes time out and the difference between raino last year and this year hes a finisher he will drive a hes six of 18 from the field High basketball IQ plays within the game doesnt Force things Stanfords done a good job of getting to him and and he drills a three right there a nice step back might be a two a little too late though I dont think he liked what we were talking about hey Applause Music you give go and somehow sellers missed the easy layup but was fouled underneath that might be the easiest shot hes missed all day yep Rus petrius now has four Music fouls hey folks on Sunday weve got good mens basketball for you right here on the ACC Network in the ESPN app freshman Phenom Cooper flag leads number nine Duke against Chucky heer and Louisville our coverage tips at 6 Eastern you said you didnt like the way super treated your Arizona family not not especially I mean they came in played well great defense down the stretch so yakovich back toback hoops he has 17 Applause now so only one field goal off his Music average AAR bumped from behind and Chism par the Harvard transfer will go to the free throw line and shoot too you know despite what happens over the remaining minutes of this game I think both teams will go back and look at the final four minutes of the first half thats when Stanford made their run and Cal has never been able to recover from that theyve simply traded baskets for most of the second half and thats going to be the story for a lot of teams in college basketball the way the talent is spread out among the conferences if you play a bad three or four minutes of basketball thats it these teams are so competitive theres no uh David and Goliath situations in the ACC where you just know somebodys going to walk in and walk out with a win so you got to bring your aame every night makes one of two 7962 Music Stanford stovich now has his season average hes got 19 just looks so easy easy for him when he raises up to shoot that three great Music release akar inside and he draws the fou well go back to the free throw line hes an interesting story Cory Oar because he played at Harvard where that big body could do whatever he wanted but here in the Pack 12 a little under siiz has to work a little harder in the paint four minutes and while we were in the break sto yakovich is three uh was ruled a three they had called it a two now a three so its 7965 and now 8065 and stoyanovich has 20 to Max Maxim Renos 20 for Stanford Applause Music down 16 4 minutes to go what what are you trying to do here C well youre trying to get turnovers but good luck with that Stanfords done a great job handling the ball and then there you see the big fella creating the wall being a rim protector theres just no easy buckets for Cal tonight and Stanford hasnt been forced into too many bad shots and turnovers very well coached team there you see the discipline back it out run more clock just as you say that he steel see if they count that hoop by Soko go ahead count that give the big fell the and one they do count it how about the wheels and and finish ability of Monty sissoko he gets in the passing Lane there you see the Sprint out and now look at the ball handling skills the one two Euro Step actually took three steps well the ball was on his head for a while they gave him the continuation trying to sparkk this cow team here with a little over 3 minutes remaining to sooko with nine now Music blaks being pounded by blackshire but being very careful with the ball now the twoman game with Rau who stops and shoots the three a rare Miss for Applause Maxine blockers handle is just something special to try this left alone CR favorite is petritis for three and Stamford calls timeout Cal within 10 its the combination theyve been looking for defensive stop followed by a three back in a moment Music Music Applause Cal trying to make a run here theyve got it to a 10point game and heres how theyve done it penetration little vision the kick and the stick fre ball from the Corner the Bears making a run thats what theyve been waiting for all night long couple of plays to bounce their way petrius has nine that was his first three of the game well see what Kyle Smith thr about now Stanford sort of using much more clock until they found underneath and thats going to be the arrow goes to Cal possession arrow Cal hold on on Music Applause folks both teams have two timeouts left if your Cal free throws on your friend right here oh Joseph thats a three Cal is within seven a N9 nothing Cal run big three probably not the best shot but a shot they took and were able to connect AAR misses underneath and a late whistle that Mark Madson cant believe and I cant believe it either you miss a point blank layup and then its just a rebound I dont call that foul in a game like this Cal has the right to be UPS said right here the penetration SE yakovich cant find anybody dead center three ball trying to sell the foul to the ref didnt get Applause that oart of the free throw line makes it but Stanfords grateful to be at the free throw line he just misses this layup and then right there thats anybodys ball thats not a foul Im sorry time out timeout by Music Applause Music cow pal needs to score they dont have to rush but they need to do it quickly if that makes sense black here blocked by Renault black here going to the well a little one runs too often you know with the big defensive play takes two points off the board sellers the extra pass and a car missed everything but Cal almost threw it out they saved it for try to save it sto yakovich for three Bs it in STO yakovich has Applause 23 its a sixpoint game and they turn it over and the ball goes out of bounds we could we were blocked black Shir turned it over out of the Cal fortunate to save the ball and then so yakovich online banking on a Saturday thats cash and that play was made by petritis another hustle play as he dove in Music Applause with Music you have what point to your foul here Cory I think its a three two possession game you got to play this out now were inside a 15 Applause sers blocking foul and osiah cers will go to the line and shoot two such a bang bang play was he set was he in front of the circle well take a look theres the penetration hes there thats another one I dont agree with down the stretch mark mson wants a timeout and hes upset and I feel everything hes feeling right now his player was set and above the circle could have been a player control what you teach you teach your guys to get over there take the hit both feet are there its a bang bang play right and he takes a shot to the face elbow to the face on top of it Cal Bears cant believe the call looks like sellers will shoot if they say it is what it is but but man what more can you ask for the Bears a little might be a little too little too late this afternoon cow had a reason to be upset Cals last time out this is how they got back with that 20 to6 run a resilient Cal team at home tonight but that call is going to weigh large as oiah sers goes to the line and shoots two sers has 14 points hes one of two from the free throw Applause Music line to come all the way back in a situation like this what you need are two things live ball turnovers and missed free throws and thats usually just something Stanfords not going to give you and a couple breaks and that wasnt a break on that last one you need some a good whistle but more importantly you need those live ball turnovers final 35 seconds dakovic Applause flush and now they need to Applause Music Applause foul oara inside good execution by Stanford keeping the ball High and the steel Blake steals it and lays it in thats going to close things out great comeback from Cal is going to come up Applause short the Finish By sasoko but theres only 7 seconds left and a eightpoint Music lead the sellers can just run out the clock and Stanford hangs on
