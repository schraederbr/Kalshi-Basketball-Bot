officials Music Applause Music tonight and Pittsburgh able to control the opening tip Panthers again on the bubble a top four seed in the ACC tournament still on the line and Blake Hinson knocks down his first shot a triple nobodys made more threes in the ACC no one and then he comes out first play of the game is designed to get him three he knocks it down great sign for the Panthers BC loves to play through the Dutchman Quinton post heres the double team and well get a reaching foul its on Hinson as you can see here no one has taken or made more threes you got to find him and know where he is at all time the way he stretch hell shoot from the logo so you got to know where he is and get to him that time he a difficult shot over smaller Defender and hes had some monster games this season and nine threes a couple of times has had games with seven threes Carrington on the Applause drive that is way off by Zack Austin the high point transfer cell Harris pushing so a shortl start for Tia post blocked carington catch release swis we talked about jayen low what he brings you saw a Ste on the other end of the floor pushes it finds Bob Carrington for a wing for three his ability to make plays in the open court just like that is why this team is so impressive from the threepoint line claudell Harris been in a little bit of a shooting slump here is Zachary mton from the corner and dein mton pledges 10 total points the last two games but did have a stretch where he scored in double figures and six straight hes played much better in conference hey has hes taking that sophomore leap when you come in after your freshman gear of Co off season and just his ability to just to attack match ups play inside and out that time showing you his range from behind the threepoint line a lot of dribbling by feder Rico twoman game with low and Hinson Hinson draws the double kicks it out to low and that was almost a rare assist for Blake hitson he doesnt get many hes going to tell it tell low there you got knock it down when I finally pass it to you only 21 assists in 28 games all season post got great position as feder Rico fell down he did I think I thought they missed him a couple of times early the officials are letting them play inside a lot of physicality inside that time and I think Post told his guys hey you missed me the first two possessions you need to find me now low the step back this time he hits he scored in double figures in seven straight well when you run a ball screen with Henson hes dictating matchups whether you want to switch or you dont and most teams try to put a certain guy on him so the more you can put hits in his screens you can dictate to the defense like Applause that as you can see here they dont want to switch with Hinson they want to leave Jaden Zachary on them Harris is going under the screen and you cant go under twice and get back to the shooter low makes him pay four four of Pittsburghs five shots are for three make it five out of six and they are locked in thats Zack Austin this is a Pittsburgh team in League Play where 44 of their shots are threes thats the highest rate of any team in the ACC theyre shooting with confidence because none of them outside of Hinson have shoot it great statistically Zack Austin is is 27 from three and just steps in after the nearly airball in the shot pit may have tipped that in off the m blocked to Applause miss Earl Grant the BC head coach his biggest concern tonight was defending the three and the other part of that is here you just like this you got to contain a dribble great job by Quinton post switching on BB Carrington and forcing a turnover Madson from a glockton who lost the handle Zachary will kick it out Harris steep into one to strong claudell Harris Charleston Southerns leading score a year ago but just seven for his last 26 entering play theyre trying to keep a bigger body on hon and dictate coverage Carrington and pit is five of six from downtown this is a team that averages more than nine threes per game in conference play theyre already at five to start the first five made field goes from behind the line and this is how pit plays and when theyre knocking these threes down they can beat anybody you know theyre going to defend the threepoint line well in the other end they lead the ACC in defending the three Harris on the triple Drive throws it up and low comes away with the rebound pit pushing low accelerates left it short theyre hot from behind the threepoint line there I think low low see he had guys behind him run into that line on its 0 for two inside the arc Harris off the shot fake not close M Lockton the post and it drops it those two guys play well they play off each other so well one guys in a dunker spot the other guy in the high post look for post to mlock and to play off each other all night now they got to switch this they got to go to the switch now and this is the game this will be how you got to be pitched Henson bullies his way to the basket and he got it to go everything falling for the pit Panthers early its a horse contest here in in K form and pits winning right now up Music eight this is the key to tonights game here at the ball screening they switch Blake Henson will have his way inside he wants to attack that smaller guy the double team comes he just power throughs it and he has a chance for the end one but once he starts skipping its just going to open up more and more opportunities for the pit pass to knock down threes and they already five six for threepoint line we were talking at shoot around and you said those are matchups that Hinson is going to have and he can exploit them those are potentially EAS easy baskets for pit I think thats the key if pit makes a run at this or not because when he sets a ball screen you have to switch and when you dont you saw the pit guards take advantage of it and when you do now you throw the ball to Henson he can back a guard down inside Force double team it just makes everything easier for everyone else he becomes your deao point guard in the half court set and I know its been said often but he has the build of that old school undersized pit post player you think of Chevy outman Ontario Le Dean Blair theres been others but hes got that same build different type of game however yes he plays more than a for that pit the pit team that came that was in the Big East had a front line that was 67 68 guys that was extremely physical refs called those games a little differently too and we get a foul on the floor on Zachary diero Diaz Graham the sopore from the the Canary Islands have checked in because of his ability to knock down shots he shoots 38 from the threepoint line you got to switch the ball screen he goes inside draws a foul punishing and switch with the guard right now this BC team is struggling because theyre giving up everything another three for a pit the second for Henson and the Panthers are six of seven from deep and this pit team is they they make nine a game but theyre not percentage wise great threepoint shooting team outside of Henson they are on fire Harris cannot answer a glocked foul going for the Applause rebound and that is on Hinson and thats two on Blake Hinson just coming off the pin down again mlock Lake and you have got the lock and Trail you cannot lose Henson thats second foul thats a difficult foul way pitch started this game the last thing you wanted to see if youre Panthers fan Zachary hes been better than 40 from three in conference play its a really good threepoint shoot it doesnt take a lot but they need him to get going he has a physical St size Advantage when he decides to go inside as well he usually plays inside the paint but more than capable of knocking down threes William jeffr checked in for Hinson low the dribble drive so Applause quick difficult match up now you got to may have to change your ball screen defense just switching everything and Pitch just getting whatever they want theyre getting to the rim now they started out knocking threes now theyre getting in the pain of finishing at The Music Rim Harris 0 for four Zacharys now made eight of his last 11 threes shot clock down to six Madson around Carrington shot altered was it tipped Applause no just driving past post there and getting to the Lane and again its because of the way they they started so hot from the threepoint line youre switching everything and then now theyre beating you off the the bounce and this team was is taken off since Lows been in that starting lineup and this is why because he had provides the ability to do that and then you bring ishmail Leed Off the Bench the transfer from Rhode Island where he comes in hes got the ball now he can do this he can attack try to get to the rim and try to score mlock in the rebound Jeffers could not finish he knows his role when he comes in he plays like a starter but when he comes in with that second unit continue to attack and stay aggressive Quinton post from the outside a 43 threepoint shooter as a sevenfooter I think Quint post got frustrated cuz he was open inside a few times he got it once early and he scored hes going to take matters into his own hand he can shoot it from the three he has it all so skilled as an offensive player post has seven low creates separation rebound by Prince sik Bay I thought it was a great job by Quinton post there just backing up keeping the ball in front of him making low take a contestant pullup jump Applause shot you can tell post wants the ball he likes the matchup against Diaz Graham they get it to him yeah mlon wild Drive post hits the deck and a foul against pit he pops he rolls but you got to find him at all cost Quinton post shooting over 40 pafic three knocks down his first three tonight time for same to get his his shot as an NBA hit coach and he was a big part of two championships as a player with the Houston Rockets very early in his career as mlon misses that first championship casselle coming off the bench to spell Kenny Smith and oh playing big minutes as a rookie on that 94 team he was and hes always been a heck of a player King of the midrange got to his spots like this guy here Carringtons a pro hes got NBA Scouts drooling Applause pits missed its last four from three offense hasnt been the same since Blake Hinson went to the bench post backing down Diaz gramp that match Ups going to be there for BC I dont know why theyve missed him a couple of times already I think good things happen when he touches the ball just like we talked about Blake hon theres a matchup issue trying to guard him let him touch the ball and dictate the coverage and then let the other guys benefit from that nine points for post Applause Diaz Graham A 39 threepoint shooter now with Hinton out theres not as much of a threat to be inside and if you notice BCs doing a better job now stand between the ball and basket and contesting shots post with the reverse layup off the nice speed from claudell Harris theres no matchup for him because you want you got it you know you you got to keep a bigger body against him so put them in ball screen you try to hedge and recover you cant get back in time hes already punished You by popping a knocking down a three got to continue to run your offense through him five to Applause shoot that one rims out and BC can extend a 70 run pit is missed six straight and the Panthers have gone almost 4 minutes since their last point but you live by the three now theyre dying by the three they started out so hot they continue to settle without a threat a threat to attack the rim like that nine unanswered and with hin it on the bench BC has closed the Gap to two and also Federico Federico is not in there for Rim protection so now the guards at BC they know hes not in there they want to get downhill and get to the rim Zack Austin through shot blocker at High Point getting ready to check in as Diaz Graham ends the drought its the seventh three of this first half for pit now G Graham Diaz Graham out there hes going to pop and so post has to stay outside and not switch against the guard and he comes up with the steal Carrington pushing right past Harris for the two great job Dr a defensive in there you got to turn that in quick offense they did great job by the Panthers able to knock down a three there but now theyre starting to get to the rim get some layups expect teams to start settling in now with the defensive rotations and assignments Harris spins away the step back offensive rebound post 13 in the first half for Quinton post if Im BC every time down the floor he touches the basketball I he is just dictating match up theres no one on the pit roster right now that can guard him feder Rico feder Rico is probably the only guy and hes probably too small if you see him at the score T I think Jeff C had enough low will go to the Applause line Quinton post is having his way inside and out heres waiting on the double team come spins away gives you the on senior night the Saturday evening post is in circulation he is having his way it hasnt been a matchup problem from the very beginning and I think theyve missed him a handful of times I mean he could very well have close to 20 points if not 20 points already every time he touched it it seemed like it was just great things happening I expect him to get a quick breather and get back out there theres just no answer for him on the fit right now he impacts the game in so many ways on the defensive end with his rebound his shot blocking offensively hes a guy that shoots 50 from the field 40 from three 80 from the stripe he can pass the ball yeah and you look at Joe linardi the Bracketology pit on the bubble but its in that next group one of the next four outs so if they win this would be a quad two win doesnt help you a whole lot it can hurt you they can hurt you and the good thing for them is they go home for their fight fin two games of the year against Florida State and NC State the chance to go to DC and maybe get a surprise win there to get them over the hump and into the Applause tournament they were a tournament team last year when they had grown men in the starting lineup they had an older starting lineup last year than the Oklahoma City Thunder they did the veteran group and Elite guard play Carrington the shot fak its tip back and the rebound and the put back thats an impressive play there by G oaz Graham I mean he couldnt get to it tipping into a teammate for a bucket a highq play there by the sophomore big the lead is nine it was 12 when Hinson left the game with his second foul now we get a foul on pit ACC tournament again just a week and a half away Tuesday is our last regular season double header on accn Notre Dame against UNC the Irish are at the bottom of the league but theyre playing better of late and then Georgia Tech at Wake Forest we saw wake get ambushed by Notre Dameon South Bend wake has been perfect at home this season that is a game the Demon Deacons cannot lose absolutely the de are in a big one you know now you know against Virginia Tech is the big game that they need to win to stay on the right side of the bubble Zachary lets it Fly too much and a league Bay throws it away Wake Forest is almost the inverse of pit yes wake has been incredible at home and they look lost at times on the road hit weirdly six power conference yes Road winds fourth most in division one yes they seem to play better away from home even though the Pete is one of the great homecourt advantages in college basketball it is and it hurt them early this team struggles so much at home and and then theyre here and its just you know on the road I mean it final theyve lost their last two at wake and at Clemson which is no shame to lose in no places wakes undefeated at home and they just have been incredibly successful on the roow just making shots like they doing here in the first half Zachary gets his Red Badge of Courage taped Applause up if you pitch you got to be happy still with a ninepoint lead and Hinton come out shooting the basketball the way he did and you guys been able to sustain the lead Diaz grab open Cash theres eight three of the half this has been unbelievable to watch these guys come out but this is what theyre doing I mean its what they do this is their identity to take and make a lot of threes and throw the percentages out they do it in volume Miss every shot you dont take right thats the motto I played Applause by here comes po spinning throws it up off the backboard Austin tips it back to low they got numbers if they continue to push it and low draws the foul and now most underrated thing about threepoint shooting is you got to stop the dribble he blow strings out the double team there and course is the weak side guy to help on a roll he helped them fed feder Rico feder Rico and got to get to Diaz Graham in the corner and 611 youre not bothering his shot as the guard Clos it out to Him Zachary takes it away from low really good on ball Defender and one of the better leaders in the accs fifth in steals and you see why theyre really physical guard really good good quick hands and AC the feet post over feder Rico 15 for the Dutchman its got to touch it every time just not much anybody can do and his advantage over feder Rico feder Rico is in the post like it off the window and feder Rico feder Rico with the tip thats how he impacts game offensively just following up being in that dunker spot when your guards penetrate like that you want them you tell him hey dont fall down and dont get your shot blocked the big rotates get it on the glass PTO Rico attacks the offensive glass and able to contribute on the offensive event thats Donald Han hes another guy hes not afraid to shoot no its taking him some time to come back from that tourn ACL starting to settle down get his legs up under him Phil the red shirt freshman had a 11 last weekend against NC State knocked down three triples great position for leot who might be the Sixth Man of the Year in the ACC this season you wont get an argument for me that Ro just suits him well he gets to come in and just be super aggressive think about only scoring the basketball and he is their best perimeter Defender so he is a twoway player like now creating that still there dangerous pass broken up here comes low Diaz Graham wants it and to the other away pull up three grazing the front rim I thought they had numbers in hand had decided to attack the rim there and set him for the pull up three thats part of the learning curve again even though hes a red shirt freshman just hadnt had a lot of minutes feeling comfortable with his legs and and just decision making and theyll get a reach and foul on Zachary thats his second smell lier just turning the corner getting to the rim hes going to call that an assist for his big man its just a difficult ask Carolinas playing as well as anyone in the country I think theyre the number one seed for a reason team to feder Rico whos got a chance for a threepoint play and feder Rico feder Rico six points in this first half averages less than five on the season you see post there theyre switching the screen they run little Sun action there and DC had the match up they want just cant simulate the length and athleticism of feder Rico feder Rico just get gets it and finishes hes a 42 free throw shooter someone else with BC has to step up now matsons been quiet today almost a turnover Harris tried to squeeze it into post wanted a foul leg it against Madson and he went right through him just overpowered him at The Rim there initiated contact you knew as aggressive as he was coming off that bench and enjo just embracing that sixman role as BC calls the timeout timeout Earl Grant pit with its largest lead of the game were back in 30 Music seconds depend keeps you drier than ever so you can say yes to more than ever yes yes yes no depend the only thing stronger than us is you you always got your mind on the green not you you your business bank account with QuickBooks money now earns

here on accn and the app first round coverage begins at 1230 Eastern Wednesday with the nothing but net crew Boston College today a little shorthanded on senior night missing their sophomore Chaz Kelly whos also the backup point guard yes and theyre missing him right now you need his decision making in his ball Ling and we talked about what having the twopoint guard lineup has done to the Pittsburgh offense its also one of the reasons post doesnt have the ability to get the ball in the post because they cant postfeed him cuz Zacharys the only gu that usually does it and the double team came too late and post has been a oneman wrecking ball 17 points in the opening half thats one of those things with his guys right now you know he has it going let him touch it let the double team come and it allow easy opportunities for yourself Carrington gets free back iron second chance chance DCs really confused in their ball screen defense theyve changed it up so many times just continue with the ball Applause screen low to Carrington for the easy two so the ball screen giving them trouble BC has a zone defense in its back pocket and on paper you might say why would you play zone against the Pittsburgh team that can make threes at a ridiculous rate when theyre on but is it something you consider well it is because right now youre giving up everything youre giving up pullups youre giving up uncontested layups at The Rim as mlock draws the foul and youre giving up threes at least the Zone would allow you to take something away and I think right now BC needs to decide which defense they want to sustain because they cant stop the penetration off the ball screen supposed to switch there easy Drive rotation and it get any easier than that thatll be the easiest two points Bob curring will get all day and something you told me earlier today as a player yes you were a guy who could knock down the outside shot how did you feel about playing against his Zone I hated his Zone I I hear so many people say all the time they dont like a Zone because a guy can shoot I can assure you Shooters dont like Zone because it just it limits how you involve yourself in the game theres a lot a lot of movement youre just standing around you get you just dont have as many plays against the zone as you do Mana man and I think its one of the most biggest misconceptions from a player standpoint of playing against his Zone I think you got Jim beheim to smile on the studio I I I know how tough it is to play against that and and its like this game now lets watch how many threes pit is hit and lets watch how many they continue to make as the game go on theres a difference in making them threes against his Zone but will you make them for 40 minutes and thats the key but right now BCs giving up threes and layups and you cant do Music both mton was not the one called for that last foul they got it on post so post has two Zachary who hits the three playing with two fouls hinin on the bench for pit with two fouls great shot there by Zachary now one of the things that Zachary likes to do was a big guard when post is out he likes to post up but if he has P Pub Carrington on him hes 66 you know so he doesnt have the advantage there thats one of the problems that this pit team also has is the size of their their back court Diaz Graham puts it on the floor fouled by mton thats two on Devin mton so mton post and Zachary all with two fouls in this opening half I mean now with post out of the game Zacharys got to be the guy to step up and carry this team offensively he knocks down a three there and how about guo Diaz Graham hes knocked down a couple of threes he close out on him now hes putting on the deck and at his size just one dribble and hes at The Rim he is playing extremely well our next all access the ACC life premieres Monday night it features the number five Virginia Tech womens basketball team pit gymnastics and Miami womens golf you get unprecedented access into the lives of these student athletes the coaches the staff parents and fans that s Eastern after AC pm on Monday big possession here for BC you want to have something positive as you go into halftime here post is in the game I would imagine you got to let him touch it 17 points on eight of 11 shooting for post two second differential game clock and shot clock look at the F screen for post coming up and a rare miss here in the first half by post final seconds Leed pulls up off the backboard no good and pit takes a 15point lead into halftime 8 threes in the opening 20 minutes just a Odell Harris trying to bust out of a shooting slump thats not the way to do it and thats thats the type of possessions you dont want if your BC coming out we just talked about and highlighted how dominant post has been and the first possession you come off off a ball screen without reading it and you take a three and not not allowing him to touch it Harris one for eight tonight 0 for four from three his last 12 games hes been held below double figur seven times only happened twice in his first 15 games and on the other end look here pit goes right to their guy whos had it going early in the matchup nightmare we talked about po post came over to help and he gets the Applause block great job by post as we talked about it really good heal Defender now we touches and you play off that if hes oneonone you leave him alone help comes hell play hell pass it 19 for post plenty of time here to get back in here I just expect post to touch it quite a Applause bit and even if youre pit for hson you dont have to force anything def youre getting any shot you want if you just move Applause it shot clock at seven low from Applause 15 adson the drive a glockton cant finish it you got numbers if he continues to push it feder Rico instead pushes it back low the lob to feder Rico the double Austin the corner three not there low scrambles for the rebound its a back breaker to give up offensive rebounds to a team thats shooting as well but its so spread out because of their ability to knock down threes like that as they knock down their ninth three here first of the second half youre so cognizant of running that Shooters youre so spread out cant get inside and box out overe extended long shots long rebounds guards got to get in there 12 second to chance points for pit and low now in double figures for the eighth straight game Carrington after the steel gives it up thats where his next step of development is again hes predetermining his decisionmaking and jumped in the air to pass that no need with his size and and vision just stay on the ground and read the defense something hell get better at as he watches More film and mroy everybody even though hes a freshman hes still a young freshman Madson meanwhile scoreless tonight he been averaging 16 in the last six games as a starter however he was one for 10 from three Wednesday night against Virginia Carrington off the window no tipped and post is there good decision there by attacking the rim here by Zachary and the emphatic block by Zack Austin who was top 20 nationally in blocks last year with high points and he does a great job even in the ACC here coming from the weak side looking at timing that block coming over and he and fed feder Rico feder Rico are both tied for seventh in the ACC fighting with his team I think he W up them now so hes in seventh place or sixth place even his teammate in seventh last touch Austin for BC the way back into this game is what someone eventually has to step up but play through post you know theyre coming a double you get mton driving to the rim and then you get your guard spacing on the perimeter to get open shots but while you still have time its okay DP inside the post its senior night for BC Eagles trying to snap a threegame losing streak and mlon drains the three BC is a team where theyve got six wins in conference all of them have come against the bottom four in the league they beat Notre Dame twice Louisville Georgia Tech and Miami the lone win outside of those four was a win against Syracuse its the only team that theyve beaten conference with a winning record Madson still looking for his first field goal not Applause there low open out there this wont show up show up on his stat sheet but great defensive decision there by mlock he was sitting in the corner on Henson and had to make a decis decision because BC didnt match up do I gave up the three to low on hon he stayed home made low take the shot fortunately for BC missed Zach turbines inside it rims out pit only has one made field goal in this second half but BC just two of eight to begin the second half thats feder Rico feder Ricos strength there to switch keeps the guard in front cant do this Hon wide open and he missed it yeah youre lucky M that I think a lot of that is just coming back into the game not having played much in the first half but they got to get their coverages right there there just two point blank looks theyve given up theyve been fortunate the last two that pit has missed post the runner and if youre BC you got to be concerned at one point that post is going to fatigue someone else has have to step up and get involved in his offense itsit gone more than 3 minutes since its last basket Austin knocks down the three that is the 10th three for pit Panthers are 10 and three this season when making at least 10 threes and youre going to give him that you see the percentages he doesnt take a lot of them and youre going to help on the penetration and youre going to concede that and unfortunately when youre down by 16 every shot matters and hes much more comfortable doing that when hes up so big but you got to figure out a way to get out to him and make a challeng his shot Carrington picks up his second foul this a great job coming over by Zack Austin doing Zack Austin things on the defensive end but oh wait hes also knocking down threes putting pit up 16 Robinson was a standout at BC averaged almost 18 a game currently on the Golden State Warriors The Warriors in town to take on the Celtics tomorrow and that means means Jerome is in the house today hes a lot like me he had a lot more hair back then when he was in college as well looked like one of my pitches but boy could he score that basketball he and Kai Bowman quite the backourt duo yes I would say send it in but with respect to pit thats thats Jerome Lane but that Jerome right there was a bucket he could score it and I mean mean very efficient scoring low the steel up ahead to L It Up and Under that is just the microcosm of the game today you come out of timeout with a play to execute and you give up a pick six turnover there Applause and it just feels like its the time is now for BC if they want to get back in this game and BC right now taking tough contested shots leg at the pullup and the rebound to a league b whats impressed you the most about the job Jeff cable has done this season with pit well because hes winning in different ways I mean last year we talked about how old this team was and how experienced it was then he turns right around this year with the inexperienced back court and theyre right there trying to play themselves back in the tournament and this team is is starting to play their best basketball I know theyve lost a couple of games on the road but its no shame to lose an at Clemson or at Wake Forest at you know on the road and the way theyre shooting the ball the confidence he gives this group the way they defend theyre just not a team you want to play and they take care of business here they get to go back home defend their home court and look out Washington DC in the ACC tournament they started one and five in conference play and Jeff cable knew going in this team was going to go as far as his young back court would take them and we have seen low and Carrington both come along both play better especially low Carrington had some moments early low since he moved into this starting lineup has been a catalyst and he wasnt healthy early in the year now hes healthy these guys this late in the year theyre sophomores and its taking pressure all Bob Carrington to have to create for himself and others and its just another facilitator ball handling is shooting Hansen hit from behind by Zachary and thats three on Jaden Zachary just miscommunication there on BC again and giving up a point blank layup as you look at the trio of guards and its Leed coming in off the bench he plays like a starter but him coming off the bench is he brings a production from the bench that not a lot of teams have not many teams has a guy coming in with that type of defensive intensity and scoring 12 points a game and that role hes been a star in that road you said hes got your vote if he had one for Sixth Man of the Year I yes yes I I I think he is been as good as anyone theres others I think I I like to wait till the end of the year but Ill tell you this he is is playing as well as anyone meanwhile Quinton post has been Hercules tonight hes done it all for BC hes got 23 of the Eagles 41 thats a goal tending call it went in anyway see him cut to the basket there able to finish and he did he didnt have the advantage off the cut he has the size over Diaz Graham trying to put the ball to the hant they looking the post and thats an offensive foul on Diaz Graham who got posted with an elbow its three on the Spaniard hell learn you got to turn his square up there theres no reason that he got slapped and he trying to Shield off if you turn his square up the threat of driving would make post back up and you know when you turn your back to the defense youre inviting them to pressure the ball great job with post with his experience pressure in the young Spaniard there Federico feder Rico back in there Manning the five for bit hes doing a really good job of using his length hes backing up helping these guards on the ball screens dribble hand off then hes getting back out the post he was trying to deny post who turns faces hes going to hit that theres not much you can do theres nothing you can do its why we highlighted early hes a 50 40 80 guy and theres just not many guys that have that and when you add his ability to with three assists and two blocks like we said the last guy to put those numbers up like that was the Big Skinny freshman from the Virgin Islands that played with me at weight yeah he turned out to be okay it wasnt bad I thought hes a little overrated at one point overrated yeah hes only one of the top 10 greatest players ever played the game of he didnt talk enough trash for your liing good day sir oh wait you like Dr prepper zero sugar shooting the problem is the ensemble cast has yet to show up yeah its 25 points in 26 minutes and we talked to Coach ER Grant earlier today and he said were at our best when we have balanced scoring and today he has anything but that post has had to put this team on his back great fed by low and Carrington connects freshman to freshman its what we talked about why this team is so deadly because now before low has taken that step it was only bu Ken having him making those decisions and now he gets shots like that created easy opportunities for him and good looks and its helped his game as well those freshman are playing well off each other our team High 13 for Carrington and theyll get feder Rico with a hold just a great find by low forcing rotation they drop down to drop the take away the dunk the drop off of feder Rico feder Rico and Currington just with his confidence just laces it and people dont talk about him as much about freshman of the year but this guy is the only freshman that has won the award four times and he is right there him and McCain and Burton and and with this team making a push to make it to the NCAA bub carring is a big part of Applause Applause Music today Carrington Falling Away another rebound by post that typically The Shot Bob Carrington likes probably needs to be a little bit more balanced on that no need to fade away and Federico feder Rico challenging that shot there forcing hand put that up higher off the glass than he wanted to Carrington on the drive the drop off for feder Rico if these two freshman low and Carrington continue to grow and the confidence blooms pit becomes dangerous in the ACC tournament very dangerous just play you saw the growth in and the adjustment made there he settled for a jump shot couple of possessions that time he didnt settle drove in the paint Force rotation dropped it off to his big fella for the Finish post keeps it alive hand throws it up and Federico cleans now you see coach hes putting Hinton in the corner he knows the guards get the putting a shooter in the corner so in the dribble hand off they just turn in the corner Carrington of three pit with its largest lead of the game and 16 for the freshman and the issue with BC again youve tried everything you try you tried to chase him over early he turns the corner that time they tried to cut it they stopped they popped in knock down threes they just have no answer for this pit offense right now post with a double double tonight claudell Harris now BC has just not had the same claudell Harris of late that they did H in nonconference Henson lets it Fly and connects wow 13 threes for pit on 24 attempts I said it was a horse game I think its just just S A Jim shooting by themselves right now piss and shooting lights out here made 13 of 24 from behind the line pit with a commanding lead on Boston College and some good news for the Panthers Wake Forest lost at Virginia Tech so pit needs some help to move into the top four and get that double bu theyre 0 and2 against Clemson on the season theyre 0 and2 against Syracuse they split with wake but that door remains a jar and we get a foul underneath against pit if you pit youre just worried about your own business right now you have to continue to to play because you got to play your way into the tournament here I mean you this is your last Road game you go home for the final two games of the year and theyve got some quad one wins I mean at at Duke and wake and at UVA or they struggled early to start the season and they just got to finish strong I think if they can get they can win out and then get to the ACC tournament and win a game in it I a game or two I think they got a chance Harris needed that hes now two for 10 and pits closing schedule no gimmies Florida stayed at home NC State at home NC States going to be desperate Florida state has scuffled of late that game will be Tuesday and then they finish next weekend at the Pete against the wolf pack but there a desperation that theyre going to play with and they need it they know that theyre right there they know theyre close and there going to be a lot of of movement with teams around the bubble stop looking around just continue to come in here and take care business that like youve done here today now the other part of this which is interesting is Carrington knocks down of three you may not want that double buy as strange as it sounds because that first neutral sight game in know the previous round the second round that single bu that might be an opportunity for a quad one win potentially if youre pitched oh it also is that but when you get this late in the season the extra day of rest becomes a factor and I think thats one of the reasons why the double bu because youre talking about someone else had played the game before so theyre coming in having to play their second game in two days and you prefer to be the fresher team three for Zachary lets say youre in that 89 game thats the scenario Im envisioning youre probably facing off against another bubble team whether its a wake its a Syracuse and again the outcome of that game headtohead tournament format neutral Court could go a long way come selection Sunday absolutely and thats why I say the double buy helps you because youre you can be the fresher team you know playing that game and having the other team havent played that game the day before that their season more than likely knowing theyre playing a win or else game as that eight or nine I guess what Im saying is if youre in that 8 n game and you dont have the double bu and if you can win that game you have essentially two opportunities for Quad one wins and then if you lose in the semis so be it so be it you might have a real shot at getting in with the two wins absolutely match up is just such a big part of of seedings as well boy carington wow six threes tonight hes got 22 I talk to Sam Cale at half time he said I came to see Bob and Bob is putting on a show from behind a threepoint Applause line 612 to go in regulation pit in full control see you guys tomorrow UNC Duke Virginia Clemson the top four right now all with double buys NC State Florida State would be the 89 game pit right now sitting at a seven seed Virginia Tech got a win against wake so if youre projecting again what it looks like today if it would be pit Virginia Tech in that game as Carrington hits his 7th three and sets a career high with 25 points at this point you got to say I might want to take him out save some of this post for three hes got 30 he has 30 and 12 and I mean he has had little to no help from the rest of this BC lineup and now because of the way the guards playing now you got to switch and Bob Carrington now because of the way hes knocking down threes against post he gets whatever he wants heat check hes earned a couple oh hes earned it definitely like you were going to say he hasnt he see she just has the advantage you know I mean way hes been shooting thats a good shot from the elbow and post and Diaz Graham get tangled down low AJ deside trying to separate the two I believe the basket is good I thought the whistle came after the shot went in but they may check call him a foul on post and those guys get getting tangled up but the basket is Applause good third foul on Applause post 16 made threepointers for pit Carringtons got seven hinsons got three and that is way too easy for Blake Hinson hes got 17 he only played about 6 minutes in the opening half but thats what he does I mean when this team is playing at their best hes the key because his ability to punish the switch like that and if hes willing to go inside and stay committed to that then this pit team becomes a difficult out with the ACC tournament just a week and a half away Tuesday is our last regular season double header on accn Notre Dame heads to North Carolina Irish starting to play well theyve got a young backourt to Braden Shrewsberry Marcus Burton and then Georgia Tech visiting Wake Forest thats a game the Demon Deacons cannot lose reverse dunk by Austin again set up by this ball screen to switch by Henson now he scored possession before now you got to come and double team him he finds the cutting Austin and post turns it over Carrington the lob Henson the flush hon is showing you I got bounced too Im so much more than a threepoint shooter the Timeout on the floor 337 left in regulation Carrington a Henson Up Up and Away with the flush dominant performance here by Pittsburgh as the head of HR I help lead a successful home security firm our teams season day in the ACC pit on the bubble this is a game that doesnt really help their case it could Dent their resume strong gets fouled by feder Rico and for pit the story today when it goes It goes and it has been a monsoon of Threes tonight thats the opening possession of the game right there knocking down threes and they hadnt stopped since and everybodys in on the ACT low and no ones been hiding above Carrington reminding everyone why hes a one of the Freshman considered as ACC freshman of the year and hes starting to play his best basketball even coming off the Clemson loss he had 18 points seven rebounds three assists zero turnovers and he has followed it up here tonight with an incredibly strong performance with the career high in points five assist as well just reminding everyone how special talent that he is he is someone who began his collegiate career with a triple double 16 threes for pit it matches the season High set against West Virginia the program record is 18 set last year against wake step back by low yeah Carringtons not the only freshman Lows got a dozen and hes got nine assists tonight you see him wave out the confidence that these guys are playing with you see he has mlon on him and hes just like hey you know though dont come set the screen I like this matchup gets to his spot post gets blocked Here Comes low Austin passes on the wide open three and draws Two Shots the allly ACC womens basketball tournament gets underway Wednesday at Green pboro Coliseum first round coverage starts at 1230 Eastern with the nothing but net crew and ISRO Randolph children and a Randolph when you talk about growth for a young player Jaylen low hes got the nine assists tonight hes scoring more consistently but now in his last six games he has a total of seven turnovers and thats why thats what this team does it allows them to shoot that many threes because earlier they were making too many turnovers and they werent getting attempts now theyre starting to get him up and Jeff tells them you cant make him if you dont shoot him so theyre theyre not taking a basketball turn it over they only have five here tonight and youre not going to always knock down 16 threes but the threat of knocking down at least the nine that they do continues to open up the paint they need to keep feder Rico feder Rico on the floor because his ability to protect the rim and even when they go to the bench and Diaz Graham comes in 611 with his LM was just nearly too mobile after seven footage that you have to deal with in the paint and Quinn P has played well but its really bothered all the other guys for Applause BC and it might be somewhat lost now that its a 30point game but pit really did a nice job in the first half withstanding a Tipping Point Blake Hinson picks up two early fouls pit had a 12point lead BC goes on a mini run Hinson does not come back for the rest of the first half and pit still ended up with a 15point halftime lead they ended up extending the lead because of this guard play just driving they picking the matchups now they switch they get like that they get to the spots so now BC they theyve changed defenses so much they tried drop coverage then they tried to hedge and recover and then now theyre just switching and then the guards are just dictating the matchup whether its mlon or his post its just difficult for them to guard these guards at the threepoint line 27 for Carrington hand able to draw the foul Applause just communicating with each other and having to continue to defend really impressive performance here by the Panthers both ends of the floor and its been well chronical that this you know Pits been really good on the road this season and at times inconsistent at home but but you get to draw it up where you get a big road win here against BC and you do finish up with two games at home against Florida State and NC State if youre pit that is an opportunity to take care of business and set yourself up for the ACC tournament everything you want to accomplish is right in front of you this is one of those teams theyre playing better theyre starting around in the shape and theyre a difficult team to play against with their length and their willingness and confidence to shoot the three but then with Lows added them and his ability to dictate matchups now that he has post they just want to say hey go oneonone we like our chance of force rotation kick out to the threepoint Shooters like Applause this Matson 0 for five today we get a timeout from Earl Grant 106 to go and might see the walk on AA get in on senior night Quinton post on senior night leaves the floor gets a standing ovation from the cony Forum crowd and if this is his final home game for BC 30 points 14 for 22 from the field 12 rebounds it wasnt the team performance BC would have liked Quinton post was magnificent he left it all on the floor and great job by these fans giving him a stand in Ovation hes been deserving of it and its not a lot of time youve had a sevenfooter here in BC with thats put up these type of numbers Madson finally hits the three his first basket his first points of the Applause game too little too late here for BC low is one assist away from a double double I get it here Marshall off with the three it belongs to BC and here comes AA senior walkon got the start today on senior night from Bethlehem Pennsylvania and a chance to finish out his bc career at home with a few more reps Jaden Zachary honored on senior night as well comes to the bench a TI hits the three and the BC bench loves it even in defeat a moment for the walk off its one of those things that is so miss I think in college basketball that guys dont get those opportunities they put in the work they work so hard and its even sweeter when a senior gets to his first shot wont get many in great job by the bench guys celebrating him in even in defeat and Matson another senior gets a standing ovation as he comes to the Applause bench thatll do it pit gets the last word on BCs senior night Jeff cels team has now won nine of its last
