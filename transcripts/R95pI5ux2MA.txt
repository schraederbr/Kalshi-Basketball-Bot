you with us here on opening night 2023 and taking a tip for Georgia Southern Carl Curry against tafari gari and its belonged to the yellow jackets and gari the transfer from UMass a floater in the lane left it short and Curry secures the rebound the Eagles starting a number of their transfers Malik Applause Tidwell checking in as well and you take a look at Derrick Harris Jr cam Bryan avonte Parker and Carlos Curry and a turnover that time in the pass from cam Bryant yeah cam Bryant got ahead of himself right there had the dribble drive to the paint but uh just threw it out of bounds we see mantoman defense wiy out of the gate for both teams and for the yellow jackets look at theyre starting five miles Kelly their returning star from year ago kaasi Reeves Jr transfer from Florida Amari Abram from Miss Tai Claude from Western Carolina and tfar gari from UMass and our first foul of the game its going to be charged to cam Bryant our officials tonight Ron Gro Jenna Renault and Joe Music Switzer and four of Georgia Techs transfers uh are in the starting lineup so although you return four previous starter 60 of your scoring it shows the level of talent they got in the transfer class Kelly lifts a three no good and an offensive rebound for taon Claude he was the best in the Southern Conference last year and collecting offensive boards for the Western Carolina cadam outs six on the shot clock Abram backs off hes pressed by Malik Tidwell two seconds one heing it up and they will let it play on no shot clock violation ofon Parker had the rebound freshman making his Collegiate debut but man I me he showed some serious stuff 25 in blue he had 28 points in their exhibition loss to Augusta 28 for the Freshman super talented and that was a great defensive possession for Georgia Southern really challenging the jackets on the perimeter contesting shots Derk Harris Jr his jumper wont fall Carlos Curry going up strong and hell have a chance to break the seal here from the free throw line that foul is going to go against Amari abam and Carlos Curry 611 240 out of Albany Georgia hes the grad senior and uh assisant Coach Maurice Spates for Georgia Southern a guy well talk about you know tonight he brings a wealth of experience this team as an NBA player obviously a great player at Florida but to have an influence like that on a guy like Curry whos getting his confidence and his length hes going to have a great year sakuri hits the free throw just a 64 shooter last year and Georgia Southerns on the board first but for most baits you know he said Carlos Curry reminds him of himself and that they both started playing basketball relatively late in life Curry didnt start playing basketball until his freshman year of high school his sister encouraged him to pick it up Abram Fires at the corner claw a triple wont fall another offensive rebound for the Jack its Kelly got it going to work against Harris short Kelly again and finally he knocks it down the jackets missed their first five shots but Miles Kelly their leading score from a year ago puts up the first bucket Ted out to Curry who lets it Fly and he swishes it Carlos Curry thats one more threepointer then he hit all of last season John thats a game changer confidence stepped in Baseline Drive throwback behind the defense great offensive execution by Georgia SN he started 26 games last year for Georgia Southern 0 for two from three across the entire year one for one to start the season as Kellys layup off the glasses well short now the Eagles want to run Harris fires along range three and the rebound belongs to Claud its just one for seven to begin things here in the season opener yeah Wy weve covered many games here at Georgia Tekken and the energy coming off the Georgia Southern bench right now is Applause palpable and Abram cant get it to fall but he will earn couple of free throws foul is going to go against Derek Harris foul air dribble Drive Middle penetration right there we get the blocking foul feet were not established Yellow Jackets will go to the free throw line and this will be a key stat tonight is is getting to the line putting fouls on the opponent but converting ABR the transfer from Old Miss misses the first its your point John Georgia Southern was minus 19 in free throw attempts and their lost to Augusta Georgia Tech was minus 20 in their win over Clark Atlanta and one thing both coaches having listened to interviews and and and we spoke with Coach Henry yesterday they want to limit fouls keep the opponent off the free throw line those were trends that they saw in their exhibitions and close scrimmages well ABR misses both free throws now Malik Tidwell sends it over to Jamar Franklin Brian looking to go Baseline Reeves closes it off crosscourt pass go get it and Tyron Moore buries Georgia Southern second three coming off the pitch and again Wy we see the dribble drives Baseline collapse the Yellow Jacket defense and throw back behind the defense two great shots right there nice pump fake had Miles Kelly in the air and that lay will fall for Kelly Georgia Tech one for eight now from the floor and the Eagles on a 60 run and theres a block from tar gari hes an exciting package of athleticism in length is he John oh hes tremendous and uh Subs coming off the bench stur van for the yellow jackets hes the guy that can really impact the game Wy also joining him entering the ball game Evie danana number 10 a transfer from NC State so Baseline in bounds this will be more he was third on the team in scoring last year and he gets it into the Freshman Colin Cole Georgia Southern two for five from the floor four of those five shots have been from threepoint range Moore crossing over stent gets a step and theyll say he stepped on the Baseline butll be Jor to take fastball when we come back but Georgia Southern debuting a new skill shooting the three Carlos hurry first three Georgia Southern coming off what was a disappointing 2022 23 season 500 in the sun Bel conference finishing eight and making a change hiring Charlie Henry after relieving Brian Bergen there you see Coach Henry John we see his resume it includes assistant coaching the NBA head coaching into the G League assistant at the power five level and col you what do you make of him as a head coach stepping into his first ever division one head coaching job I think just the wealth of experience and the mentors that hes been around a guy like Fred hyberg uh you know during his time with him in the NBA and at Iowa State great mentor great mind of the game and you can see it it influences coaching I mean Georgia Tech one of eight from the floor the energy palpable off this bench right here thats all coached the culture hes setting here comes Malik Tidwell taking on the contact and the fifth year senior at his fifth School in his many years his first ever division one opportunity hes got a chance to put some points up on the board and again transition easy baskets in transition or putting fouls on the jackets a nice start here Tidwell very good job absorbing the contact making a play out of nothing red shirt senior from Chicago misses the first free throw last year he played at Bluefield state in West Virginia he averaged 21 points a night sub coming in for Georgia Southern this is Nate braford and Tidwell interesting stat Wy one of five current D1 men basketball players to be playing for his fifth team how about that theres the transfer portal in action right there yeah hes been all over the place hit the second free throw Bryant and Stratton in Wisconsin Morton College and Illinois Missouri State in West Plains Missouri he even had his senior year in California and moved high schools after his junior year and 66 career double doubles so he put up numbers everywhere he went he sure did thats zero in blue Kelly Cuts in right side of the lane loses it another turnover for the yellow jackets one of nine from the floor and three turnovers now Tyron Moore hanging cant hit and Colin cool the freshman ripping down the rebound as EB danana is called for the over the back yeah right now the story for the jackets you know early early season Jitters here you see again dribble Drive putting pressure on the defense and then good hustle both sides of the basketball right there two guys competing I think for Georgia Tech just need to settle in you know theyve got the nerves only one field goal were almost 6 minutes into play so the game will slow down Reeves looking for the rebound and I think that time cam Bryant know theyre going to call Nate braford on the foul Music there coach Damon stoutamire gr at Arizona led the wild cats to the final four his junior year making his debut as the head coach of the Yellow Jack its Kyle stent hardly his debut in facts hes the only remaining player from that 2021 ACC Championship team and important to note Yellow Jack is playing without Lance Terrys second leading score on the roster last season average 10 points per game thats a big loss toughness experience ball handling ability a threepointer Off the Mark Tech has missed the last four shots now but to your point Lance Terry out also missing by and Dongo thiss going to be a key piece to their front Court freshman from Sagal well get a look at a different freshman piece of the front Court here Ibrahim masako from kakri Guinea top three Prospect coming out of Canada in 20123 so highly touted good get for coach stmy and staff yeah he moved to Canada for his senior year and reaching in that time this is going to be on Sako fou Char to number Music Sako was the MVP of the beach ball classic down in Myrtle Beach its been around for years and one of the best high school tournaments there there is 66 225 and they say the real strength he brings to this team is this is defensive prowess little overeager that Music time Yellow Jackets havent scored in over four minutes Bryant too strong to want of the rebound stur looking for transition and Sako had his foot in the line I dont think he was anticipating that pass John no he was running wide fill in the lane trying to get up the up the court and and on the pitch ahead just grazed the the sideline with his right foot unfortunate turnover by the jackets so tech one of 10 from the floor four turnovers taan claw coming in he averaging 15 points and nine rebounds a night at Western Carolina last year theres not a transfer on this roster that was more productive at their previous School than Claude Tidwell going up against Applause Music Stant Baseline Currys Teardrop Is Short foul caros Curry and Carlos Curry not only missed his shot but hes called for the foul that time a little frustration yeah and thats uh you know one I wish he he probably wishes he had back thats uh thats a foul you dont want to give uh Georgia Southern needs his size on the floor uh so got to watch the foul trou on Curry Cent watched by Tidwell as he crosses midcourt long crosscourt abam thats Debo Coleman who just checked in for the first time tonight another returner for the yellow jackets one of four on scholarship and he triggers a three burying it big side of relief the best pure shooter for the yellow jackets uh a guy who scored 2500 plus points in his high school career in Florida thats what he does well as a freshman he shot over 40 from three High arcing triple wont go for Tidwell now the yellow jackets with a little bit of Applause Music momentum apron going against Devonte Parker there the Freshman Coleman saves it but its right to brafford Tidwell braford threepointer and last Touch by Curry still a one possession game thats the uh you know thats the silver lining for the yellow jackets they theyve had four turnovers as poor as theyve shot the ball its still a one possession game uh so I I look for the jackets to settle down be disciplined on the offensive attack and and start taking advantage of their length their size get some dribble drives in the half court some paint touches is that where they can go for for an easy look cuz right now both teams two for 11 whoever finds their Rhythm first offensively is going to have the edge unless we get a uniform for you Wy I mean I know you can shoot the ball uh you would be sorely mistaken foul here on Avante Parker and that immediate timeout came at just the right time Georgia Southern a Georgia Tech 5 Georgia Tech coming off a 15 and 18 season the year ago saw them finished 13th in the ACC and John just a nightmarish start to the conference season losing 10 of their first 11 they couldnt climb out of that hole Yeah again not a lot of confidence coming out of the gate last season but its a new season Wy and like I said with with Kelly Coleman stur and Terry thats 60 of your scoring from this last season returning plus the 17th ranked transfer class in the nation I mean thats thats thats something to work with for coach doto and for whatever reason tonight both these teams not shooting as well as as we anticipated in fact the yellow jackets are now 0 for three one for four from the free throw line Debo Coleman has got four of their five points or six points ready but right there thats where you can get it going when youre slumping from shooting from the perimeter get a couple easy baskets get to the free throw line and that turns the momentum gets the confidence going Jamar Franklin reversing and laying it in the transfer from South Alabama and that was too easy I mean he was uncontested not a lot of resistance defensively Chris pass to the corner sacko Baseline opposite in three Coleman left it short offensive rebound for taon Claude and hell go to the line a nice Baseline Drive find the open shooter in the corner high percentage shot just didnt fall but then you get the hustle play get on the backboard get fouled go to the free throw line when its not going in thats thats the way you win games you got to find your offense manufactur it transition too we havent seen much transition offense last foul was on Carlos Curry thats his second now so hell come out of the game here as cam Bryant comes in taon Claud at the line led the socon in rebounds per game with Western Carolina last year is a third Team all Sun Belt selection hes got a chance for a couple more after the rebound from Sako and its going to belong to Georgia Tech here part of Georgia sou oh no theyre saying a foul first okay Georgia Tech catches a break there Wy and thats you know need a little luck when the balls not dropping hang around threepoint game one possession both teams going to the bench W theres some depth on both these rosters well theyre trying to find somebody who can make a bucket that too Claude hits the free throw and here comes Colin Co back fonte Parker fellow freshman checks out but Claude he had double digits in 27 of 28 games last year again of all the transfers youve got some SEC transfers coming in but Claude from from a statistical standpoint was the most productive at Western Carolina yeah 11 double doubles really rebounded the ball well and thats what he brings to this team uh a wealth of playing experience number one I mean as a mature guy hes athletic he can get it done and Abram cant connect the pass to Sako but rebounding that was a question you had about this Georgia Tech Team John something that was uh an item you want to watch not just tonight but the next couple of months as we begin this season yeah I think its its got to be a rebound by committee uh obviously weve seen mantoman defense its assignment box outs gang rebounding need the guards to dig in uh but I dont see you know your sevenfooter thats just going to Corral every rebound its got to be a sum of the parts yeah no sevenfooters but everyone on this team 6 three are taller so there is some good size some good length in that you know 66 to 69 range threepointer Abrams drains it jackets now with a two point point lead and the yellow jacket faithful and fans are starting to get into it and that is one piece of this team that tech fans were excited about with the threepoint shooting Abram let Old Miss aluk look for Sako and it wont roll in but thats okay thats two consecutive stops defensively into easy transition offensive looks thats the trend you want to see if youre coach St him Moore gets his man in the air and takes it to the basket he wanted contact but hes got a bucket tied it as well civan threepointer off the bounds Kyle Stant looking like the guy we saw at the end of last season and got his feet set rocked the defense back got him on their heels and then knocked it down high percentage three from the top of the key for stur looking for an answer Bryant a chance for a fourpoint play as the senior dupes The Freshman Sako and that was that was deep with some range get a look at a look at that one again defens was like is he really going to pull this you know not allowed of scout and report and film out yet and Bam well if you combine Carlos Curry and cam Bryan against two of the veterans on this Georgia Southern team they want to combined one for nine from threepoint land all of last year tonight theyre two for two go figure Charlie Henry Prides himself on Player Development obviously uh you know whether it was in the G League the development league formerly that the NBA called it thats what he was hired to do develop players and so you know those are Key signs of of players working in the off season on their shooting and their form their technique and more importantly the mental side the confidence so a fourpoint play for cam Bryant Georgia Southern knows is back in front Applause Abram with a little space reverses capari Way Long rebound to Applause Bryan Georgia Tech nothing manufactured offensively out of that play but I love the design coming out of a timeout coach starder you know Colin went in out of the timeout it wasnt there to develop but we see you coach I saw that action it looks like Jord tes trying to push the pace a little bit too and that time Abrams feet got away from him and turnovers you know thats thats one thing Yellow Jackets will need to take care of the basketball here down one point um you know you want to see that assist a turnover ratio turn around yeah right now its two assists and six turnovers thats not going to cut it in a 40minute game if that Trend continues this is Applause Harris cam Bryant he just nailed that threepointer a moment ago and its ripped away gorei Euro Step and to Tara gapi the agility the Finesse the side side step beautiful action if you talk about ceiling on this team John he might have the most of it of anybody I saw it right there Im a Believer transfer from UMass product of New Zealand cam Bryant cant hit that threepointer and its Jord Tech Applause basketball now lets look at this the size the grace the ability to sidestep the defender and finish at the cup you said it right there the length watch that boom made it look easy yeah he had limited playing time but was second on UMass in blocks that length plays on both ends of the floor and thats a question too will Jord have a rim protector this year as Kelly goes to danana he flicks it out gapar is there to retrieve the loose ball again going in and itll stick with Georgia Tech thought it might have gone off danana but they say it went off cool 745 first half teams finding their Rhythm offensively but its been the returners that have put up most of the points tonight meanwhile for the yellow check its a 5050 split between transfers and returners and for Tech they bring in the 17th ranked transfer class John what does this group bring to Jord Tech this year exper experience number one a collective 263 games played 116 starts and like you say 50 of the points and rebounds right now you know responsibility of those Grant transfers or transfers coming in and for the five players in the floor right now transfers for the jackets and another turnover for Georgia Tech theres Applause seventh and now Kyle stent in for Amari AB you know and you can see uh the length the size the length the athleticism uh specific to the transfers that came in with Coach STM you know his coaching staff tremendous uh Carl Hobbs Terry Parker Persian Williams and then Player Development bonsy Wells former NBA player Nate Babcock gleague assistant coach Hawks Player Development coach so hes got a great staff to develop these guys and the first fresh to score here on opening night Colin Co from Holly Springs North Carolina his first career points Georgia Southern head by one Reeves Baseline and hes going to get called for the charge Colin cool a bucket on one end and he draws the charge on the other making his impact felt on both both sides of the court right there had the feet set nice job by Co giving one up for the team now that is a change this year in college basketball John you can be called as a Defender for a blocking foul if you are not set before it the offensive player leaves the ground thats a change this year used to be by the time you guys meet and thats an adjustment for sure and its its just to clean up the game it its a tough call to make as an official uh and its its progress in our game theres a look at mayor Andre Dickens there there sitting court side Georgia Tech Alum now hes doing great things around the city hes got a mayors Midnight basketball league going on with city of Atlanta parks and wck so big time hoop fan mayor Andre Dickens out supporting the jackets Georgia Southern answers again a dribble Drive nice finish off the backboard yeah that time it was Jamar Franklin and we mentioned hes a transfer from South Alabama that make I think Jordan tech fans to ponder or maybe thats related to Javon Franklin no Rel Javon Franklin transfer from South Alabama to Tech last year Jamar Franklin from South Alabama to Georgia Southern couple of Misses from Georgia Tech but offensive Music rebounds Tech just five of 20 from the floor so far tonight they started one of 10 though and danana gets the block that time and he will go to the line e to one a tallest player on this roster at 61 they get Nate Bradford for the foul yeah and Bradford had time he just moved right at the end I I I got to think I would move too if I saw the size of the guy coming down the lane right there just need to square the shoulders feet were there moved right at the last minute and Georgia Tech will go to the line now D he was a regular in the starting line at fenc State a couple of years ago more of a reserve last year spent three years at the wolf pack and now making his Yellow Jacket debut and chance to put up some more points at the free throw line on the one and one he was a rotation guy 2122 season NC State average Four Points four boards that was his most quality season with the wolf pack but hes got experience again a guy that brings in some ACC experience hes going to help he kaasi Reeves Ka Reeves wow getting up there for the block and he draws the foul in the process on cam Bryant and how about tar gapare with the close out and then you know block on the defensive side of the ball outside the threepoint line that was impressive closing the Gap and getting up contesting so second foul on Brian and Jord Tech in the bonus itll be one and one here for Tech and I think we just had a technical foul assess to Tyron Moore yes a technical foul on the senior Tyron Moore he was taking exception to the call there I think from Ron gr double Tech I think they just assigned a technical foul to Miles Kelly number 13 for the jackets okay I didnt see what happened while yet must have been off the ball Kells first personal Applause see a double technical there on Kelly and more not sure if it was physical or just a verbal interaction now kaasi Reeves at the line Rivals called him a fivestar recruit coming out of high school and he hits the Applause first spent two years at Florida had a 21point game against AM in the ACC tournament and he SS both free throws here the Yellow Jack its back in front yeah hes another guy had 17 starts in the SEC so just the value of that experience and one more year to develop thats going to help him Tidwell round to Moore on the perimeter and mishandled that time from Bryant thats a Georgia Southern turnover thats just their fourth Music tonight and Georgia Tech defensively holding the Eagles to 29 from the field so I know weve credited Georgia Southern but the jackets have looked solid in the half court defensively on most possessions and that was a question for Coach statamire I mean he said going into the season that he felt like the offense was ahead of the defense and Kellys three pointer off the back iron and Tidwell corals it you know but energy effort and length can negate a lot of mistakes and on both sides both teams right now playing with high energy High effort Bryant just inside the free throw Applause line Bryant now got six leads all scores Kelly little no look Corner Reeves hits it Miles Kelly throwing the dime just a on the Rope right to the corner great assist on that possession unselfish play its now four threes for Tech Kelly looking to run taking on Bryant puts a move on him and rolls it off the fingertips got a timeout called by George of Southern Yellow Jackets largest lead at four Charlie Henry doesnt like like what he sees hes going to try to stop the Music bleeding they hired back in March making his debut tonight for the yellow jackets and John look at that resume oh its so impressive it speaks for itself but you know were talking about a guy thats proven to be a builder of programs and herited team at Pacific an 8 win team and then a couple years later theyre third in the in the WCC behind the zag and St Mars who seem to be always one and two uh but 23 win Seasons so you go 8 to 23 two years body of work thats pretty impressive and thats what you know the athletic director Administration here at Georgia Tech sees you know they see his pedigree we all know about his playing career Mighty Mouse as you said Rookie of the Year in 96 first team AllAmerican Arizona the final four and 94 but Im curious as a coach John as the shot clock winds down Franklin has to let it fly and its tipped Miles Kelly but offensively you look at what the Celtics have done the last couple of years will be a similar style of play you think for the jackets oh I I think they will find their their mismatches and play you know you know play the game strategically in that sense but I think its a different game you play the hand your dealt and hes got a style of play that he wants to implement here hes recruiting length he wants to address Defense Shooting is Paramount for what hes trying to do here they B started to do that and its its a relationship business you know you talk a guy like STM Carl Hobbs the relationships they have theyre going to benefit recruiting theyre going to crush it here in Atlanta Yeah Carl Hobbs associate head coach longtime head coach at George Washington University and what a move that time had a little too small there from taian Applause Claude and we got a foul away from the ball that time andou its going to be on Miles Kelly thats his second thats ta Shawn just a man you know gets the defense leaning the nice drop step used the shoulders strong aggressive assertive move by Claud you know T ta might be playing his first season in Atlanta but he got the memo on the too small celebration little Ronald aunia Jr Trey Young everybody hes hes gonna fit in just fine so heres Colin Co second generation division one player his father Jimmy played at Stetson back in the late 80s in fact Georgia Southern ended STS in Seasons Jimmys junior year and Southern went to the in tournament in the uh trans Amer Athletic Conference Championship Game Carlos Curry Carlos Curry returning with two fouls here what does that tell you John hes back in the game I I just think you know Coach Henry wants to be close going in the half three minutes is coaching him up you know dont pick up a third play smart basketball but but his size is is a Difference Maker defensively Kellys three short Reeves little bump there from Curry no call that was close and now weve got a foul and this ones going to go against Tyron Moore Curry may have gotten away with one there John yeah he he definitely got away with one came down from the top of the key and he got lucky on that possession mil Kelly at the line so Miles Kelly at the line and weve talked so much about the transfers tonight John but Miles Kelly me coach Stam Martin his first availability back in September as they began pre seon practice he said it flat out Miles Kelly has to play at an all ACC level for us and hes very capable I mean I think as he meshes learns to play with his new teammates his skill and ability is there he has tons of minutes under his Bel he can shoot the three go off the bouns his defense is continuing to develop so hes got the package well how about the jump he made from his freshman to his sophomore year he was averaging about Five Points T night as a freshman it jumped up to 142 points last year that was the second largest increase in the entire ACC stance got the loose ball he wants to run no look feed to kapari has it ripped away by Tyron Moore and Bradfords got Applause it Moore gets his man in the air oh that was cold cold shot F shot F side step nothing but net bottoms onepoint game Georgia Southern the eagle hanging around on kems Court and Mos now got a game high eight points and before Reeves can let it go they blow it dead the foul is going to go against Tyron Moore its going to be his Applause third he led the Eagles in threepoint shooting last year and you know Jordan Southerns bench likes it oh absolutely throwing darts out there Applause Music and Miles Kelly at the free throw line that was about as close to automatic as it came he missed his first two tonight that was shocking because last year he set the single season free throw record shooting 898 yeah not too shabby uh you know a guy named Mark price used to be a pretty good free throw shooter here at Georgia Tech as well but those are Mark Price likee numbers yeah the record the record he broke actually belonged to Anthony Morrow another great shooter out of Charlotte story career on the flats and and you go back to Anthony Morrow back in the mid 2000s a Applause foul this is going to go against Carlos Curry thats his third he picked it up so Co will check in he will spell Curry the last 145 of the half and yellow jackets boy they started cold but I think what weve seen here recently is what they expect to have most of the season and they shot 58 in their scrimmage last week against Clark Atlanta kapari hanging and a foul there on gapar hes frustrated and Georgia attack now thats their ninth team foul so the Eagles in the bonus you know fouling 94 ft from the basket allowing the Eagles to go to the line thats not what coach STM wants to see as you close out the first half Jamar Franklin at the line so now Jamar Franklin we were talking about most Spates earlier Jamar Franklin played his a ball for most Fates Club heres Ibrahim asako coming back in front end of a one and one here got it so shooting kind of mirrors each other 31 for the jackets 32 for Georgia Southern jackets hold a plus4 rebounding Advantage um its been a tight contest Wy Franklin hits him both and the leads down to one and the largest lead for either side has been six points Georgia sou Le 82 yellow jackets have left seven points at the free throw line the eight of 15 a lot of those misses coming early you know new season Jitters great move from CDE in the twoand jam get up to Sean shot fake one dribble with the splash at The Rim final minute here in the first Applause half Franklin in the lane and right over the fingertips of Tai je Claud nice touch from Jamar Franklin hes come alive the last couple of minutes Franklins had his way with Georgia Techs backboard hes getting into the paint and getting high quality shots and knocked Loose by Aaron Banks freshman checking in for the first time no look from stent Corner three Sako a battle for the rebound and its going to belong to Georgia Southern you know Georgia Tech did not convert on that play but I love the unselfishness the court Vision by sturdavant gets into the paint looks off the defender and finds a wide open shooter yellow jacks just could not convert well it has been a balance to Tech for both sides tonight eight different scores for Tech six different scores for southern and jackets four of 15 from Beyond The Arc 26 but theyve been high quality shots on most occasions where you going here uh in the bonus to want to get get something going to the rim 3 seconds Franklin final shot wont go Cools tip in they say does not count they will take a look at it but for the time being Georgia Tech but the bottom line is we got a onepoint game and 20 minutes to settle it yeah do stes a guy at Hampton 461 career assists th plus points score and then Eugene Brown probably the best player off the bench for the Buckeyes over the last couple seasons and Carlos Curry banging down low against taian Claude he gives a little stare there to Claude as Georgia Southern delivers our 10th lead change of the night coach Charlie hen where dialed that one in coming out of the timeout or halftime uh concerted effort to go right inside with was big man to get a high percentage shot Kellys threepointer down the drain Kelly as we said was Techs top scorer a year ago shot 38 from three and now a turnover kaasi Reeves lays it in he shot the Gap right there great anticipation defensively by kaasi and and thats what he can do he can help on the defensive side of the ball and uh definitely at his best in transition threepoint try one dribble and Jamar Franklin hits it and the nerves we saw in those first couple of minutes John in the first half they are long gone now yeah writing a new script for sure weve already seen more buckets in the first minute than we did in the first 10 minutes in the first Applause Music Applause half Reeves Baseline to the Lane clawed everything but the two did Applause Music well curry in the high post and Claude with the rebound thats six boards for Claude now T far gari went way up and he comes up lame its five on four right now for southern is hobbles back and he is grabbing it that left leg I think he caught a cramp in his cap hes grabbing at the Cal not the ankle and avonte Parker is on the board The Freshman stud for Georgia Southern his first points in his Eagle career how about the block shot by Curry on that play he went up and got that one and now a whistle here and I think the referees opting to stop play with kapari clearly not right Richard Stewart the trainers going to go take a look at him heres a look at it here as he goes up big time block verticality nice play by Curry but I think it just came down wrong it locked up looked like just a cramp the way he landed on it yeah grabbing that left Hur that hurts thatll thatll stop you in your tracks Reeves swirls in another one another threepointer for the yellow jackets theyve now hit their first two here to start the second half and when I get crms in my CF John that normally happens when Im lying down on the couch get up too fast Rees the Mak and Georgia product and makeing his Mark felt here the Florida transfer had two 20 plus point games you mentioned earlier at Florida but hes got it going in the second half and a little scoop there from Jamar Franklin and a foul on the floor he going to go against Miles Kelly its going to be his Applause third you see right there swatting down at the basketball and not a lot of contact but thats the thing you want to keep verticality not bail out the offensive player the arm swipe gives the official the opportunity to make that call and Jamar Franklin who is scoreless that Midway through the first half hes now become the games leading scorer with 12 points now did not start tonight and he didnt score in their exhibition but hes been the hot hand so far for southern stebo Coleman checks in for Kelly whos got the three fouls Jamar has done a nice job tonight getting into the paint and making plays uh the transfer from South Alabama he appeared in 32 games started in three uh but Stephy done a nice job today getting to the paint making plays and he gets some comments from his coach Charlie Henry again both head coaches making their debuts tonight at their respective programs Charlie Henry at Georgia Southern by way of Alabama as an assistant under Nate oats Abrams high to low Sako couldnt finish it now the other way Bryan sizing up Coleman Applause Music Tyron Moore Bluffs a long distance three he gets it inside to Carlos and good hands as Sako rips it away from Curry the loose ball paral by the yellow jackets and Amari Abram Claude sees from space back out Coleman nobody gets the foul call Charlie Henry didnt like what he what he was seeing on that play he thought it was clean well take another look at it Debo nice catch in traffic took the contact at the end on Wy yes he did and you know his brand John is is as a threepoint shooter but this stat really caught my eye he was the only player in the ACC that in conference games ranked in the top 15 in rebounds blocks and Steals and he was top 10 in all those categories so look its no question hes going to be known offensively for his threepoint shot I mean he took nearly two threes for every three shots he took but he did some other things and I think the uh assisant coaches Player Development coaches will um you know their work a guy like bonie Wells and Nate Babcock two guys with great experience in Player Development and deos going to continue to develop I me hes a junior hes made great strides already uh and and statistically you just said it I mean thats impressive and thats one of the positives too John for the NCAA greenlighting two more onc Court coaches for college basketball this year yeah I think the time watching film you know on court that works going to get done by the entire staff but the ability to spend time watching film and learning is those two positions can really help and Amari Abram a scoop and the put back from Claude Tashan claudes been impressive I mean hes a Difference Maker hes a tough matchup if hes got a guy with slower feet he can face up put it on the ground attack the boards here we go almost transition by the jackets Bryan short offensive Rebound with the right hand that time its Malik Tidwell heavyweight fight right now back and forth both teams throwing bombs they cant no one can shake the opponent yeah it went from being a rock fight early on to now this is more of a like you said a heavyweight a title Applause fight yellow jackets have won six straight games against instate competition two against Georgia two against Georgia State one against Georgia Southern one against Clayton State were tied at 42 under 15 minutes to go in the second Music half season poll the top eight and John we were looking at some scores across the league tonight Wake Forest picked to finish six there Trail by double digits headed towards halim at home against Elon anything can happen we see it every year theres so much parody in the game now and you see the low Majors knocking off the high Majors every season Georgia Tech he 13th a projection right there a little low I think W uh I think they got a chance to make some noise yeah I mean you look at where theyve been the last two years John they finished second to last two years ago and third to last the year before that and when you had a new coach coming in and you know a bunch of unknowns the transfer portal I think at the very least you would not expect them to be picked high in that preseason pole but we have seen a little more offense here in the first five minutes of this half than we did in the first half take a look at these numbers and the yellow jackets lost track of the shot clock there as danana heard the buzzer go off as he had the ball planted in his two hands yeah thats thats a tough one right there we see scoring right there first half slow starts for both teams second half both teams around 50 from the floor settling in high quality shots and again I I think defensively the Energys been great uh and consistent on both sides uh and that manufactures some easier offense and now weve got a technical foul against Pam Bryant that is the second technical that has been assessed to Georgia Southern Miles Kelly also received the technical foul see Dam and stamar not happy the shot clock violation looked like cam Bryan maybe had some words for the Jordan Tech bench on the shot clock violation as Abram hits the technical free throw and Bryans still frustrated Applause yeah not sure what happened on that possession but you know get a quiet the noise stay focused on the task at hand and its little plays like that you know one point at the free throw line and that could be the Difference Maker here in 14 minutes and 40 seconds so well see a third foul as well on cam Bryant and Abram hits the second thats an area where Jord te has left some points tonight John now nine for or 10 for 19 rather at the free throw Applause line as you can see its been back and forth all night and this foul will be against e d and danana again reaching on that possession just picked one up in the paint and that will be his second personal foul Bradford lays it in so youve got cam Bryant with three fouls Carlos curry with four great execution by the Eagles on the Baseline out of bounds play Ive been really impressed with the xs and H Reeves left the short but Dans got it kicks it out Abram whips it across to the corner Coleman cant get it the fall but he draws the foul eag foul Char and Charlie Henry Coach Henry not happy with that thats an errant foul uh after the shot and wasnt going to go in and Taran Moore picked up a foul I wish he you know probably thinks he could get that one back and Coach having words with him right now and thats Tyron Moores fourth foul foul trouble is going to be an issue from Georgia Southern from here on out Coleman hits the first of Applause three the Applause L Debo hits the second and Colin Co comes in for Georgia Southern so the Eagles right now theyre going to have to rely on guys other than their top two or three Tyron Moore cam Bryant Carlos Curry theyve lost some size out there without Curry and Coleman hits all three free throws so Tech after struggling from the free throw line in the first half theyve now hit five of their first Music seven Applause trying to find a way to penetrate Georgia Tech now doubled up free throw attempts and bend to the line 22 times as opposed to the Eagles 11 attempts and to for Gori says and I think he might be a little bit lame there too well thats now the second time hes cramped up so a little deep dehydration great teammate taon Claude helping him over to love to see that so Miles Kelly checks back into the game but definely cramping and in pain on the bench right now five to shoot Franklin set of his leading score has got two more again knifing his way into the paint and finishing at the cup hes been doing it that all game yeah hes now got 13 thats a game high so go turns it over here comes ion Parker The Freshman spinning pausing lifting its short and the rebound into the hands to Amari Abram Music Kelly tick back sakos got it Second Chance opportunity another rebound and before the jump ball a foul called thats going to be an avonte Parker Credit Sak two great passes recognition of open Shooters didnt go down but give your teammate uh you know give him some help give him the assist knock one down for him sakos trying to help you unselfish play at its finest and Miles Kelly off the inbounds a little bit of a Roar and look at the offensive glass there John thats been a telling number the jackets now plus seven and a timeout call by Georgia Southern they got to talk things over still only a threepoint game but the Eagles facing foul trouble and the momentum turning against him on top in the sunb well one thing we know for sure nobody really has a strong opinion I mean James Madison they got the seven first place votes but everyone else has a sprinkled first place vote here and there and should be a lot of fun to watch Sun Belt Conference basketball in Georgia Southern you know similar to Georgia Tech in a lot of ways you know they just havent finished very high in the standings recently and theyre picked to finish 13th out of 14 so the Eagles out of the break its Avante Parker The Freshman hit 28 in their exhibition just two points tonight hes got a couple more that was a you know the The Savvy and the Poise to to not travel take the contact finish with the left hand off the glass a timely basket for the Eagles onepoint game hes out of Columbia South Carolina the gray Academy they feed it back to Claud has a lot of time to think about it its wide right Tidwell Bradford in Rhythm short Stant will three on Music Applause two lob entry crosscourt the extra pass to Coleman he drains it Debo Coleman now with 10 points tonight great recognition by Claude he drew the double team had the rotation defensively scrambling and Debo knocks it Down on the Corner Georgia Tech now three of six from distance this half Just a Touch Too Strong that time Stan Kelly feeling it well its no question John weve talked about both first year coaches theyve got NBA backgrounds Charlie Henry Georgia Southern assisted with the bulls for a couple years Damon stamar in addition to playing in the NBA he also coached the last couple of Seasons with the Celtics also with the Grizzlies about 10 years ago and the threepointers a big part of the NBA game isnt it yeah and Ive really noticed the spacing uh the emphasis on spacing and isolation plays finding the mismatch right there you see a nice Inn out on the double but but Charlie Henry we spoke to him yesterday afternoon he talked all about about spacing and finding mismatches well talk some more of that about that when we come back the yellow jackets leading 52 48 its been Deo Coleman Off the Bench with 10 for the wh and goal give Rees the assist jackets up four try and survive some foul trouble Tyron Moore Carlos Curry each with four you got cam Bryant and DeVante Parker with three and John you know they havent had to pay for it on the scoreboard necessarily as the yellow jackets turn over the Eagles out of the timeout because Jordan Tech shooting below 60 from the free throw line but if they dont get those guys back in soon this game could get away from them thats two possession gam so and again the the roster a little bit depleted like you said du Ste Eugene Brown David Jones not not playing on the on the Georgia Southern Rosell so theyre thin already they cannot afford foul trouble and Kelly nearly snuck up behind t well so theyre going to have the lead on couple of their bench players Colin Co The Freshman out there down in the post this here is Cam Bryant hes playing with three and he lays it in right there isolation find the advantage go at it Charlie Henry spoke all about that yesterday on the phone we interviewed him well that goes back to the spacing like you said and I think thats thats an NBA mindset right when you look at the pieces on the chessboard and see where do I have my opponent beat and Kelly keeps it in pounds Applause somehow nice bounce pass the jack is Whi it around its stur and he connects big shot by the senior sturdavant great ball Movement by the yellow jackets unselfish play Ive been impressed with the ball movement tonight by the yellow jackets threepoint shootings not dropping at the rate they would want but that was a big shot by Stan credit the unselfish play way C Bryant fade away no thats your point about Kyle stent you look at you know the last eight games of last season a lot of people forget he averaged 13 points and six assists in those final eight games best stretch of his Tech Career Coleman got it oh that was pure and I like it another assist Debo points to his point guard stter van uh you know the little things like that the camaraderie uh I love that Debo pointed to to his point guard after making the three and getting the assist its now five threes on nine shots for Jord Tech in this half and Colin cool talking about Poise underneath and hes a freshman uh you know the Holly Springs North Carolina product hes hes a nice looking freshman for the Sun Belt sixpoint Edge for Georgia Tech that eightpoint lead was their largest of the Applause night Claude an aggressive one hand bounce pass its a battle and we got a jump ball the Aro pointing to Georgia Music Applause Tech Georgia Tech with a sixpoint lead theyve theyve got a chance to maybe get a little bit of breathing room have not been able to create separation and a Timeout on the floor from George te coach statamire senses this opportunity John he wants to talk it over and see if they can avoid a photo finish here on opening night and mayor Andre Dickens all Georgia Tech alumni taking in game one of this season and game one of the Damon statamire era and John as we were going to break you pointed out that Georgia Tech perhaps trying to take advantage of this opportunity to pull away and the reason they have it is because they have shot the ball from threepoint land much better than what we saw in the first half yeah and credit dvo deos knocked down two threes in the second half Coleman now with 13 points hes four of seven from the line but three of four from Beyond The Arc so yellow jackets taking high percentage shots unselfish play stens had some nice assists Wy yellow jackets have six seconds to shoot here out of the inbounds pass Kelly lets it Fly and he gets it ninepoint ads for the yellow jackets and Miles Kelly hes got 14 points to lead All Tech scores yeah he made something out of nothing right there put the body on cool bumped him off raised up tough shot cam Bryant taking on Sturdivant and theyre going to get Sturdivant for a foul Applause there Charlie Henrys just going to ride that cam Bryant mismatch right right there but look at this the Poise the step back just enough space great execution by Miles Kelly timely shot Yellow Jackets now with their largest lead of the game nine 746 to play but going after uh cam Bryant that mismatch isolation and on Q John that ninepoint lead forces coach Henrys hand and a blocking foul there on Coleman Bryant reaches in to help him up but look at who back in the game for Georgia Southern Tyron Moore and Carlos cier are both back with four fouls yeah they weather the storm a little Coleman lets see this lets get another look Oh I thought he could have got the charge there it was a head play by Coleman didnt get it here we go again isolation ball and this time thats an offensive foul on cam Bryant and he reached around wasy Reeves I think that might have been a little bit of a makeup right there a little wrap at the end Applause but the official crew kind of felt like they missed the first one and wanted to even the score so Bryant Curry and Moore all with four fouls seven and a half to play Curry gets it down to Claude Applause and Miles Kelly Coleman out on the same page and credit the Eagles uh you know they jumped the basketball right there almost 10 seconds left from the shot clock they went with a hard trap and forced the turnover little Run and Jump action 10 seconds under on the clock georia teen eight turnovers in the first half theyve done a marginally better job taking care of the basketball here in the second and theres a turnover forced by T sturtivant and Deo Coleman with the hammer bring the house down Stan gets the assist thats the energy they want right now turning great defense into solid offense Debo with the exclamation point on that one he got up and for the first time tonight weve got a double digit lead threepointer and Georgia Southern needed that Carlos curry went 0 for two all of last year from three John hes two for two tonight I think I know what he was doing this summer yeah absolutely four rebounds nine points to go with hes been straddled on the bench with four personals thats a big big AB Smiles Kelly matches yeah speaking of being straddled Carlos Curry was straddled at the bench now he straddled On the Floor Tech up 11 Tidwell musling his way hes a born scorer 511 but average 21 points points last year this is his first ever division one game in his fifth year of college Applause basketball no problem scoring in the second half kaasi Reeves hes in on the party another triple and it is rolling the tunami heat it up Tai Shawn the kick out to Kelly the unselfish one timer to the corner buckets jackets now in control for the first time in this one up 12 530 to play Claude spin move nearly C at the fall around two Defenders oh and Curry and Moore had their minds on different things another turnover jackets have hit five straight Applause threes and a foul on Avante Parker and stent uh he dodged a turnover right there it was a long flat kind of lacad isical pass lante just didnt have eyes on the ball so Parker becomes the fourth eagle with four fouls eie danana his full name is Ebenezer but goes by eie he in and receives the inbounds pass 5 minutes Georgia Tech trying to Salt this one away the largest lead of the night they have gone eight for 12 from Beyond The Arc this half and got a charge on the baseline or stepping on the line a bounce I think Reeves just paint in the sideline with his heel thats what I think it was Georgia Souther needs a run Tyron Moore trying to give it to him thats a start hes now got 10 four of nine from the field two of those coming from Beyond The Arc and hes got four rebounds to go with it Kelly down the lane what a move Miles Kelly oh and a turnover Reeves the yellow jackets out and running Coleman lays it in Debo Coleman now with 15 points and the timeout called by Georgia Southern Coleman first the assist to Kelly for the three kaazi Reeves geia Tech need a spark Off the Bench and thats a spark right there the flush with the 40 Georgia Tex Trio though Kelly Reeves Coleman 13 points for Kelly Reeves eight 133 for Kelly seven of n collectively from Beyond The Arc thats been the difference somebody I want say I dont know maybe hour hour and a half ago talked about how Debo Coleman could be a spark plug Off the Bench who was that John hey you know I had a crystal ball dont share that with anybody but unselfish play I mean credit sturing has been an impact player right now in terms of just pushing Tempo seeing the floor and then taan claw drawing double teams and finding the open man its been beautiful to watch in the second half Georgia Tech playing unselfish basketball and thats reflected in the assist total as well 16 assists on 24 buckets meanwhile Georg Southern you know theyve struggled to get that going a little bit just six assists on their 22 field Music goals and georia Tech 13 of 22 from the free throw line so theyve left nine points at the free throw line they would have some serious breathing room if they were shooting the free throw well tonight so Parker hits the first not the second Tech has made eight of the last nine shots from the field trying to milk a little bit of clock here perhaps as we get to the final minutes Kelly thats been his spot and it will continue to be hes feeling it Wy he is feeling it and he gets the rebound off the long Miss from Parker Kelly 22 points on eight of 17 from the floor four of nine from Beyond The Arc five rebounds three assists to go with it what a second half hes putting on a show yeah its only one night but he looks all ACC youre in game number one Wy dont put that pressure on him I mean hey Im not putting it on him Coach coach stoutmire said it all right before the season to the media in a press conference we need Miles Kelly to be all ACC not allamerican hey iron sharpens iron let him have it lets go allamerican first team Wy his coach did it you got to vote David statamire first team AllAmerican Mighty Mouse Claude hits the first free throw its that foul charg to Jamar Franklin is that the double double right there taon Claude 10 points 10 B boards three assists I like his court Vision I his ability to take care of the basketball find the open man draw some double teams hes going to be a mismatch problem can face up put it on the ground versatile player his 15th career double double is first as a yellow jacket and itll be Jord Tech Applause basketball Ill tell you what the Eagles Georgia Southern uh gave the jackets all they could handle for a good 32 minutes of this one it was a one possession game and then jacket just poured it on late and thats now two times out on the floor this year if you count the exhibition John that Georgia Tech has shot the three extremely well tonight theyre at 46 number will go down a little bit there with Debo but thats going to be a huge part of this teams offensive game game plan and quite plainly if they dont shoot it well theyre not going to have the success they want this season and weve seen it twice now where they have multiple guys who can hit from long range and Reeves draws the foul and a reach Applause inag foul going to be on Malik Tidwell I really like what I see out of Jamar Franklin tonight hes been impressive definitely caught my eyes get into the paint uh theyre putting him in ISO situations hes a tough guard hes got length strength hes agile uh hes made the most of his minutes tonight well its important to note too weve talked about it a couple of times but normally on opening night you expect to at least be at full strength for one game neither of those teams made it through the preseason unscathed by injury Georgia Southern without their top point guard Duce Dean tonight one of their most promising post players Eugene Brown I third a transfer from Ohio State and then David Jones another big piece in their front Court also out tonight meanwhile Georgia Tech theyre missing Lance Terry who as you pointed out second leading returning scorer averaged 10 points a night last year and Im telling you the one name that we havent had a chance to talk about tonight because he hasnt been on the court but by and Dango Ive talked to some people around the program John they feel like he could very well be their number one option at the five spot as just a freshman thats impressive uh yeah dep uh the dep of the jackets uh Ive been impressed they they can legitimately go 10 11 deep and the you know the physicality of it they look even the younger guys look ready to go and thatll be it there as you get a look at in Dongo or the Jord Tech bench rather thats actually Ibrahim shaare theres indongo there with the cast on sitting next to Lance Terry but but you know thats going to be a market change if youve watched or Tech basketball The Last 5 Years youre going to see a much deeper rotation Miles Kelly finishing opening night in style and a little words afterwards perhaps weve already seen Kelly charge with one technical tonight thats the length youre talking about John hes a talent I mean he he can do a lot of things well and hes only going to get better under the tutelage of a guy like Damon STM and the coaching staff hes assembled foul Char the eag 11 weve got a foul here on Jamar Music Franklin and a technical foul has been assessed to Debo Coleman and its a double technical cuz Jamar Frank was also assessed a technical foul we got our fair share of technical fouls tonight havent we weve seen a few and uh you know deos got to have the maturity to to walk away from that you know its usually the second guy that gets caught uh in that case you know he retaliated so five total technicals tonight but the jackets a 20point lead in the closing moments and they turn over Georgia Southern Applause again so jackets up 20 head coach Damon stmy gets his first head coaching victory at home on krins court here at Mish Pavilion in Atlanta I would say its been a more than a successful debut sturdavant he found that shooting stroke at the end of last season General looks like its survived the off season may have even been improved he looks great six assists one turn turnover thats what he does great his assisted turnover ratio hes a floor General throwing eight points hes three of five from the field two of three from behind the arc shot selection on point what you would expect from a senior and Bradford stepped on the line this will kill the shot clock Miles Kelly 25 Applause points and talk about a phenomenal second half 19 of those 25 coming in the final 20 minutes seven for 10 overall and four for six for threepoint land Tech hit nine of 14 threes in the second half and they will cruise to a comfortable win here on opening night the yellow jackets have won five with their last eight season openers seven straight against instate opponents and most importantly the Damon statam era begins with a w oh
