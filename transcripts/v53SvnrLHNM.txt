opened the pain up for him and hes flourishing and it I think his ability now to stretch the defense put the ball on the floor just be an overall great athlete has helped his Georgia Tech Team so see if he does enough tonight to get them over to home Sean Padula in the Hokies 15 and 10 overall five and nine in the ACC Joe linardi right now says they are considered yeah for his Fields they are the 11th team out and Leonardis mind and this is a game they have to win no theres no question if they have any hopes to con to finish this season like they did last year and get to the ncaas this is a must win game for the hopes slick alternate uniforms for Georgia Tech here at home they start out with Lance Terry missing from deep and we show you the Virginia Tech starters once again no Darius Maddox so another start for the Freshman MJ Collins bazillis now the scoring leader and Padula gets 15 and a half per game as the sophomore point guard both teams coming out strong defensively this Jordan Tech Team defensively has gotten better Applause heres MJ Collins striving and bazilly follows it up and now Georgia Tech to check out their starters we told you its small ball Lance Terrys been a major key as well and no Davon Smith for Georgia Tech in this one he hurt his ankle again yesterday at practice so he is out for the jackets and theyre gonna miss him what a move by Jayvon Franklin thats what has happened since last year hes come back in the lineup as we talked about in the opening Jayvon Franklin the paint just opens up now its not clogged up so now you pressure him he just can put it on the floor like that just drive right by you talked about trying to solve Georgia Techs defenses defense has been better like you said for the jackets and theyre going to play a ton of them Lots banging in the post and a foul is called so theres Josh pastner would you agree that between him and then Mike Young on the other side weve got the coaches with the most defensive options in passner and Mike young with the biggest offensive we do everyone knows who plays against the Mike young coach team that he runs so many plays it forces you to focus on your your defensive philosophy and your Technique just got to stay down and you cant guard everything and I dont think anyone changes defenses as much as Jordan Tech does I mean they go for man they go to one three one two three Zone theyll run some triangling two theyll mix up quite a bit of different defenses at night lets see which one they stick with which one bothers Virginia Tech and Josh passner always does that but we asked him today even more so today and he said yes because hes trying to get the Hokies out of rhythm well I think hes theyre embracing the role of the spoiler Buster getting better I mean this is the team the star of the year I know theyve had suffered some losses early the team is playing good basketball right now Miles Kelly on the drive had it roll off Franklin and offensive rebound and then mutts strict him Applause oh good fine Petula for basily thats been his biggest adjustment I think early on he was a guy that everyone considered playing on the perimeter he is now punishing smaller guys and his ability to post up inside and willingness to post up inside is really giving his team to hope hes a step toward again making that adjustment again Kyle Sturtevant from straight on for three Kyles another guy that benefited from this small ball lineup hes a double figure score as well and senior from hometown at Five Points against Wake Forest in that close loss Saturday before that three straight and double figures Brazilian yeah he can still do it on the outside too yeah dont forget about him out there hes only shooting 39 I mean not many guys have a five man that can do that oh and he goes up and gets the block at The Rim and thats not what youre expecting him to do to meet you at the square months on the Drive Franklin got a piece of it and then off mutts and it belongs to Georgia Tech its a great defensive possession there get it out of here Laughter lion vasilia attacking the paint I mean hes protecting the paint there and hes got all seven as well Kelly said hes got to have a big game tonight he needs to have a big game hes weve got a lot of different guys going and miles Kellys in a little bit of a shooting slump he needs to its great for him to see the first one go in he is their leading scorer and nearly 13 the game Franklin got the tip pushes Sturtevant Rises knocks down another their transition has been better weve watched in the last couple of games and theyve outscored their opponent in transition you know for a team that struggled to score with the small ball lineup its allowed them to get out in transition Applause hes got all nine for the Hokies I mean hes his willingness to be down there on that block and identifying hes just so much bigger than Jayvon Franklin and hes going at him inside Franklin is listed at six foot seven gazilly at six nine thats being kind you said it not me I I think hes well with the hairstyle these six seven yeah Josh Pastor said earlier this year it might be more like six five as mutt scores off the high low thats the guy I think theyre going to have the most difficult time with matching up with Justin mutts I mean he plays a lot bigger as well than his actual size and with the four guard lineup one of the guards was gonna have to guard him to watch more of the highlow action with them you can see a concerted effort by but I hope hes to go inside Holmen comes up short off the back cut plenty of offense so far in Brazilian at it stripped itll stay with Virginia Tech on the other side weve got plenty of offense out of the gates first five minutes on the flats six since that seven game losing streak in ACC action we told you Joe linardi says they are considered right now his 11th team out so to speak and this is a quad three game that they cannot afford to lose and theyre on the road again and remember that win they had in South Bend Indiana on Saturday their first road win of the season in early February if you can believe that but theyre gonna have to change some things again theyre gonna have to go on the road finish out strong this year as Mike told us early Mike young told us earlier today that you know they spent all the extra money that they had you know they built up so much Equity early in the season with such a strong start and then they lose seven straight and now theyre figuring things out theyre defending better they won four of their last six and theyre going to need another strong finish like they had a year ago if they want to get back in the NCAA tournament yeah thats how Mike young put it to us today exactly right he said we had a whole lot of house money built up in early January and what do you tell us I hate giving back house muddy no one likes giving back a House Bunny and Mike said young said he hates it more than anyone so he stood up as if he was at the blackjack table and he mentioned that in particular well they got to get through tonight then they got some Slough trip you know slitting ahead with the pit in Miami at home and those are Muslim games as well and then after that oh just a trip to Cameron yeah Applause watch ahead Justin mutts stay now Applause kid is defending Jordan Mecca a couple of Reserve digs one on each side into the game Off the Bench its got to be a concerted effort if you enjoy the tech of boxing out and rebounding its getting hurt early here tough shot no Debo Coleman and then Neko was the last to touch it after this slap somebody better put a body on this young man he has taken no prisoners flying in Miles Kelly this was happening when you dont box out my man Music small ball lineup you got to get in there and put your body on someone zone or man lets look right down at Miles Kelly as well after the flush Applause and then kid on the face up now Applause Tech seems to be mashing up a little bit where the ball goes into the middle of that zone they seem to be matching up going more man and man trying to identify find the shooters for Virginia Tech kid clears the start of a mess Couture cant knock it down 42 from Deep second best in the ACC only behind NC States Casey Marcel start of it on a step back comes up empty well Davon Smith we told he is out today with the ankle injury also missed the game a couple of weeks ago with the same issue to the same ankle and Josh passner said to us this afternoon when it rains it pours its a big loss because hes I dont think theres a player in the league is that dynamic as he is in transition I mean guys like him they got a skill set you cant teach an open floor they just give you that oneonone ability when the offense breaks down its given the ball he can go make a play and they dont have anyone else on their team that does what he does thats a big loss for yellow jackets Jalen Moore 14 in white has just checked into the game and Josh passner singled him out in front of the whole team at the end of shoot around today and said no reason you cant have a double double in this game they got to win that match up right now theyre losing it with a small ball lineup because they punished him inside so he has to play bigger than his actual size there he is handling and now dropping it out for Miles Kelly as the drought continues offensively for Georgia Tech Kelly short long rebound to Terry climbs it up basketball guys always reward you if you work hard enough getting off his a rebound last Terry knocks down an open three at the top of the key hes been huge in both of Georgia Techs ACC wins this season 19 points and the gamewinning bucket last week against Notre Dame and a big day in the win over Miami but zilly couldnt follow it two and done for Virginia Tech great job by Georgia Tech theyre getting wide in that one three one eliminating that corner three we talked about when you want to hurt this defense you get to the corners theyre doing a great job of taking that away Steve Coleman in the midrange what defense do you think is best for Georgia Tech against the Hokies offensively well you dont know because everybody all I think a lot of teams are afraid the one thing I like about Josh pastner is that hes not afraid to run zone no matter who theyre playing against and people just make the Assumption because team has threepoint shooters that you shouldnt run Zone and you just dont know how theyre shooting and right now you know Virginia Tech is not knocking down those threes from behind the line theyre one of five right now so the zone is effective Josh passner told his team at the end to shoot around today communication is going to be their biggest key because of how much theyre going to change defense and then theyre going to switch some so when you got the four guards it doesnt matter who guard two you just gotta switch they just got to have a big body on the bigs inside and right now this boy Junior Tech hokey team is really big a duel off the turnover right back from Georgia Tech and now a drop off for John Camden who missed it at The Rim yellow Jacks got lucky with that careless with the basketball and Purdue lays it off to Camden and he missed the Lefty Lane theres Mecca getting considerable first half run for Georgia Tech Off the Bench theyre trying to pressure the highest post pass foul is called on John Camden and it sends us to a town now Georgia Tech by three at home against the hope esners got his team playing a whole lot better over the last couple of weeks theyve got the lead on Virginia attack and we told you about the small ball last three games coming into tonight these six guys have played about 90 percent of tax minutes his interesting to see now because with with Davon Smith out you know not having him available today hes forcing coach Pastor to go into his bench and weve seen Mecca play a little bit earlier and he hasnt played much because he still hadnt seen Rodney Howard so be interested to see hes continuing with the small lineup he got five guards out there essentially and theyve scored offensively and right now theyre doing a pretty solid job on the offensive on the defensive glass we talked to Jayvon Franklin today after shoot around and we talked about that lineup and specifically with the offense and he said theyre just moving the ball a whole lot better so it gives him space you know he gets to catch it you know in free throw line area hed like to catch the pinch post there to start their offense and it gets some space we saw with the first basket of the game with him driving to the room passed it up for Lance Terry with a burst now back out more shot clock winding down and more did he get it off no its a shot clock violation well Josh passing we said theyre playing better they got the win last week against Notre Dame and then a onepoint loss in WinstonSalem on Saturday and boy was he frustrated at the end of that well rightfully so thats a game that they had they just got the ball in bounds it would have been fouled and just ended the game unable to close it I mean thats just what happens when your team is not confident in closing out games and another inside basket there pretty easy lay there by Grandpa cell hes got 11 Kelly no rebound secured by Couture and just to put a bow on that uh loss in WinstonSalem Josh passenger he made a beeline for the officials after the game and he told us today that there was a cop there and he told the cop I dont want to spend the rest of my night in WinstonSalem hes very appreciative of the officials and Jim Phillips directive about commenting on officials after the game well you know everyone kind of says they want the players to play the game but you gotta operate in the rules and when the official makes a call Ive never seen one take it away when theyve made it so no just gotta go with it and its a hard job it really is absolutely seeing things a lot of times with the shot clock winding down nice run again to his right hand hes a big body guard and when he drives left there spins back he gets his defender on his hip carving out space over the top of Mecca Grant vasilius eating and eating well so far in this first half get your Bojangles I gotta get you some too we gotta get you some more jackets when you get out of here Kelly hello Music Applause oh wow Kelly with a nice reverse laid here shes got five leading scorer like you said Couture on a drive and a kick for Collins short mutts on the second and third effort a couple of offensive rebounds that the Hokies hadnt been able to finish inside after theyve gotten it good hands by Brazilian this is Nifty look at this back door cut there gets it MJ impersonation with the reverse lay there I would say I can jump like that but I never could even in my best day its great Hang Time great athletic finish there by Miles Kelly its great to see him get going in he struggled quite a bit lately and good see the ball go through the basketball hes talked about how teams have played him tighter as his sophomore season has unfolded and how he started the year well Mike Devoe was the guy a year ago to you know you always got a guy to scheme from coming to this year and he was a guy on The Scouting Report as a freshman that had upside but now theyre scheming a lot of guys are struggling with that I think Sean Padula is getting that with Virginia Tech such as dominant star to the season now teams are scheming him and hes starting to settle back into his role of just running the team and letting the offense come to him but its an adjustment being on The Scouting reported in a team scheming you and trying to youre the focal point of them stopping you and its adjustment for players Kelly out right now its Franklin Moore Coleman Terry and Sturtevant the five poor Josh passner Franklin backs it out for Coleman yes he is starting to shoot the three ball well we talked about I love to mix up with him of mixing up the paint threepoint shooting oh hes in the past I thought hed settled for jump shots now hes attacking the pain and talk to a good start here five threes for a team that makes seven a game Padula tough one he gets it to go you wouldnt know what Bashan Padula really productive in the post to me he will post you up and very comfortable for a small guard to be in there playing amongst the trees his first points of the game and now Malaysia Poteet picks up another foul thats his second Georgia Tech leads by four well on his way up you know he said hes gonna give it a shot I think hes welded his weighted just going 3390 scoring inside hes going out hes having his way right now theres no match up right now on the floor for Georgia Tech against him and hes having his way set in the tone and six of nine from the floor and hes carrying his team right now he needs to find somebody off the bench give him some help but he is well up to the task and hes turned himself into a heck of a player we asked him earlier today whats been the biggest difference and he said confidence as this years gone along and we asked the same thing of Mike young and he put it a little differently he said the point guard relationship for basili with Padula that has improved over the course of the season and then he thought about it this morning he said you know what grandpa zillys just playing hard time and he was yeah I mean thats what we talked about in the open just the the adjustment from a mid major to High Mage particularly for a big sometimes theres a physical adjustment and you know having the confidence when youre playing in this league and youre playing against guys like Armando Baker and all these guys you just need a little confidence and he definitely has that now First Virginia Tech player with backtoback 30point game since 2003 start event couldnt beat the shot clock and a nice Follow by Jalen Moore doing exactly what Josh pastner expected out of him coach challenged him to get double digit rebounding and you dont have to get just defensive rebounds you know Im sure he doesnt mind getting an offensive glass as well he said plays like that at the rim and then Coleman picked it from Collins Sturdivant a drop off for more and he is fouled by Collins great job at Georgia Tech theyre out there wide and the wings theyre getting deflections creating offensive opportunities and track fast break giving them chances on the offensive glass like that just its a better team I mean theyre just a better team than they were throw the record out this Georgia Tech team is going to be a tough out for the remainder of the year puts Jalen Moore at the line sophomore from Gardendale Alabama hey ACC Unity week tips off Saturday weve got an accn mens basketball double dip for you Pitt at Virginia Tech hit 123 half game ahead of Virginia to start the night Virginia is at Louisville and then Clemson at Louisville Clemson is the first team out right now according to Joe Leonard I I think some teams theyre one of the teams that are struggling because of their recent ski and I think its also their nonconference Cutters catching up a little bit but I I think theyll do enough theyll close the season strong theyre playing well right now up against 14 against Florida State goaltending on Jalen Moore punch team hit a tough stretch I think theyre home now and looking to get back on a winning track and how about Pitt at 123 like we said another win last night Blake Henson hit six more threes you know the most impressive thing is that theres I think theres six and one in a row in the ACC if you think about that like Road winds are just so hard to come by and theyre theyre better on the road than theyve been at home and I think their schedule is just favorable for those guys I think theyll get a chance to to run the table and finish with it first or second if not get the regular season title they got a legitimate shot at it hell come down to that game in Miami last game of the year yeah what a huge one that is in Coral Gables to finish off the season yeah and thats provided they dont have a lead I mean they dont have a twogame league because then it wouldnt matter I just think that their schedule is favorable and the experience and their guard play makes them just a difficult team and they got closers I mean I think JB Burton is as good a player and worthy of All Conference calculates theyre in Atlanta its Georgia Tech by five you can see the house third events all right after getting some medical attention on the sideline he loves that spot missed it Franklin battles and tips it back out to start of it Coleman Rises too strong and now here we go more blood yeah more blood from Kyle Sturdivant gonna have to sub him out at least he got a shot up before he can win out of the game it didnt stop him getting another three up hes off to a good start shooting the basketball here and a shot from his spot yeah hes knocked down two threes and missed it from his patent midrange show Brazilian good pass for mutts at The Rim those two do a really good job of finding each other and thats what the silly provides he can play outside and you have to guard him you have to get out there and put pressure on him if not hes showing you his ability to find teammates as well Franklin spinning out of that high post spot in the Princeton offense Moore tries to follow still battles for it and gets wrapped up by bazilly and Jalen Moores activity making a difference off the Georgia Tech bench he has answered the challenge there from his head coach I mean Jalen Moore is active on the offensive glass getting his hands on basketballs and just playing really physical inside for a team thats undersized and playing with the small ball lineup like coach said hes going to need him to play with you know bigger than his size and hes up to the task so far and we quote what Josh passner said to Jalen Moore your energy and rebounding have to show up shot blocking making things happen at The Rim you have a great opportunity tonight but you have to go make it happen and he said that to Jalen in front of the entire team at the end of shoot around he did and hes doing his job so far hes really active and awesome glass now I dont know how many shots hes gonna block tonight I mean hes a little bit undersized in there but you know hey hes hes answered the Bell right now he really has and theyre going to need his activity again hes benefiting the paints opening up for everyone and the ballot scoring is what you see so far from the tech team and what theyll need man youre just the height police on everyone tonight huh yeah yeah you know oh counted for Grant basili and the foul and now a conference between Ted Valentine and Matt Porter and they do count it they gotta count him to scooping late the silly fakes the dribble handoff takes the bump from Kelly closes his eyes and throw it up against the glass and it goes in theyre gonna come to the monitor now just to check who the foul is on and I think it Smiles Kelly here from the right side there unless he called the push from Debo I think its Miles Kelly on a trip facilities flexing on the ground I would too if I had 15 of my teams 25 points and while we have a moment we remind you that Thursday night womens basketball its a double header for you Tanaya Latson leads number 24 Florida State against Syracuse at six Eastern and then Deja Kelly and number 19 Carolina against Diamond Johnson and NC State right here on accn and the ESPN app so Ted Valentine and Matt Potter talk things over and assess the foul changed it so they say its on the floor on the floor huh when Ted Valentine came over he said Yes Virginia Tech bench that he was checking who it was off yes entry for basily he missed it Mike young wanted a foul call there Terry on the Baseline back out Kelly connects great Drive Great drift to the corner by Kelly knocked down his second three and we get it time out with five minutes to go taken by Mike young well take it as well gone for 30 seconds then back to Atlanta actually given Grant pizzilli the bucket and then they took it away yeah and then brazily did not get fouled in the post and just like that Georgia Tech up seven and Mike young needed the timeout so fivepoint swing potential his six point swing I mean he would have went to the line for three points himself and goes down into Miles Kelly knocks down another three here thank you see if the Hokies come up with out of the timeout theyre struggling to score this changing defenses this really throws you off and looks like Georgia Techs going to that triangle and two here theyre guarding the silly and theyre guarding for doing under control yeah Applause this is something that Josh pastner worked on at length with his team today and they were content to give up shots like that from the perimeter to Justin Motz three guys on the floor now they gotta find Franklin met by brazili the Billys The Protector Rim has been so impressive you know about his offensive game and we know much as an elite Defender but facilities run protection has just been outstanding so far same with Jayvon Franklin who gets a block Music Franklin bounces for more off a great cut mutts commits his first theyre both controlling the game just doing it in different ways Jayvon Franklin here just doing a great job finding his teammates he does that a lot at the point of the Princeton offense hes the guy they run their offense through he just does so much for this team I think both the matchup of these bigs would be interesting to see how it goes right now basilis dominating on the offensive end but Trayvon Franklin is doing so many different things as well Franklins got five rebounds and a couple of assists and a nice fine for more hes got six rebounds at Four Points and he looks pretty exhausted as he made his way to the freethrow line getting these heavy minutes here in the first half look at the lineup that they have now youre talking about the small ball lineup of Georgia Tech but now basilis in and hes moved up to the three so you got Lynn kidding at the five just as much as the four because their star for offense right now on his Zone and then matchups that theyre giving him the looks its just giving so many different problems and they need a silly shooting because now hes the guy that theyre guarding in the Triangle kid pivoting and hes swatted by Franklin goodness Franklin blocked that to South Carolina right now wow that was that went across half court medulla no Coleman runs it down the jackets push Coleman attacks and he gets bumped by Couture picks up his first foul Jayvon Franklin you said controlling it on one end and then this kind of Defense as well yes he jumped up set that to Cartersville look at that that ball flies out of there got a ball game here in Midtown and all changing up his defenses if you had triangle in two coming out in the first half collector winnings hey I dont know of many but hes done that in the past I mean I dont think its anything new I mean if you play against his team hes known for his own defenses and switching man to man I thought last week against wake they really got off the wake of the defense have been playing their mantoman and they were solid in it and didnt run as much Zone in the second half but I think the key is even in there one three one theyre wide theyre taking away that pass to the corner which has hurt them and theyre finding the shooters and the zika tech is not shooting the ball well from behind the line theyre one of eight here early in Yellow Jackets are six of twelve man who who thought that wow again they average seven and by the way on the defense for Josh passner he doesnt call it triangling two he calls it tandem and triangle everyone has a different name no one calls it triangling too we were trying to keep up with all the nomenclature earlier today medulla missed it and then tipped home kid and Franklin both went up for it at The Rim I think thats where theyre going to have to punish this Georgia Tech Team and particularly with this lineup thats out there theyre just so big again they have the Justin mutts basili and lint kids so would you stay big Colins out right now they get Franklin for a foul and Hunter Couture is down he plays so hard he plays so physical I think he just ran into the screen I think he just hit his shoulder I just where they matched up I dont think there was anything intentional when I think hes asking them what did I do he just caught him with his shoulder in his face and tell you from a guards perspective when youre running through screens smaller guys always take the brunt of that I dont think its much to see it wasnt any militias he just stood there and I didnt think it was really illegal to screen I just think it was he heard tough guy like that its not going to come out of the game hes as tough as they come and glad hes okay he is football tough from his days playing football growing up remember he missed the four games earlier this year with a fractured elbow oh man Justin mutts cross over to slant but said jump up and block that Music Justin butts has had some highlight real plays in this first half and the Hokies are within six approaching two and a half to go until intermission Coleman underneath great job great find there you go Coleman has just been mixing it up you havent seen him post up very often and thats a great play coming out take advantage of his physicality hes got 11 playing inside out like youve always wanted him to do I think hes settled too much in the past and flat seeds mixing it up long two for Sean Padula and Mike Youngs barking at his bench to maybe amp up some defensive intensity playing for a lot right now and this is where they got to get better they got to get better on the defensive end more cant knock it down hes only made four of them this year rule is shut off by Kelly now Coleman switches on Couture triggers too strong Applause Franklin comes up to get it and the Princeton action for Georgia Tech now Kelly Couture presses out on him Colemans had a half and it continues 14 for Debo Coleman Music is starting to figure some things out when this young man bounces the scoring attack on the inside and outside hes a handful and shoot 32 percent from three on the year and if hes knocking down shots look out brazili for kid and Franklin the rebound Applause we want you guys to take open shots and but these teams have scouted each other so well when you get to this point in a year theres no secrets and the guys they want to scheme and take shots away from their doing so when theyre forcing the road guys to take shots they want them kids to take midrange shots they want Justin much on the other end they dont want that guy some threes Miles Kelly with the eighth Georgia Tech three of this half and the lead is a dozen with a handoff for kid Applause Terry got it off and its a 10point halftime lead for Georgia Tech here on the flats eight threes here in the first half by Georgia Tech up 10 here got a great second half on the way well go to the breakin then after in the studio Drew Carter Luke Hancock and Joel Berry in the studio made at halftime to kind of figure out you know what to do against this Georgia Tech defense I I think the changing of the defense and its always hard for guards because you dont know how to attack it you dont know what theyre in you got to get your teammates involved in it and right now theyre coming out with an aggressive one three one here with Jalen Moore at six foot seven at the top of it for Josh pastner and his group defensively Virginia Tech works it underneath to Grant pizzilli and he gets the roll and hes up to 15 points theyre always going to look to put Justin mutts in the middle of any Zone because hes the best passer on his team he leads his team in assist and you know with an underrated stat for him is hes a hes close to having 400 assists in his career you know thats that thats not often from from before four man in any any level at any school for that matter thats just difficult to do yeah hes got five already here in this one Coleman wow hes feeling it wow ECheck to check Applause and right now Virginia Tech you got to be concerned because its just you know you come into a game and youre scheming a team and thats the way to answer it if you got a guy like on a guitar you know someone has to get hot heal Sean Padula has to start knocking down shots and right now they hadnt needed to guard the guards at Virginia Tech because the front line has done so much damage again first points for Couture who didnt come off the floor in the first half for Mike Young plant Starry got run over setting a screen and the foul goes against the Hokies on MJ Collins yeah you love the physicality he scored a couple of times hes trying to get through the screen and hey hes tough and physical we can say that no broke nose or a lost tooth wont change that about the young man MJ Collins has been in some collisions now over the last few weeks he has by the way hes playing in front of eight family members he told us earlier today he actually lived in Atlanta for a couple of years in Clover South Carolina is only four hours away from here on the Platts theres a broken nose as you can see with the mask and we talked about how difficult it is to play with that thing hes got the rebound yeah he said all the sweat oh in there youve played with it before Ive had a teammate break my nose as well and Justin mutts accidentally broke his and big guy that played in San Antonio you may know Duncan has broke mine and practically the game actually once and intentionally uh maybe I think he did mods Campbell and Franklin makes him pay yes you gamble for it like that your cell out and reach around trying to make a play didnt happen and give up an easy one the lead is 10 again for Georgia Tech in a game that for Virginia Tech we told you for their NCAA tournament hopes they got to have this one brazily off the high low no silly can just take his time when he gets it there I dont think he needs to rush and he gets his body on Jayvon Franklin he wont be able to jump to block him butts keeps gambling you can sense some frustration building for the Hokies hes just trying to play with a level of desperation to make things happen wow Moore swirled it out yeah its only made four but hes shooting it well but hes playing well I mean he has six rebounds and three offensive so hes earning the right to take take those shots Collins into the midrange and its swirled out on him Kelly off the screen two strong rebound mutts got to be careful here if you enjoy the ticket coming down youre taking two quick shots the last two possession down this is how you allow teams to get back in the game no and butts kept it alive but Terry secures it fine line right because you said transition is important for Georgia Tech offensively it is but the last two possessions theyre taking quick shots so now you see coach Pastor kind of yelling hey lets set our offense here lets execute in the half court foul is called against Virginia Tech defensively yeah I think he got Hunter Couture cutting Miles Kelly cutting away from the ball and Hunters real physical goes to the bench he gets Lynn Kidd to replace Grandpa zilli and give the big fellow blow Terry needs somewhere to go to get this in and he finds Kelly tried to save it off Couture and a turnover defense just so physical and he is good of a three and D guys there is in the country Music denied by Franklin fronting kid just gave it right back to him theyll need to to press if youre Virginia Tech youre trying to punish him inside and Franklin is a tough guy to throw the lob over top of Couture takes a charge rinse and repeat we talked about hes a 3D guy he did not get out of possession last steals in the last two possessions the lead is 10 Jayvon Franklin doing up three blocks three steals for Javon Franklin who in his last four coming in again was doing everything for Josh pastner and hes just doing what hes been doing I mean he is doing it all here and again that small ball lineup weve talked about it a bunch but he has benefited I think the team the guards around him has opened up the paint hes able to knock down that 15footer hes able to drive I think his ability on the defensive end and play Just bigger than what he is its just the most thing thats just the most surprising Id say thats helping this team because theyre really small I mean when hes out even with him out there sixth year senior at his fourth school he told us today his couple of years at Auburn where he only scored 29 Points total in two years that motivated him he told us to get back to the high major level and to prove that he could play and play well at this level and hes doing just that for Georgia Tech here down the stretch Collins had a tough shot that wouldnt go and now Georgia Tech runs good hands by one tour but look out takeoff you saw that one coming just the big guy rewarded for running the floor my goodness so theyre back to that triangle and two Franklin matched up with mutts Franklin got a piece mutz hits the deck no call mutts on the face up short kid tried to save it its Georgia Tech ball with all the momentum a pass Kelly gets deflected right in the hands and nothing MJ Collins could do but just stand there and watch shayvon Franklin jump to the penthouse to finish that one my goodness that is a poster yeah thats going on a dorm room wall that one will get a lot of tweaks and follow tonight we got the ball in his hands again sets the screen for Kelly on the pitch back for more shot clock at 10 Franklin Watson going to work on kid with two more Music he is again if theyre going to go back theyre going to stay in this triangle theyre going to guard the shooters and I think coach is going to have to theyre going to DARE him to make those theyre going to live with the shot and air ball we got to get the silly in instantly I mean he got to come in just not the same team offensively without him stuck out to you coming in that the threepoint shooting just not the same as last year for the Hokies no I mean Couture is the only guy I mean Maddox whos not on the team right now its not with the team I should say hes shot 50 from threes down to 32 Padula I think his is that hes being schemed as we talked about you know last year he was a backup point guard he was just a guy that was on a scouting report he came out with his sophomore campaign such a strong start to the year now hes the focal point of this team and is trying to scheme him and hes struggling Im not struggling but hes struggling from threepoint line thats the difference in his drop brazily not this guy though a Miss though and then run down by Kelly by the way you mentioned Darius Maddox hes not here for a sixth straight game due to a family matter yeah we got word earlier today that he has returned to campus the situation is improving but he hasnt rejoined the team so again we send our best to Darius Maddox and his family yeah hes a local DMV guy as well Ive followed his career for quite some time I know he finished up in Oak Hill Academy and youre just hoping everything and praying for you and his family everything turns out well largest lead of the game swells Kelly on a tough shot on the Baseline and the lead is 16 mutts drop off kid and Lynn Kidd draws a foul the question would be on the ground is he shooting too I dont know if he got it up or not Im not on the floor yeah Justin mutz is telling him to go up dunk to get to the free throw line by the way biggest comeback this year for the Hokies to come back to win a game 10 points against Grambling State theyre down 16 here at ACC play well they got their big lineup out there now Padula cant hit kid saves it they got a capitalize on some of these offensive rebounds are getting Padula no its another one theyve gotten offensive rebounds but they have not punished Georgia Tech with them and theyre going to play with this lineup with their three biggest players on the floor theyre going to have to finish some of those offensive rebounds yeah to your point eight offensive rebounds but six thats it Second Chance points theyre not you know their game right now is being played theyre not punishing the yellow jackets for the lack of size shot clock winding down on more Franklin Goes climbing battles for a loose ball but silly hits the deck and the Hokies have it they need points facility fights it in for two and ends the scoring drought of about six and a half minutes Music someone on the offensive end is going to have to help crap silly out I mean hes doing it all Josh pastner takes a timeout well take it with him the lead is 14 Josh pastner and the jackets playing some of their best ball of the season inside the Virginia Tech huddle Mike young trying to spur on his team which right now through 25 games in a very similar position to where the Hokies found themselves last year at that time lunardi had them ninth team out right now we totally coming into tonight 11th team out what do you need to see from them down the stretch this season well its got to change on a defensive end uh and its just theyre not shooting the ball tonight I mean defending theyre competing right now shots are not throwing from the outside and right now theres just not much offense who do they go to who they find offense with outside of grand basilian Padula is not scoring as much Couture is not scoring and and mutts makes a hustle play to get possession for the Hokies right into your lap tried to pass me the ball they need they heard me talk about like a shooting they wanted to give me the rock look at this Show Ladies and Gentlemen you didnt see it on your TVs but Justin mutts was passing me the ball telling me he needed a shot oh great hustle play by mutts Padula gets banged and draws it foul yeah trying to plead his case that he was shooting well see this theyre trying to get points and and thats three on Jayvon Franklin with 12 21 to go hes gonna leave him in right now hes not going to take him out he makes just going to go to the zone now to protect him in the middle of the defensive bazilly Poteet and mutts all in the game another one of those big lineups for Virginia Tech The Zone trying to protect Franklin and cause confusion for the Hokies again but Doula steps into a three Applause good for him to see knock that will knock one down if they were almost there in these guys to knock down perimeter shots 16 points by the way was the largest lead Georgia Tech has had at any point in an ACC game this season Virginia Techs got it down to 11 more to the corner for Sturtevant Padula Hawking him entry for Franklin with five to shoot banging with basilia and it rolled off silly almost got stuck again trying to reach around I dont know why they trying to gamble so much to create steals for the Post entries silly post entry this time for months going to work with a mismatch on Terry and mutts scores and a foul and here come the Hokies Applause Music started on a defensive end theyve turned it up and Justin must been the guys hes doing it on both ends right now getting in here punishing the guard on the switch telling Lance Terry hes just too small my man cutting into that lead game and he is on your all Robin teams because I think that you know everyone team has a Batman these are the guys I mean theyre all playing with all conference teammates when you look at this theyre playing with all caliber you know all ACC caliber guys four of those guys definitely have First Team all ACC teammates I think the only one you can argue with is Justin much but he has Sean Padula and Grant basili Couture the extra possession for the Hokies and that Padula picks off Franklins pass and Rises left it short but silly battles and the Hokies have a 90 run Applause all started with the energy of the Hokies Robin Justin mutts a do everything guy in his Virginia Tech Career fought for the extra possession and then more of that from the Hokies hes singlehanded League been so disruptive for this 90 running and really hes doing it on the defensive end matched up with Terry and much adding to the Highlight Reel he has been suffocating on the defensive end in the last four possessions here last thinks he has the angle has him beat uhuh get that out of here hes on triple double watch again after he almost had one in South Bend hes got 12 points five rebounds six assists and thats a street stopper from Jalen Moore when a defense was igniting your offense where their struggle has been is Mound that Georgia Tech has their defense set s down the lane Applause and theyre picked off it in does Josh passenger need a timeout Virginia Tech has just hit the button turn things on here on the defensive end and pastors not going to use one Applause its a 142 run for Virginia Tech to get within five Sturdivant attacks Franklin followed and Padula reaches in this comes down to Lane attacking her room and away hes been all night hes put his head in the rim a couple of times a night and then Sean Padula just comes in early takes the steal and finishes himself and theyre competing those guys are tough defensively theres no quit in this group and he said it before we knew they were down this team is this games a long way from being over and you got to Wonder Too there Jordan Tech coming into this game was number two and Ben scoring and be honest Virginia Tech doesnt get much production From the Bench pictures to see if how this continues that the game wears on Saturday afternoon the number one womens lacrosse team in the country headlines and top 10 matchup its the Tar Heels against number seven Florida in Chapel Hill without coverage starting at noon Eastern still got chicken scratch here right now you didnt want to read that one huh I cant read that your phones too small for me Jayvon Franklin missed both and now Grant Brazilian with an offensive foul drawn by Kyle Sturdivant yeah I know you dont like it but you know the defensive Defender even though hes small is entitled to that space you cant go through them you got to go around them and no you can sit right here in front of the Virginia Tech match they dont like it but its the right call they try to fight back for what would be their biggest comeback of the season and I gotta have a game on the road Applause Virginia Techs attention of fans getting loud here in Atlanta Terry got free and hits Big Shot Applause Justin mutz had to help one of the lob a big part of Georgia Techs offenses on a single side ball screen he gets the lob Justin must help Lance gets out to the corner and knocks down a three with a deep one that wouldnt go you dont pay attention to this but I cant tell you how impressive that rebound was how high he got big guys dont rebounded Above the Rim a lot of them wait till the ball comes to them he went up and Im always impressed when guys do things like that he went up Above the Rim and rebounded that thats impressive kind of like high pointing the football as Couture generates a tie up with Kyle sturdivin it does stay with Georgia Tech so youre saying just going up to meet that thing at its highest point most guys dont attack the rent ball like that and you know something you see with big its a skill set that not many bigs possess and they wait only to come to them and Jayvon Franken to be six seven with the mini fro plays 610 611 I mean hes just hes fun to watch Kelly off of curl Applause hes got 15 theyre in there passengers to get back into his own defense Applause shifting defenses all night potique is fouled by Franklin and that is four on Chevon Franklin with eight plus minutes left Music oh theyre gonna give it to Kelly they just announced that its on Miles Kelly instead three on Kelly and so that keeps Franklin with just three himself Applause from the land this season good on the first Applause Music lets see who is it on thats not Kelly no its not that should be four on Frank definitely should be full on Franklin I thought maybe he came down and they called him on a reach but wow so that is a bullet dodged for Georgia Tech Josh passenger and Jayvon Franklin and then Poteet splits Applause nine point lead eight minutes to go I cant I cant express how big that call is of not having a because you would have a decision to make if that was the fourth foul of Franklin hes off the floor right now Coleman tough shot no Hanukkah tour is a tough guy to try to take off the dribble I mean hes as good of an onball Defender as there is in the country got to move him around risky lobbed from mutts for brazili start of it oh rebound mutts Georgia Techs bench was ready to erupt when Sturtevant Let it Fly Tapped Out by Kyle Sturdivant and itll belong to the Hokies on the other side Virginia Tech trying to forge a comeback here on the road against Georgia Tech nine ECC losses seven of them by single digits you see all these two possession games there are other two in addition to those seven by ten points each everythings been close and then on the Georgia Tech side Josh pastner has said to us that all of these four games he felt like could have been wins instead of just the one last week against Notre Dame but you know its a big difference when you you know when you look at a losing record I mean sometimes teams struggle to learn how to win I think this Georgia Tech Team I think their inability to to be confident in late game situations hurt them last week against Wake Forest and this Virginia Tech team is experienced and theyve just missed shots and you expect them to be better in these late moments but this team is coming home but they have to get this game they want to get themselves dancing in March Jayvon Franklin still on the bench for Josh passner out of the timeout Zoey through a risky pass and mutts had it swirl out Applause this is a letting them play a little bit Grapevine Poteet goes up to block more Applause brazily gets hit and a foul on Jalen Moore that is in big possession there I mean to come down and looks like he has an uncontested Duncan Poteet says not here Applause trying to hustle trying to get the ball back commits the foul big defensive stop there all kinds of Above the Rim plays offensively and defensively in this one yeah kind of plays youve been making in your mens league Laughter uh Missing layups he told me with a Kobe stopper man you had a guy who came in and stopped the guy that was making threes in your league no cabin oh that one pops out on him hunts it down cant follow much has it pop out as well oh three golden opportunities and now Terry accelerates picked off by Couture and Sturtevant commits a foul after a mad scramble its a hot potato nobody wants it but how many times has Virginia Tech had offensive tippings and rebounds and just unable to finish I mean look where Couture comes from that dude is special thats a big foul there you had numbers you had break and you commit the foul its your seventh foul you put in the hunter Couture at the line hes just being rewarded for his hustle there just what you expect from one of the leaders of the team 74 Hunter Couture at the line for the one and one makes the first we remind you every Thursday 10 Eastern right after our womens basketball doubleheaders the nothing but net crew is in action right here on accn and the ESPN app Applause you can handle that Couture makes both sevenpoint game six and a half to go we got ourselves a ball game here lets get Justin Bots pick up in the backcourt on Debo Coleman mutton Couture are two of the better on ball Defenders that youll find anyway this has been gambling tour is on Miles Kelly the leading scorer for Georgia Tech whos got 15 today just passed it you got miles Kellys not beating him off the dribble Franklin back in on a turnaround left it short and Virginia Tech can make it a twoscore game Applause if youre flipping around and just joined us they trailed by as many as 16 Couture cant connect Poteet nearly had an offensive rebound and a Virginia Tech foul goes on Justin mutts no rather Malaysia Poteet hey Bob Franklins just playing like a man inside hes just out man he got hes battling the three big guys on the floor for Virginia Tech and hes doing whatever it takes to get his hands on these rebounds the guards gonna have to come in and help him and Virginia Techs gonna have to find someone I think I have to knock down a perimeter shot or find another person they got to get back to established I think Grant facility I mean he had 13 in the first half he only has 17 right now at the game hes only four points in the second half and he got a quick 13 in the first half yeah in the first 10 minutes and 20 seconds of game action those 13 from bazilly Virginia Tech is extending Terry is firing cant hit that was a mistake there it went under screen and got caught flash Terrys not the guy you want to give top of the key jump shots too on a night Georgia Tech is knocked down 10 triples mutts bazilly stayed patient and there he is right on cue up to 21 now you need to find him ball needs to touch his hands now for the remaining five minutes of this game hes thats just not a matchup former again you know for this Jordan said Ross Applause Franklin all the way outside the arc Midway through the shot clock defended by Kid Kelly off a screen Couture sticks with him Sturdivant yes Applause its 11 threes here for Georgia Tech only 32 percent this season but coming in seven plus in four straight games and shooting even better today Couture saw the opening Vasily on the Baseline got his own Miss and Sturdivant stripped him much goes diving and hes got in timeout great play just an outstanding play by Justin much getting dirty on the floor saving The Possession for his team from Javon Franklin watch out below with the woman and children to bed Jameson Franklin is just tearing rims down here in Midtown I mean how about the game hes having and its not a surprise to you and I mean weve watched this young man in the last couple of weeks and just two points away from a full straight up four double doubles I mean hes averaging that in the last four or five games and its just been outstanding again a guy who told us today that he wanted to prove himself at this level once again he started with a couple of years in junior college and in the first game of his second season at Juco as the sophomore told us today broke his leg still ended up at Auburn for the next couple of Seasons but only scored not even 30 points in two seasons there and then went to South Alabama last year and now in his one season on the flats boy has he been good especially in the second half of the Season he had the second half of the season for him has been outstanding and its the reason why this Georgia Tech team is a tough out I mean theyre you know the second half of the ACC season theyve been playing really good basketball and and then when they went to this small ball lineup its only helped him more with the spacing of the paint leaving it open and allowing him to drive and find teammates the officials were just double checking a few different times during the break and then even just now out of the commercial something related to fouls we didnt get any word it doesnt look like there have been any changes in lid kids scores and its down to six with four to go here we go lets see what Georgia Tech goes here its youre gonna find him trying to get it in the pinch post there Jayvon Franklin s got 17 miles Kellys got 15 and Lance Terry scores over the top of bazilly Justin mutts meanwhile has keyed The Comeback and yet again he is flirting with a triple double after he was two rebounds and one assist shy Saturday zilly off the skip start of it swiped it from him and then Sturtevant throws it out of bounds Applause I think Vasily thought that there was a foul there and weve been letting them play a little bit this games been really physical were letting them play remember what Georgia Tech its coaching staff said theyd shoot around today Julian Schwartz said to his team this game is going to come down to physicality against Virginia Tech he said weve got to play this game with more Force than them and you saw it right there from start of it well if youre playing against Virginia Tech theyre a very physical team I think thats an offensive foul there it is on Lynn Kidd who had the mismatch tried to punish Lance Terry inside and just pivoted on the spin move Baseline I think his right elbow hit him in the head and Josh pastner wants them to go have a look at this for maybe something more and they will go to the monitor this is a rule you know when we talk about this this is you know this play has happened so many its making calls so many different ways and theyll be interested to see what the decision is on this I mean theres been calls where they just caught its been a common foul and then its been in flagrant one which a good tells you to call right here I get something more than just the common foul I think its plagon one try to eavesdrop here on oh yeah I think so what do you think I think it is no the rule usually is theres any blows to the head theres a flagrant one but as weve seen sometimes this year I uh hasnt been you know its been called differently some interesting to see what the calls me again a flagrant one means excessive in nature and or unnecessary and it is a flagrant one thanks very much to Matt Potter for coming over and elbow to the back of the head there you go youre one for one thanks and it doesnt make Mike young feel anything no it doesnt I mean its just kind of the way its gone for Virginia Tech in this game a mismatch in the post slim kids not trying to do that of course no but he ends up getting tagged with an F1 in that spot its its one of those things that happened when a guard is youre defending against you know a big like that and just wins its just a matter of where you are and its unfortunate incident there and its going to be two shots of the ball for Georgia Tech and to make matters worse Lance Terry is one of the best Jimmy Pro Shooters Georgia Techs got hes only missed four All Season you want to see you know Lynn there just just Elevate over on the shoot your hook shoot it you know comes out of the game Coach Pat some on the back tell him hey hes playing hard hes know hes giving him everything he has I think about being really really positive with his guys yeah still a lot of time left for these guys 317 10 point game after Terry made pole pokies extend pressure youve talked about some of the offensive rebounding opportunities theyve had that just havent turned into points we showed you the big Franklin dunk that was off of Couture deflection where they thought they were maybe going to get a turnover and the bounces just havent gone their way whats up brakes and this is a game is a long way from over because the Georgia Tech Team who struggles closing games Xbox winding down start of it thats his spot but he missed it yeah got to that right midrange pullup shot Applause mutts shovels off for Padula who skips it for Couture got it and a quick timeout taken by Mike young hes got one left and its a seven point game with still as you said a long way to go come on back illa and Virginia Tech down by seven in a quad three game for the Hokies we told you after this theyve got a doozy of a threegame schedule coming up with Pitt Miami and Duke before finishing the season at Louisville and in Blacksburg against Florida State yeah you cant get caught looking ahead this team needs every win they can get and can ill afford this lost button quad 2 went there and a couple of quad ones that would look good on their resume theyre going to need to figure this out you know they dont want to have any setbacks there this will be a devastating loss to this group and your team is trying to fight to get back and getting themselves in the field of 68 to win this game the path back to do it is what at both ends of the floor theres enough time here to get us that they got us they got to continue to get stops that was a big three there theres no need to panic theyre extending their defense here they just have to play solid defense here and get a stop and rebound they have the ability to score Colemans got to get it in Javon Franklin doubled on the sideline mutts got a piece Franklin saved it Georgia Techs got to get it over the line Terry does and then hes fouled by MJ Collins to Georgia Tech this team that doesnt they dont know how to win you and as you can see theyre nearly 10 seconds Jayvon Franklin is not a theyre giving the ball to their Center to help break their press so this is a team that just struggles they dont have a guard that says give me the ball Im going to close this and thats what hurts them in games like this and got lucky here there wasnt a 10 second call they were able to get it out of that track one and one now for Lance Terry we told you excellent at the freethrow line 83 percent for his career and this is the guy that he won I mean ideally if youre going to file you could have filed Franklin or someone earlier in the possession Franklin is pretty good freethrow shooting and now how about this gamesmanship yeah Jayvon Franklin and Debo Coleman had to switch sides and Justin mutts is switching with him and now Ted Valentine is getting a delay of game warning to both sides and this is some shatted Freud well I I get what Virginia Tech is doing you want your best athlete boxing out against their best offensive rebounder and Terrys on phase I dont think its gonna matter because I dont think hes gonna Mr free throws anyway but if he does you want to have your best you know size wise you want your best guys boxing out their best guys how can you not love and he does miss them eightpoint game inside of Two and a Half remaining the Hokies with it trailing still a ton of time left here Applause The Zone much Applause I think it is yes it is yes strike ball its just a frustration foul by Justin much there Applause drives the ball Sterling comes over steals it in its just frustration Im a veteran guy whos played his tail off tonight its just something that hes just you know you expect him not to do that but again this type of year its been in Blacksburg sturdigan only 60 percent this season this is the first its two free throws and the ball for Georgia Tech if youre just joining us this is the second flagrant out of Virginia Tech in the last few minutes the first one unintentional from Lynn Kidd posting up with a mismatch on Lance Terry Sturdivant splits after this one on mutts and its a nine point game with 214 to go now why so bad because not only did he get the free throw they added a point but now they get the ball and you gotta and the Hokies need a stop medulla is pressed on to Sturdivant who uses the Franklin screen Colemans had a big night no need to take a quick shot here very spinning Music Applause insightful move and finish off the glass Couture deep one Applause and Ted Valentine heads over to talk to Josh pastner thats one of the things youd love to see its a great spin move there but Terry gets up kisses it off the glass he has been a big part of the turnaround here in Atlanta open up the court for his teammates with just his presence and ability to make shots hes known as a threepoint shooter but he shows you there he can put it down get to the paint and finish this is one thing I like for them to change two late games we saw it in the last Georgia Tech game at wake is that they stopped the clock so much and they allow teams to turn timeouts with checking scores and talking to coaches mutts Strip by Franklin and theyll say its Georgia Tech Ball but theyll go have a look at this mutts insists that it was deflected out by Franklin Applause I think mutz wont like that one I think its all just as much what about you tank mutts just lost it and I believe the initial call Will Stand lets play such a heck of a game tonight hes flirting with a triple double and I dont even think people Coleman touched it at all or Franklin Im sorry yeah hes coming in Franklin didnt I dont know if he touched it raise it with his right index finger maybe I dont know either way I think its all just a much left hand yeah call stance Applause Virginia Tech you got to establish your D here try to get a five second call again just show the tech team has struggled closing games because you want to apply as much pressure as possible for some doubt in these guys mind if youre Virginia Tech and even tonight theyve struggled with inbounds passes they get this one into Kelly he gives it up to Coleman and Colemans the one that gets fouled double bonus now and Debo Coleman 68 percent at the freethrow line this season but hes played so well offensively tonight and its working on a career high third foul on Justin mutts by the way we told you that Virginia Tech trailed by as many as 16 in this game largest comeback by anyone in an ACC League game this year is 16 Miami beat NC State in December after they were down by 16 in the first half of that game and thats what Mike Youngs team is trying to do tonight yeah I mean that Miami team may be the best team in the ACC when its all said and done theyre playing as well as anyone right now outside of Pittsburgh Coleman its the second so he splits 129 to go Georgia Techs lead is nine trying to take down Virginia Tech they got a score they got to score quickly the freshman Coleman trying to get it in find Sturdivant Hunter Couture got poked in the eye Applause and now Coleman lost it Padula pushes cant lay it in Couture tried to follow Padula gets stripped Terry doesnt get fouled Couture hunting him and now Coleman gets fouled wow theres a lot going on right there that was a big possession there thought to steal I thought they had MJ Collins in the corner again for another three Zebo just lost to them just couldnt finish there Music Coleman to the line Applause this is on the first freethrow shooting team in the accent were talking about this team struggles closing games theyre just you know they dont have a guy they can give the ball to the college to say hey take me home in these moments and theyre going one for two and it gives it gives Tech a chance I mean even they dont even need a three here they just need a quick score 19 for Coleman to match a career high Padula off the bounce gets the roll yeah youre still trading youre only theyre only giving that one point if Jordan sick was knocking down free throws would be a different story and Georgia Tech has to use one of its two remaining timeouts trying to key it in I thought it was a good call to call time out there they had all four guys off not including the inbounder below the free throw line always a difficult to pass the ball when all those guys are there all right so Georgia Tech youre up by five 42 seconds left weve talked about the close calls youve talked about a young group trying to learn how to finish games who do you trust most with the ball in their hands to try to put this thing on ice youd want to get Lance Terry at the free throw line I mean hes 85 but right now you just need someone to step up and say Hey I want the basketball I mean everyone is going one and one theyre making one missing one you just need someone to say hey give me the ball Id like to see Miles Kelly get it as well I think hes a really good freethrow shooter and hes shooting 88 on the year and you just need guys just saying hey go get the ball be strong with the tribe you can make one pass at that point Virginia Techs gonna have to foul if they dont steal at that point theyre fighting the clock as much as theyre fighting to score right now Debo Coleman will again put it in Lance Terry to your point and Miles Kelly are the two best freethrow shooters for Georgia Tech theyre both out there Mike young just had a conversation with one of the officials John Gaffney who then went to Ted Valentine who now goes to Matt Potter and weve had a lot of conferences here in the second and this is to my point where were talking about when the game starts lets see how many extra possessions or extra timeouts I could say when coaches are saying look at the clock and these things late in ball games and teams are using it I think to get an extra possession with the uh you know extra time out so to speak Gathering of his players Kelly to Terry the two guys you want touches if youre Josh pastner Ian Padula it tangled up in a foul with 34 seconds left well put Lance Terry at the line Davon Franklin was called to put a lob there but I think its already the right thing hes trying to take some more time off the clock and feels comfortable now he got to go up and knock knock down some free throws the guy who hasnt come off the floor once tonight for Josh passner and in the two ACC wins for Georgia Tech this year hes played every single second and trying to do just that again tonight yeah hes worked his way back into shape I mean he came out he was worried about when he first got back from the four games with the hand me of getting them back in shape Josh Pastor just said hey I wont take out the game you figure it out another split though another line for the jackets Petula from deep Long rebound Coleman and hes fouled boy good look for Sean Padula trying to make that a threepoint game yeah didnt have to have a three there but cant complain with the look hes one of eight from threepoint range for the season shooting 33 percent from deep and for the Hokies as a team in this one five for 22 from Deep 23 percent I think thats the one thing that surprised me with the team this year they you know its a lot you know last year you had four guys I mean three guys averaging 40 percent from three and just dont have the one guy right now doing so and Debo Coleman hes got 21 a new career high for the sophomore from Memphis and the lead is eight and Terry generates a hell ball does stay with the Hokies but how about the D from Lance Terry yeah Joe detects mantoman defense right now just switching one through five theyre gonna switch all ball screens and all action so Virginia Tech you want a quick score here lob for mutts matched up with Franklin 15 seconds left mutts is pivoting mutts got fouled and he got it to go the last thing you wanted to do if you were Georgia Tech but again theyre learning how to close games do they have enough to finish this much great job pivoting trying to turn over that left shoulder and takes the bump and has a chance to get an amb one here one assist away from a triple double remember he had one last year against Syracuse Tampa threepoint play and Sturtevant with a huge rebound for the jackets great rebound Grandpa silly got his hand on it couldnt couldnt get two to grab it and put it in the lead was as large as 16 you talked about Georgia Tech trying to learn on the Fly how to win and for Josh passner for as frustrating as some of the recent games have been and really for how this season is gone boy his team has not stopped fighting for him no they havent Ive told you before throw the record out I think hes a heck of a coach Ive seen how he interacts with his guys and and just of competing against him having scouted against him when coaching and everything I just think hes he does a heck of a job scheming towards guys whoa and Sturtevant misses both mutz runs it down inside of 10 seconds pokeys down six months all the way and he got fouled on the way up so he will shoot two with 44 left this is what we talked about I mean his tick team is just struggling struggling to close games in the winning and you know I know for Coach Pastor just 44 seconds cant go by fast enough theyve been so close so many you know so many times the last few games and we said it coming in it seems a tough out theyre going to be a tough out for anyone but playing their best basketball right now Ill say this about Josh passner too he is one of the great guys in coaching just as a human being yeah he is and boy theyve been through it the last few weeks mutts intentionally misses but took off too early yeah ball with 44 left Applause fivepoint game Georgia Tech trying to crawl to the finish line here a tough loss with Virginia Tech and their postseason hopes they just got it I think this dictates they got to get both wins on the road to home in Blacksburg Franklin gets blocked by fazili and it stays at this end with 21 left and this game will not end theres no quitting this Joe to take me Virginia Tech Team and theyre gonna theyre gonna fight to that last whistle its a sixpoint game youre not getting the Breakaway dunk on my watch but silly tells me man you gotta love the plight we have seen on both sides and that that might sound critically like a throwaway statement but these guys have battled both coaches these guys are going to compete today Franklin hits horn and Josh pastner and Georgia Tech at the win at home against Virginia Tech tonight in Atlanta Debo Coleman with a career high tonight 21 points but just a wellrounded offensive game I thought defensively is where they separated themselves tonight they also shot 50 from three thats big 14 that only shoots 32 percent congratulates to the young
