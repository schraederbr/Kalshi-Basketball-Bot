was right on top of it hes joined by Roger Ayers and Anthony Franklin officiating our game this evening late night Hoops in the ACC GMan stay with me okay yeah and its going to take a little while I think for both of these teams to figure each other out nice strong attempt there inside so medley bacon missed on the first opportunity Eric Boone was ready and waiting and he talked to Virginia people and the thing theyre concerned about this here rebounded they were in they were a negative rebounding team last year and thats the place where Gardner can really step up he hit some big numbers at ECU he used to put that kind of production up here at Gardner Letterman rebounding about six and a half per game and 15 points per game this is Beekman shot clock running down too strong chase down in the corner by Justin Wright and there was a shot clock violation Lavelle Moten is the 13th year head coach for the Eagles we had a just a wonderful conversation with him Mike earlier at the shoot around today really has done some terrific things in the city of Durham also in his hometown of Raleigh as well just a wonderful guy to chat with were were actually a Duke fan watching our teams in the late 70s kind of shocked me a little bit they won three conference tournaments in a row from 2017 to 2019 they were rolling before covet hit and then this team looking to get back this program looking to get back to that level in fact he told us he was just happy to have a full complement of players they ran into covet issues last year as well and and you know what Tom just a different vibe you know coming into this year just talking about basketball not talking about other things Gardner shot rattles out he shot 50 percent from the floor a season ago that was seventh best in the ACC for Jaden Gardner the graduate student from Wake Forest North Carolina medley bacon goes across the lane shetrick came down with it and this is a game especially with medley bacon theyre going to let him operate in a low post and uh you dont see that a lot in the college game is these days Applause Music Applause heres a guy we talked about the shooting his numbers improved 10 percent better last year than he was the year prior 34 from three Applause Beekman the Junior from Milwaukee Wisconsin Emily grazes the front rim Cavaliers want to run David Franklin free ball money back to back three is good sign for Virginia time when this Virginia team scores thats when theyre out there but you know theyre going to defend but they need to put points up on the board I think Roger Ayers just came from just a warning about the coachs box Mike and having a little fun with the with the Cavaliers students how about the threepointers now this is a team Mike that only made about five threes per game yep and uh and that was a good extra pass the Franklin wide open and you know if youre struggling you come in that first night you really want to have a good first outing on selfish pass by Beekman to find the open man Applause Music which is right saw bouncing it falls Lets see we talked about Justin right in the open and Clark a little bit of a mistake there defensively went for the pump fake and they moved by right also there maltsby too strong Clark has it yeah writes at the top of the scouting chart as far as NC Central is concerned almost 14 points per game last year for the junior guard and thats going to be new for him this year Tom how about this three threes in a row Virginia was struggling to score up to that point Cavaliers as a team last year Mike shot 32 percent from Beyond The Arc 12th in the ACC quick hands from Franklin couldnt save it on the sideline and weve got a timeout late night three balls on the menu for Virginia time for tonights four keys to the game with Mike jaminski I think for North Carolina Central lets just maintain focus and Virginia is so disciplined defensively that you have to be locked in for 30 seconds on a possession and for the Cavaliers be principal I mean first game you dont have a lot of tape on North Carolina Central so just really focus on what you do your fundamentals Tony Bennetts team only allowed just over 60 points per game a season ago that was best of the ACC eighth in the nation in the arrow favors the Eagles now the flip side of that is the only average 61 points a game thats their their margin for error was really razor thin last year and their points per game was 14th in the ACC out of the 15 teams that compete in this conference shot clock was winding down Franklin pulls it down for Virginia and your that phrase is going to be uttered by you a lot this evening whats your friend the shot clock is winding down were going to keep a tally on that thats just what Virginia does Franklin lines it up that is the first Miss on a threepoint attempt in the game for Virginia fall in love with the threepoint shot this early medley bacon kept it alive number 35 for the Eagles two seven Footers going at it in there in Seattle a lot in a college game either shot clock is at seven Nifty dribble right just a bit strong and Gardner puts his hands on the rebound they need him to be a little bit more of a playmaker as well hes got that dribble game a good pullup that time but he can create in the lane as well keep in mind Virginia returning 914 percent of its scoring from last season and that point four percent could be huge yes and thats the best and most in NCAA basketball this season Isaac mcneelys committed the game for Virginia he just missed the last shot chedrick on the feed whistle on the strong move by Shedrick as the ball bounced out theres a good foul things just break down and you get in the dribble drive we talked about Beekman and he hes a nice playmaker as well hes three assess the game for him yeah Beekman and Clark amongst the league leaders when it comes to assists in the ACC a season ago hes you know for Beekman hes probably more of a natural point guard than anything foreign Market oh correction well get to that in just a second heres your returning starters veteran group and theres the 914 percent again that leads college basketball Music and the thing its not so much the scoring its everybody being on the same page defensively right theyre going to get you know theyre theyre ready to go right now the thing they have to do is work the new guys into that rotation poked Away by Beekman and out of bounds to Tony Bennett your former teammate Mike in Charlotte in the NBA yeah you know it was it was just some guys you play with you know are going to be coaches and you know his playing for I mean he maxed out on his talent a great threepoint shooter in college at Wisconsin Green Bay a wonderful human being in his own right and audemarle was Legacy Tony is built here for himself already Tony was an assistant for his dad in Wisconsin 9903 in fact they went to the final four in two thousand also Washington State thats right out there with him and then took this job hard to believe hes been here since 14th year 92 graduate from Wisconsin Green Bay and I was talking about it says how does it feel to be one of the old men in the league now and he said what are you talking about Jim bayheim Leonard Hamilton and you shook his head couldnt believe it 52 years old from Green Bay Wisconsin Applause this kid McNeely they really think they know that he can shoot the basketball he just has to settle in the Eagles On The Run theyll get it off the glass calculating the angle Eric Boone anytime they can get a play like that is gold against this team you know get out on the open floor not have to play in the half court defensively get an easy bucket coach Moten playing some defense on that sideline as well Hall of Fame player at North Carolina Central nickname how about his nickname love it poetry he just hes got a great perspective on the big picture and it came through covert too he talked about his struggles hes you know emotionally the things that he had to deal with and you know he lost dear friends to covid he should have really put a lot of his coaching in perspective four times hes led the program to the meac tourney championship and thatll drop on the inside Francisco Cafaro he had a big game early last year that I did up here and I thought man this guys gonna find a spot in the rotation and they know they they need him to step up buried on the bench last year but he can be a nice bookend to Kendrick red shirt senior from Argentina comes over with the help defense too much body from 22 yeah I mean you know you got Shedrick at six eleven seven foot and Cafaro coming in at 71 this is the GMan soft touch in the paint look at that little soft jump hook inside putting it you know coaches always get a little tense when big guys put it on the floor like that but he made it work he came out of the NBA Global Academy in Australia started 16 games last year Wright is at the freethrow line for North Carolina Central they play in the meac they went 1514 overall last year eight and five to finish third in the me act during conference play and theyve made the trip from Durham North Carolina and Roman is just over 8 000 of North Carolina Central foreign Applause Music number 10 in white Franklins out of the lineup we really have you have four really bench new guys out there on the floor along with Clark now talking about the value of your point guard thats a good guy you want especially running the offense but its going to be interesting to see how this group Kihei clock Mike has played over 4 200 minutes in a Virginia uniform part of that 2019 National Championship team last one last clock on the drive and there was a foul on the play no yeah I was I was wondering if he was going to come back as dean of students this year you know hes running out if he wanted to grad programs and things in classes to take here the dean of students might not be happy about it another assist for Clark Maybe the function of how deliberate they are offensively thats true you know the the you know theres a lot less there are fewer possessions and less time in the game for the other team to score however it is its truly astonishing to watch this team practice and that pack line defense is is incredible I mean it is their calling card theyve led the nation under Tony Bennett in scoring defense seven times and Mike they did it four times in a row from from 2017 to 2020 it just works again you think about when they score over 70 points under Tony 144 and 11 thats right knocked away from Cafaro to save right back to him Vander class lines it up welcome to the Ball Game Ben penderboss I mean hes the hes the guy they got through the portal and he he actually bounced them out of the NIT team last year and were playing for Ohio father Dean was teammates with Tony Bennett under coach Dick Bennett at Wisconsin Green Bay in the late 80s early 90s so Tony might have had the inside track to Vander flask when he came into the portal graduate student four years at Ohio as Mike mentioned and over 1500 career points for number five this is again the NC Central mixing it up throwing a little Zone far out Ryan you know thats just recognition that medley bacon out of the game they lose some size up front to fall that big body gets great position right in front of the rim Faro had a 16point game at home against Virginia Tech last season also had nine rebounds to set his career highs last year tipped away and ripped away Murray got it bark with the hesitation and contact Chris Monroe creating a contact for the Eagles and so theres a Timeout on the court vanderplas wide open and the threepointers are falling for the Cavaliers this is Toyota on the floor right now Devin butts just hit a threepointer hes only the second field goal in the last six minutes for the Eagles and Ben vanderplas came in Mike can promptly knocked down a three good start for him in his UVA career here he talked about it and thats you know I knew I was getting old when I started calling games of Sons of guys that I played against you know now and then now Tonys coaching them wait a minute jimin now we want to commend you on your 29th year broadcasting college basketball amazing run uh just so blessed amazing really and Raycom 39 years Raycom and ballet Sports 39 years of ACC basketball Billy Packer and I mentioned The Virginian Dan Bonner too such a I mean thats the gold standard those two incredible cast of characters weve been able to work with over the years absolute thrill Butler just picked up the foul for the Eagles for Farrell standing at the freethrow line with 1012 to go in our first half Tom wormy Mike jiminski back at it again in 202223 on the ACC Trail and the path to Greensboro Mike this year going back to the roots for the tournament yep and uh you know talk about roots and what this team Virginia had a trip over to Italy this summer yeah to kind of you know get them started on this year all they even talk to coaches to go on those trips of course you know invaluable on what they saw the experiences that they had with the bonding as a team and to get the new guys acclimated just invaluable good work on the offensive glass Butler Butler yeah and he just outworked cavara that time got inside position and the offensive rebounding has been a little bit of an issue for Virginia scoring from Butler as a bonus only averaged about three and a half points per game last year rocking the rim from threepoint distance 22 feet one and three quarter inches away you know its working for him tonight seven of the 11 attempts been behind the arc and and theyve been getting most a lot of them have been down in that right or down that left corner but really spreading the floor well and getting very good looks The Freshman Isaac McNeely 64 and 174 pounds so vanderplas has hit one McNeely Beekman and Franklin see the end of that Virginia bench show theyre just checking on Cafaro but hes out of the game right now for Virginia well keep an eye on his status big man for Virginia Shedrick came down with a rebound off the miss from all the double transfer from Pitt stuff on the sideline Beekman just a little bit of a lapse of concentration running out of court yeah theyre tending to Cafaro at the end of that bench Francisco Cafaro last year four and a half points per game four and a half rebounds per game and shot 52 from the floor showed off a soft touch on the jump hook earlier in this half Beekman deflects it out of bounds quick hands thats the thing with this defensive what looks like an open pass can shut the lane shuts down really quickly theyre so good but theyre inactive with their hands they get a lot of deflections Music Beekman started 35 games last season a little bit of a bump you know its funny how you watch them practice and they build up the defense they work three on three and then four on four five on five I mean theyre three on three defending it looks like theyre four Defenders when theyre four on four it looks like five it was just its amazing how youre so active and so physical this seems like theres an extra person out there defending you know they theyre so active they follow the lead of their coach what did he do with the shoot around today Mike they were shooting free throws and he didnt think it was going fast enough so he ran down the entire length of the court and started ripping the ball out of the net and feeding the shooters its like it was going too slow for him and he came over to us thats an offensive foul thats right Tony came over to us I said you need some oxygen he started to sweat a little bit nice nice little Sprints yeah hes like you know he said I gotta I gotta stay in shape I gotta keep up with these young guys Roger Ayers is trying to sort some things out Tony Bennett by the way needs 11 wins Mike to pass Terry Holland because the alltime winningest coach here in this Commonwealth and the Virginia program youd imagine he would probably achieve that this season at some point hes won 316 games as the head coach for the Cavaliers and Im sure that coach Holland would be well pleased with that as well is to have to have Tony is the guy who passes him and the other thing he brought up to us right away is Franklin drives in a Whistler on the drive when we talked to him today the first thing he said was I hope we have a better result in our opener than we did last year Navy against Navy in the season opener they lost 6658 theyre 222 in their last 24 season openers and he wanted to right away get us on track about the Navy loss last year but you know what I mean think about this too think about going from being the first number one seed to lose to a 16 and then come back the next year and win a National Championship Elizabeth I think he refers to that as the painful gift right hes mentioned that a few times absolutely and that happened in Charlotte remember they were upset uh Baltimore County and he handled him he has that with such Grace and then to get his team to turn around and come back and win a title the next year uh it just speaks to the type of man that he is not surprising that he was the coach of the year in 2019 they won 35 games Mike they win 151 on this course in town his highest scoring team that hes had here at UVM and he scores and this team scores they win its right scoring for NC Central hes got the three and you know and and for for Central then see that theyre hanging right in there and you know they havent been great from the field but some offensive rebounds this games still very much in shape they beat Auburn in the semifinals in 2019 and beat Texas Tech in overtime in the championship 8577 back in 2019 in 202223 its the three ball that is the order of the evening and the lead right now is 11 for the Cavaliers knocking down those three Samuel Suleiman and goes to NC Central and leads them on this incredible run and they beat Duke to get to the Final Four amazing but uh in uh he and Coach Moten having a moment beforehand and uh well do his homework but Ive I got to have a good fortune to meet John rather you know 20 plus years ago been friends ever since and uh just a fine fine gentleman and loves College athletics of all kinds actually he and his wife Renee their daughter Shea went to Carolina and graduated and his wife Renee went to back to school and they and they graduated together and they have a house down in Chapel Hill now too so what happens when Virginia North Carolina play one another Ah thats a thats a good question it could be dicey yeah it could you know I had an issue with NC Central in the book beating Duke in the NCAA tournament we had a little chat about that North Carolina and Duke at the Final Four season ago Hubert Davis what a what a fabulous fabulous year so close to that National Title in his first year as the head coach Franklin hello Applause this Virginia team played in the NIT a season ago Cedric strong run defense beekmans open launches it over top of backboard back to the Eagles and you know for Franklin we talked about him getting to off to a good start he almost passed his way into a turnover right there but theyve been getting great looks out on the perimeter Franklin three of four now from behind the arc so last year the Cavaliers lost in the quarterfinals Mike of the NIT to say Bonaventure that was on this court foul on the drive so that would have been you know for most teams you know 20 wins another 500 plus season in the ACC and a good run in the NIT but uh you know this this team has built the you know you win an NCAA Championship and thats where the expectations lie Eric Boone was at the freethrow line you know preseason second team miyak the selection coming into this year so good thing expect it out of him this is a this is a veteran team and uh you know lavelles teams in the past have been better and theyve been older and theyve been very tough defensively and thats what he wants to get back to Park in traffic that one knocked away right with a little two on two individual efforts spin lost possession got to call for the reach Applause he may be he was all ACC defensive team last year maybe the best perimeter defender in the conference two Music right at the line for the Eagles 11 straight years in the postseason coach Bennetts team nine times in the NCAA tournament couple of trips to the NIT including last year and a really balanced scoring Franklin with 13 but a lot of guys who scored for Virginia but uh not so balanced but right putting together a nice game so far eight points here in the first half doubledigit score from a season ago to lead the team with almost 14 per game score 20 or more in seven conference games last season including 32 points in an OT win at home against Delaware State last year he can be explosive keep an eye on five and Marine shot clock is at eight Clark a lot of dribbling pulls back angular rebound Gardner put the shoulder down aggressively to the rim couldnt follow his Miss Shedrick grabson well into the backcourt deflected and a clean play approaching the fiveminute threshold of the first half Im so glad that youre with us for ACC basketball and thats thats in his career up to this point has not been in his range and I think you know if youre North Carolina Central you will you will definitely live with that shot Shedrick the Redshirt Juniors from Holly Springs North Carolina calls up for grabs in the corner run down by right the ball did not hit the rim three on the shot clock McNeely couldnt stop right hey thats a three Mike jaminsky yeah and thats uh you know and its Virginia good defensive stand couldnt get the offense or couldnt get the defensive rebound they get the recycle and he gets a nice look at three its a little 60 run now for the Eagles writes into double digits Mike with 11 Franklins got 13 to lead the way for Virginia three of four from threepoint distance nice job against McNeely of creating this space driving into him and then backing you off and making the shot grander class has come in McNeely will fire away Gardner preserves The Possession and were inside of four minutes in the first half thatll be deflected out of bounds off of the Eagles and Eric Boone well take a quick timeout its a 10point game last year getting to the quarterfinals of the NIT heres what weve got so far threepoint shooting differential the Eagles are just three of ten Virginia six of 11 from the threepoint atmosphere and they are holding the Eagles to about 29 shooting so far Mike well Virginias shooting 47 as a team from the floor you know the one good thing for the Eagles theyre getting shots only two turnovers which is pretty good against this defense Clark in a congested area lost the handle this is the first game everybody trying to get their wheels under them Applause long rebound question that you know with this you really have to you have to prepare against the other coach in this game like Tony Bennett knows how Lavelle Milton coaches in the style and you know vice versa so you know you kind of know what to expect there its just a matter of you know seeing what goes out on the floor during the first game not expecting if youre the Eagles is a threepoint shooting that Virginias put out there olodapo at the freethrow line for NC Central Applause while we have a moment a message from Works Nitro the Pharaoh gets the rebound off the Miss just back into the game remember they were taking a look for him at the end of the bench for Virginia so good to see that he was well enough to come back into the ball game everything Music off Target and that one Gordon it was it was a really it was a good contested shot that time good solid defense and I think for the you know we talked about the Five Guys who were here for Virginia s gonna be for the new guys thats finding their way you know youre going to be a little reluctant at first the company of Enterprise there against the foul you may be a little reluctant to kind of really step up and take your shot I think its going to take them a few games to work that out Music Applause very early getting some good game experience of Carolina Central theyve got a veteran crew as well 10 players back from last year including three starters and really you know Justin Wright theres a Gordons a sophomore but Justin Wright is a junior is the youngest guy on the team everybody else seniors fifth year of seniors grad students so its an older crew they finished strong last year winning seven of their last 11 games for losing in the semifinals of their conference tournament Clark floating and hitting theres a normally if you want him if youre gonna pick somebody of the guys out on the floor to take that shot toward the end of the clock you wanted to be him uh part two he can step up and hit that consistently its going to be a big lift for this offense stop the four and a half minute scoring drop of Virginia something shot by Kihei Clark his grad student from Woodland Hills California playing his 129th game for the Cavaliers and there is a player doubled over its 44 ledepo for North Carolina Central shake this one off there is a time out on the floor for the moment its going to need a little bit of medical attention as he goes over to his bench area foreign with the uh with the elbow that was a really nice floater by Boone Eric Boone was an allmiac performer last season as well led the conference and assist coming up with the bucket there just under 10 points per game for Boone so while we have a second with 146 to go in our first half of play coming up at halftime well have a recap of that Stetson Florida State game and a win by the Hatters over the seminals well go with Tony Bennett I had a chance to sit down with him recently talk about his career here at Virginia and Beyond the first half highlights and Analysis with the GMan great to have you along for the ride tonight and hope youll be with us for the entire season of ACC basketball on your Regional Sports Networks Roger air is coming over okay so its just a basketball play there no uh no extra stuff for tomorrow and we appreciate Roger coming over Roger Ayers came over to clarify the situation veteran official Music Kihei Clark fifth in school history and assists missed on the shot attempt to borrow was trying to clean up the mess the Eagles butts picks it up and that was a you know at the beginning of last year I mean Tony Tony Bennett sat down with those guys and said you know what are you thinking about for this year and uh Music and then after the season came back it was it was a late decision and he asked Tony said will you have me back Tony said of course I will so double bonus here late in the first half for Virginia oclock he made the pass Applause who hit that shot to send the game into overtime Applause on the 2019 national championship for Virginia this right now if youre the Eagles you want to you know just not let this game get out of shape in a minute and a half youve done a nice job keeping the game close youre only down by 10 I want to get Virginia on a little bit of a run here Gardner Applause in amongst three Defenders and the infraction against the Eagles Garners only six six but hes strong hes wide he does a lot of work inside you know you talked about his numbers last year respectable Tom for sure 156 rebounds I think if they can get you know a rebound and a half two rebounds more out of him thatll really help the causes here Music Tony Bennetts team was right in the middle of the ACC a season ago as far as team percentage from the freethrow line they were eight in the conference and Gardner was 79 percent he was in the top ten seventh from the line for the ACC Applause oint production tonight Mike puts him over 2 000 career points played at East Carolina as well played 79 games for the Pirates before Norman Franklin has been the story for the Virginia so far though 13 points for him really shooting ball well from three how about right ripping the ropes he has made the score put a little flare on that one Mike the between the legs dribble and A Little Fall Away hit that net and right with the bucket closing seconds first half entry pass right back out to Clark Defender went by no look to Gardner Applause Iowas fooled I dont know about you Mike heres delicious waves everybody out as hes got the nice thing is he got the switch he got vanderblouse on him knew he had a big and he could take him off the dribble now he didnt but vanderblast didnt give up the drive but he was able to get a nice look on his jump shot 13 points in the first half for Wright and you mentioned Armon Franklin Mike the senior in his second year in the Virginia program after transferring from Indiana nobody attempted more threepointers last year for Virginia than Armand Franklin and every shot hes taken has been from behind the arc 305 also perfect at the freethrow line so extremely efficient I mean you take five shots and score 13 points in the half thats as efficient as it gets I mean when you look back at last season Mike 21 times he hit double fingers in scoring in the 35 games that they played including three in the NIT what you know I I mentioned the fact that he could shoot I mean its two years ago 42 from three last year down to 29 theyve got to get back up closer to that 40 which hes gotten off to a nice start here he made 53 threes Kihei Clark led the way with 54 main threes a season ago Gardner back in the line lets have a bit of an unorthodox release at the freethrow line just under 80 percent they cant argue with the numbers just kind of pushes it up too softly yeah in front of his out in front of his forehead a little bit 80 though you live with that Applause final seconds for right and the Eagles three three Ball Ultimate right Franklin will not get it away how about Justin Wright Mike that makes it an eightpoint game and 16 points for him what a half this again is theyre gonna have to get out get a hand up he has proven himself from behind the arc three in that first half to close the gap to eight Virginia had nine made field goals in that first half and six of them Music theyre in the threepoint airspace and the last thing you want to do is give a visiting team hope in a game like this and the longer this game lingers like this the more hope that North Carolina Central will have so glad that youre with us Tom wormy along with Mike jaminski the GMan the Duke Legend the AllAmerican this 29year Broadcasting we have a competitive ball game through the first 20 minutes and change as we crank up the second half outstanding ACC college basketball production crew also here in Charlottesville to bring you this one lets see if that threepoint shooting uh holds up in the second half for Virginia like it did in the first 20 minutes a shot clock down to 2G man key hey Clark both sides of the rim and no good again of the guys on the floor you want him taking that long contested shot at the end of the clock that possession didnt do much Applause and the Eagles cant do much with it thats what they uh you know talking to Lavell Moten medley bacon he really does a nice job of setting screens and rolling into the lane area just couldnt get a handle on the pass that time just the third turnover of the game for the Eagles medley bacon only played about six minutes in that first half Mike did have a couple of personal fouls right one on two one on Three still got the shot away and I think if coach Martin had to save him for the second half because of those fouls free throws upcoming for Virginia on the drive and fouled Beekman making his way to the rim and thats the one beside from his threepoint shooting the one area of Virginia really had an edge in that first half at the freethrow line 14 of 16 in the first 20 minutes although for Beekman first free throw attempts of the ball game 76 from the strike the season to go for Reese Beekman averaged just over eight points per game about four rebounds as well set a School record Mike with 73 steals yeah great hands and thats gonna be interesting to me in this second half what the score rate is how liberal Tony Bennett substitutes you know and if hes going to keep his starters out there for an extended period of time Clark and Franklin both over 17 minutes of action in the first half out of that starting lineup active defense Gardner ended up with the basketball with the whistle goes against Virginia thats the thing of Gardner he said 66 and he can defend out on the perimeter like that we try to put it up on the rim thatd be bacon clockwise got Cedric up in the air well designed played a lot to get the screen and was able to rather than go right up with this shot did a nice job collecting himself and then drawing the contact good finish and not complete the threepoint play for the graduate student center seven footer 235 for medley bacon out of Baltimore Maryland theres a transfer from McNeese State Applause third on Maltby Marquis Maltby number 11 for the visiting Eagles senior guard out of Raleigh North Carolina and a transfer from New Hampshire Music shot clock at 10 for Clark Applause not a ton of movement from Virginia here a lot of standing around some oneonone dribbling not a lot of ball movement or player movement four on the shot clock Gardner and Clark Shedrick beacon on the inbound Franklin in there as well keep an eye on that shot clock Franklin got it away Big Time play and uh he had uh and the bacon bearing down on two with a hand up in his face that was a tough finish Applause foreign language for the North Carolina Central Eagles completely changed now they they feel like they belong out on the court not backing down from the number 18 team in the nation now its very early in the season I dont know how much Credence head coaches put in those rankings at the Disco rankings Music Shedrick contacts file against Shedrick and this just bails out a possession that was going nowhere four seconds on the shot clock on a sideline out of bounds and then maltsby that was a thats about as good a look as youre going to get in the half court Applause he wants to be shot 33 percent made 23 threes a season ago for the Eagles Shedrick just picked up his third personal as well so Cafaro has come into the line Applause crowded jpj getting a little testy right now to see the great life on the bench for the Eagles the lead is five for Virginia hes been accelerating lost the basketball two on one hanging and scoring and its boom and a Timeout on the court well and what a great job Boone did on a twoonone break holding the play making the defense commit and then finishing the play after he made the three for Lavelle Moten and his Eagles great player in his own right Lavelle Moten third in school history at North Carolina Central in points over 1700 in his career and think too you mean you you forced Tony Bennett to take a timeout before the under 16 which was coming and he just he he had to stop that run foreign so if you go back to the first half Mike about 10 minutes and 45 seconds of game time just two baskets and both of them Franklin threepoint shots thats a breakdown Music see where the other source of offense might come from could it be beefing could it be vanderplas has come into the game hes got a three Mark stumbled caused by the contact who they gonna give this one to maltsby you know at least in the short term in the near term in this half if Im if Im Lavelle mode Im gonna pack it in Im gonna see Im going to test that threepoint shooting out in the second half of Virginia see if there still as hot make them prove themselves again and then press your defense out seven of 15 so far in the game that was the fourth on maltsby as he trudges Eagle bench area with Kihei Clark at the free course but only one of five in this half correct after going six of 12 straight in yes maltsby just hit a three as well for the Eagles he has to go to the bench and foul trouble and the mark comes up empty he was 78 last season from the line against the tightest game with a three for NC Central inside deadly bacon Miss tough angle he hit the court Mike and there was a whistle a lot of activity under the hoop and the fouls against Cafaro Cavaliers by three Wright hasnt scored in his head uh you know its been Boone who has stepped up and also theyre playing better as a unit offensively theyve got the three assists on four made field goals so getting stuff out of their offense instead of oneonone Applause medley bacon at the freethrow line hes all for one from the line tonight couple of points for him so far connecting from the line and inching closer to Virginia lets see and the Eagles have done a nice job spreading the score Tony against setting the higher picking roll with medley bacon and rolling him into the rim lets see if they keep going too bad Applause 1543 on the clock Mike in the second half and this is a onepoint game Virginia LED 3830 at halftime I mean theyve only scored five points so far in the second half Franklin he got bumped that was Devin butts 52 in Maroon 5 second foul on Bots the fourth on the team well yeah right now if Virginia can get into the bonus fast thats really going to help them out because they really struggled to find offense other ways Applause Virginia got to the freethrow line 16 times in the first half and made 14 of those led by Cafaro and Franklin both four for four from the line in the first half butts on the hold thats another one his third and those are again you know as far as getting to the bonus those are the cheap fouls that you cant give up against this team it was a grab on a play 30 feet from the basket so all of a sudden its NC Central shooting a better percentage of the team right now 41 38 and a half percent from the force of Virginia Franklin will not improve on those figures and in the shots Virginia is getting a tough theyre contested Applause North Carolina Central LED this game two nothing that was their last lead chance with a bucket to take the lead vanderplas held his ground Beekman the kick Clark thats a couple of feet behind the line Vander plaskka Farrell tried to volleyball it couldnt get to it Applause Music the glass and good Eric Boone and even though coffaro is seven feet hes not the shot blocker that that pedrick is Music Applause for Clark we talked about the guy with the championship pedigree he knew his team he needed a lift of some sort Clark led the team last season in made threes beeping with the steal rock the rim against those lazy passes you really have to be careful against this Virginia team and that Beak was so opportunistic in a blink Virginia has taken a fourpoint lead after trailing by one right a little follow away and he hits it Big Time answering the crowd the crowd was quiet theyd gotten back into it but a terrific answer first basket of the second half for Justin Wright Beekman Applause this is a ball game Applause foreign Applause Music to the basket Applause Clark Cafaro power dribble and the finish and this group out here right now Tom may be the best offensive unit that Virginias had in the game we got Franklin out in the wing with dinkling and then Andrew Place and capara with that finish inside Monroe picked up his third personal Applause ity so Virginia and NC Central going to toe points for him so Tony Bennetts team challenged this evening in their home opener on the other the other thing right now too is the next foul by Central puts Virginia in the bonus for the rest of the half dont forget Tony Bennett is 178 and 37 on this court as the head coach of the Cavaliers but Faro couldnt finish off that old school threepoint play you want to stay tuned for the fast break presented by your local Ford dealer thats the Ford fast break and its coming up in just a bit for 12 19 to go in the second half Tom wormy Mike jaminski here at John Paul Jones Arena well the Cafaro was looked at by the training staff in the first half doesnt seem to have affected his play so far Applause this incredible facility 17th season Virginia program inside jpj Applause they win 80 percent of their games in this building and theyre in a fight with the Eagles that came up short sander place Virginia also 8710 Mike against nonconference opponents at home under Tony Bennett oh thats a good thing on that kick because Cedric was wide open ready to dunk the ball Music well take that I mean you only you get only two seconds more added to the shot clock because you save a dunk Music three double figure scorers beatman Franklin safaro right now for the Cavaliers shot pocket 10 for Clark thats against the Zone Vanderbilt is a good guy to get right in the middle of that as a passer and score shoots it at the end of the clock and makes it Applause two for three a threepoint attempts and this is I talked about him working his way in hell get more aggressive looking for his offense as this season grows Applause grabbed that loose ball Applause Second Chance on the possession they try to get him to medley bacon actually against Shedrick you cant throw that lob hes too too bouncy vanderplas again looking for his third three out of the corner he took that threepointer out for a test drive Applause medley bacon I got a big double team in the corner nice job taking some time off the clock he was fenced in for a moment now right working on Clark came up short and that Clark pulled down the board yeah better job Clark is strong and he got underneath right that time forced a tough shot Virginia working on an 80 run make it a 100 run Kendrick at The Rim much better balance in this half of attacking the paint area and then hitting some timely threes lead is back up to 12 so the Eagles had taken a onepoint lead just a few minutes ago theyve got a three from the corner nice swing that time Devin butts Applause second three made for butts seven made threes in the game currency Central tapped away and stolen on the hustle boom one on one goes Euro score it that was a an excellent defensive play I beat him that time but he just got beat by a better move again the good hand on the on that Wing pass and I think they got away with a little bit of walk that time one two three and then it came down yeah thats thatd be a travel in most in most leagues and the third foul on Beekman hes going on the bench with but yeah I mean even you know that all being said that was a that was a good finish through some good defense so beekmans out of there with 10 points and three personal fouls and the threepoint play completed by Eric Boone lets see how long it goes out at the 9 30 Mark lets see how long Tony Bennett keeps him on the bench with those fouls so both Boone and right Mike have 18 points to lead the way to the Eagles tonight McNeely Music Ill tell you what he put medley bacon aside and then grab the offensive glass the manly bacon was begging for a ball right though youre not going to get that on the road follow Clark he went for the Steal heres the look I mean this is you know on the work side and it just two guys working one guy wound up on the floor and he got by Boone who came over to help defensively and shedra took it right boom foreign Applause combined 167 rebounds out of the Five Spot pretty good production and Im always going to give those Five Guys back and down didnt get the bounce for the depot and Shedrick came over the top for the board yes Applause 2822 the advantage on the glass for Virginia Applause he has been all over the offensive glass these last three or four possessions fighting up high there with medley bacon Franklin stop and start Applause hes a little in between right now he wants to get that under eight time out and hes got that in his pocket now 18 points for Franklin leading scorer for the Cavaliers offensive foul on that possession Applause Music so leading the way is Franklin with 18 and its a 10point lead for Virginia Music you know off the dribble thats what uh North Carolina Central thats where theyve been doing most of their damage and Clark just really quick that was a tough call I gotta say Applause Virginia with a basketball 7 50 to go in the second half they had an eightpoint halftime lead 3830 in the first ever meeting between the programs first game of the season Drop It Low Shedrick put it on the floor it goes against NC Central Applause medley bacon nice the production out of that pick and roll game with uhfaro picking them up in the second half Applause Music Applause Shadrick is now three for three from the line its going to be Justin Wright coming back into the game for NC Central right and boom filled with 18 and they can uh you know Tony Bennett the longer they can keep this 10 11 12 point lead out there he can keep them on the bench with those fouls Applause Music three fouls for Beacon and 10 points one of three doubledigit scores Carls got 10 Franklins got 18 eagles with the basketball medley bacon backing it down on the Block its going to be a goaltending violation against Shedrick anyway hes got some nice moves inside and theyve given him a lot of room some good spacing so he had really the whole paint area and you know a lot of times Thomas shot blocker will give you that Latitude inside and let you have the catch thinking that he can clean things up six points for medley bacon lead is 10 Shedrick LED this team and blocked chops a season ago with 67 Music the double double on the road at Syracuse thats Gardner hes had a tough time for anything only four now in the game in the paint Applause just three points for Gardner if you told the Belmont and Gardner will have three points with 655 to go hed take it but nine rebounds so it hasnt affected the other parts of this game points from the free throw line for Gardner Music spinning around the defender contact on the floor oladapo oneonone situation Gardner is three for four from the freethrow line thats the ninth team foul against North Carolina Central for the eagles they you know they need to get right going again last few minutes only three points and there are only two points in the half and uh right now theyre putting some they got some length on and Franklin has been guarding him and hes done a nice job shutting him down now Virginia they will double big side to side and they they think about medley bacon that time yeah right was five of eight shooting in that first half shot blocks at seven got Franklin in the air nice job defensively running out of time great defensive stand that time great job by Franklin Justin Wright Applause Isaac McNeely Applause Music heres that look and see again he sees donor off the dribble but a nice job Franklins thing is grounded keeping me you know he knows with his length that he can get up and bother that shot foreign double bonus now for Virginia and Franklin at the line Music now five for five from the freethrow line comes back in for NC Central beekmans back in the game as well Mike hes in the backcourt and now theyve got some real size out there with Clark out of the game one of the few times hell be on the bench but you know youve got a back court of Beekman and Franklin thats some length out there defensively Virginia is 190 alltime against opponents out of the meact also play Maryland Eastern Shore November 25th out of the Mia Wright turns around and it stays down Butch Moten wants a timeout I got the bigger cover that time that was a shot that thats the kind of play he was manufacturing for himself so you got the switch with Gardner and he knew that he could create a nice pump fake its 20 points now Mike for right seven of 13 from the floor and that includes three for three from threepoint distance after 14 minutes in this half theyve kept him in check but uh Music so theyre checking on Justin Wright right now at the end of that eagle bench well retape see what he did in the first half there with those 16 points he let all scorers in the first half and he was five of eight from the floor all of those threes that I mentioned that hes made were also in the first half I think I may be working out a little cramp there as well Letterman scoring a season ago hes doing it tonight first team mall miak and looks like hes headed to having a repeat of that granted its early but uh on the road in this environment against this defensive team to do that had the night that hes had so far out of Greenville North Carolina 62 and 195 pound guard and a junior coach Lavelle Moten you can see hes got some moves question is can I hydrate a little bit more to get back in the games yeah the issues as well with one of his teammates thats Chris Monroe number two I think coach mote and Mike would take a 10point game with five and a half minutes to go considering they actually had a onepoint lead earlier in the half ever they LED 4443 lets just fast forward to this and see who wins the last getting past the gmans Bedtime here approaching 11 Eastern this whole Daylight Savings Time change thing has really thrown me for a little time come on the rods and cones are all messed up Music Clark trying to work off that vanderplast screen could not materialize Music Clark lets it Fly front rim rebound frankly watch out that was a collision weight and a half and Franklin might get the worst of that although popping up with the help of his teammates immediately and there was a foul in the process butts picked up number four that means free throws for Virginia theres just nobody out in the perimeter everybody packed in Virginia Central so Franklin Mike is up to 20 points five of nine shootings six of six from the line he was part of that early threepoint barrage by Virginia made three of their first four attempts setting a little threepoint tone whats up weve got 10 made threes in the game Applause Franklins career high is 23 he has been talking about again as efficient as he can only nine shots excellent from the free throw line Applause Beekman upset with himself or not he saw two points he saw a pick six right there Im glad he didnt dive after that one because he was headed in our general direction power yes I love you I dont hold my ground for the offensive fouls when youre this close to the action shot clock at 10 Applause was met at the rim Shedrick was there Franklin two maybe vanderplas as well converging on the ball carrier Music Baseline move vanderplas this is what Shedrick does he does does a nice job of fighting off inside and then protecting the rim cleaning things up Applause really solid I mean you right from the start you saw the bounce in his game and he paid his dues his first year as well expanded last year tremendously still growing into that role I think red shirt Junior 611 okay vanderplas 68 continues to play you put those those three in that rotation gives you some good depth with the four five you can throw some different combinations out there good looking front line and across challenged the shooter Gordon Stripped Away Gordon got it back right into vanderpas Cedric grounded heres Clark inside of four minutes to go in regulation excuse me yo Ill tell you what Franklin just he runs about three miles in during the game along that Baseline just running off the screen trying to find an opening vanderplas kicked it out from Green Applause really nice answer about Virginia to that that lead and uh North Carolina Central is really pumped up at that point but Virginia came out defensively shut things down on the perimeter 11 made threes for Virginia out of the corner thats a three ball Gordon was Gordon took a tumble after the shot as well but got it away and connected with a sophomore forward from Powder Springs Georgia its a Mississippi transfer Mike first year in the program Applause spinning knocked Away by Gordon Clark has nine points in the game and just made his second three 7159 Virginia 7159 243 to go in regulation here at John Paul Jones Arena Arman Franklin Leading The Way with 21 points four made threes he is tonights Hardees star to watch writing the thing too when we talked about the pace of play and this a 12 point lead against thats a big lead for them just the way they grind that is not the shot deep in the shot clock took a chance that was Shedrick for three right Mike hes now over three in his career yeah youre not going to hear that call too much oh man Master block tried to save it thats a call you will hear a lot though man that young man Mike this is not a time for Mercy Virginia the Guardians of the rim Applause going through all Mr grishams books his defense is like the firm out there what else we got all right were not quite into time you keep doing that Im going to send you to Camino Island Cedric double team team play was well might have hit the end line Applause these two teams tonight theyve been sparring partners jiminsky all right Im done with that yes you are that ended about 30 seconds ago Im behind the times as usual 7159 inside it two minutes to go gold Tom gold those are references to John Grisham books use Courtside tonight watching the action that finger roll drops Ill tell you what Devin Gordons kind of come alive late this one a lot of good things Mike for the Eagles from tonight and its still a 10point game yeah no no question about it I think that coach mosins gonna have a good game film to look at here early in the half the Eagles went on a run and took a onepoint lead wakeup call for the Cavaliers Applause Music leads the charge tough catch on the bounce pass Applause Gordon Beekman and that should Bob do it the final minute Tony Bennett trying to close in on win number 317 as the head coach of Virginia and is 386 overall he is approaching Mike 400 career victories in his 17th year as a Collegiate head coach Music this one was in question for a heartbeat evil a rim Bender from Shedrick adding the punctuation Applause to the story authored tonight by the Virginia Cavaliers Applause just stop already Applause foreign Eagles trying to get a shot away late in the shot clock theres only 10 seconds on the game clock and that will be Virginia basketball and that should be the final count so heres what you got coming up Monmouth right back at it on Friday well have it for you Northern Iowa Baylor are going to play Baylor is going to be a Eastern Shore out of the meac as well and thatll do it good first night by the Cavaliers and Ill tell you what the Belmonts should be very proud of his team and the effort they gave here Trail by eight at halftime and losing 7361 and Tony Bennett and the Virginia Cavaliers I would say he feels like he Avenged that loss to Navy in the opener last year they win it tonight against the Eagles and all around what we expected from Virginia and they did it without
