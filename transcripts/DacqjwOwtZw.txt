team one each time Bert Smith Clarence Armstrong and Tim clockery your officials and for this pit team one of the best road teams in the country this season they finish with two at home and theyre hoping to take care of business on their home floor pit will have it to start they vaporized BC on Saturday thats a good word on the strength of 16 threes that tied to season high its a team that lives and dies by the threepoint shot they absolutely do in the last six games the four wins theyre averaging over 13 threes a game at 47 in those two losses theyre shooting 24 theres your math they need to make threes bub Carrington hit seven from Deep when he went for a career high 27 over the weekend a lot of dribbling the turnaround not there feder Rico feder Rico the offensive rebound Florida State gave up 21 offensive boards to Georgia Tech over the weekend Blake Henson for three the 99th three of his career we welcome those of you who just watched Clemson beat Syracuse to the Peterson Event Center first meeting of the season between Florida State and pit with top Korean ion sh and the Clemson win is good news for pit fans Pittsburgh if it wins out and if Clemson beats Wake Forest on Saturday the Panthers will have a double Buy in next weeks ACC tournament pit coming off a big win at BC over the weekend they hit 16 threes in that game Blake Hinson got an early three tonight for pit bub Carrington who had a career high 26 seven on Saturday with the bucket there meanwhile Florida State coming off a road loss at Georgia Tech where they really struggled on the glass well they struggled big time they gave up 21 offensive rebounds for 21 Second Chance points you cant do that anywhere but especially on the road in this league and that they cant allow that to happen tonight a good early sign for Florida State Daren Green from the outside and were get a bow a hold against Florida State its on jir Watkins their leading score and your best player absolutely I mean hes hes approved so much as a transferred from BCU where hes done a great job in college and he just come here and hes got an incredible Purpose with the way that he plays the movement the movement without the ball for a guy thats wired to score has been phenomenal for Florida State Austin steps into a three and the rebound taken by the Spaniard Baba Miller were watching one of the more skilled 611 players in college basketball and as he gets stronger as he gets finished stretching his lower body going to be even that much more of a force finds cam cor and Hinson cleans pit leading the ACC and threepointers made Florida state turns opponents over at the highest rate in the ACC thats the tail of the tape tonight Florida States great at taking it away pit protects the ball better than anybody in concer well they do and and its going to come down all night to how does pit handle and attack the switching of Florida State irregardless if they switch the point guard through the power forward or at certain times go Point through Center one through five the the big part of this game plan is how they attack it they want to attack but theyve also got to be able to get threes inside of this game when youre making the amount of Threes they make the most amount of Threes in the ACC and theyre coming off a game a we dont need this we dont need this early Watkins and Carrington have to be separated Tim clockery pushing the fresh man low and Carrington away from any further trouble and then goes to calm down Blake Henson who is trying to rile up the crowd exactly and credit the referees credit the referees here this could have easily been a double technical good thank goodness they didnt call it it would have been a tough way to start this game theyre going to try to get it under control here oh theyre going to go to the monitor to see if there was something more there Im not sure there was come on man were at the zoo in Pittsburgh thats play how about this we woke up this morning the weather in Pittsburgh today most of the day was in the 70s absolutely I I think at one point I got into my car to come to one of the walkthroughs my car said 81 degrees I dont know if that was if that was something wrong in the jeep that I rented but it it it only dropped to 79 it was beautiful today so they will call a technical foul on Carrington Watkins gets a technical as well so they could have done it they could have done it right away its probably the right call you hate to see it uh for two good players two key players and for Watkins thats too early foul and he goes to the bench for Florida State now foul trouble is not as big a deal for Florida State as other teams they go 12 deep they like to play a lot but Watkins is one of the few guys who plays 30 plus minutes and hes been playing a lot the plate is low cant finish another offensive rebound for pit well what this does is it changes the threepoint shooting for sure and it also changes the attack Chandler Jackson being in the game youre more have to see some Zone here maybe earlier inside of this game if if coach Hamilton decides to switch it up but you do see what he can do he can cut he can move uh he just doesnt have maybe the ability to get to the rim the way Watkins does three early turnovers for pit they have had 10 or few were turnovers in seven straight games Taylor B Bowen in there for Florida State along with Chandler Jackson heres warley Big 67 point guard the drop off to Corin beautiful play cam Corin has improved so much hes quick hes a rim presence offensively maybe not the rim Defender that hell be down the road but his movement his activity has been really big as Florida state has progressed through the season when you play 12 like Florida state does you can pressure in the back court all game Carrington to feder Rico its knocked Away by warley itll stay with pck we watch this now we watch Jaylen War get in the paint reads the pick and roll gets the spin they step up to help freder Rico steps up to help theres cam corn sliding behind the defense to get the easy two Florida State a team that has a very strong chance to get a first round by in the ACC tournament Here Comes Carrington coming off that career high low at a career high nine assists on Saturday and he gets his first two points Jaylen low is in constant movement when I watch him play he reminds me of a young man that played at Michigan for two years Kobe buffkin whos now with the Atlanta Hawks left after his sophomore year uncanny ability with that left hand can go both ways buffkin might have been ahead as a Defender low as ahead as a ball Applause handler corn from the Baseline carry in skies for the car up ahead feder Rico turns it over four turnovers now for pit both teams have combined for seven turnovers in the first four minutes Jacksons pull up blocked by Austin who was one of the best shot blockers in the country the last two years when he played for High Point warley using the size on low let him play here Comes bub Carrington pull up three in transition out there Jackson the other way green catch release Splash he is so good in transition and if there was one focal point today in that pit walk through is we have got to stay attached to Darren Green and find him in transition last year against pit in this building 5 threes on eight attempts 24 points ishma leet getting ready to check in for pit low to the basket green snags the board good pickup there good pick up by Zach Austin good pass down L feder Rico the block on B Bowen for those of you watching on ESPN but the good news for Jeff capable Clemson beat Syracuse tonight that was part of the scenario pit needed to potentially get a double buy if pit wins out and Wake Forest beats Clemson on Saturday pit is guaranteed a double buy I think I misspoke earlier I think I said Clemson if they beat Wake Forest on Saturday pit his own and two or has lost to Clemson so you got the Clemson win against Syracuse which you needed if your pit if Wake now beats Clemson on Saturday and pit wins tonight and beats NC State pit would have a double by bu yeah and Im just still stunned to seeing Jeff Cable in that suit seems like it was decades ago coaches were all in suits he looked good in that blue suit with the white Su you always a suit guy well no not I changed what everybody else changed Id probably go back to it but uh theyre much more comfortable coaches are much more comfortable on that sideline no doubt 103 run for Florida State green got eight Henson and green matched up against each other Henson driving and calling for the offensive foul youre good with that though Hinson felt he had a matchup and he could take green to the basket absolutely but the whole key for Florida State in this game is to not let Blake Hinson get loose they got up into him Darren Green got into his body thats what Clemson did he didnt even attempt a three till they were under four minutes to go in the first half against Clemson because the way Clemson defended if youre up in him it becomes much harder he needs the space to move pouring through resistance at the rim and it draws the foul Darren Green and you and this is where Leonard Hamilton has been Leonard Hamilton all these years when his Defenders could get up into your chest get under you the Terrence mans the Devon vassels all those type of guys that hes had that were two and three stars maybe tops that he turned into NBA lottery picks and NBA NBA big money type guards when you could get up into he never worried about the size of the guy that he had in the match he only worried about the heart in the fight and I think thats what you had with Darren Green Jr in that position he they were not going to give Blake Hinson an inch and and they got the turnover out horen right now playing some of his best ball of the Season at 14 seven over the weekend averaging better than 11 a game over his last five hes been in double figures and four of those games thats a good sign right there cam corn making two hes a 59 free throw shooter in the league so youre coach Hamilton in that staff you like seeing your young big man go to the line and and cash in Watkins on the bench for Florida state with the two fouls hes their leading score Primo Spears guarding Carrington Spears too long to be a catalyst low gets free Carrington came off that ball screen if he swings it to buff not to buff Im getting confused now he swings it to low right away I keep seeing Kobe buff if he swings it to him right away theyve got a chance to get into the side pick and roll with hints in the low just a little bit quicker Here Comes Primo Spears he lost Applause Music Applause it low dips underneath beautiful move by The Freshman from Texas he has that in hes got great footwork he can play off either foot feet hes like a big man with his up and unders Baba Miller leaves it short and Diaz Graham picks it up off the Applause scramble low to Diaz Graham the slip screen worked perfect beautiful play and thats a pitch staple the slip screens its something that Leonard Hamilton and the staff were concerned about especially out of timeouts but they know that this team is looking to get slips especially with with with guo as much as they Applause can Spears doubled this is Josh nickelberry and the battle for the rebound its gy and Diaz Graham spins out to leit Les been arguably the top six man in the ACC blocked by Jackson nickelberry wide open no nickar is wide open hes got to make that shot and he will hes capable of making that shot his percentages dont say that but throughout his career he has and that would be a huge boost to Florida State you see Josh nickelberry make some threes tonight Dio Diaz Graham not there that was not a good shot there was no balance hes a 7 foot one guy who shot that like hes 71 and Spears turns it over ESPNs exclusive presentation of college basketball is presented by Progressive Insurance bundle home one thing that pit is so good at is either setting the screen slipping the screen but most importantly flipping the screen great action by G Diaz Here Comes low look at the space between the two Defenders as he hits Garo on the slip that has got to get cleaned up you cannot allow that type of space for the passer most of those passes come in the form of a pocket pass bounce pass he didnt even need to do that thats way too much room that Florida State gave Im sure its been covered in the timeout and the hands werent close but that is where they are so dangerous setting those screens on the side in the step up or at the top in transition andish Ro top green with Tuesday night at the Applause peak Jaylen low a career high nine assists last time out Hensons a top five scorer in the ACC he leades the conference and made threes backing down Primo Spears theres the double and he draws the foul we were talking about this at shootter around so important and hes he hes got he cannot settle for jumpers especially when theyre up in his body I thought he tried he didnt go in the post enough against Clemson in that loss hes big enough strong enough obviously hes become such a a better threepoint shooter in college hes two years at Old Miss he made 91 total in two years hes already got 99 this year 97 last year he went for being a 32 threepoint shooter to 42 this year with all that being said go to the post and get your baskets and get to the foul line and thats exactly what he did and and hes a 67 free throw shooter that needs to improve B back on his free throw offensive rebounds an issue for Florida State they gave up 21 against Georgia Tech an issue tonight Henson with his 100th triple of the Season hes now three away from breaking Ashton Gibbs single season School record what a beautiful shot you do not want to give up offensive rebounds especially off the foul line and then they turn into an open three in the corner basically a fourpoint play and that was at the other end six turnovers for FSU here comes the action hes wide open they dribble back up there is nobody near him the kick up you know hes in the game youve got to find him in the corner Leonard Hamilton said today something that was was tough to hear cuz hes such a great defensive coach he said this is one of the quietest teams if not the quietest team hes ever coached and that says a lot for a guy that has done what he has done uh as a coach because he is all about toughness he is all about aggressive that was pretty aggressive its going to be a goal T and you saw carington Fearless going to the basket one of the missing pieces for Florida State this year while they have size on the roster they dont have that impose your will type of shot blocker like a a Chris kumaji or a Michael Ojo theyve had others fandu cabin gy a few years ago was a terrific interior player defensively Baba Millers got but he plays more like a guard jayen gainy just hasnt been healthy since he came over here from Brown and cam Corns a little undersized yeah and but cam has gotten better people forget Baba Miller just turned 19 hes been here he missed all those games last year for for the for the for the eligibility issues which made zero sense but this is what hes capable of getting down low driving the ball hes not had an off season of weightlifting in this program yet he played on the national team overseas this summer hes going to get better hes his number one transferable skill right now to the NBA is his potential but thats not enough theres so much more that hes got to get before he makes a career out it hon again and the battle for the board controlled by Corin and he can run he he he just needs to get lower get stronger with the ball right on Miller was guarded a moment ago by guo Diaz Graham mayorca against the Canary Islands its the Spanish Civil War I was not very good in history but Ill take your word for it cam corn has improved thats the second time hes gone to that spin hes got a really good touch and that one rolls in by Carrington who had s threes on Saturday he plays with so much confidence I mean watching him in person now knowing some of his story its amazing the confidence that he has as a freshman in this league hes earned every bit of his success so far this year without a doubt they call him bub this is Miller thats way off in Florida state two for six from three its not a very good threepoint shooting team pit turns it over they have more turnovers today than they did against BC on Saturday when they only turned it over five times yeah we we got p in in a little bit of a home run mode right now look at the play he ready to shoot the ball knocks it down bub Arington is a guy back home okay in the DMV he got cut off his a team okay his eighth and nth grade year he finally makes it as a 10th grader he becomes one of the leading scores in the Nike ebl League which is as tough as it comes and hes hes come up the hard way in a sense that so much of his basketball was playing against other grown men at the parks or or in the gym and his dad whos an absolute Legend Bob Carrington senior whos just an absolute legend in the DMV would get him in the gym take him and get shots at 6 in the morning this guys earned his career and he just picked up his second foul go head to the bench thats a tough play but you know when youre playing with that kind of confidence just where Jeffs got to make a decision with 9 minutes I got a feeling hell come back in here let him come out a bit and uh relax get his get his mind right again come back into the game you dont want to play too long without him and you dont want to be in a situation where you dont have Carrington and low on the floor at the same time lean is fully capable here with low these two have played well together throughout the year lean is so impressive what he did last year at Rhode Island coming into this and coming off the bench just selfless guy who knows how to score and that move bringing low into the starting lineup bringing legged off the bench has really changed the potential and the ceiling for this pit team absolutely absolutely because when Leed comes into the game hes either going to be playing against a tired starter or the other teams backup guard and hes going to win that Advantage most of the time he he can really really score he can get to the rim he can run the point Austin from the corner the three is good by the red shirt Jr who transferred in from high points yeah thats he had 10 the other night against BC hes a 33 on the year you like seeing that if youre caped theyre getting that open three in the corner right now it is four of eight from three when they make at least 10 threes they are 11 and three this season green wanted his third Triple B Bowen no shot clock reset and the Freshman to the foul line Zack Austin he slides slides on the penetration B Bowen steps up to help probably too much it was a nonpenetrating drive Drive throws it into the corner you dont need to overh help out of the strong side corner beautiful three by Zach Austin fto Rico just picked up his second foul our next NBA Wednesday double header starts in htown Rockets hosting Kawai and the Clippers at 730 then Yannis and the Bucks begin a 4game West Coast Wing against Steph and the Warriors coverage begins with NBA Countdown at seven on ESPN now the pressure now we see to slow it down a little bit theyll get into the switch game theyre doing a good job with Darren Green Jr trying to deny Blake Hinson his easy catches in scoring areas Hinson down low and fouled from behind he get warley his first beautiful action right here with Blake kinon all right he set the screen theres a slip they throw the back their ball back to guo okay Diaz Graham a play they work on sliding up they want to hit the slip on the pick and roll excellent slip by Hinson out of that ball scen Hons knocked down a couple of Threes but weve also seen him be aggressive today going to the basket a little more than usual absolutely when youre as efficient and as big and strong as he is and you can shoot the threee youve got to find ways to get to the f I mean its just its imperative he should be averaging six seven free throw attempts a game Florida state has missed six of its last Applause seven shot clock down to four warley in trouble here comes Diaz Graham all the way the follow by leot whos one of the best rebounders on this team see youve got to get back thats where corn corn cam corn has got to get back and get in the play hes playing extended minutes right now with the foul issues shot pick Taylor B Bowen Corin stripped and theyll get a foul coach Florida State struggled on the defensive glass Saturday Eight Second Chance points for pit yeah you got to get back I mean you got to get back you got people challenging the shot but they forgot about the next man layup 2007 from the archives remember that game the last time Tom Korean was in this building finish the story oh we won in overtime on a Sunday afternoon uh on CBS Billy Packer was doing the game we had some great games with Pittsburgh Im telling you now when you you were tough and it was this was such a a such a big deal to come in here and get a win in here we had great battles with pit great respect for this program and I also got the coach here for a year and our daughter Megan was born here so I got special affection for bit 1994 1995 That season Ralph Willards first at pit how about that hair oh coach that hair how about that hair oh my oh like this is not this is not right we are supposed to be a team thats one of the great things about b ESPN I am getting hijacked today they didnt have Barbers here in the steel city when you coached no no I didnt I didnt go man I was I wasnt making that much money plus I was newly married I just saved my money we went to a nice Italian restaurant across the street from where we live thats where my money Applause went that hair was flowing though flowing was that a mullet did you you scor the mullet no I wouldnt go with that it was a little long in back I wouldnt call it a mullet some might I wouldnt jir Watkins back into the game at two fouls Florida State steps out of bounds that team that you coached on Ralph Willards first season you were part of the staff that helped recruit the likes of fontego Cummings who got there the following year absolutely coach Willard is one of the finest coaches I I loved it I worked with him for four years at at Western Kentucky and one year here before I went with Tom ISO we had guys like Orlando and tiga haime Peterson Chris Gant biggest struggle that year Jerry McCulla was a great point guard who we didnt have because of a knee injury but uh I led my year here with Coach Willard and living in Pittsburgh of course those games are back at the old Fitzgerald Fieldhouse hinsons three another loose ball and this time Corin able to retrieve now from Florida State you got to go get inside right now and finish this half in the bonus youre one foul away away from the bonus Watkins blocked by Diaz Graham in a game like this where the scoring is six so imperative that you find a way to get easy baskets and right now the easy baskets are at the foul line have good verticality good verticality very good verticality CMO Diaz Graham has improved so much I got to watch him at IMG he is such a better player in in in the way that hes developed here for a guy he just come over from Spain such a developed player Jeff capable and his staff do a phenomenal job getting guys better hes still has some weight to put on but he spent the Summer with the team State side and part of his regiment was getting stronger and working on conditioning you can see it he can space and shoot he can pick and pop hes running better by the way that was a beautiful spin move by cam corn in the paint beautiful move using the glass scoring over his left shoulder right hand Corin and Darren Green of 18 of Florida States 21 as we get a foul on the Applause seminar yeah you have Carrington out of the game right now it is important that Florida State get into this get inside put even more pressure on the basketball with him out of the game Clarence Armstrong Blows the Whistle looked like Deontay green was trying to check into the game and green will come in to spell Corin yeah Deontay green he looked good in he looked good today in the walkr looked very very active the long rangey arms of the 67 warley almost forced to turn over I wouldnt have Cam kin out very long though hes playing really well hes playing very confident hes on the attack when you look at those stats on the attack tonight outside of corn and green as you saw no other Florida State player has made a field goal low defended by Watkins low splits the D and finds Austin Above the Rim get jayen low and Carlton Carrington their ability to escape traps to to to play in traffic to go both ways to just the the the the spinning that they have the wiggle that they play with phenomenal read phenomenal job getting in the paint four assists for low heres Austin Jeff cable telling me at shoot around part of the maturation for low is that he can play fast but in control now he really does have to change his speed thing they theyve done a really good job with this group I think I like Marcus Burton and and Braden Shrewsberry how much better theyve got an Notre damus freshman they understand it better such a big part of it watch now as Jaylen low gets in this paint crosses up gets in the paint inside out dribble beautiful dribble throws it up great lck look at that inside out dribble thats vintage thats one of the most underused and under dribble moves in basketball why is that be I I think people are afraid of the carry but it it sets up especially if you have a crossover and now you have the ability to get your hand on top of the ball and fake that crossover because people are jumping for it we worked on it all the time DNE Wade learned early on how important that move was Victor Oladipo guards that we had Dominique James Jerome McNeil West Matthews guys that came in here its its an added value to your repertoire its like having three extra moves when you can sell that cuz they dont know if its a hesitation they dont know if its a cross you keep the ball in your same hand and you could explode valuable move one out of two for Deontay green one of five Florida State players from Leonard Hamiltons home state of North Applause Carolina Jeffers setting the high pick and now the switch low guarded by Miller exactly what they wanted 80 of this walkr today was spent on attacking switch shot clock running down low over house and the battle for the board another offensive rebound for pit like it trapped underneath the basket and finds an opening what a beautiful move I thought he was driving to throw at Baseline he stop that de deceleration is excellent watching Leed is like watching a running back go through the holes he plants he steps he he uses the backboard that is a big time finish and he sh Tom Kanan 351 to go first half Pittsburgh with a sevenpoint lead Co K as you see no longer has the M I thought we were going to get something out of D cup and Zubin menty I know they had something back in that studio for us that we didnt catch heaz lets it Fly and the slim Reaper hits the slim Reaper Jimmy Carr who coached him at IMG when he got there said he was 172 lbs his first day at IMG they list him at 220 they must have weit him dripping wet and wearing some heavy duty Timberlands at some point I dont know if hes 220 yet that shot looked good and we got a foul underneath Miller got tied up with jeffris Baba Miller still down Applause Jeffers and Miller get tangled Applause up lets see if they go to the Applause monitor so they call Miller and jeffris for fouls and now theyre going to see if there was anything more egregious what do you see here coach I see two guys getting tangled up two guys that its hard to tell exactly who initiated that contact probably the right call because again youve already established what was going on earlier in the game when Watkins and Carrington got into it at the foul line its too bad looked like both of them took a harder hit than what the foul cost we had chirping early theres been some physicality so when youre a coach on the sideline what do you want to see from the officials in terms of taking control of the game consistency yeah you you you want you want consistency no doubt about that these are two very prideful teams I mean letter and hton Im with him today I dont see any signs of of a guy thats not loving coaching and not looking forward to to the the future of this and the recruiting and the portal and how he figures out how to make these guys better I mean its just the guys a legend he hes an absolute Legend as a coach and Jeff cable has won everywhere he has been and and hes doing it here in pit I mean it you play pit youre going to feel it for a few days there is no question about it to your point on Leonard Hamilton if Florida State wins tonight he will tie Gary Williams the former Maryland coach for fourth all time in terms of ACC regular season wins the only coaches in the history of the conference who would have more regular season will wins shashy Dean Smith and Roy Williams its amazing if theres a coach out there that doesnt like Leonard or doesnt respect him or maybe they dont know him but if they dont respect him theres something wrong with that person there really is I mean he is a tremendous coach he has meant so much to so many coaches as theyve come up the line hes turned out coaches but what people forget theres a lot of programs n that can that can get drafted what he does is he develops Pros thats what hes done I mean and and look at those guys we mentioned before teren man Devin Bassel those guys were not that highly recruited Jonathan Isaac the list goes on and on you named the big guys hes a developer and hes always had good people with him whether it be Charlton young Dennis Gates hes had Stan Jones for a long time now hes got Kevin nickelberry hes got Steve Smith hes done an outstanding job and and he just doesnt have a team yet right now that fits what hes built this which is constant switching constant harassment and if anything they lose far too many 5050 balls than what his teams have been used to losing they dont have that tenacious shot blocker that some of those great teams had under Leonard Hamilton no but you know what theyve gotten better throughout the year as as pit if this is on Diaz Graham its going to be his third and it is so Dio Diaz Graham with three Federico feder Ricos got two and buob Carrington two fouls for pit its in this if youre Florida State youre not worried about the score right now youre worried about making sure you can get something good in that paint or at the foul line every possession and if you get in the lane and kick it out make a three get on the glass offensive rebound the next foul by pit puts Florida state in the double bonus one week from today and Washington DC at Capital 1 Arena it is the tip off of the ACC mens basketball tournament so much to be decided whos going to be the one seat will it be Duke will it be Carolina can pit get a first round by and a second round by how much does Clemson and wake and pit how much do they have to do once they get to DC same with Virginia right now what pit better do is figure out the cam is going at it that was a terrible pass he stole it he gets to the rim this when youre a coach and when youre a team everything were talking about next week that is like a a month and a half from now as a coach right like all of these things you putting so much into each game each possession and all those things are down the road pit these are two teams like we said theyre prideful theyre going at each other and this is a hugely important game for both programs Co has put Florida State on the back of his bowling ball shoulders in this first half 14 points and hes done a lot of damage at the line eight parade at the strike he is hes aggressive and again we said this earlier his free throw percentage is not high at 59 but when you see him making it like this hes playing with tremendous confidence tonight look at the switch look at him down in a stance low back out to Hinson blocked by Miller low able to get it back and hits the elbow Lows got an aanny ability he finds the ball he can defend block shots right place right time there with that put back six points five assists for the Freshman Jaylen low youve got the match up you got the match up on Corin outside of Darren Green whos got the ball and Corin no other seminal has made a field goal in this first half thats one of their staple play plays the double curl just wasnt a great look leg it through the contact leg it again its like a running back going through a hole hes so quick getting it up to the rim hes strong Compact and Primo Spears was not aware of the pass a turn over watch it right now look at the kick out Hinson gets it blocked low reacts gets there quick stays in his shot beautiful play and heres leged doing what he does best create contact with time theyll play Cameron indoors Saturday night pit up by a dozen the Panthers finish out the regular season with two home games Florida State tonight NC State this weekend if pit wins both and Wake Forest beats Clemson on Saturday pit will have a double Buy in Washington DC for the ACC tournament yeah theyre playing for a lot theres no doubt about that theyre playing for their tournament life and theyre theyre doing it I mean theyve come out and theyve done it without Carlton Carrington thats where leg it is just invaluable to your team Le it the drive intercepted by Baba Miller shovels to Green shot fake lines it up knocks it down three threepointers for Darren Green he and Hinson are similar theyre both microwaves and can get hot quickly and they were both the keys to each theme Scot report of staying attached finding them in transition but Baba Miller with a great block that length when he gets down and plays like that I mean you put that young guy in a weight program for a year and help him get his shot his stance right when the sense of stepping into his shot going to be a phenomenal player Pinon bullies inside and pit extending its lead its 4029 timeout Jeff cable so in the last couple of games Saturday Blake Hinson picked up a couple of early fouls pit was able to you have two not good but great Shooters in Blake Hinson and Darren Green both of them in their careers have combined for 28 career games where theyve made at least five threepointers its amazing when you look back at what uh Blake Henson did in that Louisville game nine of 13 from three for 41 points but uh they can score they can get it quick theyre instant offense but the great thing about both of them theyve got many different ways to get there Spears hits the pullup and that is the first seminal with the exception of Corin or green to make a field goal low the feet inside jeffris gets the basket he had been scoreless in his last seven games and thats how the first half ends jayen low is oh you can get lost in all the hypotheticals and buy and double Buy in the ACC tournament the reality for pit the way their freshman back court has gotten better through the course of the Season it gives them a chance to be dangerous and Washington DC next week and it gives them a chance to be dangerous in the NCAA tournament if they can get there oh I believe that wholeheartedly I mean because they play that theyre not only good they know theyre pretty good they play with really really strong confidence okay because they play the game strong theyre not big strong young guards but they play strong they play quick they play fast and they play intense Florida state turns it over on its opening possession of the second half we look at pits resume and net of 44 quad one wins against Duke and Virginia the seven Road wins which is tied for most amongst power Conference teams and thats not just seven Road wins its seven Road wins against Power Conference teams that tells me if you put them in they can go and beat somebody absolutely I mean I I dont have a vote but I but Ive got two eyes and four eyes actually with the glasses I love the way they play I think theyre an NCAA tournament team what they did did at Duke the way that they beat Duke the the way they ran the ball screen the way they got him in twoman games the way they beat him in transition it was like thats the identity that they needed thats the identity that they have maybe it hadnt come yet especially when you got freshman guard so that Duke game at Duke turned everything in my mind and theyve become so much more confident as theyve gone through the year Jeff has done a fantastic job with that sta low gets the screen from Rico hes got the mismatch down low on green Miller comes over to help Austin wide open and hits just too easy I mean hes its just too easy right now Florida state theyre aggressive but theyre moving on the catch when the ball gets passed rather than moving on the air time of the pass its a big difference Miller posting up Hinson using that 611 frame good job good interior space to by cam corn to move to the other side as Baba Miller made his move to the middle and low draws the contact and that is Watkins its going to be number three lets see they call the foul on good catch Darren Green Jr gets caught in it theres no communication Jaylen warry gets there late its too easy this is a great move but cam corn slides out of the way takes his man with him turns into a nice inside the lane move for Baba Miller second foul on cam corn and jayen low back to the line up to seven points on the night he scored in double figures and eight straight and if you look at his last six games maybe the most impressive stat in those six games only seven turnovers well hes a basketball player like Im not sure you define his position he can play one or two but hes a basketball player with his footwork with his up and unders with his ability to block shots as a guard uh his movement his passing his dribbling he hes hes so well schooled it shows up Austin picks up the foul and if you count his numbers from tonight but six plus games coach for a freshman point guard in the ACC in those six Games 33 assists eight turnovers thats impressive thats impressive hes playing his type of game he makes up an unders he gets into the paint and creates he can hit the floater he can make a three he can play off the ball especially when Carlton Carrington is in he moves well hes very very instinctive player first point of the night for jir Watkins who Florida States leading score at 15 a game and had been averaging almost 192 per game over his last seven well you feel you feel the scores obviously its 15 but youve got a guy Watkins was on the bench as long as he has it now hes getting in the paint you just trim this down bit by bit but youve got to have that movement you cant stop going to cam corn what you cant do is shoot yourself out of coming back with bad shots bad Applause threes bub Carrington with the ball he picked up a couple of fouls in the first half spent a bulk of the half on the bench they want to take away those gaps of help Hinson Wheeling inside fed go the follow I love frto Rico fto Rico I mean hes improved he can run you can run offense through him he can short roll and he can definitely follow up misses 14 Second Chance points for pit Wild Runner K had the offensive rebound regains control blocked from behind by Austin look at him R look look at Frederico running look at that run rewards the big man for running the floor oh man that is beautiful look at the energy that he plays with time out Leonard Hamilton you watch this action now watch him take off and run hes down the floor all right theres the block look at him take off he inbounds it he takes off the block from Austin here it comes great finish Frederico Frederico the number one team of the country but they lost their big man JoJo tuger to season ending foot injury how significant is that for Kelvin Samson well thats significant because you add in the loss of rone Walker which is a problem Jaan Roberts basically played that Oklahoma game with one hand one arm the other night after getting injured in the first half but youre taking two really really good big defensive players that can switch out do multiple things that is a problem for Houston down the road no question a team that gives up less than 60 a game as Watkins hits the three gave up what 85 to Oklahoma the other night L and and again Jamal shed he just Wills you to victory I me hes such a good player hes the best player on a great team and theyve got the guard play and theyve got enough but over that long period of time that that really dives into their depth especially you get into the tournament and theres foul issues and its been a balanced scoring effort for pit not a single player in double figures Carrington swings it to Hinson who beats the shot clock raises the front rim Austin diving for it and it knocked it out see thats just what theyve got to do a better job of making contact Applause Music First Thats The Madness of March so North Alabama will play Austin P in one semifinal tomorrow Jacksonville ston and the other over in the a son getting beat by one of your own thats thats tough but thats the new world were in in college basketball and it is not going away we saw it on ESPN 2 before this game Joe Gerard for Clemson exactly hit some big shots against his old team Syracuse exactly were less than two weeks away from the portal it it is going to be um I dont know if Madness does enough theres March Madness portal Madness might even be crazier lunacy cacophony Moni you cant take overp you cannot overpay average players thats you see so much of it going on right now as teams try to finish the Applause season Corns got 14 to lead the seals kicks it out to warley PO to three its just his second three of the season on six attempts he had pretty much sheld that shot through all of nonconference and all six of his three a winner attempts have come in leag play but hes a winner he understands how to play he can do so many things for others he can move without the ball he can deliver the ball its a great pass by cam Corin out Jaylen warley three Worleys only other three came on the third of January against Georgia Tech dropped into the one31 off balance Jumper by Carrington there thats where hes got to stay in his shot he Fades off to the right those never work out well Watkins through the trees out of bounds itll stay with Florida State and that is not a three for warley so hes still stuck on one three they said his foot was on the line that was a two well it looked good anyways right but the defense now Florida State jumping into that 131 pit wants to get some movement through the middle on that as we get back into the other Applause Music end Watkins only five points one of four from the Field cam corns reading the double team oh look beautiful Play Beautiful play all set up by the fact that gram corn didnt have it kicked it back out ran into a ball screen Florida state has trimmed the deficit to 11 theyve been down by as many as 18 Corin two points off a career high Carrington gives up thats a 611 plus4 guy on the on the wing defending that in the zone feno knocks it away three on two for pit hson all the way the basket is good really strong finish tough shot inside you just capitalized on a turnover you dont want to take a tough shot greens there just a little bit late hence it hits him with the shoulder goes up finishes through the contact Beautiful Applause Finish give jayen low another assist hes got eight assists now on the night last time out he had a career high nine yeah with the 12 points I mean again hes just everybody thats following pit and following the AC ACC is watching these two freshman guards Blossom right before their eyes we get to see it tonight they look like freshman maybe bodywise they certainly arent playing like freshman low was somebody who was banged up hurt at the beginning of the year as we get a foul call and it was a slow on ramp but once Jeff cable made the decision to put low into the starting lineup and have leged come off the bench this team took off yeah you know who deserves the credit for that outside of Jeff cable recognizing it is legged because heres a guy that was that was a very very good guy in the Atlantic 10 last year at Rhode Island comes here joins this team and accepts a role which really hasnt affected how he plays but it has affected and impacted his teammates to have low out there and how important is that when youre in the transfer portal looking for guys and a lot of times its a mercenary type of situation someone is going to another place because they want to play more they want to score more but to get somebody to buy in and we rather than me well I think you have to know okay youre transferring theres money involved uh with the nil you want to go take a step up from the Atlantic 10 to the ACC but with all those things being said you got to be able to come in an impact winning and you have to understand what your impact is so he wasnt going to come up to this level here and just score maybe as much but but he still can get the same looks the same type of shots playing with other guys because hes concerned about making them better as well Watkins Picks It Off warley lays it in for two and the nolles have closed to within 11 quickly the other way since that time out the pit ball handling has not been nearly as strong the decision making hasnt been as good thats not a good shot that is not a good shot being challenged in the paint Florida States got to do is continue to get good looks like that green kisses it off the window and Jeff cable wants a time up you brought up ball handling decision making Florida State in conference play turns its opponents over on 20 of its opponents possessions thats the best Mark in the league and has been really good at take care of the ball exactly but its not even really close for how good of teams Leonard Hamilton has had over the years but this these guys they do go after the this is a beautiful move over g m Diaz just a beautiful move to get it up high off the board shoot it over the seven foter that is beautiful its important now your pit you cannot come down and and get a bad shot get something going to the rim get one of those patent and slips that they get get something that you know youre going to score on either in a in at The Rim or getting to the foul line Florida state in the midst of a 122 run hit led by as many as 18 horn and green were the offense in the first half starting to see Watkins come alive a little bit here in the second half and Baba Miller whos very very quick very quick hands but Florida State doesnt try to tap the ball they dont try to stab at the ball they try to rake the ball they try to take the ball from you they rake inside and grab it right like thats how theyre very very good at that Applause Carrington open not there Baba Miller has the rebound and gets fouled by Leed this is the moment of truth right now for this pit team because Jeff capable the staff you see him over there theyre clapping theyre trying to get these guys going they took their foot off the gas when Florida State called the timeout they took their foot off the gas they havent been nearly as fluid theyre not nearly theres not nearly as much movement and its a moment of growth to essentially for Florida State a team that at a number of junctures in conference play this season when they get down big they just dont have that fight in them but theyre fighting back and theres Watkins again its a sevenpoint game and this place got quiet fast jir Watkins is not only the best player hes the Energizer his movement toughness the fluidity that he plays with it makes everybody it makes everybody more confident hin in a long three Bingo way too easy k not give him open looks hes got NBA plus range youve got to be there you you cannot let him get an easy catch no matter if youre man or Zone one more three and Hinson will tie Ashton Gibbs single season School record for made threes Miller using his size and able to draw the B back the head Bob in the yell one thing youve got to teach your team to do cuz its not so natural teach them to yell dont dont over yell but when you get that yell with that head bop man thats thats like a 90 youre going to the foul line look at him he gets inside all right not great contact but he yells he Bobs the head the ref buys it two free throws for Baba Miller selling fouls is an arc its a skill Florida State tonight has done most of its damage at the free throw line 16 out of 19 at The Applause Stoke Miller one out of two hes a 53 free throw shooter youve got a game right now so the defensive intensity of Florida State playing with the link showing their length on these Wings is going to be important because thats where theyve gotten some turnovers Hinson the long two and hes fouled they Darren Green his Music third heres the action beautiful shot by Watkins warley with what looked like a two make looked like a three make a two cam corn on the roll after throwing it out Florida State playing with great confidence full strength because for them to continue to win a guy like Caleb Foster and Proctor theyve got to get better defensively I mean there theres no way around it they have got to improve for Duke to make the run that theyre capable of of of making uh if those two improve and again its late in the season and you dont need those kind of injury situations that slow a guy down from one of his weaknesses which is really guarding the ball how about Henson tonight five of 10 from the field three of seven from three and two of six from the line yeah not a he he could be more aggressive he was aggressive early on hes looking for that shot he Fades back his shoulders go back when shoots that free throw so he doesnt stay in his shot and not only does he fade back he Fades back early just two of seven from the strike Miller fouled on the reverse layup his fellow Spaniard Diaz Graham got him that his four on the softball from the Canary Islands one thing that happens when players come from overseas theyre used to playing at their pace and its its different and hes picked up his Pace over the year one more dribble and is probably a dunk to go with the foul the Baba Miller when he gets stronger when he gets better with that ball and again when he bends his knees and plays with his knees bent this young guy is going to take off even more barst stay 58 from the field in the second half with Miller I think you can forget that he was a guard his whole life before a gr spur where he shot up from 62 to 611 in the Spanish just a few years yeah hes got a lot of hes got a lot of confidence for a young player and hell get even more as he as he understands the pace and what Leonard really wants look at that length and and as he gets he gets that ball handling and a legit shooting down because he he can get a shot stepping in he can get it in the lane low spots up for three 11 points n assist tonight for jayen low hes the Catalyst of this team thats a big three for him he had not been as assertive the last thats this second half thats a good three to hopefully get him going he had a big three late and the win against Applause Duke all eight of watkinss points have come in the second half oh they switched it shot clock at five strong Drive pay the Applause man they switched it he took the switch he drove it got it got under his shoulder drove through him watch this theres the switch he gets under him separates they rotate over he stays strong finishes with the contact keeps his eyes on the backboard look at his eyes look at his eyes while hes playing through the contact sees the ball go through the rim thats a heck of a finish third foul on Carrington you brought this up in the first half Florida State attacking the paint its not a great threepoint shooting team you said in the first half they need to get into the bonus well that was pit 16 foul Midway point of this second half next one and the seals are in the bonus thats exactly what you want when you have a goal did it for us the goal was always to be in the bonus by the 12 minute Mark of each half youre winning a lot of games if you can do that consistently they can get in that in the next two possessions thats going to thats going to bode well for them the rest of the game cuz this Zone has stagnated free throw disparity significant Henson wide open and he hits the three his fourth triple hes now tied the single season School record for made threes yeah youre helping on the roong you dont need to overh help in the Zone on the drive when youve got guys like Blake Hinson and jayen low standing Applause outside Watkins posting up Carrington warley lets it Go fto Rico looking for help BBA Miller got away with one on frto Rico goes arm Carrington using the feder RICO screen warley the other way green Fades from the Bas Applause line good choice by pit they would have been out in front because corn was underneath him its a good choice come back get some movement Applause this is where your weak sides got to really talk Drive dish hson and they did sets the record for most threes in a season at pit one better than Ashton Gibbs and Jaylen low gets his first career double double with the assist you know that Blake Henson is on your side of the zone you cant not talk you cant overh help in that situation and green with the answer at the other end how about this now 5 threes for hson that is the 14th time hes hit at least 5 threes in a game of his career what I love is how much his percentages have jumped up 32 in the two years that Old Miss 38 last year 42 and over tonight yeah that thats the sign of improvement guy spends a lot of time in the gym whoa a little show a tell beautiful that his ability to stop to decelerate to change and get that turn around jump shot that is a high level pressure play Jaylen low in double figures and scoring for nine straight games Applause now theyre not even really defending the three for warley Baseline Drive over feder Rico snagged by low now warley is getting tired that was not a good play now hes playing so hard but he might need a rest low to feder Rico fouled on the offensive Applause rebound watch Hinson hes in range right now hes definitely in range steps in knocks it down from the edge of the p in the pit that is a beautiful shot hes got legit hes going to play in the NBA he may get there the hard way it may be through the gleague it may be in the second round it maybe is a free agent but hes going to make it hes going to make it hes hes got two many ways he can score and hurt you a big cheer for feder Rico only a 41 free throw shooter this season you mentioned warley and some Florida State players getting tired this is what Leonard Hamilton can do its a fullon line change well and again but he can still stay in his Zone he can put Chandler Jackson in the middle he can put Taylor Bowen on the wing he can still stay in that if he chooses to they spent time today in the walk through with with this pretty much this lineup going through the zone one out of two Watkins and cor remain everybody else subed out Corns got three fouls gets it inside he drops it in and cam corn has matched his career high with 18 the communication by both teams right here is like D minus D top level grade right now both teams are not for as active as they are and as hard as theyre playing its not nearly enough communication on whats going on you dont bump that up youre not grading on a curve no Im gr Im grading legit Im grading like a coach legot pulls up too Applause strong Primo Spears has been quiet Applause today they got corn again they in theyre going to get a Jackson maneuvering Spears kicks it to the corner rainbow from B Bowen offensive for cor and the flush career high 20 for the sophomore he didnt get the ball he kept moving in the half court offense the shot goes up there he is over two people he is having a tremendous night and double figures tonight for the fifth time in six Applause Music games good switch with this length theyre not giv separation now whether its been man or Zone couple open threes but other than that not been the same for pit Henson beats the shot clock his six threepointer 24 for Blake Henson hes got it hes got the step back he holds his follow through hes got range like weve said corn again feeling it gets the tap in 22 not only is the roll to open theres no pressure on the ball you get two on the ball youve got to bring some pressure both players hands hands are down and it its just its far too easy for pit I mean for for Florida State to score in that paint right now in the ball screen game Darren Green and Jaylen low at the scores table looking for the clear out now spreading everybody out to try to get this oneonone match up Carrington and thats going to be a goal on Cor and that brings us to the under eight timeout at the 541 Mark well and its right there I mean its still its still a very close game look at cam K two hand rebound power dribble up dunk finish got it Henson with the step back no problem separates back has been a oneman tempest tonight six threes that is the fifth time this season hes had at least six threepointers in a game well hes getting good ones he hes getting good with and theyve lost him a few times for a guy that theyre theyve targeted to make sure that they do find him but what what he does when youre not used to playing against him he he he tricks you with that range I mean that range is for real and again he got that step back and he stepped back to basically 26 ft right 27 ft like thats thats a real shot like you the focus today in the walkr was to really make every catch hard and right now no matter if its man or Zone hes getting the ball way too easy and he knows what to do it when he gets pit is led by as many as 18 Florida State shaved that lead down into single digits now its back up to a Bakers Dozen Horns been the ns best player tonight and hes kicking it out because hes reading that double team he can feel the double team hes reading it well and he keeps moving for to shoot Spears over to Jackson over low and they get jayen low with a foul hes incredulous yeah thats a very fortunate play right there basically since lets see what we got thats a three shot foul shot it sure is he got that hand G came across the uh the inside of the hand or outside of the hand I should say in there thats thats definite so now youre in the bonus youre Florida state that thats such a huge part of this because you basically went almost 5 minutes with pit their sixth foul and not getting foul to get to that bonus now youre there got to utilize that pain even more three shot foul for Jackson who is named after Chandler Bing friends and wes number zero because his favorite player is Russell Westbrook I read the notes pretty impressive the incomparable Chuck Walsh long time sports information director of Florida State the Applause best got the switch out Spears is good on that ball shot clock at 10 Carrington a lot of dribbling beaing fed Rico little percussion at The Rim there you didnt need to leave him you didnt need to leave him thats the only place you can really go with the ball horn wants it over feder Rico and two shots coming for cam Applause Cory K hes got Spears he he bumps him gets it there they step up no rotation Federico feder Rico underneath wide open you dont need to step up like that if youre cam corn you want to Bluff it the ball you cant give up the obvious dunk and now both of Pitts primary bigs have four fouls feder Rico feder Rico and and GE mod Diaz gram cam corn hes letting his hand go out on that last free throw hes been getting his hand in the rim that time he did it comes off his hand a little funny and he it kind of spins and what happens a lot of times if youre not focused on it youll let your hand drift off and in his case Drift Off to the right thats where he misses been shooting with his hand in the rim tonight finishing his follow through in the rim which is one reason he shot the ball so much better Applause Lows got a double double tonight he set a career high in assist two games in a row and B Bowen tried to get the block at the rim and I think theyre going to say go t at least bit is pleading the case beautiful play call by Jeff beautiful play call they bring we call that a bull rush all right he steps in there he he you youre trying to create that contact get that separation put the man in a disadvantage like that beautiful post up its a chance for a threepoint play B Bowen committed the foul theyre checking the monitor to see if this is a goal T and that ball was on its way up sure was I should say it was great post thats what you want Blake Hinson doing and and because its a hard match up and theyre trying to guard him with Darren Green Jr and he caught him behind the so the fou is on both B in the question now is that a goal T thats a goal T yep it is everybody gets an extra 45 seconds to a minute break its an obvious call they go check it its obvious now he goes to the fou Hinson loves the Pete last three home games 24 22 41 tonight hes got 26 hes like I said earlier hes going to play in the NBA I have no doubt in my mind uh great body improving got a legitimate stroke hes probably going to end up a team thats got some dominant ball handling guys dominant players that he can just go space and make threes Watkins is fouled thats Carrington that is four thats a tough call that thats thats a tough off call hes got him there trying to ice it hes on him now did get his hand in there and he ripped it through see it from that angle its a good call but again theyve been letting the hand checking theyve been letting you get up into each others bodies tonight but it was also a very good rip Applause through three players with four foul Watkins doesnt get the roll Carrington secures the rebound all 11 of Watkins points have come in the second Applause half look for the switch here we try to get green on Carrington over green he forced it offensive rebound Applause low low gets the step comes back to lean Corin has his seventh rebound beautiful ball movement though just a little short on the shot Green catches shoots rebound Hinson still plenty of time 14point game you havent had the TV time out at four yet dont give up open jumpers or a clean refusal layup Los been the M stroke picked up by Green on the switch gets inside off balance Runner 15 for the Freshman while Florida States gone about 3 minutes since its last field goal that is so good his finishing ability his ability to make the decision keep the ball high on his release really good Watkins right around low well we see earlier Jeff capable and his staff they did a great job in their Scout today they they most of it was spent on how theyre going to attack the Applause switches looking for the switch again with corn Carrington has the matchup puts it on the floor back out to Henson deep three not that tght Watkins through Applause Music traffic were watching an nich and everybody at home watching it with us Jaylen low finds so many different ways to score gets the switch gets in the paint picks it up great footwork with the Euro holds his follow through bucket as the Demon Deacons on the road right now its a onepoint game 18 seconds to go wake has not lost a game at home this season if Pittsburgh wants that coveted double Buy in the ACC tournament they need to win tonight and then they need wake to be Clemson on Saturday really the result of wake Georgia Tech doesnt matter but if youre Steve Forbes you beat Duke and if you dont win tonight you havent won since yeah thats thatd be thatd be theres no question you with a win tonight you overcome a tough game like that with Notre Dame where you go on the road you got to win at home when youre hunting like this Mose to motre Dame they lose at Virginia Tech and now not playing well against Georgia Tech still time here for Florida Applause State Watkins lets it fly called for the foul its not you do not need a fade away Applause Music Applause Applause Music three need somebody in the middle versus that Applause trap low milks the clock they want those switches pit has done fantastic job getting the switch they want low throws it up off the rib off the window and gets the two 17 to attack Darren Green Jr and they are doing it 17 points 10 assists for jayen low and got him so many different ways it just he just impacted the game at such a high level Florida State and the double bonus and now a little mocking war chant from the Oakland Zoo hey they they work hard the zoo works hard they know what theyre doing theyre here early very early and I was impressed for a Tuesday night they were here early you know what this is coach this is playing on the road in the ACC yeah no Applause question a pit team that started one and five in conference play Then wheeled off nine of its next 12 with a chance to make it 10 out of 13 almost a turnover warley gets caught and gets tied up with leg it the foul is on the junior Jaylen warley that pit was lucky with that they were lucky with that play they got sloppy on that pass but again one of the one of the weaknesses all year for Florida state has been winning the 5050 balls whether theyre loose balls like that whether G at The Rim a Leonard Hamilton staple throughout his career was was wasnt just the defense it was the switch ability it was the going after people and just taking the ball it was the it was the winning the the defensive rebounding 5050s but hes training guys to get them to understand what that takes and when youre youre watching it now and you see cam Corin tonight and Baba Miller tonight I mean youre excited about the future of Florida State because neither one of those guys should be going anywhere and are thinking about going anywhere because I dont get any impression that Leonard Hamilton is going anywhere I think the man loves coaching legendary at it just needs to continue to build this team and get him where theyre capable of being where his teams have been hes lost a lot of young players over the last few years this team took its laun in on conference they lost a lipop the USF was actually having a pretty good season to SMU but they started 5 one in conference play now theyve trailed off off if you are a Florida State fan do you see anything that gives you hope going into Washington DC oh absolutely because again if they turn it up and they have their moments here youre walking out of there with Cam corn playing this way Id have liked to seen them be more conscious on how they can get back in the game with getting more things in the paint getting things done that way especially when they were so close to the bonus even coming out since the last TV timeout theres been some they they moved the ball they havent really attack theyve settled for some jumpers but this is still a team this is still a team thats coached by a legend and coached by a guy that belongs in the Hall of Fame and has developed and trained players and teams for a long long time and still loves coaching and its got an outstanding staff both teams have outstanding staff I I hope Im as active and as locked in as Timo TL is who turned 60 today wait wait wait wait wait I thought it was 28 well somebody said what what are you doing I I that guy I mean it was inspiring to me watching him working out the team before the game but Jason cable mil Brown an outstanding Staffing pi and Jeffs one everywhere hes Applause been they can sense it here at the Pete thats a big win for pit didnt play their best but they played their best when the best was needed and well get one more foul its on kins you think of the program Jeff cable inherited two years under Kevin Stallings at Pittsburgh were a complete disaster the program was left in the rubble and it was a slow grind to build this thing up had a promising freshman class early on Trey McGowan Xavier Johnson AIS Tony none of those guys stuck around Jeff cable had to recalibrate his formula went heavy with transfers last year old team they get to the tournament now with a young backourt and he said all throughout the season this team will go as far as this young back court takes them you can start to dream this season on this young back court theyre looking at backtoback 2 win seasons and if they can get into the March Madness if they can get into the NCAA tournament theyll be dangerous if they get that double by they are a legit team that can win in DC in the ACC Championship hes done a fantastic job and credit Heather likes the athletic director for giving him the time to build this program the way that
