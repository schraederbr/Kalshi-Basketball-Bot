welcome those who just watched Boston Colleges shocking upset of ranks Virginia Tech racc Network double header continues here in Tallahassee Mark Adams jail through with you Florida State you look at their record three and ten but theyve started this game on the front foot Mark when what a win for Earl Grant I had them against Nebraska they looked comatose in that game but Earl Grant has a way of rebuilding programs and now is going to rebuild that Boston College program with something successful and right on cue Florida State another bucket thats what you get in the ACC knighted and night out anybody can beat anybody we just saw that with BC Virginia Tech you may see it here Florida State against Notre Dame Florida State with a lot of energy early and early turnover on the first possession by Notre Dame got this floor to us this Florida State offense moving much needed bucket for the Irish this is a Notre Dame team that comes in off backtoback doubledigit losses Mike gray told us look were short on confidence right now weve been beaten up by Marquette in Georgia you cant let that carry over to a third game tonight they theyve shot well in those losses they just havent turned into wins oh Notre Dame 01 right now in the ACC and for Florida State at one and one its a new season right now heres what you put up or shut up this is a crucial game for both of these guys going inside for Matt Ryan splits the defense puts it up and in for two whenever I see Cormac Ryan one word comes to mind cerebral on offense he makes so many great decisions and such a good putter without the basketball no doubt about it these are two teams that are desperate for a win headed into the holiday break Hills lays it off everything but the finish for Corin and itll save Florida State basketball

to get a little carried away for football why because this is playoff season Applause Notre Dame trailing Florida State 107 in the early going here in Tallahassee Mark Adams this is an Irish team theyve lost three of four two in a row a veteran group that entered with higher expectations than theyve performed at who has to step up and set the tone tonight well Nate lasheski is their leader and hes a unicorn with fairy dust thats how special he is take a look at those numbers plus 15 points plus seven and a half rebounds look at his shooting numbers hes the only player in America right now that carries those shooting percentages along with that production he is a special player for Mike Bray and for Florida State what a role Derek green has been on he just dropped 30 in his last game against St Johns how good is he he went for 23 against Purdue earlier this year and this is a kid that when he gets it going Florida State can be really hard to guard he can stretch a defense like not many can in the United States and even though Florida state has struggled this season Leonard Hamilton will be the first to tell you that Cleveland failed on the inbound pass if they win tonight the Seminoles improved a 21 in ACC play theyd be above 500 in conference play and Leonard Hamilton said hes really told the guys forget preseason as he called it noncon play its all about how you do in the ACC now this is reset time and Florida State one and one born in this game theyre going to Christmas at two and one who cares if they were three and ten up to this point offensive rebound four and fouled on his way back up freshman out of Allen Texas well head to the line for two you know cam corn this is a the story of Florida State this season hes like five to ten minute guy but because of injuries and because of two guys that went to the NBA draft hes now a main guy for Leonard Hamilton but look all hes got to do is do exactly what he did fill your role go get an offensive rebound get a stick back make some free throws and look good run up and down the floor playing defense this is a program that over the last 20 years under Leonard Hamilton has been built on depth and experience they dont have either this year thats exactly right and weve seen that in the early season struggles but theyve got good guard but Caleb Mills number four in white hes legit I watched him as a freshman at Houston Darren Green Jr number 22 in white weve already talked about him they have good guard plan and they do play up to their opponent hung with Purdue one of the best teams in the country and at Virginia a top 10 team Cormac Ryan seven seconds on the shot clock now Trey Works hes going to have to hurry Hoist the Deep three that connects thats from NBA range for Trey wurtz no thats what Notre Dame can do to you because they have such highly skilled offensive players you can think they are dead in the water but then they can pull the trigger from anywhere Music more and getting enough is right back Music that is a huge Plus for Florida State the corns playing well early Music Louisville thats the best and Seminoles have looked this season start tonight and is paying dividends for Leonard Hamilton the brothers name really standing around offensively that is not a good look against this aggressive switching mantoman early Birds tailed them out last possession stays in attack mode fading away and it rolls in back to back buckets for Trey wurtz he goes over cam corn why because corn dropped his arms if hes extended that makes it a tougher shot check out three way off the mark nothing but air for Darren Green hes clearly cooled off since the 30 against St Johns over the weekend up ahead lucchesky great body control to lay that up and then ties it at 14 that awful transition defense that time for Florida State as lacheski just ran right down the middle and hes got to be the focal point of that defense Music Notre Dame has made five in a row the Irish heating up to tie it at 14 Music you know I tell John Green to do to keep shooting even if it continues to look like that I made a bunch of them up ahead no transition defense again Cormac Ryan slams it home and and Notre Dame has now made six in a row theyve taken the lead that is inexperienced defensively Jalen Worley should have been rotating back along with Caleb Bills done either of them were in sight Music crane listens to you Mark and keeps shooting that Off the Mark again heres Starling explodes and draws the foul hes fun to watch Play The Freshman out of Baldwinsville New York all the white jerseys stayed on the offensive theres bills now hes got a long way to go but Worley he goes to the ball and tries to contest the pass theres nobody back as Cormac Ryan with an easy deuce Irish on a sixnothing run over the last minute in 21 seconds going back farther than that theyve made their last six in a row but Jay heres what weve learned in the first seven and a half minutes almost in this game Florida State they got easy buckets early and it turned into an offensive flow for them then Notre Dame got a couple easy buckets late and now they are exploding and you do not want to give Notre Dame easy buckets because the baskets its highly skilled offensive unit Marcus Hammond into the game for Notre Dame and why thats important is because that means Mike Bray is going to play seven guys tonight because when Hammond does not play it means hes going with six guys the whole way hoisting it up Mills Way Off the Mark I think he was trying to mob it up for an alleyoop to Cleveland Ryan left open big Florida State a transition D is crushing the Seminoles yeah no one communicate this is a young team that hasnt figured it out yet and no communication defensively nobody points nobody calling out matchups and Cormac Ryan was bridled 110 Run for the Irish theyve taken control of this game Music whos gonna stop the bleeding for Florida State Caleb Mills takes it on himself and weve got a football score Notre Dame up a touchdown 2114 yeah this game has been about lack of defensive transition Cormac Ryan is wide open wide no communication and the Irish are on fire here in Tallahassee what welcome to the neighborhood did you know that Geico could help with your own insurance cookies oh this is my moms secret recipe a little nutmeg in there its a secret is it cinnamon its my moms secret recipe Geico Music food tastes better with a dollar for days Music oven baked pastas like our new ravioli carbonara and for the gift that keeps on giving theres our neverending

can fly Music Applause what a way to heaven Music Applause everyone is ready for Monday Night Football because tis the season for football Joy thats what Im freaking talking about Ken Herbert and the Chargers spread some festive cheers or will the cult spoil their holiday plans the Chargers square off against the Colts Applause Music Florida state has gone scoreless in the last 2 30 and its allowed Notre Dame to capitalize a 110 run got Notre Dame when you give them these looks they are going to catch fire off Bentley such a highly skilled basketball team and Cormac Ryan gets the easy one there and then that leads to this shot as well once you get a wide open left the basket simply gets bigger and when youre Cormac Ryan and bet on the type of run hes been uh over the last five games that is bad news for Florida State great news for the Irish because this could play at a highly efficient clip the one thing when youre scouting Notre Dame every coach in the country will tell you this you cant leave them open from three theyll make you pay Notre Dames gotten clean looks and theyve done exactly that you know Mike Bray does such a good job along with Anthony Solomon the staff of first creating spacing offensively because he puts his position his players in position to be successful the cube be a great coach is understanding your talent then letting that town play Within the framework of where they could be successful and Notre Dame is really successful offensively with a ruby ball and they stay spaced and they share the ball thats when theyre good and thats what theyve been tonight Music youve got Cormac Ryan shooting 45 from three on the season as a team theyre just under 40 percent and they they will make you pay as Florida state turns up some full core pressure Music Applause Ryan he checked and he drills it Carmack Ryan is on fire Chandler Jackson The Freshman comes off the bench and goes underneath the screen and Cormac Ryan is just hot great feed Matthew Cleveland on the other end Notre Dame to the call Centric defensively and Cleveland just slipped behind the defense right there good execution by Florida state two possession game Florida State could really use a stop Notre Dame has made eight in a row make it the Lefty Marcus Hammond hits it from Deep correct me if Im wrong but I dont think Notre Dame is just a shot since they got the bunny on the opposite end correct nine in a row and now a turnover Irish have numbers uhoh Ryan Applause fouled shooting three the Miss wont count so the nine for nine stays intact if Ryan can add three more from the foul line what Notre Dame has just been so impressive sharing the basketball and give Notre Dame a lot of credit they know that Ryan cormack is on fire and theyre giving him the ball all the time theres Hammond from deep as well everyone is stealing it in a blue jersey tonight Applause this is exactly what Mike Bray thought this team would be a team that shoots really well plays in control turns teams over and relies on their veterans like Cormac Ryan Trey words Dane Goodwin and Nate nashewski Applause then set the tone in the first half call Matt Ryan went for 23 points in the win I mean this team beat Michigan State by 18 yeah they drilled Michigan State this kid went six for seven from three when he gets hot like that the whole team just carries himself in a different way now an 11 point lead this is the danger zone for this young inexperienced Florida State team playing their last game before holiday break and they punch back and not let this Gap get any wider than it already is Music we gotta look for Matthew Cleveland number 35 in white whos the guy that you wanted to start taking over this game Notre Dame shooting his way good job defensively foreign Bills contested three rattles in and out offensive rebound Cleveland goes right back up with him thats what they needed yeah you dont have to run an offense for Matthew Cleveland you just got to throw it up and let him go get it what really does the best job in this league yes he does saw that last night in Coral Gables wow what a great game you saw last night as Miami knocked off Virginia had a hangover they were they were psychologically bruisable in that game because Houston beat the heck out of them they did tough turn around on the road Miami played great Starling in trouble Keeps The Possession alive five seconds to shoot from the corner off the mark offensive rebound Lumen misses the layup sticks with it though and Notre Dame Cashes in ultimately with the freshman then Alan Lubin what did we talk about Van Allen Lubin before the game hes got to do that right Blue Collar stuff did exactly that working on the other end two efforts both the Duck Go Notre Dame on the road they brought their hard hats tonight Mark theyre battling yeah watch Ben Allen Lubin right here really good hands when he does this for Notre Dame they become a top half team they become a contender in the ACC when he hangs at the threepoint line theyre not nearly as good but he cleans his work boots his lunch pail goes Blue Collar basketball thats good news for Mike Gray so on the stat sheet it says Notre Dame is 10 of their last 12 but because it was two misses that they got the offensive rebound on theyve scored on their last 10 possessions Florida State desperate for a stop Goodwin Tangled Up fights through it kick to the corner Hammond can hit it another offensive rebound its moving again just watch number two when it goes up stop for Florida State and 11 possessions and they cash in Coast to Coast for Jalen Worley now that could turn this momentum a little bit before the state they needed an easy basket they got an easy basket now lets see if they can defend this stretched out space defense of Notre Dame Music Applause step back three Off the Mark Marcus Hammond has fallen cold hes missed a couple and its allowed Florida State to gain some confidence now finally Florida state gets something a little bit easy going up and down Jalen Wally right there really nice step through taking it with the left hand thats how momentum turns back Notre Dame turned it on that flyby yep now maybe Florida State can turn the tape Music better than that zone the entire game and it is bothered Florida State Music has to she does well to bury it that is a tough shot were not used to seeing the 23 Zone from Mike Grays team I wonder how much Florida state has even able to prepare for it when you say that theyre slow against it and Mike talked about it today that they were going to go more Zone this didnt feel like they could play mantoman for the entire day with a lack of depth didnt think theyd go with it for this long though its been effective though yeah its working to keep you keep pounding in into that zone and just like that theyve gone man to man in the blow blind floater Way Off the Mark he is way out of sync yeah after scoring 30 just a couple of days ago funny game isnt it Ryan everything about the Finish didnt drop Applause foreign Marcus Hammond all over him and Caleb Mills at the line when we come back Notre Dame still in the drivers seat leading by seven Music welcome to the neighborhood the Geico could help with your Homeland insurance cookies oh this is my moms secret recipe a little nutmeg in there its a secret is it cinnamon

Hodges goes for 22 points and oh by the way a division three transfer by the name of Dan lures came off the bench for the Panthers of Eastern Illinois and had 10 big points for maybe the biggest win

was punching a lot more than that as lucchesky goes through contact to slam it home 13 million versus 7 million Iowa these two teams trading buckets the offense has turned up tonight in Tallahassee now we expected that Florida State could score against this Notre Dame defense and were seeing that now Leonard Hamilton has this team back on track after a rough five or six minutes Notre Dame had made 10 straight baskets then a threeminute scoring drought or Matt Ryan high off the window in perfect position for the follow flush Van Allen Lubin hes only a freshman hes out of Orlando he is just so athletic he does those things for the fighting ours Music orally through the spin cycle too much on it Music lets move in another rebound he has attacked the glass with ferocity tonight thats what you want with a guy coming off the bench just play your role dont do anything special just play your role be an energy Giver thats what Ben Allen Lubin is tonight five rebounds for the Freshman five minutes left in this first half lucchesky wide open hell usually make you pay from there Applause Mills transition three he hits him I really like that because with Florida State Going Up Tempo the Notre Dame defense cant get set and they lose the rotations really a good cerebral Fast Break by this Florida State team both teams shooting 50 from three in this first half Music if Im Florida State I doubled down on 94 foot push it push it push it try to wear out this this Notre Dame team that does not have very good depth Music Leonard Hamilton played nine guys he knows hes giving a few guys a little extra money because he knows Notre Dame doesnt have enough bottoms a program built on depth and experience he doesnt have either this year but empowering guys to try and play their best especially when it comes to ACC Play heres Cleveland head of steam oh a rib rocker flying in cam Corin the pace has changed in favor of Florida State ass rejected by the rim Music Applause tested shot Off the Mark but fighting to keep it alive Florida State heres Mills left open great look would have given the Seminoles the lead of Florida State really being impressive in their early offense and I

two possessions or less but funny enough here at the Tucker Center in Tallahassee Florida State a perfect 50 against Mike Brays Irish and Notre Dame has never won Owen five and Leonard Hamilton congratulations youre a grandfather your daughter Allison just had a little grand baby boy Hunter how about that Jay a little early Christmas present for the Hamilton family he was but he was he was popping buttons today over that one that was one proud grandfather right there you know the great thing about Leonard Hamilton he has such great passion and perspective he does of all the high high major guys I dont know theres anybody that invests more in young peoples lives and coaches lives to make it better hes unbelievable Applause right now his team playing really well on the defensive end Notre Dame and a threeminute scoring drought clinging to a onepoint lead five seconds to shoot Cormac Ryan this is a deep three too much on it our angle I think looked like it was something in the hot hand for the Irish but its cooled off in the last five minutes hornley leaves it up a for Camp Corin and he fires Florida State in front and corn and third in the starting lineup tonight and he has been athletic and aggressive slipped how many times can we see Stan Jones the associate head coach from Florida State go through that shoot around today about 150 yeah at least 150 I counted it was actually 120 post on it males hes left alone made it a little harder than it needs to me but it still counts the two really have their offensive Rhythm right now and this is fun to watch feels like whats going to separate these two teams markets who can get a stop yeah or who gets tired true both Finn benches this season but Nate luceski is looking back cut every opportunity he can give Starling pullup pop draws the foul Orange Jesus Leonard Hamilton takes the time out his team now up by one will step aside for 30 seconds Music we did it Wilbur when you get the armrest why shouldnt die if

yet hes trying to keep these guys positive he said more than any other group mentally if they come in with confidence they can beat anybody is that their confidence was damaged in that Marquette game and hes trying to build it back and Georgia went after them in a similar way as Marquette did this team today were starting to see them psychologically recover this teams going one with a win they go into trip spread the 500 the ACC Applause ENT shoot the blow by thats goaltending Music JJ Starling just left somebodys lingerie on the deck thank you Bill raftery for that line he just blows right to the rim was he Uber talented so fun to watch the year Music Stakes for Notre Dame with the win they get back to even in the ACC at one and one for Florida State theyd improved a two and one in League Play Leonard Hamilton telling us forget the three and ten were focused on acc and they should be and Notre Dame goes back to their zone now lets see if it has to make a play keep an eye on Matthew Cleveland along with corn number three inside on the offensive lap Florida state has to hurry green hoists of three missed it hes been off all night Worley tracks down the offensive rebound Cleveland goes up with it and now Ryan holds it can to take a onepoint lead into halftime that was a fun half pretty much so two teams the second half for Florida State its about getting out on streams with a hand up when they got exposed they were three feet away and hands down theyve got to be more aggressive on the ball especially with the shoes that go today final game for both teams headed into the holiday break theyd love to go in with an ACC win give some confidence to two teams that come into tonight pretty low in the confidence category Jay both these teams are using the break in different ways as we look at this shot by a good one down low but Florida state will go home after time these kids will actually get a chance to go home Notre Dame football to Mike Grays house for Christmas if its a win thatll be really fun and theres the other Alternatives he jokes I cant go too tough on him even though theyre on a twogame losing streak theyve lost three of four because theyre spending Christmas in the bray household wow talk about turning nothing into something uh Matthew new Cleveland just saw the shot clock rolling down and Nate leszewski leaned into him a little bit Cleveland looked like he might have initiated the contact a little bit but goes to the line hes really improved his perimeter shooting this guy just continues to get better he can switch defensively one through five he gives Leonard Hamilton the typical Florida State midsized big that could play five different positions can score on the perimeter can take the inside plays defense Leonard Hamilton loves big guys that are flexible you can play multiple positions so on all three from the line a prized recruit for Florida State one of the top and school history he never thought hed be playing on a three and ten team when he committed here and yet his attitude has not changed he continues to lead by example for Leonard Hamiltons team big three flieszewski buries it man that is just coldhearted that is scroogelike right there were gonna talk a little bit about smooth yeah were gonna get into some Christmas Carol present past future the ACC with Mark Adams in a little bit thats a crafty move for the Freshman how fun is Cam Corin been to watch tonight its been really fun tonight aggressive hes one of those guys that growls the nips you like it you like his aggressiveness especially on the offensive glass around the paint hes up to 12 points already hes shy of a season High Cleveland steals it away from luccheski in attack mode dishes it off coring up and in back to back buckets for cam Corin and Mike Bray says give me a timeout Florida State shot out of a can second half looking for an ACC win here at home Music welcome to the neighborhood now did you know that Geico could help with

rebound needs the break to 94 this does so many different things he has hard to move on Cleveland on an individual sixnothing run to fire Florida State up by five Music words hes been quiet in the

analogy Triple Crowns rarified air youd have to go triple double three in a row something like that okay just trying to expand my my basketball Music Florida say this is the best theyve played all season no doubt about it well one thing about when you play against Notre Dame eventually youre going to get some offensive Rhythm but Mike gray cant pressure it just do certain things and so like Notre Dame back in the zone right now youre gonna get your offensive Rhythm eventually lets see if Florida State can attack his own head try and shoot over it to no avail Applause up by his own player hes off to Crosby Court which they do Goodwin hes been really quiet only taken one shot tonight missed him lucchesky great ball rotation and he buries the three Nate lisheski when you need a bucket hes the goto guy and Marcus Hammond saw him wide open and just zipped the ball to him good recognition Music house trying to answer he missed him but hell get three at the line thats the second time Notre Dame is committed to foul on a Florida state three we have Tom house the pride of the Centerville Elks just outside of Dayton Ohio mom was head volleyball coach at Rutgers for 11 seasons they

too though Elks is good the Centerville Elks are tremendous Athletic program just outside of Dayton Ohio always in the running for state championships and basketball and football Music big question for Florida state is can this young inexperienced team finish 12 minutes left tons of times fivepoint lead them play well for spurts New Virginia and they put together a complete game against Notre Dame Ryan a three hey its in Cormac Ryan dont let him get hot Kayla bills had his hand right in the shooting pocket as well but that was a quick draw three before Matt Ryan up to 17 points tonight and Florida is right back with Cam Koren thats a season high for the Freshman 16 points its a high scoring game and Tim corn is better than I thought watching him and seeing him grow offensively tonight hes blossoming for Leonard Hamilton Music one of these young freshmen taking a lot of minutes as Marcus Hammond answers right back whos going to get a stop in this game its just back and forth we go in town has been the whole half and thats what we expected tonight Music and he gets the Finish oh how did he do it Caleb Mills so crafty he never gets sped up that was like slow motion without being

Applause Music freshman cam Corin having the best night in the Florida state uniform today Leonard Hamilton called him a puppy an aggressive puppy that growls and nips at your heels Leonard is 610 hes nipping at The Rim tonight this young puppy is not only growling and nipping but hes getting things done in the paint eventually up puppy grows up we are seeing that in a big time ACC game tonight yeah hes probably becoming Junkyard Dog instead of just an aggressive puppy and I think a lot of people will look at Florida States record and certainly struggled early in this season but Leonard Hamilton whos built this program on depth and experience he didnt have any of that so hes thrown freshmen like camcorn right into the fire guess what in these 13 games theyve gotten better and better youre seeing them start to put it together now can they close in the final 10 minutes heres Cleveland already a double double tonight misses that position Worley flying flying point game thats why Leonard Hamiltons Hall of Fame coach coming out of that timeout well executed play well designed on the backside for offensive class as well Goodwin has it swiped away Dane Goodwin looks nothing like himself hes scoreless hes only taken two shots you know Dane Goodwin used to be a guy they would invert him and theyd send him down the block to do some back to the basket type stuff I would do that again I think that hes effective down there hes a good inverted midsized guy that could score with his back to the basket Mike Bray making a really risky decision here Nate lashesky has four personal fouls on the night theres 9 58 left in this game and lejewski checking back into it good one who has struggled will go out and so what do you do if youre Florida State even if Notre Dame is in a Zone you isolate him in his position and attack him do you like this decision for Mike Bray you know heres the thing about it so the short answer is no but the real answer is when you only got six or seven guys dont have a choice hide that horse as far as you can ride them the officials just trying to correct the shot clock maybe Mike brace thinking a little offense defense as much as you can maybe but I think he put him in for a purpose I mean this is a team now thats down by six Nate lasheski is your best player hes a great offensive threat hes really good against the switching defense of Florida State and thats where he brings Great Value at 610 can see over any smaller Defender Music quarterback Ryan 17 points to his name finds lucchesky a little give and go would close out by cam Koren Ryan into a double team spins out of it doesnt drop great job by corn May King Cormac Brian put the ball on the floor took away the threepoint shot bills right to the rack luceski had to move out of the lane because hes got four fouls and it allows Caleb Mills to capitalize Notre Dame was a man right there and roseski was matched up with Cam Ford Im coming back the next time isolating corn down lowington right go right at the chest the chest foul called Kayla Mills doesnt like it neither does Leonard Hamilton get the isolation down low thats lushesky down the block and Caleb bills now he scores with it good good aggressive play Im isolating that big guy all night long until you get wacheski out of the game well hes out of the game right now Mike gray going to the bench you might have saw the same thing Music works much needed bucket for Notre Dame ends the scoring drought of two minutes Awards really used his body well to Shield the ball Music take away the Zone has been the more effective defense today Starling Coast to Coast lays it up and in JJ Starling makes it a fourpoint game Notre Dames been on the road for a long time a lot now up on Mike right timeout Leonard Hamilton you know what were gonna have some fun with Leonard when we come back everybody knows hes a great basketball coach what you dont know hes a gospel music producer of the story when we return Music

grandmothers your fairy my mother with a lineup of stars ready to Wreck the Halls you cant get this one to bring the not this one forget about Christmas premieres tonight at 8 part of VH1s naughty or nice Music Florida State head coach Leonard Hamilton and his 598 wins one of the best to ever do it on the sidelines but his other passion is producing gospel music on his record label five oceans and he shared some of it really inspires him he says he finds himself listening to it constantly and uh really cool inside and we listened to gospel music with him for about 20 minutes on our call you tried to get him to sing some he did he did and as a beautiful voice hes been in the choir since he was a little boy sang in a high school group called The Magnificent spent a little money as well but he talked about whenever he would be singing he loves harmonies by the way but he struggles with that because when he hears baritone he sings baritone he pairs Alto he sings Alto but we were fascinated by how focused he was on the harmonies of his work absolutely and it makes sense right theres a young Leonard Hamilton back when he started in the choir and you mentioned Harmonys mark I immediately thought theres Harmony in basketball when you have a team playing together you can make some pretty beautiful Play Beautiful music and theres a lot of carryover from producing gospel music to being a basketball head coach believe it or not no that little dude in his coat and tie he said Mark we thought it was sacrilegious to not wear a coat and tie to church you know what I love Leonard Hamilton I dont care who knows it and it shows that theres so much depth to the person you see on the sideline got Steely glare a lot of passion a lot of love this they had to hang on great feed and theres Dane Goodwin first basket of the night and guess what they did they inverted him setting down in the post thats where he can be effective and help this team offensively I feel a Notre Dame running seven minutes to play Irish down three up top the freshman and corn couldnt Corral itll say with Florida State though Dane Goodwin is better when he gets to make basketball decisions and Mike gray put him in position to make a basketball decision and a cut to the basket this is where this kid look hes a coachs son he reads Defenders thats a great cut inside and hes big enough strong enough tough enough to finish plays around the rim and that bench reacts for a good reason they need Dave Goodwin to come up big suit three and it goes hes been cold but Darren Green buries a big one Dave what did we say early keep shooting thats why Music restores a sixpoint lead Music Applause Music towards pull up hop left it short great defense by Florida State they had Notre Dame standing around on that possession both Greens hot you gotta look for number 22 in white Mills Goodwin all over him Music passes up Cleveland on the drive floater doesnt fall huge possession for Notre Dame right now they cant stand theyve got to move Music but Jessicas got a mismatch inside against Mills Goodwin takes it himself cant finish Applause your big guys matched up with a guard youve got to give him the basketball Music oh thank you good job being active in the zone Music bills fires a three both teams have fallen cold after trading buckets for most of this night you feel the pressure now you feel the pressure of a oneonone team in Florida state with an 01 team in conference play for Notre Dame both these teams need this win desperately a little tight right now Brian too much on it Mike Bray told us where the going has gotten tough he feels like his team hasnt rolled up their sleeves this is a big moment to show their head coach that they can do it on the road trailing by six okay fatigue is part of that this Notre Dame team only seven players deep you missed shots but you get tired time to get stops when youre fatigued too five seconds to shoot Florida State goes to Cleveland system both teams showing signs of fatigue who can push through the Finish warts draws the foul hell get two of the line so how do you combat fatigue start flowing your shoulder and attack the rim this is a really smart play by Trey works just going right to the basket because weve seen shots a little bit long a lot of them short that means tired legs Notre Dames been on the road since before the Georgia game this team has to really dig deep now to figure out a way to win for the very first time here at Florida State oh and five here in Tallahassee works is 79 foul shooter on the season that touched every drop Applause so how do you adjust a little more knee Bend no more legs for the next shot front rim first but it goes in a little more chesky goes out on defense Mike Grays trying to squeeze every second out of his big guy playing with four fouls hes been doing that since the 10 minute Mark of this game Music Florida State fivepoint lead what a win this would be for the Seminoles to put them in two and one in ACC play despite a brutal nonconference record we cant settle here you got to get the ball in the paint Mills into the paint trap kicks it out heres green on the drive puts it up and then Darren Green delivers blood clay late shot clock by Caleb bills defense contracted had to expand just enough for Darren Green to get by his Defender same thing for Notre Dame now you cant settle youve got to be in attack mode here inside easy bucket Van Allen Lubin upon fatigue you get the more shots you want to the rim Music I like it the Freshman Rises cant connect cam corn whos got a season High tonight missed that one to go Notre Dame trailing by five theyve never won here in Tallahassee okay words JJ Starling are the two guys who want to ride right here because of that they can make plays they could buy Defenders missed layup for Lubin had it right on the doorstep and couldnt put it in this ones coming down to the wire fun finish between Florida State and Notre Dame Music welcome to the neighborhood did you know that Geico could help with your Homeland insurance cookies my mums secret recipe a little nutmeg in there is this is it cinnamon its my moms secret recipe Geico Music Applause Applause everyone is ready for Monday Night Football because tis the season for football Joy thats what Im freaking talk about Ken Herbert and the Chargers spread some

insurance and not even the Hail Mary will save you from paying for this so get off State Music really animated Notre Dame huddle as we welcome you back to Tallahassee buckle up this is going to be a fun finish in the ACC Mike Frey Leonard Hamilton with these two meet its probably going to be a close game six games decided by two possessions or less this ones been back and forth all night long Iris right now at a fivepoint hole they have never won in Tallahassee Leonard Hamiltons a perfect 50 against Notre Dame since 2013 in this building it comes down to guard decisions Caleb Mills number four right there get them to paint Making Place making his teammate better thats critical for Florida State on the flip side for Notre Dame Trey wurtz number three in blue along with JJ Starling number one in blue those the two guys that could get by Defenders and make plays you cant settle down for jump shots because theres some dead legs out there you gotta get to the rim and remember Nate lisheski hes been playing with four fouls for the last 10 minutes right now they need him offensively Womack Ryan was so animated in that last time out and theres Trey Woodsman running Darren Green with the blocked shot Applause Music watch Mills late shot clock or Worley get into attack Music Zone it was effective early Florida States to break it down was Jeske guarding with four fouls and the Freshman cam corn comes up clutch again oh Texas twostep inside for Camp Gordon really nice job of footwork Notre Dame under two minutes of play backs against the wall starling The Freshman answers right back JJ Starling and now Notre Dame needs a stop look for Florida State to go inside against lachesky again hes got four fouls matched up with number three corn inside stop Music running the needle to Cleveland through traffic lachesky defending with four fouls big stop that was a huge stop and a huge no call Darling Watson Michael Starling draws the foul and can make it a one possession game from the line just rolled the dice came up big does a really good job of just building the fence around the basket he just goes straight up thats great discipline and then Starling hes on spin cycle he wants the ball in the big situation hes the goto guy now from Notre Dame late game Music The Freshman calling his own number hes had a huge night up to 17 points the third leading scorer amongst ACC freshman and weve seen full display from him on the road Applause Mike gray just brought in Van Allen lube and why because of his athleticism and defense the ability to go get a nasty defensive rebound timeout for the state well take you with him 63 seconds left weve got a one possession game in Tallahassee we did it Wilbur Laughter whyd you get the arm rest why shouldnt I if youre on a flight you need to share the armrest and if you want to save by bundling home and car insurance you need Geico nuts well hey you its that time of year again its okay to get a little carried away for football why because this is playoff season Applause Music Florida state with the basketball one time out remaining Notre Dame has two the Irish needing a stop to keep it a one possession game Mark Adams jail through with you not much to separate these two teams online Mark theyve gone punch for punch at a game both teams and both coaches told us they know they desperately need this game going to the holiday break feeling a little better about their standing despite struggling in the early parts of this season and some really interesting late game chess match right now for Notre Dame Nate leszewski number 14 in blue has four fouls so if youre Florida State you attack that big guy you want to get him out of the game also for Florida State and Notre Dame especially for Florida State they only have four fouls right now they have three fouls to give and so if Im Leonard at Hamilton Im going to go to some full court pressure package Im gonna trap a little bit Im gonna sell out for the ball because any foul doesnt matter for them over the next several Music first things first can the seminals execute on offense make this a two possession game youd have to imagine theyd take a look at Matthew Cleveland after setting a careerhigh 23 points and 13 rebounds over the weekend hes followed it up with 19 and 12 tonight warley buying up his options dumps it down low Mills rejected Starling has it for Notre Dame JJ starlings wow Defenders up and in and its a onepoint game Nate lasheski with the block on one end and starling with the deuce on the opposite end Mike gray electing not to foul gonna play this out now Anthony Solomon his associate head coach is letting him know that Notre Dame only has five fouls they have a foul to give right now only a fivesecond separation risky play call Notre Dames defense dialed in one second on the shot clock achieve and thats a shot clock violation Mike Bray surely will take one of his twotimeouts to draw something up theyll review the clock as well but lets just say Notre Dames gonna have five seconds and the basketball and Florida State only has given four fouls for the half this games virtually over right now why do you say that because Florida State to get Notre Dame into the end of the theres gonna be time thats taken off by those fouls its four states upon excuse me total mistake on my phone youre saying the games virtually over Im thinking for one team my bad I got to selected far from over with 47 seconds left now Past Notre Dames ball now if youre Leonard Hamilton do you foul just continue to whittle this clock down to lets say half a second comes off with every foul now that was the real point there the Florida state has fouls to give and so now look they just added two seconds onto the clock six and a half look for Florida State to foul in the backcourt we talked about this situation with Leonard Hamilton in late game situation and Mike gray has taken a timeout officially in addition to the official review of the time and now for Notre Dame whos been really really good getting the ball in the rim and you got luccheski whos really good on the picket pops JJ Starling has been unbelievable in this game as he has taken the ball in the rim especially in late game situation theres the block and then Starling in the open court he is back Notre Dames code two guy Id expect him to do the goto guy again on this situation just a freshman and he plays alongside four fifth year grad players and yet its the Freshman whos had it all on his shoulders tonight and he has backed it up a 20point performance 13 of those coming in the second half you think you go to number one Id go to number one but if Im Florida State Im going to burn some of those fouls to burn some clock Applause Notre Dame trying to snap a twogame losing streak Florida State trying to improve upon whats been a dismal start to the season and yet thats not what they would be thinking about on Christmas theyd be thinking about the fact that theyre two and one right and ACC play Notre Dame with an opportunity to go 11 so winner goes to the top half loser goes to the bottom half thats really the situation in the ACC team with one time out Notre Dame cannot run the Baseline six and a half seconds left Applause the inbounder youre gonna foul Notre Dame you want to do it in the backcourt Florida state with fouls to give starlings covered and Notre Dame uses its final timeout Mike Bray looks very confident with Starling taking that timeout I wonder if he just wanted to see how Florida state would set up and credit JJ Starling was not being panicked right there with him that clock in his head that kids just a freshman just made a really smart play Notre Dame now out of timeouts Lord of State still has one remaining and theyve gotten fouls to give here you know whats interesting in this type of situation is Florida state will come out again in their full court pressure will Mike gray look for something deep I always like something thats kind of a snowbird deep its a gamble but its they have to have a flyer you cant have everybody coming to the ball you have to have a flyer and for Florida State again theyve got fouls to give Nate macheski the tallest player on the court by a couple of inches you wonder if you just throw it up to the big man and now its cormack Ryan the inbounder six and a half seconds to go into war Applause State survives Applause Music
