the officials that gave me a just a chill like a cold sweat the officials good to have Josh Pastor the for Georgia Tech head coach back at the studio knows what Im talking about Florida state starts with the ball in Gold seals coming off a great win against Georgia Tech on Wednesday 8271 trying to build some momentum here in conference play after an up and down nonconference schedule you know Virginia Tech defensively they really like to play pack it in theyre tough they really use their chest and the way they move the ball they made move their feet they are a good half court defensive team you take a look at the hoky starting five shot clock down to two fade away to open the scoring Darren Green Jr gets him to a great start which allows Florida State to set up their press theyre going to try to take Virginia Tech out of their half court offense and try to force them to start carther offense near by half court you can see Miller is guarding pulla right now at the top thats 11 in between Baba Miller and Shawn padulla wide openen three Tyler nichel cant cash Applause in deflected ball so shot clock resets padulla in attack mode pull up pop missed it another offensive rebound Virginia Tech with a third chance to score and finally nickel does Florida state has struggled a little bit on the glass at times they did a great job against Georgia Tech the other day however great offensive action there offensive rebound Wise from Virginia Tech he cant get that many looks the seals go inside the Deontay green you have to think looking at these two teams on paper Florida state will look to get inside more than usual today well theyre going to theyre going to want to do that but what Id also tell you for for for State they going to have to make some shots because Virginia Techs going to pack it in theyre going to play tight into that paint there they play a kind of a pack line in sense they really use their chest as I mentioned on the way they guard the ball and then the other thing you see down there when theyre playing against Florida State youve got to find the gaps they really collapse towards the ball and youve got to find those open Shooters which Virginia Tech got good looks and then the offensive rebounds got allowed them to get that third shot but when you go against Leonard Hamilton you said it you know that youre going to get full court pressure absolutely all game long and when you put them in the free throw line and they make the free throws or made baskets it allows Florida State to set up their full court pressure and try to take Virginia Tech out of their half court offense and thats why its so vital for the hokes today Mike young said it keep control of the basketball cant turn it over so far so good Scoop to the hoop up and in maai long you know again Virginia Tech you wait for to St plays defense its its an unorthodox way to have to go against that they switch and everything they do so theres just going to be a lot of breakdown offense by Virginia Tech theyre going to get open looks they just got to stick them heres Couture threepoint threat right back to Long swiped Away by Applause Music Applause Green talented sof more Baba Miller draws the foul you know we were talking on in in during shoo around today Baba Miller was making threepoint shots and then you can see down here in the transition just in the in Virginia Tech being able to drive it youve got to drive Florida State because of the way they play the way they get out in the passing Lane you just cant settle and make passes around the perimeter they will force you to get turnovers throw away there warley and Watkins cant connect Florida state is known about their base out of bounds defense how how hard is to get the ball in it this time it was Virginia Tech stealing a page out of Florida States book on making it tough to get the ball and out of bounds there good job by Virginia Tech those are kind of the special team situations that youve got to win I know coach Hamilton does not like that you can see the pressure by Florida State just trying to take for Tech not letting him set up in any of their offensive actions boua nearly lost the handle there you know he struggled with a foot injury for stretches in this season Virginia Tech is going to need him to be at his best today kick to the corner that three is Off the Mark he had one more up to the slot if he found that he had another pass race there look at that range by Green Darren Green J if if he sees it hell take it you got to find him in transition that was Beyond NBA range where he shot it from and again its a youve got to know where he is on the floor at all times when he crosses half court hes literally into his shooting range thats the type of range that he has and hes shooting 40 from three now 335 career threepointers Jay you can see the pressure by Florida state is just theyre not allowing Virginia Tech to run their normal half court offense so everything they have to do has got to be through dribble penetration now the first of probably a few for Darren Green today that was way Beyond NBA range hes a volume shooter but if hes hot hes as good as there is in the country and here we are talking about how Hunter Couture had the program record last time Virginia Tech waso Tallahasse nine threes in a win against the seminal Darren Green hes the type of a player that could match a performance like nine made threes absolutely kid the spin cycle everything but the Finish count the bucket go this I think a huge key for Virginia Tech is ly kid hes talented he didnt have a great game against wake the game before vers uh that they played he actually was 14 of 15 from the field I think it was versus American but you can see the heads there by him but hes a big key for Virginia Tech you mentioned the Virginia Tech lost last Saturday to Wake Forest 8663 far from the Hokes best game this season and then you have you know a buy quote unquote because you didnt play in the midweek so you have a whole week to practice whats that like as a coach coming off a lopsided loss theres two ways to look at it one if you have a tough loss like that you want to get it out of your system and you want to play right away or the second way to look at it that hey you have a whole week to correct of course correct and get yourself angled up Spears in padulla and they call Spears for the bou you know coach young Mike Young from Virginia Tech mentioned to us in shoot around that he felt he was a little heavier or slow last game Wake Forest padulla he coming off that injury in his foot and you can see Florida state is just putting enormous amount of pressure on him and really trying to make him have to make plays off the bouns and he throws it away there right on Q and you thats what theyre going to make you do switch and guard and play a unique style defensively well we mentioned it a couple of times already but when we come back well take a look at the last time Hunter Couture played here at the tuck center now the last time Virginia Tech played Florida State in Tallahasse the hes hit a program record 18 threes well half of those belong to Hunter Couture and those nine threes knocked down by the Orlando native is still a program record for the Hoke he nine of 11 27 points and a big Virginia Tech win on the road and it was funny we joked with Mike young he goes you almost need a performance like that to win in this building people dont understand how hard it is to win at this place I mean obviously Florida State and Leonard Hamilton theyre an elite program but to win on the road here is really hard to do and for Virginia Tech to win theyve got to make some threes right now the road for two theyre going to need to start making threes to have a chance to beat Virginia Tech start to beat Florida State now out of those 18 made threes program record 15 of them are still on the roster padulla and Couture Spears splits the double team and hits Ito Spears you can see ly kid there come out with the hard Hedge and then Spears though was able to split it and thats what he does he can get to that ACC logo and make midrange jump shots heres Couture right on Q you cant leave him open nothing but the bottom of the net but padulla had a drive hes he got three or four Defenders sucked to the paint which left Couture open behind great read by padulla to find the open open man well if theres anybody you cant leave open its Hunter Couture in this building we just showed the program record nine made threes triying to swipe it away there kick ball and stay with Florida State you have to know where number zero is at all times if youre Florida State you you have to now Florida State defensively theyre going to be who they are and they swarm that ball I mean you penetrate theyre coming after you so they will leave some Shooters open at some different spots but youve got to know where he is its important now they do a better job with this face out of bounds last time there was a turnover they got it in here green contested and yet it rattles home Darren Green Jr firing Florida stay back in front hes a hes a tough shot maker he can shoot it deep you just it was actually good defense just better Applause offense shot lock down to 10 heres Couture Spears all over him gets it off off the mark that time those are the contested Brees you can live with yeah and absolutely and sometimes are just good defense and if a guy hits a tough shot you just give him credit on that boy is Florida State happy to have Cam Corin back this five games with a broken toe he gives them a big boost in the front corner a huge boost they need him you know again forestate has been dealing with injuries all year long but hes a big big addition to get him back CU he can play multiple positions and he can score from elbow on in theyve looked a lot better with Corin back in the lineup they feed him again that time couldnt Corral it loose ball at midcourt Great hustle jir Watkins wins it back for Florida State Spears cant connect Applause Music right now Jay the pace is favoring Florida State they want it to be a little bit more of an up and down track meet type of game and to cause disruption not only for Virginia Tech offensively but to really put pressure on them at The Rim on them on defensely and theres Leonard Hamilton and his camo military appreciation tonight here in Applause Music Tallahasse great talking with Coach ham and shooter around today he feels like this group is coming along happy with how they played against Georgia Tech on Wednesday night and that 11point win when they told me his age I said theres no way he looks like hes 45 well you I remember when you were the coach of Georgia Tech would always Heap a ton of Praise on Coach ham and you always said how is this guy not in the Hall of Fame and hes not in nobody should be thats exactly right he should be nominated hes hes outstanding hes built programs what hes done here has been incredible nickelberry at three and Coach Hamilton mentioned that they need nickelberry to get back to scoring ways thats going to be important for him to do that yeah it wants him to be more aggressive hes certainly shown throughout his career he can be a big scoring threat hasnt really shown up so far in Tallahassee Chandler Jackson lost the handle and then committed the frustration fou outstanding 5050 ball win there by by Baron there just getting on the floor first of the four wins to to to win games like this especially on the road J youve got to win those loose ball battles thats a great win there for Virginia Tech first to the floor that get you an extra possession Big Time play Big Time 5050 ball 5050 win you can see now the the the pressure set up by Florida State Music and that pressure has been disrupting Virginia Tech so far today the hys have fallen into a three minute scoring drought how do you end it here well look theyre going to have to continue to penetrate not turn it over that be one thing not to do that but they going need to continue to penetrate find the o man then probably skip it for one more BBA Miller through contact foul called so hell get two at the line we we both really like Bob Miller in shooting around earlier today he was making threepoint shots hes got a high high ceiling the more he plays the better hes going to be he had a disruptive freshman year missed 16 games got inserted into the lineup Midway through the season but Leonard Hamilton reminded us just 19 years old has all the potential in the world really high on this young mans future yeah you can just see in shooting around his talent his his upside the more he plays I mean hes hes a hes going to be a Pro Prospect and uh and Coach Hamilton said that that a lot of people have been coming to obviously watchs got a lot of hype coming in as well Virginia Tech the scoring drafts lasted 3 minutes and 10 seconds theyre over for their last three and theyve committed three turnovers thats been the killer well Florida State just takes you out of what you do in a normal sense its hard to understand and prepare for it until you actually get on the floor and play against it you just sometimes got to have breakdown basketball like that play right there but you just got to finish it otherwise its just a long night Chandler Jackson looking to go Coast to Coast everything but the Finish Florida States allowing Virginia Tech to kind of hang around right now in this time period poti swatted by Baba Applause Miller Millers made a real impact on this game so far Spears of three rattles in doesnt drop during this drought that Virginia Tech has they only fla state only has a fivepoint League they havent taken full advantage of the drought that Virginia Tech had and again you know thats a tough shot thats not what coach young wanted there from both teams really struggling to score right now they are combined oh of their last 11 the scoring drought for both sides but Florida State a fivepoint Music Applause lead some people just know that the best rate for you is a rate based on you not

be you to the max well it has been a frustrating last four minutes for both of these head coaches Virginia Tech and Florida State to combine all of 11 from the field and seven turnovers look Im Leonard Hamilton Im sitting there saying guys we are blowing an opportunity right now we should be up 15 if I Mike young in Virginia TCH side Im saying thank the good Lord right now were only down five so it depends on how you look at it but again Florida state has Not Taken full advantage of Virgin text misses which is not normal for them to miss the type of open shots they miss right now yeah if you come in an ACC play on the road and have a stretch where you commit four turnovers go 0 of six usually you look up at the scoreboard and youre down a lot more than five so the Hokies with plenty of opportunity here despite the slow start heres padulla Couture cant leave him open thats why Hunter Couture buried his second three of the day credit to Mike Young atto play out of the timeout that was a setup to get Couture the open three perfect execution and just like that despite a horrific fourminute stretch only down by two right in at Midway through this first half you can hear coach young there yelling gaps gaps gaps they want him packing it in as tight as possible shot clock down to two B Bowen has to hoist and it doesnt drought we could look back at this segment where Florida State maybe didnt take advantage of the drought that Virginia Tech had that could be the difference of the game depending on how the outcome plays itself out yeah still a lot of basketball to go pulla left alone decides to take it and make it sha padulla fires Virginia Tech in front what we talked about is you got it Virginia Tech was going to need to make threes against Florida State and hit backto back possessions with those Thea got got him on his heels Bell and he got an open three too good of a look for him to give Florida State still in the scoring gra the seals have missed their last six shots its allowed Virginia Tech to grab control Music here shot clock again down to two and a turn turnover Florida State theyve lost their Rhythm well and and right there you can just see defensively the gaps that theyre in you can see this is the add of the timeout the three by Couture but the gaps the the halfcourt defense that Virginia Tech is playing again the open three by pedulla there but whats the reason Florida state is not scoring is theyre playing in the half court against Virginia Tech theyre not getting out in transition right now theyre not getting enough baskets in in the in that type of basketall ball and thats a credit to Virginia Techs transition defense Florida State wants to play wants to gain to be as Up Tempo as possible Padula missed it here they go in Music transition Baba Miller DS it down low green through contact count it plus the foul Jay thats what it is that Florida State got the went in transition threw it ahead got a breakdown offense with Miller driving got the dumper spot went underneath there kind of relocated and found it but it happened in transition when Virginia Tech wasnt able to set up their half court defense it thats how Florida State needs to play to be able to get their offense going to score great action there in transition offense by fora State and you can see green on that underneath how he relocated on the drive he didnt stay at a spot he went underneath the opposite side on a Applause Applause relocation Virginia Tech wants to keep this game at a slower Tempo like you were saying Josh keep it a half court game instead of a track me in transition theor fading away oh hes so crafty Hunter Cure good defense better offense on that Music one 17 back and forth we go if youre Florida State you would live with that you cant let him shoot threes you can live with those type of shots but again now youre set back up Florida state has to operate with the against Virginia Tech half Port defense Watkins hard to the hole missed it and they say it was off Florida State last so itll be virgin Virginia Tech ball all tied at 17 ACC play Hoke and seminal Hunter Couture Leading The Way with

Hamilton one of the best to ever do it 611 wins five times Co of the year and the amount of players since 2004 that he has sent to the next level is outstanding its funny me were talking with him at shootter around this morning here at the Tucker Center he walked in and saw you Josh passner I think hes happy youre youve got a headset on and that youre not on the sideline coaching against him anymore well look I look I love coaching against coach Hamilton his teams you had to be so prepared to play against when their style of play I have said multiple times he should been nominated for the Hall of Fame what hes done here and at Miami and at Oklahoma State hes amazing hes produced so many great players and hes added so many great teams the only thing hes missing is a final four thats the only thing hes missing and its too bad cuz they had the team to do it in they would have won the National Championship wi in 2020 they were Music outstanding and he told you that hes been basically coaching basketball since he was 18 years old coaching and playing big time three Padula from Deep again late shot clock pretty good defense by Florida State better offense and but for Virginia Tech thats what theyre going to need to do Spears trying to answer and cant thats a tough shot tough two right there last thing on Leonard Hamilton he told you he spent one year in media during the coaching was a down in doing some radio in Miami and its funny how that oneyear refresh can then lead to Florida State he did the one year in Miami and then boom this is what hes built since hes and he and he talked about how how he has so much respect for all everyone in the media for the preparation that you have to do for that MJ Collins drills the three from the corner so Virginia Tech has caught fire from three theyve made five threes in this first half the hokes on an eight nothing run time out Florida State Virginia Tech has grabbed control of this game leading by six well be back Music some people just know that the best rate for you is a rate based on you not Paul you dont want to ride with po get a rate based on you with Drive wise in the allate Music Applause app Music she

Im here Courtside watch this you have got to watch this play folks watch this watch this watch me watch me watch me do this fire here theyve made their last four threepointers after being IC cold its a maker Miss game its not that simp its not that complicated basketball its a make or Miss gain let me just tell you this a lot of the threes have not come through some extravagant play settings is come through breakdown offense thats what happens when you play against the Florida State Defense youre just gonna have to make some shots and thats what Virginia Techs doing right now Baba Miller triggers from three Off the Mark no Music good Miller keeps picking up padulla on defense there is 10 Ines separating those two players the way they play defense Forida state theyre so interchangeable they switch everything they play on the high side up the floor its a very unique and unorthodox Pula all the way to the rim boy that foot injury looks like its all healed and if you notice he there was no passes in that possession it was a dribble dribble dribble you just had to make a play and thats what he did and that allowed him to get to the rim youve got to do that against Florida State as you got to drive the ball because of against their switching but Mike Youngs teams Jay 63 of their field goals are assisted they want to move that ball but against tonight this afternoon just like that example right there it just going to have to be some breakdown and right there padulla just no passes just dribbled it and went right to the rim Florida state has fallen into a threeminute scoring drought during that same stretch its allowed Virginia Tech to go on a 10 nothing run from down two to up eight seals need that three didnt get it as I mentioned earlier I mean if Im Leonard Hamilton Im looking back at that segment Im saying we just did not take full advantage of Virginia Techs drought heres an opportunity in transition Watkins into traffic and draws the foul theyve been at their best Jay when theyve been in transition theyve got to get in transition now you got to get stopped but when you get stopped theyve got to run they are struggling against Virginia Techs half court defense Virginia Tech is a very good halfcourt defensive team they play in the gaps theyre physical they move their feet so Florida state has got to continue to find ways to put pressure on Virginia Tech and transition offense coming up next our ACC basketball triple header finishes in South Ben number 14 Duke taking on Notre Dame in the Irish theyve looked a lot better the last couple of weeks its a great win against Virginia should have beat North Carolina state that was a great game they Michael Shrewsberry is having the team theyre getting better and better and better each time they step on the floor theyre going to be a hard out during conference play I dont need to tell you because you coached in this league every single conference game is tougher oh its you got to have the Tums ready for you right there I mean its it is nauseating its its exciting and thrilling but it is a its just hard to win in this league whether its at home or on the road MJ Collins muscles it through contact and Virginia Tech has found a great Rhythm now and and and I dont want to beat it you know just continue to beat the same point but but you can see there there was no passes again something that n Youngs teams dont do theyre so good at moving the ball its but on this type of playing against Florida straight youre going to just have to take that out and find ways to get to the rim coach welcome to broadcasting thats what we do we just beat the same point over and over Im good at repeating myself thats Ill fit right on in five minutes to go in this first half Florida State needs to find something offensively they are just one of their last last 11 make it one of their last 12 they just theres a lid on the rim right now and its allowed Virginia Tech who had their own scoring droughts in this first half to grab control of this Applause game this lay up there nothing can fall for Florida State they have not made a basket in more than four minutes heres l in kid he cant connect what can you do here when you when youre you havent scored in more than last position by Florida State they got to make the layup I mean theyre in transition and they got to do that but again in transition theyre theyre their best when its not against Virginia Tech set set defense theyve got to get down and then they another time they threw it ahead and just reattached the close out and got to the paint they are struggling when they have to when theyre playing against their half court set defense offensive rebound ly kid goes right into Corin who got all ball corins been a spark Off the Bench Florida State continues to get it done in transition that time with Watkins and they again the where theyre the way they play on transition offense thats Florida States best way to score right now especially during the drought theyre having shooting on from the Applause perimeter caught in between a pass and a shot there re Steiner gave it away the Florida state they had that one for 13 drown but the seminal right in it only down Music four in the studio for halfon Josh pner Jay alter with you here in tallah does coach beheim miss it or not I want to know I want to know if hes missing it does he miss we watching this game the amount of Miss shots right now what is he thinking well hes used to watching Miss shots against his two3 Zone yeah its hard to play against his two3 I mean what is he got 2000 wins I dont know I mean hes won so much goodness gracious they should name Syracuse just Jim beheim well the courts named after so thats a start thats the start do you miss it is the real question well when I was seeing Mike young wipe all the sweat off of there I was like goodness gracious you dont miss that I love being right here right now tough take both of these teams have played excellent defense so youll look at some of the numbers and go oh ugly game offensively but a lot of that is because of the defense being played yeah you look at it right now Virginia Tech like I said earlier 63 of their field goals have been assisted in coming into this game but tonight this afternoon they only have two assists on 11 made field goals so everything theyve had a has had a been breakdown offense now Florida state is one of the very best in the country if not the best on base out of bounds defense they trap they play all over right thats what they do its a special team situation and theyre the best at it transition continues to be the key for FSU today theyre going to take a look at this though to see if it was offensive goal tending on gainy Jay that is those type of special teams base out of bounds are such a winning and losing 5050 situation Florida state is so good on base out of bounds defense they make it so tough Virginia Tech spend a lot of time working on their base out of bounds they get the steal After Base out of bounds defense do look like it fell off the rim I think its I think its clean counted offensive basket interfer although they ruled no basket Music everybody in the arena saw what we saw up on the Jumbotron I thought it fell off just enough for gainy to clean up the spill look at halftime were going to look at it halftime I think what theyre going to see is AJ Des coming over here to say theyll look at halftime hes talk to me when in the last what eight years during the game Ill just be y we be yelling at each other you told me your record with him as an official was like two and something yeah it wasnt real good I can tell you that no now listen I love AJ as a person hes hes a good man but on the Coury I didnt have a great record with him I said AJ what is going on CU I cant help it that you guys foul more than the other team like go way she dont teach fouling now theyll look theyll look back at that but that could be a momentum swing shifter for Florida State to give him some life that can undo the lid off the rim sometimes basketball thats what is getting that energy just going for you heres Couture leads the hokes with eight lost the handle though Florida States defense has been suffocating in this first half do you see there Jay that when he was driving it literally five guys were swarming him so but now you might say well just pass but the problem is qua States length theyre so long vertically and horizontally it makes it tough again base out of bounds defense Florida States probably the best in the country at what they do Applause here shot clock under 10 little more than two minutes left to this first half padulla trying to wiggle free off the Lin kid give go padulla beats the buzzer how about that thats what youre going to have to have just sometimes some of those shots got to fall for you you can see the great hedge there by kid on Virginia Tech to push Florida State back towards the half Music court seminal have struggled in the half court this half and they continue turnover padulla transition three missed Music it lorda States got to maai Long stayed down gy from goes inside commits the foul Jay The Possession before when Miller got it stolen cuz hes trying to drive the single gaps we would call it the single gaps in there and and they were just really inside with their hands and then you look at the other way coming down Florida State got in transition they end up scoring cuz long went down but in transition nickelberry pulled it back out they got to stay on the attack mode when theyre in transition not pulled out the best when theyre continuing to attack trying to conquer that ACC log so count the bucket they we all saw the contact there but no foul the knocked away out of bounds it will stay with the Music hokes 32 timeout Virginia tich 3 second timeout here Virginia Tech Florida state with under a minute left to the Music half point lead Virginia Tech has the basketball you know again its its its a base its an underneath its a base underneath right now deep Corner this makes it really tough Jay for Virginia Tech to get the ball in bounds this is a you can see where its at its deep Corner this is a big possession for both teams because with 14 on the clock Virginia Tech needs to one get it in and not turn it over and two for needs to get a stop maybe even get a turnover here and get in transition big possession right here to end the Music half Okies have been good out of timeout so far today padulla draws the foul hell get two at the Applause line and remember Florida State might get two extra points here at the end of the first half the officials are going to review that off offensive goal tending at halftime it looked it looked like it was good it was off the rim and enough of the cylinder away that it should have counted but tomorrow afternoon right here on acc Network a great slate of womens basketball it tips off at noon Eastern Time top 13 matchup NC State at Virginia Tech the Georgia Tech app hit and then the night cap Florida State Clemson Boston College at Syracuse a quadruple header tomorrow right here on acc Network G gaining for Florida State theyve been wanting to continue to get health hes had a lot lot of knee Sur knee issues knee surgeries what a follow shayen Worley rocks the rim great momentum dunk there and Florida State Leonard Hamilton was talking about they need gy to continue to get healthy hes such a big part of of their scheme their system how they play the more he plays the more healthier hes going to be hes a huge key for Florida State but that was a great Punk there two seconds left in the half kid has to hurry off to Collins did not get it off in time missed it anyway Virginia Tech 30 Florida state that starts with the ball they did take a look by the way at halftime in ruled that it was offensive goal tending so could have been a onepoint game its a threepoint game game and you and I both disagreed on that we actually thought that looked like I thought it did fall off the rim but Jamie Lucky came right over he said we got a good look the ball was touching part of the rim so no basket with Florida State they had Rhythm and then it just evaporated 1 for 13 at one point during that stretch how do you make sure you just get more consistency on the offensive end well look I mean again besides the point of of of transition offense theyre going to need to make some shots and especially from three theyre 1 for eight now one for nine so I think theyve got to theyve got to throw the ball inside more and try to establish a post presence inside and get going with paint points nichel on the money to start the second half Virginia Tech a Sixpoint lead Florida State needs to try to score more in the paint they need to try to get it inside they need to try to score its not in transition its going to have to be off the free throw Music line Miller trying to answer and he does Baba Miller he made two or three of those and shoot around this morning working on those at his size that is a that is a dangerous weapon if he can start doing that on a consistent basis Pula and Couture the dynamic duo for Virginia Tech they combined for 19 of the Hokey 30 in the first half that is the danger with the way Florida State plays Josh is because theyre constantly switching its not like one guy gets more attention than the other yeah and because of that theyre going to get some open threes like right there they swarm to the ball they find nickel on the open three and then you hear the penetration a great look there for Miller in that corner or three thats just the second made three of the afternoon for Florida State inside nichel in trouble kicks it out Couture a three and he knocks it down Hunter Couture buries his third three of the game tremendous decision by Virginia Tech they got it in the paint and then instead of shooting it they found Couture behind wide open because of the again the Swarm by for to State towards the basketball right to the rim Coast to Coast out of control lost the handle F swipes it and Florida State had numbers missed opportunity in transition wasnt a good decision on that pass there they had opportunity and they had to his right they had both both Wings filled try to find it try to thread the needle and try to make a home run pass and just keeping it simple and hitting a single and those things will drive you crazy as a coach I have to imagine youre sleeping a lot better oh sleeping so much better I dont have to eat so late at night I you know I mean I its just its its a new life almost I I I I cant explain it the ACC itll take the life out of you because every single one of these conference games and people that dont give credit to the ACC this is a monster league to win in this league it is so hard to do Home Road its an incredible League it it should be getting way more attention and recog than it does right now flying in on a rack attack B Miller transition offense they are so good in that open floor flying around that is the way they need to Applause Music play contact and three foul shots coming for Tyler Nicholl beautiful absolutely outstanding now but let me just say this they make a run there they have that great play but then they they lose the momentum by fouling the threepoint shooter and what happen is Florida State because they play so up the floor it was really good penetration by padulla he he got the defense to to to uh to commit to him and he kicked to the open corner and then the close out he hit so the momentum that Florida State just had they lost a little bit about that by fouling the threepoint shooter on that Music three before the Miller slam we were talking about how the ACC doesnt get the amount of respect that we think it deserves how difficult is it to especially now nil transfer portal year in and year out to just build your roster to have it competitive because if youre not at the top youll take your lumps youre youre not this and its not even nil its pay to play I mean thats really what it is that being said its not a program its Year bye is what youre building you cant look for past two three years down the road its one year at a time based on the climate of the ni and the transfer Applause portal and nobody knows that better than you they hang a banner in 2021 ACC Champions and then boom two years later youre broadcasting with me I mean its true Mike young knows it too they win in 2022 now everyones well what have you done for me lately its almost its its its its thats what its about its winning now because of the portal because of the nil now if you dont have nil it becomes really hard but the portal has made it so where people are expecting results immediately where you could build get old stay old have some ups and downs thats no longer the situation right now in college sports and at the end of the day only one team can win the conference winning is hard every possession is hard to win a one possession is so hard to do now the home fans not happy with this call Leonard Hamilton cant believe it fou was the call on the Music floor and the home fans think padulla just lost his footing here and and you know with padulla hes had some foot injury foot issues as well so that could have been the situation on that the officials can control a lot of basketball on those 5050 calls that can make or break a team a season a player in good or bad so this is almost like a free possession for Virginia Tech can they cash in 10 on the timer Couture in attack mode Collins wide open missed it fouls it up though and now coutur three he buries it green who contested it went running to half court instead of coming back for the rebound there at the free throw line those are back Breakers I guarantee you coach Hamilton will be showing that to Green on the film you got to get back in defensive rebound B Bowen the answer talented freshman from Vermont here comes the Florida state full court Applause Music pressure thats a turnover of Virginia Tech they are riding Hunter Couture and why not the alltime leader and threes in program history hes added four more to his tally Music today Im a parking gate and Im all out of whack and if you have Cut Rate car insurance this could leave you all bent out of shape so get all state and be better protected from Mayhem who says you cant go for bold without going broke get the brands you want the prices you want whenever you want TJ Maxx where you can always afford to be you to the Music Applause Music Applause Music max the Australian Open hits different from the networks of ESPN ready for the NFL playoffs I was born ready dramatic entrances check team of Destiny check nightmare matchups check all the heart pumping playoff action of your dreams check Music please now the Virginia Tech back court has been excellent on the road against Florida State today Hunter Couture sha padulla combining for 25 and the way theyve shot the ball today has kept the hokes in control yeah look those two guys are such such good basketball players they know how to play they move so well without the basketball now this is an or unorthodox game because its so much more dribble penetration not maybe as much passing but to their credit theyve made some big shots to allow Virginia Tech to have a sevenpoint lead right now this is a big stretch right here I think this next 4minute segment is a big 4minute segment for for State they start with the basketball great out of timeout it was perfectly executed except the foul came in before the Finish thats why Leonard Hamilton is one of the greatest in the game to be able to have again the out of timeout setup and gets him right a chance for a threepoint play he missed it but gets him to the free throw line I think Florida State needs to continue to attack the paint obviously within transition offense but when they are in the half court they need to keep trying to find ways to play inside that ACC logo on the floor there the more they can conquer that area the more thats beneficial for for Florida State against Virginia Tech half cour defense 12 of their 35 points have come in the paint today the other thing is in a two possession game you need stops and padulla and cador just too many makes that time exactly what the seals needed they get the Stop and swipe it from padulla Music on that end Padula you saw three guys he drove he we called it like a single Gap he didnt there wasnt enough of a room so he drove a single Gap three guys formed them and their hands are so active watch three guys there and watch the hand activity by Jackson allows the steal and transition and then a foul for Florida State big possession right here for Florida State crosscore pass finds B Bowen The Freshman playing with a lot of confidence right now B Bowen did not settle for that three he attacked the close out attacked the paint they need thats what Florida States got to do more points in the paint this half to give him the best chance to win this game c stolen away again backto back steals for the seminal Corin finishes at the rim and just like that its a twopoint Applause game poti answers with a dunk of his own that will silence the crowd going right inside nice seal there by potit on this on his footwork as well too green hes been quiet that rims out no good from Deep theyre fortunate there Virginia Tech he he can make Applause Music Applause Music those Pula splits the double team calls his own number and delivers again another possession without a pass straight dribble but thats what Virginia Tech has to do to to to score against Florida States defense and you went up for Mike young against him so many times you told me today watch the way they pass offensively hes one of the great masterminds offensively when it comes to passing offense hes thrown all those plays out and let his guys win oneonone matchups look they come in the game 63 of their field goals are assisted this this afternoon its not like that but youve got to just figure out different ways against the style of Florida state which is very unique and unorthodox to play against especially in half court yeah only seven assist assists on 17 makes thats very atypical for a Mike young coach team but it is working today theyre up six to his credit hes found the the style thats had it work for this game to put him in position to win trapped in the corner risky pass and a turnover Jay thats the second turnover Forida state has had on base out of bounds throwin usually for thats what fora state does to other teams theyve thrown it into the deep Corner both times Florida States got a trap and they forced turnovers by Virginia Florida Virginia Tech has scores two turnovers on base out of bounds every time that Florida State gets within Striking Distance the hokes have punched back today cam Corin dunk got it within two and Virginia Tech has responded and a foul called on the Freshman B Bowen Couture grabbing the back of his Applause head even though Virginia Tech you know offensively is its not been a typical Virginia Tech type of way they play offensively they are doing a great job in the half court defense and and defense does travel it tra so if you have an off night the one thing that holds true is your defense you have an off night offensively you can you should always be able to count on your half court Applause defense shot clock down to five Couture has to hurry stayed with it Hees it up through contact no call and thats a shot clock violation great defense by Florida State again credit to Miller his size and length guarding the point guard and the way hes moving his feet totally disrupts Virginia Tech and then theyre fortunate that they didnt get and that was a great non call by the three officials cuz Couture try to he looking for it he was looking for it hes so good at acting and gamemanship in in in the way he played good no call by the three officials I cant believe Im saying a good call by the officials but a good job by the three officials on the no call because he was trying to that was a setup for them to try to get a get free throw line limping over to the bench grabbing his right knee well continue to monitor Applause that Virginia Tech is going to need Hunter Couture not just in this game but the rest of the season must have been the way he landed yeah hopefully hes okay Couture who loves playing Florida State last time he was in this building he hit a program record nine threes hes got four today we will get an update on him as soon as we can great hedge there the hard hedge on the screen by PTI nickelberry goes Baseline swatted at the rim and a foul called if you notice they got it to Miller so they had a hard hedge by Virginia Tech they threw it to Miller outstanding pass crosscourt Skip and nickelberry again didnt settle what did he do he attacked the close out and got to the paint which then resulted him get the free throw line he looked like Florida State quarterback Jordan Travis there that had some speed on it to go crosscourt well at his size that helps too to be able to see oversee the defense tonight at 8 Eastern after our triple header is finished the nothing but NE crew will break down what has been a busy day in the ACC theyll take a look at the best matchups of the week to come everything you need to know in one place right here on acc Network how about Wake Forest quietly becoming I think a team to beat in the ACC a big win today against Miami thats now nine straight wins for Steve forbes team they can really score J I mean and hes done such an incredible job in getting guys in the portal I mean hes kind of been the portal master at this point kid missed it trying to follow his own shot kicks it out open three Collins buries it theyre fortunate they didnt get a travel called I thought ly kid shuffled his feet by them not calling that thats a break for Virginia Tech thats a big swing right there dumped inside and Florida State might answer with an oldfashioned threepoint play through gy hell be at the foul line when we come back these two teams at a critical ACC Affair going punch for punch not much to separate and weve got a fun finish shaping up in Music Tallahassee Jay as you can see on that threepoint where I thought he traveled and he shuffled his feet these things keep me up at night as a coach I mean these are big plays I looked right there I thought he right there was a shuffle again and maybe Im just you know have that thinking of being in the the head coach but not getting that call leads to a threepoint play and Ive always said when theres those type of plays its the make or break that can change a season change a game change a players career cuz theres so much at stake thats a big play those three points could very well decide this game weve got a very close competitive game and I want to say this the offic the three officials here are all very good theres great officials in the league again you know when youre being a head coach youre always going to be hard officials but they have a very hard job the speed of the game they have and the three guys here are doing a great job and theres great officials in the ACC but youre youre looking are all those littlest things when youre when youre watching the games padulla tangled up with Miller tumbled to the floor hard great to see Hunter Couture back into the game hands off for lin kid who tried to squeeze it down the Baseline and turned it Applause over Spears the double team right to the rim lays it up and in Primo Spears every time Florida state has run a high ball screen with Spears involved Virginia Tech has come out hard on the head and each time Spears has split the head the hard hedge and has gotten to the pain and has made a Applause play ly kid shuffled His Feet Again same exact play we just showed you a moment ago good s basketball you can see the replay here its the same thing he shuffled his feet so he has a tendency of doing that and again in the speed of the game the quickness its hard to see every little thing on that from an official standpoint but those are big plays theres no doubt about it inside great defense by Kid Padula missed it went right to the rim could not finish Applause Applause both of these teams dialed in defensively its made for a fun game close competitive and theyll likely come down to the wire here thats what ACC basketballs all about fou call jayen Dany was hacked down low Music long good catch there by gainy you can see they got his hands in there but they need Florida State needs gainy to be at a to be high level for him he was a transfer from Brown in the ivy league I recruited him when I was at Georgia Tech I love that he was really a big time rebounder Defender shop Locker he could rim but hes had injuries and that has been an issue that has hurt Florida State and its hurt because they have counted on him to be a big time player for for for their program and remember the ivy league didnt play in 2020 so really in three seasons of basketball he only played one can be duck on conditioning as well fou called on the other end you know Jay so much of it in sports theres momentum theres rhythm theres flow theres energy we havent had a lot of flow and Rhythm not in this game but I was also going to say to be successful theres also got to staying healthy and and you look at the not only this year but the last couple years for Coach Hamilton unfortunately he even talked about this morning in shooting around they have had the injury bug and you know people say well next person up well thats not always the case in college in the NBA yeah the person thats come next person up in the NBA is is is actually a pro or they can get someone and trade someone off the waiver now lets hope they dont do college sports like that but but thats the point we have enough to worry its not always that simple so they have not been as healthy as lately and thats been thats been why theyve been a little bit up and down at times and another foul called the fouls piling up here Virginia Tech is already put Florida state in the bonus they didnt take advantage of the free throw line there Virginia Tech free throws could very well decide this game both teams actually are going to be in the bonus for the remaining 952 that is why for Florida State theyve got to keep attacking and conquering that ACC logo theyve got they dont need to settle for threes the more they can drive it the more they can play into the paint another missed free throw Al the one back by Miller right back to Watkins he cant finish it that time cleanly put in jayen Applause warley and a chance to give the seminal back the lead with the and one second effort offensive rebounding off the free throw line box out again and those are humongous plays when youre in a situation of a back and forth possession by possession game missed the free throw thats now four missed free throws in a row but another offensive rebound Miller gives it right back and Florida state has the lead with Cam Corin the first time the seminal have led since it was 17 15 It All Happened off the effort on the free throw line box out twice down there that could be the difference of the game on a free throw line box out both those times Florida State on a N9 nothing run hokes need a bucket here shot clock under 10 itll stay Virginia Tech ball you have to imagine that Hunter Couture or sha padulla will have the ball in their hands here shot clock at nine and those have been the two goto guys all game all season long watch here on side base out of bounds again Florida state does some different things on base and side out of bounds they make it tough to get it in youll see them start up in a diamond here in a diamond set and then and then youve got Miller on the ball with his length watch Miller there trying to make it you can see it heres ly kid nothing but air and Virginia Tech has now fallen into a threeminute scoring drought which Florida state has used to go on a N9 nothing run and grab the lead credit to the side out of bounds defense by Florida State made Virginia Tech shoot that tough shot Florida state had been getting all the rebounds and the hustle plays and they get another Miller swipes it away and another and Applause one Florida state has taken over this game an 11 nothing run Miller has been made big plays down the stretch on offensive rebounds and all kinds of hustle plays hes been outstanding time out Virginia Tech Florida state with all the Music momentum FSU on an 11 nothing run they have completely taking control of this game now a fourpoint lead and theyve done it with hustle well look Miller had two big 5050 ball plays popped the free throw line box out they did another offensive rebound theyve done it through kind of the old school way of just effort on the glass and and those are things that you have to do to win games any game but especially in in a league like this and another offensive rebound thats now six offensive rebounds make it seven eight and another and one that sequence sums it up Florida State dominating the glass eight offensive rebounds in this second half along and a lot theyve cashed in its been the actual difference in the game right now find Mike young those type of things just absolutely drive you up the wall you can see padulla was left standing didnt slide over to have the box out and they allowed him to get through there on the Miss they have made a living off the free throw line offensive rebound right now FL the state nine second chance points all of them have come in this second half eight offensive rebounds that is the difference of this game right now and most of them off the free throw line Miss free throws yes how about that as a former head coach missing free throws might win you this game yeah I mean really thats been the best offense right now with Florida State in this last 3 four minutes has been missing the free throw and then getting the second shot putting back and also getting in close because of those offensive rebounds and 5050s just falling near the basket and getting a lot of and one opportunities as padulla spins his way through that that ends the 14 nothing run desperately needed bucket for the hokes and yet even though on the road you suffer a 14 nothing run youre only down five with eight minutes left in this game still right in it green of three missed it he got a great look Jay I mean you cant get a better look than that actually a great pin down screen throwback got a great feet were set he coach Hamilton would take that all day long ulla draws the foul trying to inject some life into this Virginia Tech Team hell be at the line when we come back trailing by Music five now Florida State trailed by as many as nine in this second half and yet the hustle plays have the seminal with the lead yeah right there vir Tech had it they lost it and again off of a Miss free throw there again Bob Miller gets a steel then heres warley coming in no box out for Pilla at the top of the key they have made a living actually their best offense is Miss free throws because theyre getting the second and third opportunity on their effort on keeping balls alive and scoring that direction right now and its one thing to get those offensive rebounds but theyve done a great job cashing in on those opportunities so a ninepoint deficit is now a fourpoint lead after the padulla May final 8 minutes of this game what are you saying to a team down the stretch in a very close competitive conference game look in this point right now every possession becomes magnified Jay I mean literally every possession is so magnified so You got to make sure that you take care of the ball youve got to get good shots if Im Florida State I want to continue to attack the paint both teams should want to continue to attack the paint cuz both teams are in the bonus Florida State continues to stay red hot Mo Spears and its a fivepoint lead for the seminal risky pass it pays off at a foul call thats so two things there one Florida States in their Zone press instead of being their manto Man Press there they got in their 221 Zone press but secondly the last thing you want to do when you have that momentum thats the second time thats happened theyve got the momentum swing to you for Florida States advantage and they create a foul earlier they they fouled nickel on a threepoint shot in the corner and then now they foul long right there at half court no need to foul when you got the momentum towards your Applause Music advantage long who missed two free throws earlier makes that one Virginia Tech just five of 10 from the line before that make as a team if Im coach Hamilton just I I like the aggressiveness on the Press but you you dont want to foul like you got to be smart about it there was no need for that because that again negate Spears a shot with that with both free throws there by long both teams in the bonus the rest of the way one possession game in a critical ACC Affair Florida State once again goes inside gets the foul call they have made a living of getting right to the rim up in close and then getting fouled Virginia Tech did a great job moving over there long got there in in front but based on the new rule thats changed this year any Collision if youre not jumping straight up and down almost 999 time is going to be a block theyre trying to avoid any collisions at The Rim which the advantage goes to the offense so right there they try to get to take a charge but any cont if youre not there way beforehand its going to be its going to be an automatic block Music the other thing for Virginia Tech is Hunter Kor has gone quiet in these last few minutes the ball now I dont know if its because of when he got you know that dinged up dinged up and he went out so I dont know if thats affected him at all its great that hes back on the floor playing but hes been so good against Florida State over four games against the seminal in his career he shoots at 63 Padula the floater Falls Perfect Touch best offense for for jinia Tech right now is just keeping it in his hands and just dribble dribble dribble having the ball screen they had a go screen there a slip screen by Couture and allowed him just to dribble penetrate get to the paint and get a baset green deep three money Darren Green drills it thats what he does Jay Applause sixpoint lead with about 6 minutes to play Collins rejected but thatll count go count the bucket question is will they review that I guess not coach ham is not asking for a review on that thought it was actually got to be hit the backb like can see it here no he he did hit the backboard so good call got to hey I got to give the credit to the officials when they make the you havent done a lot of that today Ive got to give I I I got to give their due when they make the right call Ill tell you what in these close games ACC games so important in conference 6 minutes ago fourpoint game you got to be happy youre not on the sideline sweating up a storm youre here comfortable inside and another slam gainy Applause Music delivers Florida state is had a clear game plan get right to the rim and they have capitalized in an immediate answer Thunder is from Robbie Baron Baron there had gy on the switch was guarding him in gy due to his slowness because of some of his health concerns from his knees wasnt able to keep him in front of Baron just took him off the dribble right to the rim and got a uncontested dunk and Baron on the defensive end blocks it up ahead nichel great transition defense green up ahead Watkins Florida State likes to run hammering it home Jaylen Applause Music gy critical time right here Jay for Virginia Tech I think this possession right here as were getting close to the under fourminute timeout you see Miller on pulla right now long misses the three offensive rebound nickel double team kick out Couture got it Hunter Couture his fifth made three that one the biggest of the bunch some of the best times to get an open three is off of an offensive re rebound kick out what Florida state was doing against Virginia Tech Virginia Tech gave their own medicine got the offensive rebound found Tor a wide open three at the slot there in front of their bench huge possession for Virginia Music Tech you see it right here offensive rebound by nickel long great decision by long to find Couture again Florida stated everyone swarming on that and again how many times do people say it to get a the best time to get a threepoint shot is off of an offensive rebound one possession game weve got a fun finish coming in Tallahasse you dont want to miss Music Music it and whats better better than this a fun finish in the ACC its been back and forth between Virginia Tech and Florida State all afternoon long Le changes and punch for punch its been an outstanding game it was troppy the first half but the second half has really picked up on their energy both teams making some shots its been an really entertaining game and theyve gotten much better much better flow both teams in in this half one possession game Florida State a threepoint lead with the ball three timeouts as well Spears hes been money from that spot rims out no Applause good they FL State came with double goost screens double slip screens and allowed Spears get right to the free throw line had a good look just missed it padulla with 10 on the timer under four to play drives and draws the foul Jay if you notice padul is just driving them because they again Florida State switching one through five so theyre getting Miller on padul and hes just driving to the rim not as much of any ball screen action right there just said hey were just going to put my head down and get to the rim badulla who struggled last Saturday in the lost to Wake Forest hes battled a foot injury throughout the season this is the first at the line he has bounced back in a big way today for Virginia Tech both Padula and Couture those are the two that have carried the hokes can they carry them enough to the Finish Line in another missed free throw 0 for two from the line no way you would think that from Mike young or anyone any Virginia Tech fan would be thinking hes going to miss two free throws too good of a Music shooter cross score pass risky but it pays off they go inside d thats his third dun that might be the biggest one and again they did not settle crosscourt pass on the Skip and went right back into the paint whether its been the dribble Drive attacking or through the pass thats whats carried Florida State along with the offensive rebounds FSU keeps going inside and it keeps paying off a fivepoint lead for the seminal padulla trying to spin out of trouble missed it and thats FSU ball Great Wall up and moving his feet Miller not going for pulas foot fakes or Head and Shoulder fakes great defense there by Miller what a pass hey Jay Ive been so impressed by Miller hes been really good this game yeah you could argue hes been the biggest bright spot for Florida State tonight both offensively and Music defensively FSU looking for backto back ACC wins one against Georgia Tech Wednesday trying to close this one out acrobatic how did that go in Primo Spears are you kidding let me tell you something Jay he played off of two so he drove the close out got into the paint did not play off of one foot came to a twot jump stop used his body and his power hes a strong guard got into the paint there finished got an old school and one big time play by Spears again and they didnt settle for the midrange or the three they attacked and conquered that ACC logo in the paint thats been the game changer Florida State continues to go inside it continues to work this is the largest lead of the night for Florida State can they hold on another 240 you have to Big Virginia Techs looking for Couture he shot 64 against Florida state in in his career its padulla instead Off the Mark no good really good defense there by by state Watkins going Coast to Coast right to the rim blocking foul is the call 10point lead for Florida State this is now or never time for Virginia Tech yeah you can see here again transition offense so thats where theyre at their best Florida State because Virginia Tech cannot set up on their half court defense and it allowed Watkins to get from end to end on a penetration get into the paint but youre right Jay right now this is really critical time for Virginia Tech cuz its getting to a point where its a point of no return based on the score right now theyve struggled free throw shooting today just seven of 14 before that make look theres still a lot of time left but I would tell you this this next possession for Florida State defensively for Virginia Tech right here this is this could be the game and for offensively for Florida State this could be the game this this possession right here is going to say a lot on how this game finishes out Florida state has only made three threes today it has not mattered the game plan has been to go to the rim Viria Tech showed pressure something that Florida State always does Virginia Tech had the pressure there it almost got him a 10sec violation 42 points in the paint a lot of those coming in this second half Leonard Hamilton takes the timeout still has two remaining here two minutes left in regulation well I tell you right right now this is a big defensive series for Virginia Tech as I mentioned before in a big offensive series for for Florida State coming out of this timeout youre right at twominute Mark youre right in that kind of teetering time youre youre is an eightpoint game so Virginia Tech they get a stop they got to go and try to get a go in transition Florida State if they score they keep it in double digits if Florida state is at double digits I always thought as a head coach around the minute 30 Mark youre probably in a good position doesnt mean youre youre guaranteed anything but youre in a good position so what are they drawing up here Virginia Tech does not play zone theyre going to play man so you know theyre coming out in a in a man defense that last time to start the half or out of the timeout they ran that back screen lob will he try to do the same thing or do something to get the ball into the paint the other thing Jay is what about Virginia Tech defensively on the ball screen cuz Spears has split them multiple times when theyve hard hedged itll be interesting to to see if Virginia Tech does switch their coverage this time and try to switch the ball screen instead of the hard show hard hedge by either kid or Barett now Virginia Tech knows they need a stop here led by as many as nine Florida state has flipped this game around by getting to the rim and cashing in 15 seconds on the shot clock Millers been a bright spot now off to Spears 5 Seconds to shoot Spears lost the handle a heave from Watkins no good Virginia Tech gets the stop they desperately Applause needed good defensive stand there by Virginia Tech and a foul call which Jay stops the clock and push for best free throw shooter on the free throw line I dont want to jinx them but these should be an automatic Applause to the hunter Couture on the season 90 from the line nothing but net there Im not a betting man but if I was a betting man Im going to say hes going to make both of these one of the best ever to wear the Hokey uniform the alltime Virginia Tech threepoint leader Florida state must hate CM Couture CU over his career he is 64 from the field and hes 100 from the line there two possession game with a minute 30 to go and Virginia Tech goes back to their Diamond press which gave Florida State a little trouble and now interesting cuz that did look like a planned foul there Robbie Baron looked over to the bench making sure thats what Virginia Tech wanted yeah I dont know if they wanted that I looked over at the bench or I couldnt tell from coach young with the assistance I didnt think wanted him to foul I think they maybe if theyre going to foul get cross half court try to get some traps in the back court but if they wanted to foul because we doing to try to extend the game so youre battling the clock as much as youre battling the lead absolutely now warley 67 from the foul line this season and he misses that one and you got to remember now for both teams the remaining way to go its double bonus everyones getting two shots its not one and one but that foul obviously ends up right now the best you can do is one point out of this so it ended up being a good foul by Virginia Applause Tech and if youre looking for Duke in Notre Dame that game to come right after us in South Bend will get get you over there as our ACC triple header continues so right now youre in a threep possession game Jay Virginia Tech has to score in this possession they have to score Florida state does does not want to foul and put them on the free throw line to give them any free points padulla right to the rim lays it up and in fivepoint game Spears breaks the Press and a turnover Primo Spears called for a carry at midcourt Leonard Hamilton is in disbelief a big call and a close game the pressure by Virginia Tech as taking Florida State on these last three times they pressed has given Florida State problems and again just forced a turnover there on the on the carry Virginia Tech has life one minute left in regulation padulla got it Shan padulla drills the three and its a twopoint game incredible big shot by padulla and now Virginia Techs taking the press off and theyre just going to play in their half court defense cuz theyve got a one possession game incredible Big Time possession right here offensively for Florida State this is what its all about in the ACC theyre going to come with a high ball screen look for Miller to maybe slip on it but here comes Miller on the screen Spears 3 seconds to shoot in trouble warley gets it off just in time but misses and Couture has it 25 seconds left Virginia Tech trailing by Applause two nichel for the tie no good and padulla has to commit the foul there hey okay they got a good look there they got a good look I like that Mike young did not call timeout Florida state was not set up defensively I thought it was a good decision not to call timeout and ends up getting a good Music shot missed free throw and that gives Virginia Tech life because the worst Florida State can do right now is make it a threepoint lead now if they miss this no you got to get a free throw box out cuz thats where Florida state has hurt Virginia Tech on these Second Chances here missed both Virginia Tech has a timeout 10 seconds left in regulation padulla in attack mode draws the foul and will have a chance to tie this game at the foul line Miss free throws down the stretch there theyre theyve missed theyve missed three of their last four free throws Jay and here comes padulla just on the drive again good decision by Mike young not to call timeout Padilla gets to the rim draws the foul and I would tell you Fula missed those two free throws earlier I think hes hes such a good free throw shooter I would be shocked if hes not making both of these and Baba Miller has fouled out of this game and hes been a huge bright spot for Florida State eight points 10 rebounds hes played excellent defense I tell you what Jay I to last game winning shot was Cleveland at Miami February theyre there Music Miami were getting Chuck Walsh the Sid from Florida State hes the best of the business he was coming telling us some stat stuff this is Florida state had the game Virginia Virginia Techs pressure in the back court their full court press has caused for State major issues and then the Miss free throws by Florida State timeout leard Leonard Hamilton hes going to try and Ice the second foul shot of padulla whos been terrific all night 25 points for Shawn padulla what a bounceback effort after he struggled last Saturday in the lost to Wake Forest heres the reality for Florida State you were in the drivers seat this game was almost put to bed you led by seven points with a minute 30 left in this game and yet one free throw away from it being tied at 74 that being said as disappointing it is to lose that lead if youre Florida State you still have plenty of time to get something off well look they were up 17 with 8 minutes to go against Georgia at home earlier in the year and they lost the game theyve had some issues of holding on to leads and that can drive the coach crazy time and score is everything they just struggled somewhat against the pressure of Virginia Techs full court press but heres the thing they missed their last three of the four free throws Jay otherwise the games over instead padulla with a chance to tie this at 74 leads all scorers with 25 points tonight got it Applause and Mike young decides to take his final timeout to set up the defense well heres what I would tell you the question becomes and one Miller Miller has foued out thats a thats thats a big loss from Florida State assuming if they dont make this shot if they dont make this shot losing him in overtime is a big loss for them because hes been such a Difference Maker you can see the blow leads that Florida state has had this year that being said what is Leonard Hamilton drawing up right now and what is Mike young doing drawing up defensively I think Mike Youngs going to try to you dont want to get them behind so they might try to pick up just 34 court but keep it in front of you you dont want to Bow cuz both teams are in the bonus for 59 seconds is plenty of time to get to the rim on a dribble and you got to remember the new rule in college basketball that if you drive and the and defensively a guy moves over its probably going to be a block if theres going to be a collision at The Rim if theres not a straight up and down Jump by the defender so if Im fora state Im driving that ball to the rim as deep as I can and try to put the pressure on the official two minutes ago Florida state had a 10point lead Virginia Tech with a furious 111 run in the last 2 minutes to tie this game at 74 you can see Virginia Tech coutur picked up in the about right at the free throw line extended at Virginia Tech Spence just to make sure that Florida State catches it as close as they can to the Baseline I think once they throw the ball in theyll drop back they just want to have it caught as close to to the end line as possible into Spears 5 Seconds To Win It Spears all the way to the rim and a foul called foul called with 12 Primo Spears a chance to win it at the free throw Music line you can see straight drive sh that is not a lot of contact but he called it and Spears 88 foul shooter hes one for three today good decision to just drive it and get to the rim put the as I mentioned put the pressure on the do you miss it here Virginia Tech does not have a timeout if Im Florida State I missed the free throw you got to hit the rim that way Virginia Tech cant set anything up because at with a one point one or two points it shouldnt matter he should miss the free throw but hes got to hit the rim he makes it Virginia Tech down to one final chance a Applause Music did Lyn kid get a touch of the ball is the question cuz if he did not no clock would have run off so itd be 12 seconds left Florida state would have the ball but there would be time remaining so the question is did Lyn kid get a touch of this Music ball right now the game J I would like it you no I I would like for you to tell me do you foresee this as a this is a huge play right here on the Replay by Spears on the drive right I was going to say right now the difference in this game is this foul call so lets take another look before we look at the official review how do you see how do you see it Jay Im not an official and Im not a coach like you but in a in a tight game like this I would lean towards swallowing the whistle its a question call I now I will say this for the officials defense if theres a foul you got to call it whether its 1 second in a game or 19 minutes in the first half that dont know if theres enough contact that I I couldnt tell he said he got hit on the head it looked like it was more on the shoulder his forearm maybe on the back is where he got hit so now this is what theyre reviewing did a piece of the ball touch ly kid tough to tell there if it did the games over if it did not then Florida States just got to throw it in and get make sure they get a touch so with Virginia Tech with no timeouts what a terrific comeback attempt by Virginia Tech they trailed by 10 with 2 minutes to go seven with a minute 30 to go they come back to tie it at 74 and yet Florida state with those two primo Spears foul shots made may have just held on heres a good look at it kid outstretched arm it looks like the ball turned so maybe his fingertips got it live I thought he hit it as you look at the replays its tough to tell T to tell but with its if its a if its a close if its a 5050 the tie goes to the runner tie goes to what the official has on the call on the floor that look right there maybe did the ball turn did the did the laces change direction is the question they say didnt touch AJ deze coming over here to give the Music call so 12 seconds left Florida State ball and all the seminal need to do is inbound this call successfully you cant turn it over and you win the game you just got to get a touch because it whether Florida State or Virginia Tech touches it it starts to clock so even if you got a deflection its almost like you just throw it let the let the inbound guy guard the inbound get a deflection almost cuz the clock will Music start as you can see Florida State start stting everyone of the half courts so they have room to break towards the basket the only thing fora State needs to do is get the ball touched somehow some way just throw it up and a foul called by Jamie lucky before the inbound thats the last thing that Virginia that Florida State Applause Music wanted big opportunity here if if he makes if he misses the first so he does his first got it I would go ahead and make you got to make it just if you do theres no chance yeah sometimes you can think about well you missed theres no chance still coaching youre in the booth we cant we cant help you youre still coaching down the free throw fourpoint game your games over hey missed it I dont know why heave start clock way early thought they started the clock early they started the clock early the officials have walked off the court its a final Florida State the clock early padulla is trying to tell AJ decide
