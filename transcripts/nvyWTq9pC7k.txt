cough it up They are last in the ACC committing over 13 turnovers per game And as Damon starter told us today its those live ball turnovers that just absolutely kill you Georgia Tech with the basketball first at the point Lamar Washington among the best in the ACC in assists per game trying to set up something on their first possession Jared Mustaf able to bring it back out Washington Mustafi Reeves Bayongo and they get a good look on their first possession and the Yellow Jackets are off to a flying start I love when young men are out here earlier in shooting Hes the first one in the gym when I walked in at 645 getting extra shots with one of the shooting coaches and he comes in and he knocks in his first trunk Well the lineup for the Demon Deakons has changed repeatedly this season Miles Culvin in the starting lineup gets the Demon Deakons on the board Yeah swapping threes right off the bat Both these teams hungry for a victory trying to get off five game skins Corner three off the rim No Coralled by Harris Visitors from Winston Salem North Carolina wearing their road blacks Out of bounds Bring it And were going to have a foul call Roger our lead official with that call along the baseline Tony Chiaz and Rick Crawford our other Yeah they got Mustaf down there hipping that young man out of bounds His first foul They cannot forward for Mustaf to get in foul trouble Hes kind of that energy that coach starter needs when hes out there on that floor Has it poked away by Washington And itll stay at this end with 10 on the shot clock This is where Georgia Tech has got to get it done defensively Their last three opponents have been over 90 points But one thing in talking to coach Stamire earlier today hes worried about toughness He he just wants to see more toughness from his team That manifests in a lot of different ways Yeah He he said handle adversity better right like when things start going sideways in a basketball game theyve had games where theyve been down just a possession or two and then all of a sudden they end up getting blown out by double figures So he just wants his team to be able to be more mentally tough maybe a little tougher physically on the floor as well He says he still goes into every practice trying to make the Yellow Jackets more reliable by making them uncomfortable Well if youre uncomfortable in practice he thinks youre going to handle that better in crunch time in a basketball game One thing that uh will drive him mad is trying to get out and challenge a threepoint shot and then fouling the threepoint shooter as Fleming gets a little too close to the shooter there and just gets enough of the body Its like his hands okay at the ball But you could see that chest to chest action Officials going to call that every time pass of the personal against Fleming The freshman guard for the Yellow Jackets has Sebastian Aikens at the line He misses the first of three Akens is a military kid from outside of Charlotte in Concord North Carolina He started the last couple of games after the injury to Nate Calse cheering who was sidelined again today and sidelined indefinitely The starting point guard for Wake Forest Theyre hoping to get him back in time for the ACC tournament And so his backup Aikens gets coupled from the line to make it 53 weight This is what I want to see They got Reed the team score back after missing a couple games Oh Reed goes in Dango Nice little low to high transition Dongo sliding down from his high post position Gets the flush Great first step by Cooper Schwagger and the flush Well that wont make coach happy right You got a big man going right down the middle lane for an easy slam Got to play better defense at the rim Tell you what Scott although Georgia Tech turns it over we saw in their last possession two guys who need to deliver if the Yellow Jackets are going to win every night Theyve got to get a lot of ball from Reeves and Dango every timeout Yeah they seem in the first couple possessions Reeves didnt even touch the ball this time I thought he was going to make a move to the basket for a bucket Washington shoots a triple from the outside Misses the range Trayvon Spillers with his first rebound of the night Now Spillers with a quick first step and he gets to the rim for two Oh you see the game plan early right now for Wake Forest is just to attack the basket on Georgia Tech They do not feel like they have anybody that can stop them at the rim Spillers just down that left lane line with nobody to stop him Harris called for the foul Yeah Georgia Tech is having to do with out two of its four bigs once again tonight Moila remains sideline and Payton Marshall who suffered a thumb dislocation back in late January Hes out So Damon Starttomire really only has a couple of true big guys available to him Fleming misses the triple And so youve got to be careful Youve got to adjust your defense You got to make sure nobody gets in foul trouble Yeah it it you might see coach starter even go to a little half court zone defense if somebody might pick up a couple fouls early The key player and hes not against going small and often times forcing the opponent to adjust to them Bulvin dribbles into traffic and loses it to Indongo and quickly up ahead here comes Georgia Tech right to the rim hanging Fleming had it knocked away Oh I thought Fleming had Mustaf on the right side for the easy high hand off Should have dissed it over to Fleming Schwagger draws the second defender He kicks it out gets it back lays it off the glass and its a blocking foul He will shoot two Yeah Reeves tries to come over and draw that charge but he was inside that restricted area even though that he was already set See lets drive right here The little pick down that and the roll down the lane there I take that back Reeds was outside the restricted area but the officials are saying that he slid underneath First foul on the red shirt senior from Mon Georgia And so Cooper Schwagger at 610 a junior from Overland Park Kansas Hes got a twin brother Carson who is 68 And they teamed together last year at Valareerezo but then transferred The twins did cheering went their separate ways for Schwer here in Atlanta Cooper that is and his brother Carson is at Queens University the Atlantic Sun in Charlotte Juke Harris comes out of the game for Wake Forest He has had a quiet start to the ball game First four minutes for Wake Well Schwagger has been a nice job of showing that he can put the ball on the floor and he can roll to the basket uh very well So thats a a good sign for for Ree from the corner First three points for Lil Wayy Well thats what they need They need Wacy after missing the last ball game and only playing six minutes at Cal to get right back into this thing offensively He does a nice job sliding those biscuits this time taking that charge The push off by Miles Culvin The former Purdue Boiler Maker picks up his first personal And weve got our first media timeout music of the night is their biggest thief in terms of stealing the basketball Came out of the ball game 345 in Thought well maybe hes getting a quick blow for that first media timeout but the Deaks come out of their huddle and hes still on the bench Yeah its something to watch Maybe he got a little something tweaked but now as soon as we say that hes back up off the bench walking in front of us to get ready to check in Next ball Chaz Kelly with a basketball just into the game for the Yellow Jackets Heres Mustaf on left wing guarded by Spillers Shot clock down to six Big contact and down to the floor Spillers with a personal Yeah is going to get banged up pretty good on that But he likes his ability to take some of these bigger power forwards off the dribble drive there Just a quick hard drive to his his strong right hand and that caught Spillers off guard and he had to commit the foul Also into the game Cam Craft number 12 in white gets the basketball back uses the dongo screen Good ball movement to get it to Mustaf into the paint A lot of action up near the rim Able to get the rebound and come the other way as Wake Forest Mustaf again by Spillers Gained an advantage just could not finish at the rim Heres Harris second leading scoreer in the ACC looking for his first points tonight Second defender makes him pick up his dribble Seven to shoot Heres Aikens Its downhill The help side comes and Dongo with his first block shot of the night That was quite the wipe away at the rim Three ball Dont know if that was the intention of Kelly but hell take the three points I guarantee it wasnt his intention but youre right Hell take it Coach Dere more importantly in the Yellow Jackets will take that triple cheering Foul called on Kelly who does shoot it really well 35 or rather 45 And so when you shoot it that well I dont think you have to apologize when you do that Hell take it They love that defensive play there We saw by Nongo there that he went well up towards the top of the square to get that ball before it was on its downward arc towards the basket That was impressive But Todd the big man has got to play big inside Got to stop that weight far and you know hes a marvelous athlete at 69 240 You can see during shoot around earlier today and even during the game hes not 100 but hes out there giving him everything hes got Harris tough shot Reeves flies in and gets the basketball somehow for Georgia Tech Its out of bounds Back to the Yellow Jackets Gang rebounding right Like when youre having trouble getting on that glass and controlling that ball you got to get every white shirt on that in towards that painted area there to try to collect that ball That time Reeves came back and did a nice job helping out by Don Rebounding has been a problem for the Demon defense this year They are last in the ACC in that category 18th out of 18 teams Dong strong to the rim able to lay it in through the contact being guarded by Omaha Belaloo big man just backing his way down Left shoulder turn right hand hook is probably his primary move in that position and he shoots 56 from the field So you give him that one hes going to shoot probably closer to 65 or 70 Again with those quick hands and then Reeves got on the floor but is likely to be called for the foul Yeah and thats going to be Reeves second right your leading scoreer whos trying to get back into it after missing a couple basketball games is going to have to go to that bench now and to sit down with his second personal foul Sebastian Akens comes out as does Trayvon Spillers for Wake Forest We get our first look at Isaac Carr who over the last three games for Steve Forbes has played extended minutes 25 minutes per game for a freshman from Portland Oregon who had not seen any regular playing time until the last couple of weeks Yeah And hes been rewarded Hes been getting on that glass and chewing glass So Coach Forb says You going to play defense and rebound You can play for me Well they need rebounding And Carr has been willing to do it He gets an assist there just seconds off the bench on the three by Mason cheering That snaps an eight nothing run for Georgia Tech Craft trying to answer at the other end Working on Mason Pulls up Left it short Off the bounce That one rattles off Mai Mason only 30 on the year The transfer from Washington has six quick points off the bench Pace is fast and furious I love that its last possession there for Wake Forest as the ball did not stick in anybodys hands You can see that one little penetration and pitch over to the left corner The next time down to the right corner nice quick pass Little rhythm dribble knocking down backto back dribbles Well you know Mason has not delivered for Steve Forbes like he was hoping to coming into the year but hes certainly given a lift here tonight And he comes up with the rebound off the Kurowak miss Kelly looking for his own Hes got I like Kelly aggressiveness coming into this basketball game He knows they got to score points Demon Deas like I said they like to light up the scoreboard They like to play fast Georgia Techs going to have to try to match some of that early energy Chaz Kellys dad Chuck Charles II played a year as a walkon at the University of Houston Alvin Brooks back in the day then was attending the University of Houston on an academic scholarship cheering Five to shoot Harris still scoreless Ball goes out of bounds Back to Georgia Tech Theyre doing a real nice job on Harris keeping him to have to shoot tough twos Yellow Jackets 15 Demon Deakons 15 here in the first in Atlanta per game with two fouls Theyre going to play it and hope he doesnt pick up number three Yeah that second foul he kind of got was one of those ones that you know its hard to take the aggressiveness out of a kid but hes got to realize they have the leading score I already got one foul cant dive on the floor and cut out somebodys leg So get the ball in his hands while hes out there on the floor Try to get him some opportunities offensively Chaz Kelly had provided a spark off the bench back on the bench and thats why you have Casey Reeves on the floor Coach Starttomire knows what hes doing thats for sure Got the ball in his uh his shooters hands right at the top of the floor and Ree did the rest He was Starttomires first recruit out of the transfer portal when he took the job three years ago playing with the Florida Gator was looking for a bigger role able to come back to his home state of Georgia and happy that he has come back to Atlanta I think thats where Reeves is at his best right there when hes playing and not thinking Just catching shoot in rhythm Knock down triple Here he is off the screen right down the lane Hangs in the air Missed it though Kiraak fight for the ball Gives it back to Wy who flushes He left no doubt on that one So I might have got the little dipsy doo Couldnt fall But this one Im coming with some power That was uh it was some evil intentions behind it there Douge Yeah playing through the foul issues His five straight points makes it a fivepoint tech lead Cut right back to two by Isaac Carr The freshman from Portland has his first point Well it was drizzling outside raining threes inside here at Mckameish Arena Pavilion whatever the heck they call it This place is uh they are knocking down some triples They are hot in here Well that guard matchup car in Washington Couple of Portland guys whove known each other since they were kids And of course Damon Starttomire also from Portland Oregon I love the extra work on the boards that time by the big man underneath He finds his his buddy Reed for the jam And then back the other way again with fire triples And they seem to be going down with a regularity here in this first half What is that Eight triples combined here Right Kiraak goes out David Remigin was in the ball game for a brief moment Hes now back out for coach Stamine Mustaf and Fleming have returned Georgia Tech 11 and 13 overall Re slams on the brakes doesnt get the roll We talked a little bit before this game when we went to law and said you know how Reeves has got to have a big night right Like he cant just be at 15 Hes got to be in that 18 to 24 range for the Yellow Jackets to keep the pace Spillers always trying to get to that left hand Finds Carr Gives it back to Spillers Spotting up Hes got it The hot shooting from outside continues Yeah and I love that one right there cuz Spillers was willing to give the ball up when he got cut off initially defensively Smoke it to his teammate and swings it right back to him Now hes wide open for the triple Just his seventh made three of the year No double team over Belaloo but he missed it Coven rips it down Beloo gives it back to Carr Tries to drive baseline Cut off by Washington Dvin left his feet intending to shoot Instead passes to Spillers who puts up an air ball That That was a disjointed offensive possession that time by Wake Forest You dont see Coach Forbes teams have many of those through the course of a basketball game Tech got fortunate there The pass by Must was touched by Spillers Should have been a turnover Instead itll stay at this end with 21 on the shot clock plenty time to operate We watched in morning shoot around Georgia Tech run through all of their baseline out of bounds sets Lets see if they can get a high percentage shot here Come out of this uh bamar Washington the point guard triggers it in back out to Reeves guarded by Juke Harris Now they switch He picks up Mustafies from Portland going at it Washington finds the cutter along the baseline Fleming though Kiraak good health defense Wake Forest The defense comes away with the ball Great defense by Coven down along that baseline to deny the easy opportunity underneath His recoverability was tremendous See if the DeS can run some offense and find a good shot here Miles Calvin turns the corner up and over Washington for two Well that was good defense Just better offense So all you can do is pat him on the backside and congratulate him there cuz he was stoned down there in that painted area and just kind of had to flip something up towards the basket to avoid the 3second violation See the drought stopped by George Attack there Second made basket of the last six Well Reeves is feeling it He came off of that downream and was free to fire that little curl action right below the free throw line Schwagger hands to Harris He launches and connects Duke Harris said Hey I can come off a little bit of a side screen myself And Juke Harris gets on the board Hes playing through a dislocated left index finger suffered against North Carolina State on January 31st But Juke said no problem His shooting is not an issue Bad pass by Calvin Washington knocked it out of bounds So itll be Wake Forest basketball when we come back Now the teams two leading scorers First for Georgia Tech Reeds curling in side that painted area for a music buck in then and just as important as that to me off the courty is a free spirited deep thinker Hes published two books The first I am not your doctrine His second natures renaissance Hes got a third one in the works The idea is something about philosophy I should spell renaissance Hes back No that look at that defense by Tech getting another stop trying to cut to that fourpoint deficit Tell you what Georgia Tech has done a marvelous job taking care of the basketball so far Its been one of their problems this year Gets inside Dongo Now he goes to the other side protects the ball with the rim and lays it in He had two guys jump on him on the left side of the floor He went up with it got his own board and then he was crafty enough now to use the rim as kind of a protector of the ball ball He went to the right side and laid it in The three is good from Cooper Schwagger Just his eighth made three of the season Are you kidding me Schwiger Hes a pick and roll guy Now youre telling me hes a pick and pop guy Stepping out behind the arc knocking down triples Everybodys making threes here in this first half Both sides Faces up now Sets the screen for Reeves And hes fouled by Schwigger I got it Yeah its going to be the fourth team foul now on Wake Forest So be another one of these opportunities for baseline out of bounds But you can see Swigger hes got that confidence He stepped out there like hes knocked in 80 of them not just eight Well you know last March for Valerezo he put 33 on UIC So he can fill it up He can make those threes Culvin out and Sebastian Akens back down the floor for Wake Forest Tough inbounds pass Chopped by Dongo to retrieve it Mustaf looks to penetrate Schwagger got a hand on it Spillers takes it away I tell you what these officials are really letting them bang on those drives For the most part they are not calling a lot of fouls Stop took a really big bump there that time Akens gets to the rim just cant finish Young man coming off a very good performance as a starter against Louisville Four assists no turnovers Heres Chaz Kelly who provided some instant offense off the bench earlier this half for Georgia Tech Trying to add to it Schwagger soarses for the board Higgins back to Schwagger Little jump up off the back iron Out of bounds Wake Forest says lets challenge it The players want for their coaching staff Yeah it look they are going to review it D Forbes immediately looked to the second row and the assistant with the laptop said Yeah lets take another look Yeah Mustaf was in a bad way defensively trying to box out and hold off underneath and I believe it was Mustaf that actually poked that ball The previous play has been reviewed So while they review off of the Wake Forest coaches challenge well take a break as well to me Yeah theyll show there Sorry All right while the officials take another look we will do the same with you at home After review the challenge by Wake Forest is successful Theyll retain their timeout They have one final challenge Itll be Wake Forest ball on the baseline with 20 seconds on the shot clock Very well explained by Roger Ays Yeah and I I agree 100 You can see Mustaf again in a bad way kind of with that left hand just pokes it out of bounds So he wouldnt give up the offensive rebound Sometimes thats not such a bad play if you know youre kind of down there youre you know off balance Just hey lets just poke it out of bounds and and reset our defense Harry fouled on the jump shot Well again execution on baseline out of bounds plays is obviously really easy when you got the second leading scoreer coming off a couple screens towards the basketball along the baseline but you got to kind of look at coach starter there None too pleased that uh going to foul a threepoint shooter and put him on the line for three shots cheering Heres next Wednesdays mens basketball double header First number 20 Clemson heads to Winston Salem to take on Wake Forest at 7 Eastern Then number 15 Virginia comes down to Atlanta to take on the Yellow Jackets All games found right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Had another busy night of ACC basketball ongoing tonight Were the second of a double header where Virginia Tech picked up a huge road victory at number 20 Clemson Pokes on the bubble That is going to play very well with selection Sunday just over a month away Yeah I tell you what Georgia They fight hard Weve had an opportunity to do a couple of their games now and they play hard Georgia Tech trying to fight back Dongo able to put it back in but its still a 166 Wake Forest run I like what my guy Dongo has done here in the first half right Hes chewed glass He scored buckets inside Hes played good defense and Gracie Reeves now with 10 points as well uh is has found his rhythm offensively after only playing six minutes the last couple games And I know Tech doesnt have the lead but if they can just take a little momentum to the locker room theyre going to feel real good about themselves to come out in the second half Heres Chaz Kelly who in his last game no points in 18 minutes Hes got five points Couldnt connect there so far off the bench tonight Ball got stuck on the left side of that court They didnt really like that possession that time for the Yellow Jackets But then again another quick fire out of Wake Forest and then Georgia Tech gets an easy rebound Well typically Juke Harris does not force shots as Fleming misses but Ive gotten the sense in this ball game so far that Harris has forced a couple of shots Well they played some tight defense on them right You youre averaging 28 points a game over your last two and all of a sudden youre getting shut out Youre going to start hunting some shots as well and try to get yourself going and sometimes that leads to some bad shots Well he is clearly their best player He according to his coach is the best student of the game So Juke Harris knows what hes doing Now he puts it on the floor and lays it in And thats generally what you got to do when youre struggling to score offensively I mean I knocked in that one triple off a corner curl screen but for the most part you got to put your head down and attack the basket when you havent seen that thing go through the hoop as often as youre used to Under three minutes to go first half its a sevenpoint Wake Forest lead Cut back to four as the Reeves continues to deliver Yeah And coach Forbes for Wake Forer a game plan for him this music afternoon at 200 and yet Ree has come out here on fire in this first half music And Juke Harris this guy right here just snipes between two defenders and then they just lose Reeds over that left corner and he burns them music Yeah And theyre playing theyre playing through their roles playing real well Reeds got to be careful not to pick up his third foul here in this final 251 to go And then I love the bump off the bench that Wake Forest got nine points off of their bench here in this first half Well Reeves has the 13 points to lead all scorers He had just 22 points combined over the last three games for Georgia Tech Paris seven points Omaha Belaloo yet to score He has really scored very well the last couple of games able to retrieve it and weve got a whistle We had a reset of the shot clock Perhaps that was the issue Yeah they uh reset the shot clock They thought maybe was a change of possession when Bay underhanded that ball back in bounds but they officials said no That wasnt a uh possession by George Tag so they put 18 seconds back on the uh shot clock Good job by the officials to get that done quickly Its a good crew I I like this crew because theyre theyre calling the fouls they need to call but theyre getting big strong young men play like big strong young men here in this first half This is Roger a Final Four official our lead official here tonight in Atlanta Wake Forest up by four despite having cooled off just a little bit Both teams shooting 50 from threepoint land out of bounds Calvin accepted that pass and that is the third turnover as he took it in good position but stepped down the end line He was going so fast he just couldnt get his feet to stop in time and he lost that ball as a result of worrying about his his position on the floor with his feet Got him Theres the threepoint specialist Thats what he is in the game to do We had a game earlier where he he knocked in four of uh threepoint shots to start the games in Georgia Tech So hes capable of kick real hot behind that threepoint line Now they force one of those turnovers by Way Forest Look at this one more time Washington with just a nice snap pass on time on target right where Craft likes to shoot it catches it right at the letters there and he knocked it down Yeah he has a special skill shooting the basketball Former Xavier musketeer last year with Miami Ohio Now a key piece off the bench to Damon Start Feeder the big man gets fouled and hell shoot two Swiggers got good hands He got good footwork He rolls off of picks real well He caught that ball in transition Now hes just got to go to the line and have a little confidence Last time he went over the free throw line Hes got to knock a couple down right here Just that advantage of back up to three points Foul on Washington his first and the seventh against Georgia Tech The softball season rolls on with the Shriners Childrens No were talking womens basketball Excuse me Looking ahead to a womens basketball double header Thats going to be on February 19th right here on ACC Network in the ESPN Number 21 North Carolina takes on Virginia Tech at 6 Eastern And then Miami hosts Stanford Of course everybody chasing Duke these days Carol Lawsons Blue Devils still undefeated in ACC play at 13 and0 Schwigger made a pair He is a good free throw shooter on the season So hes got a nice Yeah he he sure does He just havent been there a lot right Hes only taken uh 18 free throws coming into this Dango sets the screen off the bounce Left it short Good close out by Belaloo who was the last to touch Itll stay with the Yellow Jackets But Omaha Belaloo can provide a lot of things for Steve Forbes Hes every bit of 68 230 Plays really hard He was a McDonalds allAmerican out of Walke Iowa Didnt work out playing for the Cyclones and now in his second year Wake Force but because of injuries and other things this is really the first time hes played since high school So he is still kicking some of the rust off And Beloo has for the last couple of games averaged 13 points per been very efficient shot the ball very well If they can make him be a weapon every night coach Forbs team will be that much better off Yeah he he loves his size Like you said 68 230 lbs So he had 14 points three boards last game Gets a little from the corner Aens left it short Yellow Jackets trying to convert at the other end Fleming had it poked away Saved Whos got it It comes to the Yellow Jackets who missed the layup And the whistle comes off of the good fight Yeah And thats going to be free throws the other Thats going to be the 18 foul now on Georgia Tech They were fighting hard for that loose ball and couple shots up on the rim Couple offensive rebounds but they just could not get it to go And as bad luck finds them now going to go down and free shoot free throws on the other way Coach Dtomire barking out some instructions down there Oh hes going to get a couple of his offensive weapons back in here for this last possession or their last possession of this first half Dongo picks up his first foul and I like the reaction of Steve Forbes right in front of us He knows his team doesnt rebounded well but he has not had anything to complain about in terms of how hard his team works both on the floor during the game and in practice He talked about last Thursday former Deaks head coach Dave Odum who still lives in the Winston Salem area visited practice as he often does And coach ODM said to coach Forbes after the game you know your guys are still working as hard as though this was an October practice as opposed to a February practice So Coach Forbes has nothing to complain about in terms of effort from his guys Yeah And and thats good Thats good to see and good to know You got guys are going to keep fighting right I mean theyre two and eight not eight and two How many you get good practice out of the guys out of you know the teams that are eight and two in the ACC Theyre two and eight and theyre still out there competing Thats when you know you got a solid group Well you just wonder for Wake Forest and I know coaches cant do this but fans certainly do it how the season might have flipped if they had gotten that win against Michigan in Detroit back in November lost by a point against the mighty Wolverines or if some of the close games against good teams in early January when they started ACC play if they go the way of the Demon Deacons changes confidence changes the flow and might have changed the trajectory of where they are right now I agree with you 100 I I loved our what 25 plus minute talk that we had with coach Ford while his team was kind of going through some of their early workout and stretching prior to him taking over control of the shoot around Hes very candid about about his bunch and you know who he got that can fight who how they who can handle the adversity Reeves gets his own miss Those were the first two free throw attempts for Tech here tonight with about 30 seconds to go until the intermission Timeout called by the Yellow Jackets with nine remaining on the shot clock Yeah I believe thats that Yeah let me use it or lose it Time out here Just a chance to be able to uh set something up in this final nine seconds that they got to work with when we come back Zindango here with nine on the shot clock Yeah I I like Ree coming back to this basketball A little high screen roll Maybe a little little hand corner hand off here There are the two of them Shot clock under five now Dangerous pass swiped away 10 seconds to go in the half Still time for Aikens Pulls it out Harris for three 3 seconds Two seconds The heave from beyond midcourt by Kelly is off the mark and a very well played first half is in the books with the Demon Deacons up by four Yeah both teams shot it well from behind the arc We had a little loose play there the last three minutes Some turnovers some sloppy plays some tough possessions but I like the way these teams are competing 3733 our halftime score Wake Forest leading Georgia Tech in this game that puts a couple of teams in desperate need of a victory The way Reeves music leads all scores for the Yellow Jackets with 14 points looking to protect their home floor But now lets send it back to the studio Our halftime report here on the ACC Network Wake Forest begins the second half with the basketball And we should say that Juke Harris while he didnt score it a ton hes got seven points did grab six rebounds has a couple of assists and in one of these strange oddities Miles Calvin four turnovers in that first half Were underway Miles Calvin with three Yeah Juke Carz comes right back in near the top of the floor knocks down a a triple So he got himself going real quick here in this second half Give that man double figure scoring now with 10 points David Reagan getting the start for Georgia Tech to begin the second half And he turns it over Freshman from Germany getting the confidence from Damon Stamine who keeps him out there 4033 This matches the largest lead of the night for the Knights Yeah they got and Georgia Techs got to get themselves going They were just uh 0 for their last four field goals and they come out in the locker room here and uh as you mentioned a quick turnover to start the second half Harris attacks goes right by Remigan and lays it in Ah hes just so wired Hes so ability to be able to squeeze through the creases of the defense Now twice in his game hes gotten himself all the way to the rim just attacking inside One of the top scorers in the ACC one of the most improved players in the ACC And at this point with about a month to go in the regular season Juke Harris is clearly the favorite to win ACC most improved player for 2526 100 agree with that Scoring average of 15 points from where he was a year ago Number one tiny number one in the country with the most improvement from a season ago Little wild on that shot there but hes bigger stronger more confident just a different player than he was as a freshman gets it taken away And I like the consistency from one half to the next with these officiating crew A lot of body contact on that drive by Rimigan and no call Dolphin had the steal and then is fouled at the other end These guys like constant energy right between trying to get a handle on on Harris and then you got Cloven the transfer coming over Second leading scoreer on the team and hes just a ball of energy flying down that right side of the floor He gets the body contact chance to go to the line Excuse me Scott Quy Reeves just picked up his third personal foul Well there are a couple of Yellow Jackets at the scores table and I imagine one of them will cheering get Kasi Reeds as Pen connects on the first Yeah take him out of his game but you cant sit him down there long now because this this game is now at double figures deficit So I cant blame coach Dtomay for leaving him out there on the floor Yeah Kesi plays on They need his offense 14 to lead the Yellow Jackets in that first half Calvin gets a pair The junior from Indianapolis makes the score 4433 Its a 7 nothing run to begin the half for the Demon Deakons Dangerous spot here for the Yellow Jackets Not so sure about that shot You know the ball never changes sides of the floor Never gets into the top two players hands offensively Woo Kawasi Reeves with the block shot on a three Culvin recovers and gets it swatted again This time its Dongo into the front row Thats Dogos second block shot of this game and impressive fashion sending that one coming from the weak side First of all you dont really want to see Reeds going out there and challenging that threepoint shot to the point where he can possibly pick up his fourth foul Someone shooting the three He got away with one there and then Dongo cleans up the the mess inside But man I was so impressed by the Reeves block shot Did it with the proper hand Didnt make any contact down low Still Wake Forest keeps possession and Spillers converts Its a 13point game Well they only had two offensive rebounds in that first half and Spillers with a big one right there to start this second half off right Eric Chatfield Jr getting his first run of the night number two a backup guard as the Yellow Jackets just continue to try and find something to work at that end of the floor It seems like the Yellow Jackets can get their hands on a lot of balls around the rim but they dont really squeeze it hard and go back up with any strength or power and theyre not able to finish some of these offensive touches that they get around the rim The Yellow Jackets have missed their last 11 shots What a feed by Harris inside for Schwigger He ripped it right by the defenders ear hole And Im telling you this guy has got really good hands That ball was coming 100 milesPH and he handled it cleanly and laid it in the basket Oh look at this one more time here Harris just whips music it by two defenders and gets a bucket inside for shot out of a canon to begin this second half 11 unanswered points to open up what was a fourpoint game at the half Yeah I like that way they mixed in the outside game and the inside attack on the on the offensive glass Got second chance points got two drives to the basket and then you had that Juke Harris triple So everything clicking offensively a quick four of nine to start this game here in the second half You know David starter told us earlier today quote We dont have a collective toughness at times Well well see what their response is here right now Well I love that right there He He got some guys in the game that say Were going to take it to the basket whatever by any means necessary and they drove it in there hard Now an opportunity to go to the free throw line to stop the bleet Foul number two on Spillers as Cole Kiraak the 7 foot freshman from Georgia at the line He is now 0 for six as a collegiate player from the free throw line It takes reps I remember my freshman year I could barely my knees were shaking sometimes when I stepped early to that line I hadnt had a lot of reps So this gets some confidence when he gets to the line cuz his strokes not bad But youre right there was some nerves involved in those two free throws and hes been able to get neither of them down Akins and Culvin in the back court along with Harris Schwaggers got the basketball now And this is Trayvon Spillers They get it back to Harris one of the top scorers in the ACC at 21 points per game Another whip pass to the other side Good rebound from Kesi Reeds playing with those three fouls You know Reeds had that spurt offensively quick 10 points after he picked up his second fouls foul in that first half I wonder if maybe picking up that third now has got him nervous to pick up a fourth cuz he hasnt been the same aggressive player offensively here after he got that third foul Fact the ball is not even really finding him on the offensive end And I think thats a big missed opportunity by coach Stammer and his bunch Oh wow Reeves with the overplay Pokes it away and now gets the ball back Gives it up Trap hangs in the air banks it No but the ball was good Makes sense that Reeves who got the steal got the two points Hes a really risky defender Once he challenged a threepoint shot and it got a block that time he went for the steal almost got whistled for a foul but it worked out for him and it worked out for Georgia Tech Do the Yellow Jackets have an answer as the Deaks have opened up a 13point lead and NC State Friday at 1230 Eastern Wolfpack also take on Texas AM Saturday morning Then the final game will be Sunday morning Number 19 will host those Tigers as we are back to action five minutes in here at the Camish Pavilion in Atlanta And does the home team have an answer for what Wake Forest has brought here in the second half I tell you what uh Wake Forest is getting the job done on the glass Duke Harris just got his tint rebound on that last possession going on with the now up 12 points So this kid is coming on like gang busters here And Kesi Reeves just registered his fourth personal And again at this point of the season at this point of the game David Starttomire says At least for now well keep him in Nope hes going to take Reeves out next time Chaz Kelly comes in Yeah Cant cant afford to have this young man foul out here We still got 14 minutes and 46 seconds to play And I talked about his aggressive play defensively and sometimes when you got three fouls you know I got to stay on this floor Were were facing a deficit here You just got to lay back defensively and he was just too aggressive Foul puts his shoulder down and goes right through Carowak for two Yeah you got to remember Spiller hes that lefthanded player and he if he can get to that you know right shoulder turn left hand hook it that thats his bread and butter You got to try to take that away His drive to the left and then that right shoulder turn and that left hand hook Hes just diddly Yeah Spillers averages 11 points five and a half rebounds a game Craft with a tough shot Omaha Belaloo in the game pulls it down for weight Yeah it and again want it and done for Georgia Tech They cannot get anything on that offensive glass The Yellow Jackets as you see one of 10 from the floor here in the second half They were down by just four at the intermission Juke Harris has it knocked away by Champions Beloo with it Five on the timer Carr loses his footing And here comes Carowak and the Yellow Jackets Well they had the numbers and able to convert even though it wasnt pretty Akai Fleming with the layup It was one of the ugliest breaks I think we have seen the entire college basketball season But live ball turnovers They got four guys in white shirts going the other end and somehow theyre able to fight that ball into the basket Well Fleming has just two points after having scored 19 in each of their two losses the last time out in the San Francisco Bay area So they could use more offense from Fleming if they can get him going Yeah that time trying to be a little too aggressive Lou trying to get on that offensive glass just a push in the back underneath there So Georgia Techs able to uh retain possession of that ball This got to get something going here though They got to get something going back to the rim or help one another score Not trying to do it oneonone Chaz Kelly former Boston College Eagle Back out to Chatfield Seven minutes gone here in the second half in Atlanta Home team down 13 Five to shoot Well Mai Fleming with five quick points Yellow Jackets trying to get back into it Fleming was great on the West Coast He had 19 against Cal 19 against Stanford And I love that one because it went inside and then back out for the triple They joined the starting lineup way back in on November 29th Harris Harris with two He continues to deliver here in the second half Yeah Juke Harris has got it going now Hes stuck on automatic Hes throwing them in from all over the floor from the triples A midrange game is nice Hes driving the ball hard to the basket 14 points on the evening go along with 10 boards Kelly carried it cheering off of the screen from Kiraak He was hesitant about what he was going to do The hand got underneath the ball and you cant do that No the ball seems to stick when it hits Kellys hands Whether he doesnt know where to drive it doesnt know where to pass it hes not sure when to dribble it and hes allowing the defense to reset The defense resets on you like that makes it real difficult to make a decision with the basketball defense by Kelly to cut off the baseline Heres Harris Just over eight minutes gone in the second half Coven drive and dish for a quarter three and it is good I love the confidence of Mason before the ball hit the net He was looking at his teammates on the bench saying Uhhuh Yeah And and that basket gets as big as a hula hoop now when youre up by 15 points So it seems like everything that Wake Forest throws in from the outside is going in Champfield gets those three right back the freshman from right here in Atlanta They needed that badly but can they get the stops defensively Thats thats where theyre having problems here Doo muscles his way to the basket and draws the foul Well the best way to to get a teammate open is to drive the ball towards the basket and then kick it back out to the outside Thats a nice job that music time by Coleman And they again a quick swing swing to your teammate on in high school and he looks bigger than 67 Hes put on good muscle weight He told us earlier today hes playing at 195 and probably would like to get over 200 at some point And I said when was the last time you measured yourself He said not since the summer He said hed prefer even if hes 68 for people to think hes 67 because then when they see him in person they think oh youre bigger than I thought Its a big thing And he is legit and he keeps getting stronger Hes got an NBA body Scouts they have a handful at every home game And uh there is talk that he could be a second round pick if he chose to go that way But you get the sense He was a hometown kid from Salisbury North Carolina Wanted to stay at the same high school for three years And now hes in his second year And you get the sense that hes in not in a hurry to get to the NBA If it happens this year great If not hes happy to go back to Winston Salem for a third or a fourth year Well the way hes developing I mean why not right I mean you go from six points to 15 points And coach Forb just loves this kid He loves his work ethic We got talked to coach form He says Best part about the game is practice And he got a kid in his superstar that loves practice So there you see an ACC play in conference only games Harris is number two behind Cam Boozer just ahead of Ibuka Cory the brilliant freshman from Stanford who is number two in scoring overall But what a season it has been What a renaissance season it has been for the ACC That foul on Omaha Belaloo was his second Nice find and the great finishing throws it down Yeah live legs by Flyn Fleming But how about the pass by Dongo there Nice bounce pass underneath the defenders arms and came up perfect for Fleming to slam it down balloon His first three points of the night come on a friendly roll How about that You know little shooters touch You dont normally see those threepoint shots hit the front of the rim and then the ball softly back through the basket Theres Fleming who has been feeling it a bit here in the second half of the Yellow Jackets Miss Batley there There you see the agility and the ability of Bayono Yeah we we said Dongos got to chew some glass tonight right say hes got six boards for him Like to see him try to get another five to six rebounds before this thing is all said and done But look at little zone defense now for Georgia Tech trying to throw Wake Forest off their game Miles Calvin shot fake Give it to Mason Boy he has really delivered tonight for Wake Forest Another big triple here in this second half for the Demon Deakons They are lighting that thing up from behind the line And the hot shooting for Wake Forest has been going on since the start Ticked off shortly after 900 And they have been ready to roll Chaz Kelly gets his own miss off the bounce Dongo keeps it alive and the reaching foul against Belaloo Well by Dongo is playing a mansized basketball game on the glass I cant talk about it enough because it is just a joy to watch some old school chewing of the glass And thats exactly what this young man is doing here getting on that offensive glass getting those extra possessions trying to cut into that double digit deficit Well the young man who grew up in Sagal played his high school basketball in Connecticut at Putnham Science Academy played for the great AAOU program the Alb City Rocks produced Kevin Herder Andre Jackson Tobias Harris Isaiah Stewart Jaylen Picket all now in the NBA And Dongo played for that program And remember he was 13 all ACC last year He was a preseason guy He may not make any of the list this year but he is a really really good player a solid player every time he steps on the floor Not too many guys in the ACC doing what hes doing Over 12 points eight rebounds Hes got four offensive rebounds in this Nice looking stroke for the big man He makes them both Fullourt presser now by Georgia Tech Just trying to mix it up Give Wade Far some some different looks Maybe falling back into a little zone defense again No straight manto man Cars come back onto the floor for the Demon Deacons Shot clock is back there at five Car save Schwaggers going to have to make something happened and hes fouled with under a second to go on the shot clock Wow Georgia Tech played great defense Almost got a live ball turnover Somehow Swinger gets it and drives it to the hole Im thinking with mere ten of a second left on that shot clock just that reach across the wrist Dongo gets whistled for the foul That is his second In real time what should Dongo have done Just just laid back Its hard for a defender to know exactly how much times left on that shot clock which is almost like you have to have that internal clock in your head to say Hey weve done a great job defensively If this young man can somehow fight this ball into the basket and I just have my hand high instead of reaching down across the wrist so be it Good contest by Wake defensively Spiller comes away with it off of the miss by Eric Chatfield Jr Field defends Aens Harris comes to the ball gives it right back to the man who gave it to him and picks up another foul as Spillers crashes to the deck Well they run Spillers and Harris kind of a little dribble exchange And when Harris gets it he draws so much attention from the defense twice now Hes been able to whip passes by the defenders for that rolling big down the middle of the lane And Spillers took the nasty spill on that one as Dongo Was that three now on and dongle cheering So Spillers who is a product of the junior college ranks and wound up at Appalachin State first team all Sunb Belt a couple of years ago was really good last year for Steve Forbes now year number two at Wake Hes a career 10000 point scorer Hes into double figures cheering He matches his season average and makes it 6449 Well I think Damon Starttomire has realized now is the time he gets Reed back in the game Unfortunately they cant get the ball on his hands before they turn it over Champfield coughs it up Sebastian Akens continuing to get extended time at the point for Steve Forbes who is making do without his starting point guard Nate Cali Offense continues to click led by Juke Harris Juke Harris Im telling you this kid is something special to watch He has an effortless offensive game Backtoback turnovers Harris has 10 in the second half his 16 a team high Make that 17 And once again the Demon Deakons getting what they want downhill in the lane And the domination is up to 20 Just a real joy to watch Wake Forest here in this second half Been shooting and 12 made threes though offense start clicking uh for Wake Forest and Georgia Tech has just not had an answer defensively and how to get stops Theyre giving up threepoint shots to give up points in the paint Theyre giving up uh fouls and it has really gotten them disjointed offensively They have backtoback turnovers as crap knocks in a triple soil Fer Jr from Chicago now with six And at the same time Wake Forest does not look like a team in the midst of its own fivegame losing streak They have defended very well They have eight block shots and they have four players in double figures They are shooting 50 from beyond the threepoint line and theyve got four in double figures It has really worked on both ends for the Demon Deacons Aons lost it Dongo comes up with it Here comes Craft 642 remaining in regulation That was a good defensive possession They slapped the little uh trap out there on the perimeter and uh Wake Forest didnt know how to attack it Dongo inside for a wild lefth hand shot Couldnt get to go Thats the one where Dongo would Id love to see him instead of trying to get tricky just play with some power go right up through the chest of the defender A to Harris trying to get a step on Fleming along the baseline Fleming stays with him makes it tough and comes up with a defensive stop Thats the guy Id like to see get going there for gets the roll It has been a quiet night as you reference for Jaden Mustaf a sophomore from Buoie Maryland Yeah he had the quick triple to start this basketball game and then nothing since before that bucket right there You like looked like you were ready to take that ball there Scott I was Well you know we were shooting horse earlier and I I got the little chance to have that ball in my hand Who won that horse game by the way Well the the first one yes the 15year NBA veteran beat the playbyplay guy and the producer But you know the second game before Wake Forest chased us off the court We know how that one was going Scott Tanner uh he he knocked in a half court shot on me to put a letter on me That was a tough one to try to match there contested three And Ill tell you what Cooper Swing is having himself a ball game Hes having some fun isnt he His kids rolling down the lane Hes knocked down his second triple of the basketball game Its a double figure score now is he Well he was the freshman of the year in 2024 in the Missouri Valley Conference at Velpo Now playing himself into a much bigger role for the Demon Deakons His first in the ACC Bandango heating up just a bit But is it going to be too little too late But five minutes to play they got a lot of time Weve seen Georgia Tech slap some some trap on opponent We had the game of Virginia Tech and they were down big and they were going to cut into that double digit deficit late in the ball game and uh and made that one a contest Lets lets not put pull a plug on them yet But Harris off the sweet feed from Mason And you know one of the issues for Steve Forbes this year he has not liked And as weve got a uh yellow jacket who needs a little more time Dongo took a shot But Steve Forbes has not liked in a lot of the close games at clutch time the way his team has performed and can close this out now The the margin of error is much bigger here right now but as you said theres still time Can his deaks continue to perform over the last 440 Yeah and if they keep getting buckets to the basket by their primary score going inside Id say the answer is yes If they have some live ball turnovers which they have had one and give the opportunity for Georgia Tech is under review then then its going to be a lot more difficult for him It is going to add some drama towards the end of this game Well I didnt see live what happened to Bayongo but the officials are going to review and see if there was something untoward that should be called Well it was it was a nice strong drive there by Harris is what I saw on It seemed to me that uh theyre rubbing blood from underneath the right eye now of Dongo Lets see if this left elbow comes out and catches Dongo across his face Yeah its that forearm See that that left forearm trying to keep the shot blocker off But is that just basketball play Its incidental contact basketball play rather I I I dont see review Itll be Georgia Tech on the baseline with 30 seconds Yeah So just a basketball play Yeah Yeah And and those happen I think over the course of the season you kind of realize that as a basketball play you just hope at the end of the uh regular season or postseason youve given out as many if not more than youve received Well I like the way Juke Harris took that ball strong through a elite shot blocker And Juke spent his summer he told me this afternoon working on his threepoint shooting and his free throw shooting But now hes trying to further round out his game getting downhill finishing through contact which he exactly did screaming Well that was a nice drive Was that move stop fogging down that right side there or plumbing that One of these guys they had an opportunity to catch their breath and took it hard through the rack Yeah Reeves now with 18 points Didnt you say Harriss brother was here Do you think maybe his brother gave him a pep talk at halftime Yeah big brother Z There are six Harris children and Z has made the drive down from North Carolina to watch his baby brother And yeah maybe there was some inspiration at halftime because Juke has been much more proactive and more productive here in the second half Fourth foul on Aai Fleming the goodlooking freshman for Georgia Tech from nearby Marietta Mai Mason to the line shooting two And so at the free throw line is Mai Mason who has had a breakthrough game so far tonight for the Deaks Tomorrow night at 10 Eastern after our womens basketball double header the Nothing But Net Crew well break down the night in the ACC with highlights and analysis of every womens game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for the weekend and for early next week Weve got you covered all season right here on ACC Network and the ESPN app Mason gets one out of two He has 15 points more than double the season average Yeah Averages you know 67 points per game but hes just having one of those nights where everything he gets hes just taking the ball hard to the basket or knocking down jumpers and yeah happy for that young man Its tough to do that on the road Like you come down here and have a late shoot around at what they get here about 200 145 200 and got to go back to the room get your head right and then come out here and perform Terrific finish by Mai Mason 65202 from Gilbert Arizona Yeah I didnt mention it Hes just just hard to the rock right 17 points now And I think thats pretty much iced this one here as theyre up by 17 with under 330 to play Ill tell you what just before the start of the second half we highlighted the other guys on the roster for Steve Forbes If they can get this kind of balance for the final month of the regular season theyre going to win some more ball games Yeah this has been a a tremendous team effort The ball doesnt really stick in any one players hands right They get the ball to Harris They let him operate but they dont its not out of a static situation Coming off a screen coming off a curl doing some pick and roll right at the top of the key He finds his teammates Im not sure the assist numbers but hes knocking down shooting up another triple there Hes got 25 points and and 11 boards Fun to watch him operate Gustaf through the contact He was fouled by Mason who is in the midst of a tremendous game offensively Wake up by 17 Put 20 and 10 on American in the season opener Had 16 in the near win against mighty Michigan And then 16 points against Campbell late November The last time he was in double figures until tonight He has been terrific for Wake Forest Well he he does a nice job getting himself behind the arc on balance So when the ball does find him hes ready to fire Mustaf at clears throat the line gets one out of two Hes got six points for Tech Final 238 in regulation Jenkins finds Mason Spillers Nice bounce pass inside the elevation by Juke Harris And that is a mismatch Well you know Wake Forest has done a much better job here in this second half of mixing up the outside attack and the inside attack Georgia Tech tried to go to a little zone defense to choke off a little but he still gave up the inside pocket as Craft knocks down his second threepointer in this second half And hes got three for the game All nine of his points coming from distance Back to a 15point game Mason thought about it from 18 instead turns it back out again Wake Forest is playing without its point guard Nate Calse Came in averaging nearly five assists per game Hes in a walking boot and they hope to get him back in time for the ACC tournament Spillers throws it down on the putback Yeah you got grabb trying to block out Spillers on the weak side of the basket where exactly where most long shots come off the rim and Spillers with uh easy jam after the rebound is Ree cant go inside for a bucket Terrific balance for Wake Forest Harris has 21 points Mason 17 and then 13 apiece now for Spillers and Schwagger Well Wake Forest is kind of doing what Wake Forest does right They try to get around that 80 point plateau and it just it made it real tough for Georgia Tech to to match that fire power here in the second half once Harris got it going And of course its hard to talk about Mason Theres Harris again Another offensive rebound and put back So Georgia Tech just could not stop the inside attack or the outside attack the offensive rebounds and they had to play without their top score here for a good portion of this second half Excuse me Scott Count the basket and one for Jaden Mustaf And so he will go to the line So impressed with Juke Harris had a a relatively quiet first half scoring the basketball only seven points You look up hes got 23 Thats why he is among the top three scorers in the ACC And again the odds on favorite to be the ACC most improved player of the year Yeah And I like you you had mentioned he kind of was hunting some shots after he started slow in that first half In the second half we seen none of that He played well within himself He played well with his teammates combining when he wanted to score when he wanted to get other guys involved And uh it was impressive to watch here this last 20 minutes way this kid operated And theyre going to get off of that fivegame losing streak and cheering Mason and Harris is a big reason why Final seconds tick off on a very impressive second half applause for Wake Forest Steve Forbes Damon Statmire meet for a few seconds at midcourt Fivegame losing streak is over for the Demon Deacons
