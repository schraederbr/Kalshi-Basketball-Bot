hot shooter of late he averaging 10 points per game in ACC play Eagles in white noted Dame in the navy blue and we are off and running in Chestnut hill our officiating crew is made up of Bert Smith Tony Henderson and Tommy marsy dein mcglockton with the ball hands it off to claudell Harris a post trying to back in loves that shot but hes short and keev ji has the rebound and interesting again Notre Dame comes out manto man how they defend Quinton post that time no double thats great defense pushing post away from the basket forcing him into a tough turnaround noted Dame offense has been a bit inconsistent they averaged 63 points per game 40 from the field only 29 from three heres kesn driving towards the Baseline open three for Julian Roper and Zachary has it Prince Elite Bay in transition thats something you have to convert on absolutely again a wide open look for Notre Dame off a great ball movement Burton well he loves the dribble drive and post has the rebound but you love the fact that Burton gets in the lane he is and that was a key one we spoke with uh coach Earl Grant and the BC coaching staff they said we have to keep him out of the paint where he can break down the defense and score for himself or set his teammates up Harris playing a twoman game now with Jaden Zachary Harris 16 points per game thats second on the team behind post five to shoot for the Eagles haris from three and the rebound for Carrie Boo and Boo has been a excellent contributor since he came into the starting lineup for no today and thats a great back out that time as well too on Applause post Burton and and hes got the first two of the night theres an NBA Scout and some execs in the building tonight and they really like this young player uh Burton again we talked about his numbers and thats a key for Boston College you have to keep him out of the paint thats a great jump stop jumper off of dribble penetration Burton 10 straight games in double figures he had 20 against Florida State in their lost Saturday Zachary deliberate with the ball Devon mcglockton for three and hes got it the big fella from coming Georgia has three and thats almost like a postentry pass out there was so much focus on Quinton post buttons wide open and again I like what Boston College is doing early on theyre trying to get post established in the paint M glts A 59 shooter hes been a revelation on the offensive end for Earl Grant its only his ninth three of the season in 26 attempts Booth gets Harris in the air but mton Eng Gul the board a leag bay wild shot his offensive game needs to be more refined yeah thats true now drives again hes got to go strong hes trying to finesse that in with his left you need to come to a jump stop jumper and then try to play through contact two hands on the Applause ball and Marcus Burton we talked about his numbers hes one of the best freshman guards not just in the ACC but in college right here dribble Drive beautiful jump stop jumper and then this right here again look at all the attention on Quinton post theres three people around him M glockton wide open look thats a great read by Jaden Zachary first foul of the game called on Prince El Bay its Mason Matson checks in for the Eagles he is guarding Jr kesn mson a Cincinnati transfer big game for him in their CL in L Saturday rer tied up by post Northwestern transfer with a heath and theres a shot clock violation although BC Engineers a fast break Zachary with a bump and a foul Marcus Burton called for the foul thats great uh transition from defense to offense again great defense of possession by Boston College Matson with the pickup and then right here again I like this Jaden Zachary no Euro Im just trying to go right through you and play through contact Zachary 81 at the line he averages 12 points third on the team such a huge part of BCs success not only last year when they won 16 Games N in the league but 32 32 minutes a game and thats a big aspect of his game thats under play I think hes the heart and soul of the team again he may not be their best player in terms of point production obviously thats Quinton post but hes the leader of this team at that point guard position and he also is one of the better on ball Defenders and hes going to have a tough matchup tonight against the phenomenal freshman Marcus Burton Julian Roper with the ball as ji pops out now kesn Baseline Drive good defense creased off in the post by mcglockton here comes Zachary spin move in the lane too strong with the layup good idea by Zachary it was but I think uh nobody on the offensive glass were Boston College a runner by Bert and thats special he has such a outstanding touch and we spoke with coach shuberry at shoot around and thats really what makes him special again hes growing right in front of uh this coaching staffs eyes and thats a great undercontrol dribble drive and then thats Toof touch at the F line claudell Harris for three Eagles are cold from distance Jai has 38 rebounds in his last four games including 11 against NC State hes come along nicely for Michael Shrewsbury Burton again short mlocked in the rebound and thats a tough one again thats something hell learn o Shrewsberry talking to him again you want to get a little bit Applause more flow to your offense post and he was aggressive quit post off the bounce well I think thats again uh By Design uh they do that they try to isolate post either down low on the Block that time though they put him at the free throw line and let him go to work just BCs second made field goal in eight attempts J the back door to Roper oh he hide it and Roper was the beneficiary thats a beautiful uh read right there and again and thats execution little curl cut no communication by Boston College and thats a wide openen layup off of excellent ball movement post backing in and the rebound by Carrie Applause Music Booth OD D playing without Tay Davis whos out with a leg injury thats a big loss for them for the moment hes been their best defensive player heres TZ dis in the lane hson Burton takes it back and hes got it from distance a three for Marcus Burton and that right there heads up play by Burton Matson looked like he had a foul on Kevin J before our timeout Marcus Burton seven points Music when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks father three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one most of any kind its not bragging if its true greatness is what we do the ACC accomplished greatness with no fees or minimums and no overdraft fees banking with Capital One is the easiest decision in the history of decisions even easier than this Ill take Barkley yes I still got it I told her shed pick me first yep even easier than that with no fees or minimums and no overdraft fees is it even a decision thats banking reimagined whats in your wallet drive its what propels the Champions the comeback kids The Underdogs it means constantly improving striving hungering its no excuses no days off or no glory its Drive I wait tables but last week I built a filled hospital I stopped 1 thousand attackers and a natural disaster while I go to school full time while I work full time greater the challenge the stronger we become JD Power now ranked sleep number number one in customer satisfaction with mattresses purchased in store visit sleepnumbercom to learn more Sofi is helping me get my money right to achieve my ambitions with Sofi checking and savings I pay no account fees and earn a competitive apy Applause Applause Music the Marcus Burton show in the early stages in Chestnut Hill oh yeah hes got it going early on right here dribble drive under control jump stop jumper again hes so quick so Shifty thats a tough Runner right there in the lane and then this right here breakdown by Boston College and he has really been a guy uh that has played really well uh in his freshman campaign as you take a look at the numbers tonight seven and uh the rest of the team too and really thats been also though one of the struggles that Notre Dame has had for the season hes the only player averaging double digits now theyve had other guys that have shown some sign obviously coach Shrewsberry son uh has a freshman ACC freshman of the week of this past week but I think thats going to be a key for them as they continue to progress theyre going to need that second and third option to go along with Burton and is on the bench the season ended today is 16 points per game with rank third all time for noted aame freshman behind two of their alltime grades Adrien Dantley who averaged 18 and Troy Murphy who averaged 19 in their freshman campaigns and those two guys went on to have a pretty good NBA careers as well too yes they did as post misses a three and the four shooting continues for the Eagles so IMS is in the ball game in the back court for Notre Dame also off their bench I mentioned the injury to Tay Davis he is now in the game so thats a pleasant development for Micah Shrewsberry Davis made 16 starts kzne to J and a foul so they dump it in on a double team of the post and thats great recognition right now Boston College again Burton has been the guy hes on the bench right now but this is really a double team the rotation is late and thats really a tough position to put Chaz Kelly in right there trying to defend the big couldnt do anything but foul Kellys the backup BC point guard who strangely plays better on the road than he does at home made three starts hes averaging Four Points n 11 Steels which is the top five number on the team but I bet you probably didnt meet many players throughout your career that played better on the road than they at home well theyre going to need him tonight and again obviously a huge contributor as a rotation guy off the bench and now in place for Jaden Zachary and certainly coach Grant and staff know hes capable had some flashes last year where he put up some pretty big numbers so Kelly stol the game after the foul with Matson Donald hand or money mdy and Deon mton post on the bench for a moment Mighty coming off the stomach flu for Kelly trying to shake IMS a three for Matson hes got it Mason Matson 49 Tops on the team from three thats his 23rd three of the year what a beautiful find by Chaz Kelly and again a breakdown by Notre Dame you cannot leave Matson open 45 from the threepoint line beautiful offense by Boston College kesi ran into some dribbling issues but the last Matson three was effective yeah right here this is all set up great read by Taz Kelly beautiful crosscourt diagonal pass and again thats part of knowing The Scouting Report thats a breakdown you cannot leave Matson alone on the threepoint line again well over 40 from three excellent identification and recognition by Chaz Kelly minute and a half on the bench for Marcus Burton hes back in Applause Eagles deliberate Ro Grant said he wants a leak communication and that will help their cause with Mason Matson his fifth point of the game well hes been playing well for Earl Grant Off the Bench and those are two huge buckets one of three and then thats off the bounce B Matson what does BC have to do defensively to stifle Notre D well right here keep this guy out of the paint thats a great double Applause ims now Burton with five to shoot too strong with the three Mighty the board both teams deliberate offensively heres Kelly whipping it to mton theyll take that look though again thats a nice dribble drive and kick Bren Shrewsberry ACC rookie of the week hes in red hot he had 25 against Georgia Tech and their overtime win Tuesday well when we coach talk with Coach about his son he said he does not lack confidence and that right there a deep three and he has been playing really well for then last four games hes hit 12 threes and 25 attempts M glockton to Kelly a steel by Burton he got hounded by Marcus Burton not only a strong offensive player but very Adept defensively zone of the three a rare three for the Bley Mata so six straight points for the Irish and what a little rub screen that time by Burton he hadit dribble hand off but then he set a little screen afterwards to give Zona a little bit more space heads up play by The Freshman point guard rebound Tracked Down by Donald H and hes got it through cont hands been inconsistent coming back from a Tor ACL last year but well done thats a big time finish through contact that time by hand his father with a star at Virginia Tay Davis the take runs into a double team and he is fouled ear a three show yeah great execution offensively right here Braden shuberry with the Deep three Notre Dame up to early as a small business owner you learn to wear a lot of hats Auto Owners takes care of your business insurance so you can take care of everything else thats simple human

spoke with Coach shrewbury about you know his uh dealings with coaching his son and he said look I treat him like any other player when were in the confines of practice games breaking down film uh but Ive talked to other guys uh guys in the industry that have had to coach their uh Sons guys like Ron Hunter Ron Hunter Jr and uh Co coach Fran mcaffrey and he said look weve created this space where when hes home we dont talk about Hoots Im just Dad and dealing with all the other things and certainly its an interesting Dynamic when youre coaching at this high level and your son is playing at this level as well too and I think theyve managed that as well as anybody possibly could two misses at the line no Dame at the line has struggled their last five games they were three for 11 against Florida State their eight point loss Saturday fou is on mton before the timeout as post hits the floor looks like he got hit in the mouth plat Harris Charleston Southern transfer and the board for J Notre Dame as caral its 12th rebound BC has eight but post is shaken up well both teams run a lot of dribble handoff and actions and thats something coach Grant talked about we must have great communication on all their dribble handoffs and pin down actions chai on a lead Bay Skips a pass for Shrewsbury couldnt handle it elbow for Quinton post as hes got blood yeah and thats when were again lets see o yeah definitely and thats and the back referee I think was blocked out but yeah he definitely took a shot hes bleeding pretty good theyre going to have to get him out of the game and hes saying I was elbowed they didnt notice the Applause infraction so Quint post will have to grab a seat NL Grant will get an explanation here heres our next Super Tuesday double header coming up tomorrow night number six Tennessee host Florida in Knoxville at 7 Eastern thats and Hunter Dickinson at number three Kansas take on Oklahoma State and Stillwater both games on ESPN and the ESPN app well conversation right now uh coach Grant is having a conversation and trying to understand what the conversation is obviously coach Grant staff are not happy felt like that should have been reviewed that was Kevin ji who elbowed Quint Music post post has been such a force in his 65 games at BC since coming from Mississippi state that 50 40 80 stat line which is elusive in college basketball thats 50 from the field 40 from three 80 from the line one of two players in the nation with it the other guys KJ Simpson Colorado yeah and Coach Grant and his staff deserve a lot of credit again when he transferred in not many people thought he would turn into one of the better players not just in ACC but in college basketball but he has done that and they deserve a lot of credit and right there great ball movement of that time after the delay Jaden Zachary 29 from three an aspect of his game that he wants to improve and a foul on BC thats o quit post you cant ask for a better ball movement right here again guadal Harris draw two Defenders extra pass by a league b to Jaden Zachary and thats one of their best offensive possessions of this game right here ball went left to right and the end result a wide openen three from the corner thats when theyre most effective on offense right when they move it left to right and thats something coach Grant talked about again dribble drives get the ball into the paint break the defense down and then go from there Carri Booth J another rebound shrewbury from distance hes got it Bren Shrewsberry with six points off his father miks bench theres already been six lead changes yeah and thats another deep one he is shooting lights out right now you talked about got it over his last four games hes really been balling for Notre Dame Harris off the line trying to find his offensive Rhythm Burton started fast has been quiet heres rer guarded by Zachary Eagles manto man Burton takes post right on Q I said he was quiet you know hell heat up well again that right there thats a mismatch they had Quinton post out on him thats just an easy isolation and or one of the more quick guards against the sevenfooter hes going to win out in that situation anytime Cody names plus six on the glass Harris from 15 well hes had a tough time finding his Lane and that right there probably not a good one had Jaden Zachary posted up against Burton three is good for Julian Roper the Northwestern transfer and noted aim is redot the defending the threepoint line that was another key when we spoke with uh coach Grant of Boston College he said look we cannot get break broken down and give up uncontested threes Prince El League Bay too strong noted aame an8 to nothing run DC opponents shooting 36 from three eight per game Allowed by The Eagles Shrewsberry eyes it cant buy this one with the rebound track down good Hustle by Carrie Applause Booth Shrewsberry with the elbow Burton thought about it a double and a foul so noted a heating up from distance theyve

the key in this one right now now 56 from the threepoint line and I think problematic for BC is how open they are again these are clean looks this one right here excellent ball movement late on the close out and if you look at the numbers a Notre Dame uh coming into this game uh statistically has not shot the ball well their last in the ACC but tonight theyre 56 I think a big reason why theyre getting open looks Bradon Shrewsberry with six points off the the bench Burton has nine Roper has four Eagles led by Jaden Zachary and Mason madsons Five Point each but that eight to nothing run as sty BC in the last two minutes and 40 seconds keev ji heres Carrie booth and watch how the Notre Dame players shot fake and ball fake that time again a Gamble and they make you pay thats something uh the coaching staff will Boston College was concerned about Boston College staying down on the ball fakes and shot fakes staying sound in your discipline defensively you cant get broken down like that Marcus Burton 11 straight games in double figures Music we theres a reason why he scored over 2000 points in high school the runner by Zachary stops the 10 to nothing run yeah thats a tough one and much needed bucket right there by by Jaden Zachary this end right here though again theyre going to have to cut down on the dribble drives not let their be defense get collapsed Burton inting from every quadrant what a shot and that right there though is on of The Bigs and wings of BC theyre doing dribble handoffs you got to Blitz him or come out and show and slow him down hes coming off too clean on some of these pin downs and screens Harris still scoreless you think hes played by an ankle injury Applause yeah that right there does not look like he has the same lift on the other end Everything clean for Notre Dame because of this guy right here as Madson takes the three on the break quick trigger problematic not a bad one again youre shooting 45 from the threepoint line youre wide open in transition maybe though three on two you try to work it down but again he has been shooting the ball pretty well Jr kesn hes from Southbend play at St Joseph High School rer rebound tapped to Quinton post Eagles shooting 30 they have made three threes and six attempts Harris still searching for his first bucket there a tendency to press right three Booth you got it largest lead of the night for Notre Dame 12point Advantage Carrie boo we saw him with 17 against Virginia but this was pretty all set up uh by The Freshman point guard Marcus Burton simple basketball dribble Drive

time West Coast game has number 12 Arizona hosting USC at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific on ESPN last play kind of typifies the night for not to a Malcolm and I think the growth of Marcus Burton right here again he could have easily tried to pull up for himself but I think hes starting to understand the point guard position yes you know he can score leads all freshman in the ACC in points per game but I think his decision making thats part of the growth and right there thats a great read dribble Drive kick it out to your teammate for a wide open look Chaz Kelly in the post two post another high percentage shot missed by The Eagles I like that though again offense by Boston College youre not settling for a jumper try to get the ball into the paint off a post touch or dribble drive and then go from there just unable to convert youc one for its last eight from the field its a 15 to two Notre Dame run and a tie up jump ball with the possession out for Notre Applause Dame heres this weeks NBA Wednesday matchups Giannis and the Bucks are in Cleveland to take on Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs at 730 Easter on Espen and LeBron and Lakers host the Mavs that will be on eight ABC at 830 Eastern 530 Pacific NBA Countdown tips off theight at 7 on ESPN watch every time a Notre Dame P catches the ball they square up shot fake that time they let it fly but again they do an excellent job of making you defend everything every cut and anytime they have the ball Jr kesn is scoreless the averag is n and a half points thats second on the team behind Burton Zachary for it but coming up with a roll sometimes it takes that doesnt it and I like that though again Jaden Zachary using his size try to get Burton into the paint and play from there Zachary has nine to lead BC Burton cant track it down what happened right there again that great defense Zachary and also Chaz Kelly they switch and then this play right here again Jaden Zachary using his size play through contact and one he thought but again defensively the big thing was of the communication Zachary again with contact and an n one Zacharys in double figures with 11 hes a little extra emphasis after the shot was made well Marcus Burton can beat him with his quickness right here though Zachary much stronger player again right here and one and he has been aggressive attacking the paint I like that offense by Boston College again let Zachary use his size advantage against Burton getting into the paint off of a post or a drive so BC with five quick points the trail by seven its the second foul on Marcus Applause Burton and a foul on the Eagles lets talk quick post second on the seven footer from Applause Amsterdam right here again Notre Dame does a great job doing a lot of their dribble handoffs again couldnt see what the call was from that angle look like that might have been on Matson yeah again thats a tough break for Boston College and now post on the bench Shrewsberry hesitation but hes having that type of night he has eight points you have to stay down on the shot FAS again shot fake you go for it he goes right by you but they do a great job shot faking getting you up in the air and thats an easy bucket that time by Shrewsberry the ACC rookie of the week is combined with Marcus Burke for 21 M Lockton took the three and rer has the rebound HEC shooting 32 they being outrebounded Applause 211 extra muscle by Notre Dame maybe a factor Malcolm in the shoo around we saw earlier Notre Dame had Supreme energy and Burton had his man in the air again with a shot fake DC needs a timeout so maybe energy brought something to noted Dame in the shooter around he will take a timeout coming right back in 30 seconds not game up by 11 when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks B three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one most of any kind its not bragging if the true greatness is what we do the ACC AC 6 seconds to change until halftime malol and Notre Dame has had the lead for 11 minutes during the half and theyve been the more energetic team right now but I think also how theyve run their offense big reason why uh Boston Colleges inability to keep Marcus Burton out of the paint again hes done a masterful job breaking them down right now hes got 15 points hes got two assists zero turnovers but a lot of it is hes just getting into the paint and scoring for himself or kicking out and then guys are going from there thats got to change for Boston PGE on the other end Boston College really again has struggled uh with the exception of Jaden Zachary the only person in double digits with 12 points everyone else really has struggled and again Earl Grant going over his defense and what he wants for this last offensive possession maybe the effects of the stomach flu are still still prevalent post has two points three rebounds in 15 minutes three players down missed the Clemson game of the stomach flu post El League Bay and Applause mighty added two seconds Here Comes Zachary across the timeline cut off on the double team finds claudell Harris who scoreless the glockton industrious off the offensive glass and it pays off with the foul and thats something hes done really well for Earl Grant hes rebounded the ball in particular on the offensive glass right here great job blocking out and then trying to come up with the offensive rebound again a lot of guys wont do that on the offensive glass you typically see that defensive rebounding that time he blocked out on the offensive glass the gain position great job by mlock De mlock did top 10 score in the ACC five ACC games 16 points eight rebounds how about the career high 30 against Georgia Tech thats the most points in the league against an ACC opponent yeah and I think the big thing with him he shot the ball well but also hes rebounded if you look at his last five games in the ACC eight rebounds per game hes done a great job on the defensive and offensive glass one of the most improved players in the league is especially on the offensive end this BCs second offensive rebound before the foul on carry boo Dame killing some clock with Tay Davis wild shot but a foul thats on Deon mcglockton well Notre Dame right here again this is a great job just attacking the paint straight manto man that time uh just kind of bullying his way down the lane on Chaz Kelly yeah that time mlon with the body second on mton with Tay Davis at the line its been an adventure for Davis at the free throw line 63 hes averaging 83 points tied for third in the team his his strength is rebounding and defense he usually guards the opponents best play yeah and I really like how he has played in this again guys know and accepting their role huge Ando now for him to try to push this thing to 11 Boston College on the other end 179 seconds to go got a chance to try to cut this thing to single digits before you go into the half shot clocked off and a foul on IMS first off Logan Imes played in 15 games 16 minutes off the bench two points two rebounds with 8 seconds left 10point deficit for BC Booth to the bench placed by Kev J Mason Matson inbounding to Chaz Kelly deep three Mason Matson has got it giving BC some moment momentum in beating the clock again another breakdown first five minutes is going to be key for this one for Boston College they must match the energy that Notre Dame had in that first half the second lowest scoring output for BC and a half this year previous was Syracuse and the Eagles had sled pole three by post Off the Mark rebound to Carri boot Syracuse game you called it they were down 289 at the Dome end up losing by 10 yeah they made a valiant effort to come back they actually took the lead who had about four or five minutes to go in that second half but then just ran out of Music gas Boo has a career high 10 rebounds for the Irish tie up by zacher as Booth comes away with it here comes Prince Elite Bay with good hustle and it will be BC ball great hustle play that time both a leag bay and Zachary called a foul on Kevin John yeah again that time a loose ball 5050 ball right here Zachary thought he was going to come up with a steel scramble situation but good Applause recovery Zachary takes the jumper and Nails it Jaden Zachary confident shooter he has 14 points he to spoke to Micah Shrewsberry during the shooter out he had a great line he said confidence is one heck of a drug it really is and they needed them everybody else struggling Jaden Zachary Still Remains the only BC Player in double digits he and Marcus Bert have a nice little battle going on Julian rer doubled by El Bay and mcglockton 3 seconds to Applause shoot and mton comes away with it so the e cut it to five they Trail by as many as 12 with 333 remaining in the first half Zachary knifing through the defense theyre having trouble stying him and thats the play right there that has been effective curl Cuts get Zachary in the lane let him use his strong frame against a smaller Burton and a steal claudell Harris scoreless and still scoreless a foul on noted a but Harris been overzealous on the attempt and it is getting chippy they are chirping both teams right here though Jaden Zachary a great read off the ball screen side ball screen there and then anticipation right here get into the paint and finish but the last play again right here Bell her has felt like uh he had had his legs taken out from underneath him theyre going to take a look at it to see and I didnt think there was much there from that angle looked like he was going up for a dunk now again gladell Harris immediately turned and said something to Bradens Shrewsberry thats the first foul on Braden Shrewsberry take another look and again now again you couldnt see the bottom half not like he grabbed he just kind of put his hands on him now again he got the hand on him but nothing egregious yeah as the official review is ongoing Bert Smith Henderson Tommy marsy the officiating crew now the only thing that they could potentially be looking at is if there was a shove and and again if a persons up in the air and you shove them I dont care if its a little tap or not certainly its a dangerous play and theyre giving both coaches explanation of what happened somebodys going to walk away unhappy common foul Two Shots two shots for BC foul on Shrewsberry with claudell Harris at the line what happened on the attempt by Harris was he just out of control I I think he just again hes still a little hobbled from the high ankle sprain doesnt have quite the lift that hes normally has he was going up to that and take the rim off not able to lift the way he did and I think just the contact alone really bothering them but again I think the call is right by the referees nothing more than a common foul again didnt grab them really not a heavy push first two points of the game for Harris hes averaging 16 a night shooting 49 BC riding a nine to nothing run and batted Away by Zachary took it away from Burton strong towards the hoop no foul Zachary out of control yeah that one right there hed like to have back but hes been physical with the Freshman point guard and again I think thats what you have to do its been too comfortable for him thus far in this game Jaden Zachary trying to get up and bother him be a little bit more physical Burton an awkward moment for him underneath the basket will be BC Applause ball and right here again Zachary trying to get up in his space and right here hes trying to go into him but Burton does a good job pulling Applause away Dame is Led for 15 minutes you seal the chance to grab the lead on this possession Zachary backing in on Marcus Burton and he lost it to two straight empty possessions well I like what theyre doing though again theyre just trying to isolate Zachary on the Block right here though again good defense by Jaden Zachary and this I think the energy uh really has been matched by Boston College they were more physical Team Notre Dame in that first half kesi mton in the open floor and he ran into Applause contact thats how Marcus Burton is third well John you talked about this and we talked about it coming into this one Notre Dames energy to start this first half off I think really was the difference that has changed in the second half now Boston College has matched that energy and a big reason why uh theyre at the free throw line with an opportunity to take and retake the lead you see8 for eight at the line mton ties it Applause up second tie of the night Logan Imes in the Notre Dame lineup for Michael Shrewsberry replacing Marcus Burton Burton exits with 15 points three fouls and three rebounds and thats hugee the three fouls we will watch that how this offense runs of Notre Dame with Burton on the bench he really has been the Catalyst for a lot of open looks shrew Barrys got it Bron Shrewsberry is in double figures the ACC rookie of the week and I really like his body control again hes got a strong frame and thats a great pullup jumper that time under control of by Braden Zack excuse me Braden Shrewsberry Harris dumps it in for post and the slam Quinton post his first dunk of the night nine lead changes DC hadnt LED before this last twominute sequence last time it was BC in the lead was 12 to 10 shwb boy hes got a pretty shot I mean footwork on point thats two backto back pullup jumpers by Shrewsberry and uh you can tell that footwork uh has been worked on right there nice little reverse pivot turnaround Zachary the lob too much and out of bounds its Notre Dame Ball but Quint post with an exclamation point malcol well its been back and forth right here Claude Al Harris with the nice find for Quenton post uh we got a onepoint ball game in Chestnut Hill when youre great your game does the talk in the ACC our speaks Vol three of the last eight NCAA championships 99 NCAA tournament wins since 2015 eight NCAA titles in the last 22 years six of the top 30 winning his programs in division one most of any its not bragging if its

Applause Music she has it she has it hey its me your skin help me maintain my moisture balance with sahy hydrating cleanser nice night for Jaden Zachary has 16 points and I think the big thing his defense on Marcus BT he has tired him out offensively hes made him chase him off screens right here using his physical frame to put him in the paint but I think its been his defense look in the first half it was all Marcus Burton he was comfortable he was running the offense he was setting himself up for looks and his teammates he had 15 points in the first half he has zero in the second big reason why Jaden Zacharys defense on him and I like what Boston College is doing theyre attacking him on the defensive side Marcus Burton Zachary season High 21 points at the Citadel in a VC win five points away from tying that he leads all scores in the game of those 16 raen Shrewsberry and a steal by claudell Harris on Imes Nifty dribbly he converts and thats why it hurts not having Marcus Burton in the game again theyre just pressuring IM right now and theyre trying to force turnovers on him the question mark now is how long does coach ruberry stay with Marcus Burton on the bench good change up by Errol Grant with pressure Applause defense Kevin ji for Logan Applause HS four to shoot and a foul L to the Chagrin of platell Harris thats his Music first well right here again the pressure anticipates by Claude Al Harris and again the Finish thats been uh really the story in this and right here and looked like he was in pretty good position right there I think its more referees may have thought he sold it a little bit but somebody was going to walk away unhappy on that call you never sold it did you no never was a big flop guy I heard that about you Eagles have 14 points off of seven Notre Dame turnovers Burton frustrated again the waning seconds of the shot clock down the four to shoot for kesn whos scoreless but pinned by post kesi grabs the loose ball car booth and hes got it boy hes got to handle like a guard at times yeah thats tough move right there great length and body control that time showing off great touch youre absolutely Applause right post guarded by ji Zachary from the elbow give him Music 18 there we go well they continue to go at Burton again those three fouls theyre going to continue to test Applause him Burton trying to take it all the way but out of bounds BC ball eagle out scored Notre Name by eight in the first 6 and 12 minutes of the half that tells a huge story foul trouble and then again a credit Jaden Zachary uh he took on the challenge again that was a problem they could not contain Marcus Burton in that first half Burton 11 straight games in double figures coming off a 20point game against Florida State and a foul its on Logan Imes he Applause second you see ball movement much better as the game has worn on whereas Notre Dames been scratching on the defensive end yeah and I think a big reason why theyve gotten some easy ones 14 points off of turnovers end this game to three for Notre Dame but Boston C has done a nice job getting in transition uh with their defense Kelly trying to navigate Harris no good did he force it yeah claudell here hes taking some tough ones again hes been a guy that been able to hit those but its not going tonight Id rather play if youre Earl Grant go through Quinton post give him a touch Steel by Mason Madson nine turnovers for the Irish post onai oh he was the determined didnt fall but hes fouled and that expression says it all by post that one did everything but bounce down again well thats the play if youre Boston College let Quinton post get a touch play through him if they dont double let him operate almost an and one situation right there a donut against Syracuse 0 for four from the field he did fou out at the dome in the BC 10point loss last week asz he hits foul was on Kevin ji is third but anytime FR post is scoreless only the second time in his career yeah and give J credit as well too again qu post when we spoke with Coach ruseberry as Sho around he said look hes one of the best players in college basketball not just of the ACC hes a tough matchup and right now starting to heat up a little bit but uh for the most part in this game Giants done a nice job keeping post under control Eagles have led for 8 minutes 13 lead changes chai guarded by post the take Booth three rebound fought four one by the Northwestern transfer Julian roer and thats the key word one you got to fight for those 5050 balls thats a great job coming up with an extra possession excellent Hustle by rer and the Eagles whistle for a foul its on Chaz Kelly second Eagles backup point guard hell be important for BC is B Grant says this is the end of round one in the ACC this will be the fifth ACCC game they play four rounds with 20 leag games yeah absolutely huge for obviously both teams but Boston C particular at home er gr said look we have to establish a being a tough team to beat at home hot pass and J could not handle it so 10 turnovers for Notre Dame the eagles with a threepoint lead come on back to Chestnut Hill after Applause this if you love to travel

anytime youre in the building John meell right now though we got a great battle going on against Notre Dame vers Boston College and right now I think for Notre Dame you need to get a stop I think for Boston College continue to play through this guy right here Quinton post post over for three on threes and held to six points rugged defense by Notre Dame thats their trademark teams struggle to score more than 60 they have not allowed a 70point game since they lost to Georgetown in overtime on December 16th thats a stretch of seven straight DC ball after the misfire by Braden Shrewsberry so that gives you an idea of how tough their defense can be yeah the Improvement really has been uh phenomenal under coach shuberry again statistically theyre one of the best teams defensively in the ACC and they do a great job making it difficult for you to score Eagles have matched their largest lead of the game with three Donald hand and the rebound for Kev Applause ji ji has eight rebounds booth has has 11 and John in the first half Notre Dame was not doubling post that time of a double post now again if youre Boston cou I still like that play through post let him go through the double team get him a touch every offensive possession and into a double and an n one opportunity Donald hand DC was hoping for some offense from him off their bench throughout the year hes done it times last couple games have been a rough run for him but thats an aggressive play yeah and you can tell that and he starting to get healthier again last season again only played two regular season games tore his ACL and came back and uh when we speak with the coaching staff about him again they dont want him to try to do too much hes still a guy that did not play all of last year so again getting his legs back underneath him but again hes another guy in the rot that Earl Grant and staff expect big things from so BC with his largest lead they were down by seven and half time odan scoring drought is 335 T Davis on post now kesn eyeing his first three of the game hes got it Jr kesn when he gets hot look out and thats a breakdown uh Mason Matson again you got to understand The Scouting Report thats a wideopen three earol Grant going to quickly go to his bench but again he said we must limit those open looks for Notre Music Applause Dame and good defense by the Irish Here Comes Burton behind the back balls on a string what a move and a block by mton boy he did the hard part but M Lockton with a weak side block Madson and the rebound post eyes the three cant buy it Roper the board again this post one you dont mind cuz its wide open the mats in one quick again you have the momentum no need for a quick contested three Applause Music agreed Burton scoring in the second half he averages eight second half Applause points andne and before the shot a foul its on Donald Han this right here again great Notre Dame defense and then on the other end marus you take a look at some pretty decent ball Movement by Notre Dame again thats a breakdown by Matson keski was quiet in this game thus far but again he gets a wide open look in the corner off the defensive Applause breakdown we saw him singlehandedly beat Virginia in the first half on December 30th Jr KES at 12 straight points they were LED in that game by Carrie Bo 17 heres a three by kesi again as advertised hes a oneman run and Coach Errol Grant talked about our communication need to be on point simple pin down screen miscommunication by Boston College uh they dont switch nobody hges and he gets another wide open look Bell Harris forced it hes had a tough night 14 lead changes BC had led by Applause five Burton gets by Zachary but falls down and a travel thats the the 11 Irish turnover right here again no communication you have two guys there its a simple pin down one guys should be locking and trailing the big should be out helping they both get crossed Applause up again they need to figure that out the communication again Notre Dame a team that runs a lot of pin Downs dribble handoffs Zachary got it Jaden Zachary continues 8 for 10 from the field he has 20 points to lead all scores well his pullup

screen coverage the big that time Zona has to step up show hard slow down Jaden Zachary to give IMS and Burton room to get back over to slow Jaden Zachary down excellent analysis Applause good idea though good job by our crew too in the camera work good idea of how difficult a guard Jaden Zachary is on the defensive end to slow him down well a lot of times its not the person defending the ball its all about how your bigs come out slide and slow the ball down lets see how they adjust right here again Marcus Burton on Jaden Zachary so another lead chain Topsy Turvy game 16 lead changes Prince El League Bay to Donald Han Quinton post claudell Harris three no haris quiet with four points one for 12 from the field same thing on this end again how they defend ball screens with Mar Marcus Burton this time Skips a pass to Roper over the top wow what a board and ann1 Tay Davis Applause determined foul on a league Bay thats just pure hustle and determination thats a big time offensive

thats two missed opportunities uh from the free throw line Burton still scoreless the second half hes stuck on 15 Applause points adson takes it put back no Eagles are errant on many high percentage shots and thats huge part of why theyre trailing by four yeah that right there again put back opportunity by Matson just short armed I think thats fatigue right there both these teams battling defensively and its hot in here too not outside at 25° Matson the foul on Burton thats his first right here again uh good for Matson not to give up the bucket but again that time you got to understand you got to keep Burton out of the paint easier said than done to switch off and Burton recognizes and goes right at Matson Two Shots from Marcus Burton Indiana Mr basketball last year playing out of Mishawaka just down the road from Notre Dame as Matson heads to the BC bench Chaz Kelly in Eagles will play Kelly Harris and Zachary in the back cour with post and M Lockton up front sixpoint Irish

Zachary the bump on Shrewsberry post hell make that nine out of 10 and thats all set up Jaden Zack three again heads up play attack the Baseline collapse the defense nice little dump off pass Burton

shoot a three thats a tough match up for opposing bigs and Boston College has used him a a lot of their actions pin Downs dribble handoffs and then had him pop back up to the threepoint line8 to nothing run for BC all the points scored by that man Quinton post Jr kesn at the line after the foul was on post MRE Dame scoring Dr 202 kesn with his seven second half point scoreless in the first half hes Malcolm hucker Im John me Perell hope youve enjoyed the ride happy MLK and thanks for spending part up with us on Applause ESPNU game tied again for the fourth time L Dame is Led for 21 minutes and 30 seconds BC 1248 po doubled soft touch but no good Julian rer has it whats the focal point on offense for not today right here this guy again put him in a high ball screen let him go make a play Burton with just two second half points 17 overall Kevin J has been a force on the boards he has nine Burton forc the pass stolen by post 12th turnover for the Irish thats not a bad uh look that time Burton almost threaded the needle right there it was on Ds hand just unable to bring it in you see conversely is just three turnovers they had 22 last week against Syracuse post the turnaround good look didnt fall yeah just short that time again got a pretty good look but again I like the establishment of Boston College going to post let him get a touch play through him Burton trying to shake the defender and Chaz Kelly is called for the foul third on Kelly and again its so tough again that time he rejects the ball screen and hes so Shifty nor Dame has missed four free throws as a team they shoot Applause 71 one of one ribs out Music three timeouts remaining for both teams Harris Off the Mark that type of knife for him hes 1 for 13 yeah and thats a clean look that one you dont mind yep great set play he came off wide open just doesnt have the lift in that ankle 80 seconds left in regulation Burton eying the shot clock its down to eight guarded by Harris the take and a turnover perhaps remains Notre Dame ball I think theyre going to go take a look at it yep and great help defense that time by Jaden Zachary to almost it looks like come up again he helps off that time again tough to tell from that angle but a great Gap defense that time by Jaden Zachary Zacharys two points away from establishing his career high in points he has 20 between Zachary and post they have 34 of the 57 BC points and I think the biggest uh contribution for Zachary besides the 20 points holding Marcus Burt the two points in the second half again right here this is a better angle yeah again lets see again that hes trying to yeah that looks like that might be Boston College ball from that angle like might have been a foul on Zachary definitely looked like a foul uh but if they dont call it a foul then certainly it looks like Burton is making a passing motion out and it would be off of him Bert Smith Tony Henderson Tommy marsy the officiating crew the both teams with 69 seconds to contemplate whats next our game summary with Burton going off in the first half Notre Dame efficient from three BC has misfired 11 times but the largest leads havent really mattered because both teams have had a counter pun effect it really has been a slugfest and and a now changed that call uh to Boston College ball so again thats a huge break but thats all set up by uh Jaden Zachary heads up play again helping off Burton hat Harris beat Zachary steps in comes up with the turnover all right so BC ball in a tie game Eagles have lost three of four they are six and2 at home Notre Dame 1 and three away from South Ben M Lockton poops out on tay Davis Zachary at the Applause logo post deep got it Quinton post have yourself a second Applause half and timeout noted a three three

offensive foul on Jr kesn Eagles cranking up the defensive intensity KN and thats twice now Jaden Zachary has stepped in great helps side defense again right here lets see if he got there in time I I mean you could have probably called it travel before as well but nonetheless player control uh but again its all set up Jaden Zachary stepping in the the lane that time and thats twice and a 30 everything we build is from the ground up every great idea every crazy idea every next idea everything you see everything you feel when you drive it we put everything we have into our our trucks so you get everything out of them Ram trucks are what we do during the ram start something new Sales Event get 4500 cash allowance on the purchase of virtually all 2024 Ram 1500 trucks so the Eagles trying for their second league win Notre Dame has two ACC wins but quit post has been the story yeah really right here great screen action Quinton post again sevenfooter steps out quick release another big time bucket to put Boston College up three and then right now to close this game out for Boston College its going to come down to free throw shooting 24 seconds left they have to inbound the ball Kelly to Zachary almost CED it up and a foul benby hounding claudell Harris do you like that idea of the design of the play yeah again A lot of times teams run a home run Run play they choose to bring Zachary up now thats a dangerous pass again I dont like that design only because theyre coming to the corner they got to break that time a good a body control that time by Jaden Zachary to hold off the defender I think theyre going to have to change that up though if they have to inbound again underneath DC has missed four free throws and Harris cant buy anything hes held to Four Points one for from the field 0 for three from three two for four from the line and I think this is the key one right here to make it a twopossession game troubles at the line during ACC play 65 thats a big one for Claud L Harris both teams have two timeouts to the rack Marcus Burton and a foul Marcus Burton is awake thats his second bucket in the half and thats all set up though Chas Kelly again you cannot let just Marcus Burton Blow by you like that again youre backpedaling you got to back up a little bit if youre not going to keep him in front of you and then inexplicably uh Quinton post files him again if hes going to give up a two thats fine or if youre going to foul him make sure he does not get a shot off fourth foul on Applause post timeout B Marcus berland 195 and three so cerebral doesnt play like a freshman its a cliche theyre a couple guys like that in college basketball but hes right at the top of the list really and again I think in this game joh we talked about this holding home court so difficult to win on the road Boston College has lost close games at home Wake Forest and NC State now another one at home against Notre Dame going down to the wire can they close this one out and they have a North Carolina encounter and a soldout county form on Saturday afternoon then they go to Virginia Tech at Notre Dame again in Syracuse back home in Chestnut Hill followed by Florida State so its all about league play Ear Grant said were at the end of round one five lead games of the book after tonight Notre Dame with Miami coming up they have eight days off now this is a rare Saturday Monday swing for both teams Michael Shrewsbury wasnt happy about that Saturday Monday thing that went on the last couple days yeah really again and obviously uh coaches like consistency uh but again obviously uh some road games uh for them but I think uh the big thing for this young Notre Dame team Ive been impressed their defense thats the one thing that uh they have done well theyve been consistent and statistically again uh one of the top teams in the ACC defensively and thats kept them in games and no different from tonight they havent played Saturday Monday Malcolm since 2022 thats the quirk in the schedule and the Miss by Burton rebound theyll alive Michael Shrewsbury takes a timeout 117 left one possession game Notre Dame ball youc could not get the loose ball rebound little things 5050 balls hustle plays again you have to get this rebound if youre Boston College a great play that time by Notre Dame to keep it alive and now they have a chance to tie or win this game but again theres three Boston College players standing around when the story is written not Dame wins this game theyre going to look at rebounding and they have a plus 16 Edge 43 to 27 theres your game reset good timeout decision by Shrewsberry right absolutely with the young team again you want to make sure you get a good play again you dont need a three nope in this situation obviously uh you dont want to go too late because obviously if you miss but you want to give yourself enough time to foul on the other end Boston College youre going to have to communicate on any ball screens if youre going to Blitz Marcus Burton uh meaning youre going to trap him your backend rotation must be on point you cannot allow him though to just do what he did on the previous play which was drive right down the lane uncontested and then get a and one not aame and BC swapping Haymakers the 12point lead for noted Dame the fivepoint lead for BC Zacharys been scoreless the last 3 minutes or so but hes been very good on the defensive end as well Burton coming up large when they needed the most 12 straight games double figures for him kesn will inbound kesn Burton Shrewsberry booth and Imes on the floor for the Irish mton Kelly Zachary post and Harris for BC KES inbounding to boot the three in and out Kelly the rebound the open three for Carrie boo foul on Notre Dame with 79 left to regulation tough to pass up an open three you cant ask for a better look right again a beautifully uh designed play right here a post lost contact with booth and thats a clean look that thing was in and out again post went over to help and Coach Roseberry clapping his team on again you cant ask for a better look than that right there huge shot for Chaz Kelly three point Point BC lead first point of the night for Kelly Guard from Houston Earl Grant sweating it out fourpoint BC lead ding here do not foul if youre Boston College slow the ball down but do not foul Burton to Shrewsbury takes the three no Booth got it but thats going to Mak it a twopoint game see what happens here will there be more time left well I think they might have called the foul I think they did on claudell Harris and if they did inexcusable again no need to foul in that situation even if he puts the twopointer back in youre still up one and again I think he might have fouled him with some time left on again post blocked it right there again thats tough M maybe again not sure if theres going to be any clicks but again if youre claw Al Harris theres no need for you to even try to go up and attempt to block that yeah thats a Applause foul looked like it certainly was but the ball game is over as Notre Dame Falls to BC for the third straight time the Eagles
