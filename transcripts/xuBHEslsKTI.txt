State fell to Clemson Chase Hunter 25 points in that one well Im excited because this is a kind of a contrasting style uh Florida State wants to get inside and drive the basketball pit likes to pull up and take some threes and space the floor pit in the blocks Florida State and the goals cam cor former null back in his former stopping grounds wins the tip heres Jen low one of the best players in the ACC turnover creative ball picked up by dayquan Davis outstanding freshman Watkins in a starting five alongside Jackson Davis Bowen and Yan heres Jackson veteran launches back iron no good the students starting to fill in here at the tuck to our left could be Rowdy after all tonight at the tuck done leg it low Corin Austin the five on the drive block shot hes got it pushing it up into the front Court here is Jamir Watkins Davis mid J pulls that one rattles out rebound clean by Coury Pittsburgh is trying to run their offense nobody in the last two years has been successfully been able to run their offense against this Florida State team because theyre big they switch and they just take you out of what you want to do most teams just play basketball against them and space the floor this is what Florida State wants to do they want to run wow three straight shots rattled off the rim for the noes they want to get out into transition pit theyll pick their spots to attack Florida stayes pressure but they want to play an efficient half court offensive game yeah but they also like to get easy shots for for dun and for L legged and right now theyve got Dunn handling the ball as opposed to low duns a little bigger stronger this guy can really stroke it over his last seven Applause games you and is fouls Applause Music I cant heres Yan at the free throw line first free throw rattles home for you and the 611 junr from lawrenville Georgia he is so efficient when he catches the ball he either takes it hard the basket or he delivers it to a teammate for an easier shot and this is the start Florida State wanted to get off to at being here at home joining you here on ESPNU for Florida State leads to nothing another turnover thanks to Jay alter Rand tilis how about the hokes coming all the way back hi ho attemps this has been a frenetic Pace to start between the noes and the Panthers leot fouled on the drive and ish leet ishma leot is Senor see if they call it two shots he was in the a it looked like of getting to the basket and as leg it goes to the line coach what do you want to see from both of these teams well I think the key thing I want to see out of Pittsburgh is offensively how are they going to operate are they going to try to come and run their offense or are they just going to kind of space the floor use ball screens and get downhill and attack the rim for Florida State I think theyre doing exactly what we talked about I think they want to come up I think they want to run some really good half court offense I think they want to throw the ball into ying and then play off of him y whos been leading Florida state with 18 points per game in conference play and no fallen into Clemson over the weekend Ying scoring but he also distributes the ball and makes the defense collapse which gives guys easier looks Watkins three ball in the Nos leag and thats the guy they have to get going and they need Mr Watkins to shoot the ball well top five in the ACC in points per game he only averaging about 12 over his last three contests gos want to run H it Watkins so strong so patient strips Zack Austin hustle play off off Watkins itll go the other way thats something Jeff Capel has wanted to see from his side he was telling you earlier today at shoo around weve got to start doing the tough things the nittygritty things to win without question theres watch his jump shot and thats the open shot Im talking about that Ying creates by his presence in the post Applause Area 52 early going pit one of the best offensive teams in the ACC heres Corin the former n c Corin loses it out of bounds thats Florida States defense if that ball gets in the paint its a fist fight I mean nobodys going to be able to get an easy look and pit has to be able to recognize that and play through that thats what Florida State wants to do right coach they want to cause turnovers create Havoc get into the passing Lanes they forced four turnovers already ever since Leonard Hamilton got off the bus thats the way hes been playing here at Florida State heres Y and double team came wrap around atno b b and put back not there as well Austin rips it off the glass pit wants to run Jaylen low the straw that stir the drink attacks kicks good ball movement Pit Austin rips straight away three off to the right no good Watkins Coral heres Jamir Watkins getting into the lane off the glass no good and and was trying to force it off foren and stepped on the end line great drive that time by Waton it looked like he got a little nudge there but it looks like theyre going to let that go tonight a little bit Florida State coming with the with the full court pressure its not to turn you over its just to wear you down and get in your head to understand and youre not getting anything free tonight what are the keys to play against a Florida State style like this I think you got to attack the pressure I mean I think you theyre going to try to deter you from going to the basket and just like dun did you got to go you understand youre going to get bumped you got to be physical and you got to play through Music it Ls physical there you and guilty of the foul I love when the two teams huddle up right next to each other you know and they fight for a half an inch of space Damen Dunn is in the act of shooting and go to the line for two this is an important game for both of these two teams because in the ACC theyre really working and Duke is right now is is out in front but whos next and pit thought feels that they should be next and so its important to get this game especially on the road for Florida State its a chance for a quad one win so its very very important to them Clemson North Carolina have had something to say about the top of the the ACC as well and youre right coach theres a lot of real estate available for these teams to gain some grounds in the league a ton of teams Stuck in the Middle there at two and three and 3 and two early in this league season Damen done the transfer from Houston knocks down a pair of free throws Ive seen done play as a freshman at Temple I saw him in Houston he has really grown his game and this physical type of basketball he can play turnover created there its a point of emphasis for Jeff cable Squad said we got to get back to defense and rebounding to be an elite team and early on the turnover bug has hit both teams thats the fifth turnover for pit eight combined between the two teams he buil it he Oklahoma did a great job came back to D and now hes doing it at Pittsburgh talk about building programs huh I tell you what this Leonard Hamilton has been around a long time and wherever hes been has been successful and he has stamped his mark on this Florida State program its cool to see you two catch up earlier today the stories and the jokes galore a good time had by all Nolls and Panthers early action from Tallahassee a q1 quad one opportunity for both teams Watkins has hit one three make it two Jamir Watkins from way downtown Watkins plays under control all the time Ive never seen him being forced to play faster than what he want or at a pace that he couldnt come up with a good shot theyve been working with jir Watkins on being the focal point of a defensive game plan Clemson and Brad ronell did a phenomenal job of Walling him off making life miserable Watkins hit two threes against the Tigers and then they Batten the hatches down this time he rips it from Beyond The Arc yeah you cant give him that much space but you notice Yu was posting up on that side so it causes the defense to be able to rotate to help him 6 7 Watkins from Trenton New Jersey 33 this season from Beyond The Arc that foul was given to Justin Thomas it was away from the ball a lot of hand fighting going on down low heres dun sturdy guard gets into the paint and kicks Austin who has been scorching hot from three over the last couple of games has really started to find his scoring touch Banks today yeah but give dun the credit for that because his penetration created the open shot and right now it looks like pit is kind of giving up on their offensive sets and just going more spread and letting the guards try to penetrate and create that was their first field goal from the floor but thats what part state does to you Davis strong Drive late whistle and the Freshman will head to the line I think the officials are going to have to get some clarity on what a foul is because what they like to do is you know when you have the ball and theres a lot of contact they make that call if youre cutting through and its not if there may be a little contact but theyre kind of letting that go and the players have to recognize the difference between the two bird Smith Tony Anderson Bart Lennox coach Hamilton was having a clinic after the call against Florida State now coach Cape was having his clinic right now Applause theres coach Hamilton both of these two coaches can really plead their case now if they werent coaches theyd be defense attorneys dayon Davis made the first second one hes good as well in his rookie campaign Davis an ACC play averaging nearly 11 points per game 10 assists against the Miami Hurricanes last week he has really come on for FSU and given them a true point guard able to engineer the offense and thats important I mean as I talked to Coach Hamilton being able to connect with his team teams where hes had a lot of success he was able to connect with them but they were little older players over and back another turnover for pit that is their sixth already here in this first half Lows going to H if they put that much pressure on low hes going to just have to beat him he cant be playing with the ball that far out hes quick enough and strong enough to go by him he just got to blow by guys jayen loow has meant so much to pit now in his sophomore season from Missouri City Texas top 10 in the ACC in points per game he really is the engine of this team Everybody Plays off jayen loan the way that he creates thats from guards to The Bigs down low he has been so important and its Forida States game plan tonight to try and disrupt him yeah but hes up to the challenge his Godfather is John Lucas senior and uh he goes to that John Lucas Factory so hes played against physical Play Before Hell Be Ready Florida State by four see thats the difference once the guy has the ball puts it down you got to get off and you got to contain him and Pittsburgh is getting caught up right now and two fouls where guys put the ball on the floor and theyre trying to body them once the balls on the floor you cant do that you have to give up some space and contain them Davis Will inbounds Taylor bulbo and Florida States been in search of a number three scoring option bbo and is shown flashes hit four threes against Miami couple games ago followed that previously to that game a double double against Syracuse Davis into the teeth of that defense that righthanded floater not there long rebound Austin Dives to the floor done having trouble coming away with it every place pit turns they seeing a Florida State uniform legot is legot against Thomas turns hangs fires oh thats nice thats a tough shot by Leed thats not what he normally does hes normally catch and shoot but they make him put the ball on the floor and create last years ACC Sixth Man of the Year is leget so reliable for Jeff capable this season its a twopoint game heres bbo Davis shot clock under 10 Davis has the match up he wants attacks off the glass no good defense there from Diaz Applause gram low ball fake attack to the rim off the glass no good crashing the glass was Diaz Graham coming away with it his ball B Bowen behind the back dribble loses it turnover and thats not Taylor B Bowens game the pace is a little faster I think that Florida State wants it I get a quick shot forced missed it long heres Watkins sloppy early from both teams trying to settle in 900 pm start late on the East Coast Watkins kick threw it out of bounds fifth turnover for Florida State 11 combined by these two F Well the pace has been a little ftic and I will tell you baskets have been hard to come by Music again Florida State coming with the full court pressure and theyve got done bringing the ball up he played point guard at Temple he also played the point for Houston so uh hes kind of used to Applause this missed the last missed seven games earlier this season with an injury as Austin cant throw it in offensive rebound hook shot is good theres Diaz Graham a couple of bright spots early in this D Diaz Graham is going to be a good player hes he can really score the ball physically hes got to get a little stronger but I tell you what hes got a really high cealing and good skill set his Spaniard can shoot it has five games in double figures this season dank cant throw it in try to turn around there from the logo the ACC logo 10 to 10 right now Florida state is forcing their will on this game because pits playing a little bit slower than what they would like they havent had a whole lot of open looks the floater there for Cummings Brandon Cummings The Freshman from Midland Pennsylvania less than an hour from the Steel City and he has really stepped up and played really good basketball for Coach cable 60 run for pit Jackson ends it quickly and were tied again at 12 tandor Jackson 65 Jr from Memphis Tennesse good Defender his strong suit is getting downhill getting to the rim and pulling up for that midrange which you showed it there see but but pit is in a No Mans Land theyre trying to run offense and then theyre just trying to play basketball and I think theyre going to have to make a decision do they just want to open the floor and just play or are they going to try to run sets Le it done with one fires away from Deep shot clock violation and the seminal bench loves it at the top of your screen good defense from the Noles and state program has been their depth and in the past their depth has been guys that have gone on to become NBA players coming off the bench but because of this transfer portal and he hasnt had a chance to develop that the seventh eighth and Ninth guys to be at that level yet Coach Hamilton really talked about his program the Hallmark of it was getting guys into the program developing by the time they were Juniors being studs that went on to the NBA you and thats not going to go down foul call its going the other way see who its on and as much as we talk about the physicality and the toughness of Florida State dont get it twisted Jeff cable Point guarded Duke Championship hes tough competitive and hes been after his guys to step up and to meet the challenge here tonight foul was on Boston Hol who was guarding Dunn there duns got to finish that I mean I mean the last step the last dribble has to be a hard dribble and it has to go at The Rim the last two times dun has driven the basketball hes gone away from the basket trying to throw the Applause foul cumings on the drive there nope dang pushes the ball up the Applause court heres Jackson to hold ball rotated around the aru and down low working against camc cor a match up to watch tonight Yan turns nearly lost it staying with it 10 on the shot clock you it no look pass dang floater no Corin rebound D would have been better when he when he got the ball to shoot it hes a really good catch and shoot guy hes not as effed when he puts the ball on the Applause floor low P shot block he got a hands on it hes going to hold play up as Boston h controls the rock tie at 12 Florida state has made a point so far not letting low have any easy looks Jacksons midrange no hit one earlier from that same spot that time it rattles out rebound by The Freshman theres Brandon Cummings looking for the pick and roll with Corin its not there has the switch on the bigger five here and active hands pokes it out Cummings is the third guy that has initiated the offense for pit as theyve been rotating guys because of Florida States pressure there you see the block and the run out right there the thing that good players do is they make real time adjustment low has to recognize how hes being played what hes going to be able to get tonight with the defense Florida state is playing against him and take advantage of that what are you seeing early on I think hes got a attack more I think hes trying to set up and run the offense instead of just using his speed and ball handling and beat his guy off the dribble penetrate and kick and get easier shots or finish at The Rim sh clock lining now Cummings heres leg it with five hes got to come up with something against Thomas leg it good first step falls down low cor and fouled with 1 second left on the shot clock out here a little bit of jawing going on down low competitive Spirits flying thats all it is yes I mean he used to play here last year so he wanted to let him know that hey Im still a Im still a tough guy 122 low scoring so far under theyre big they switch everything and for and for low Lows 0 for one from the field hes got four turnovers and hes got no assist and so theyve eliminated him as a playmaker and a score and you cant let that happen you either have to step up and be the scorer or the playmaker and leot has basically lived off of Lowes ability to get him easier shots which he hasnt been able to do today because the way Florida State switches everything theyre big theyre physical and they kept the ball out of the paint theres Jeff cable played for Coach K also coach at Oklahoma NBC I was teasing me hes even got that one knee going like Coach K used to do in his prime hes done a phenomenal job at Pittsburgh made the NCA tournament two years ago got to the round of 32 last season one of the first four teams left out in a good spot so far here this season B bow foul from Beyond the AR and one more that was a big time shot there knocked down the three Taylor Boo and and thats what he does hes able to stretch the floor and you jump past the guy you never jump into a guy and thats the thing you learn on Closeouts and thats why coach capable was rubbing his head bbo and his threepoint average has jumped up to 37 here this season he reclassified a couple years ago got to Florida State early a fourstar prospect hes come to life for FSU and ACC play size athleticism one of the best shot blockers in the conference and now the three ball has been there for Taylor bbo well I saw him in practice yesterday and thats what he was working on and theyve been really pleased with his progression and if he can space the floor like that that just opens up more driving Lanes NOS by two on their home court D loses it he it into the front Court he steps on the sideline uhoh see see pit has to wind up making the decision all right its too much much dribbling not attacking the basket because theyre trying to set and run their plays and Florida state does not let you run your offense and the teams that have had success against them over the the last few years have been the ones that just come out open the floor and just attacked and played and run some very simple Concepts every we looking at something theyre choke theyre checking to see if you did indeed step out of bounds now when I coach they didnt check on all these things I tried to help them and I tried to make recommendations but they never really listened to me right there was that era and its 30 seconds on the shot CL they staying with the call you like that microphone now they can tell everybody they dont have to run over here and tell us he we stick with the call as coach Clark said another turnover for pit thats nine that that D that double and low hes going to have to get rid of it early and then move and get it back again theyre not going to let him just set up and run the offense and the young fella cant get frustrated again hes got to realize in real time what what theyre doing to him and take advantage of it Davis gets into the lane layup he blew it offensive putback snot there boy buckets are hard to come by for both of these teams both teams missing a ton of shots near the rim but that time you and go into the line yeah but every shot is being challenged its not just like they they they cant shoot but every theyre challenging every shot heres y two points three rebounds early on as he buries the first of two what a game this should be between two of the nations best Saturday at noon Eastern on ESPN Mark shears and number four Bama they take onga OA and number eight Kentucky at R Arina also available on the ESPN app so B at Ru how about Old Miss yesterday winning in Tuscaloosa first top five win in program history and again Florida State they keep with the pressure its Relentless and I think that right now theyre really getting in the Pits head a little bit Davis his best Mar heres impression there right defensively picking the pocket done on the attack physical play they will walk oh Watkins trouble no thats Watkin oh Music wow watch Davis come right there for the steal Florida State Defense is the key to their success it always has been and theyve been Relentless with it tonight see right now dun is staying out around half court you got to get the ball where you can attack around the foul line where you can make passes and they have better angles and Applause everything the Panthers with those 10 turnovers already at their season average nearly another one there three on the shot clock floater air ball he one comes away with Florida state is flying around on defense no look pass flush time ripping the needs to take a time out right now they need to get more organized and have an understanding of what they need to do to handle this coach is reading your mind coach time out taken great coach he knows what what he needs to do well step aside Music Music Florida State defensively they are causing havoc and getting out into transition they are and theyre getting easy opportunities and theyre taking advantage with it because of their aggressiveness great finish that time and theyre playing off of their two guys you and and Watkins that was the you and the Watkins connection Watkins is eight Florida States on a 90 run pit looking for a bucket over their last five from the floor and its been that kind of half so far right yeah but that time you had Ying on done okay you in on done and so it doesnt matter CU all theyre doing is switching all the ball screens so what pit has to wind up doing is when you get that switch and you got the big one you have to drive him no shots from the floor made by pit in over five minutes theyre going to double him theyre going to double Music him double oh and a foul call and I saw that coming because whenever low gets the ball screen they just double low to make him give the ball up and somebody else has to make a play thats a big second foul on you and he will sit iset and Zach Austin have two fouls for the Panthers oh wow another travel another turnover hit now over their season average in the first half thats 11 you know was coach cap try do at the time just calm them down and say coach and say guys this is what we can do we have to take our time we have to use ball screens we may need to slip them so they dont double us but we got to start getting the ball in the paint and attack Christian needu in the game he was jostling down low the fellow freshman Brandon Cummings they really like me to they think hes got is going to be a really special player the Canadian need to this is his 12th game that hes played in they love the size ball skills combination hes tough it hes tough and I think thats the one thing that coaches look at thats how you get better Watkins on the catch and shoot not there Diaz Graham the rebound heres dun still working his way back for missing seven games with injuries Diaz Graham will pull the three thats an air ball NE to chases it down Florida state is really in Pitch head right now Applause offensively when when when someone drives you normally have spots offensively that you go to so the guy driving knows that if somebody rotates over to him that he knows where he can drop the ball off to normally its a its its a what they call a rim guy its a a guy in the opposite corner its a guy in the opposite Wing but thats what pit is not recognizing when theyre driving Florida States just collapsing on them and not giving them outlet and forcing tougher shots foul on sworden after he turns the ball over and that should put pit at the free throw line both teams will be in the bonus the rest of the half one andone coming here for lean and Coach Hamilton explaining to the referees that this is the way we teach it and you cant call fouls on that and hes plead hes still pleading his case he said Ive been here all these years we won all these games and now youre disrupting the way I teach it here schle it one of seven players in the NCAA averaging at least 16 and 1 12 points per game 5 and a half rebounds per game and nearly three assists per game and two steals per game the other in the ACC is Cooper flag pretty good company to be hes a pretty good player Sweden steps into a three nearly airball caught the back IR long rebound collected by Watkins if you pit you cannot give up offensive rebounds though Davis against C kit mlbo its lay up missed it rebound Cory pit wants to run heres leg it with six Corin floats it not there fighting for it s and comes away with the basketball hell push it up the floor leads the break Jamir NBA three oh there it is Watkins is popped hes got three triples Watkins range is incredible especially in this building here he thinks anything across half courts a goodlooking shot for himself Nolls by eight Watkins in double figures 14 straight games done dribbled it off his knee out of bounds dun is going in trying to look for the foul instead of the basket hes got to go and and look for the basket cuz theyre not calling the bumps or anything like that and hes got to be stronger with the ball injury on the floor we got to step aside nlls by eight no doubt about that Sting the 66 freshman in the state of Merill pit 12 turnovers thats tied to season high this is just the first half Florida States defense has been fanatic its caused chaos the length in athleticism has allowed the nles to get into an eightpoint advantage here Thomas three ball rattles off done battles Neu for the ball and the veteran in his six season of college basketball comes away with it Diaz Graham no thats Jorge Diaz Graham coach C doesnt mind that shot though that push the basketball thats what he wants him to do push it ragot done Trail three rattles out BL your C they havent had that many open looks the last two down times down the first time they had really good open looks Watkins missed the bunny continue to push the basketball I think low Euro Step kick clean look for three that one is good thats pits game they just havent been able to get that kind of look with low to leg it thats the way they they like to play the driving the kick Le it buries the three hes got nine B Bowen reverse L and he misses off theyre going to say go Applause time this is what Im talking about forget your offense forget running plays push the ball space the floor kick it to the shooter knock down open looks good offense is all that means is you get good shots and sometimes running in transition is the best way to get shots than that what thats the way you have to wind up playing Tony Henderson one of the officials just came up to us and said we will review that at halftime they will check to see if it was a goal tending or not thats another turnover on pit its not an offensive clinic in this first half well I understand low is trying to run his offense and hes trying to play at a pace where he can get the ball to where it needs to be instead hes got the quick and the speed and ball skill to blow right by Davis whos guarding him but hes trying to run his offense and may sometimes you just got to go by and beat the guy Florida State shooting 26 from the floor pit shooting 24 Jackson bumps they will say foul on the floor and the nolles are in the bonus that is on looks like number one Damen dun that is his first in games like this where baskets are hard to come by a sixpoint lead is like a 12point lead just because of the pace of the game Florida state has definitely set the pace in in so far in the first half one and one for Jackson 74 charity stripe shooter connects Chandler Jackson is the only player on Florida States that has been in the program for three consecutive Seasons coach am pointed that out earlier today at shoter around said Im used to having guys again that I can develop in this program those guys almost become like coaches on the court by the time theyre juniors and seniors and hes done really well with those guys and this program has flourished with that its just been a change in the atmosphere with leg it aloop it works out that time they just attack attack they W they didnt try to run anything they just attacked the pressure of Florida State hold the ball hold the ball Davis Jackson bbo in right wing guarded by Diaz Graham three ball in the air off to the left no good and knocked out of bounds by Florida State itll belong to the visitors from pit if P can get a basket here for all the things theyve gone through in this first half theyre not in a bad spot theyve defended pretty well they themselves its a pit team thats winning the rebound battle by one coach C pointed that out set in our four losses weve just been bludgeoned on the boards leg it we traveled twice un let they jump ball in set alternating possessions will go to FSU and Leonard Hamilton will take a timeout to talk things over with just under 45 seconds left to play in this first half all right hall of fame Music coach hold your thought Ill get it from you on the other side Music 23 combined turnovers between these two teams and hit already over their season and its really created by good defense not sloppy off Davis B Bowen poked away good defense Jaylen Applause low low working against Thomas foul calls Every Time Lows getting the ball and they can double him theyre looking to double him and he has to recognize that keep his head up and kick it to the open guy the foul is on Thomas thats his second jayen low hasnt scored in this basketball game and sometimes the other team when especially youre leading score they want to see how he handles not scoring or taking away his scoring opportunity and how the team handles him not being the leading score and getting the opportunities he normally gets the advantage low has is that his head coach was a point guard and hes the best guy to help him through and understand that double checking the clock was also told Again by Tony Henderson theyre going to check at half time on a goal tending violation earlier this half on Christian need to who touched the ball it was on the edge of that Rim theyre going to decide if it was coming off or not so stay tuned for that well have the answer for you at halftime it was a go 10 what thought so far in this first half defensively obviously both teams have played at a high level offense hard to come by but good energy in a important ACC matchup uh you know this is the way and you know because youve seen a lot of Florida State when theyre at their best thats the way they play its a fist fight and theyve made this a fist fight and one of the things that coach cap was talked about this team he thinks that theyre very talented but theyve got to learn to win fist fights and so this will go to help them as the season progresses and in real time they got a chance at halftime to come and make some adjustments and take advantage of what they need to do to offset this uh Florida State pressure Jaylen low leads pit in free throws knocks down the front end of the one and one thats his first point of the game shooting over 90 from the year thats second in the ACC top 25 in the country and you see what hes been doing on the year Florida State has worked to try and make life difficult for the sophomore here in the first half still just down three pit after all that noes will have one last chance with the shot clock Applause off the Freshman Davis going up against the sophomore low Florida a will now get into their motion offense 8 seconds now six Davis six Davis five four Pro throw the alley threw it off the side of the back for de Jackson right at the buker see what coach cable Drew up the adjustments made here for the Panthers switch on to Watkins low gets in floats it no hell go to the line aggressive from Jaylen low first possession and thats what you want thats the first time hes gotten into the paint going to the basket you know this is why coaches really like guys to kind of stay around so they can develop and watching the development of them and these are things low is going to learn I mean hes the target for everybody and everybody sitting their defense to try to take him away and this is all in real time a learning Music experience low misses that time oh and for jayen low that miss it snaps a 20 eight in a row free throw streak and we didnt mention we didnt mention it I waited and if he had made all of them today I wouldnt have mentioned it would have left it for the next broadcast group pit does trim the lead to one heres done attacks kick Austin three there you go thats pit basketball right there drive kick Zach Austin better than 44 from Beyond The Arc on the year Panthers within one theyve scored the first four here of the second half Yan ISO double team comes kick out Davis ball rotation good defense from the Panthers Watkins trying to find something late fires the three it rims out Le it pulls down the board hes got a couple of double doubles this season as well a willing rebounder at the guard position is schle One V one against Watkins Watkins good defense oh they call a foul thats tough luck for jir Watkins defensively sometimes you have to make an adjustment because the offense is in front of the coachs bench and so hes on it but there you see a kick great shot right there W with the threepoint shot by Austin that is a big foul by the way on jir Watkins thats his third and hes going to have to exit this game especially when especially when he was playing so well right Florida States leading score long throw e grabs it play off thats a big top play right there that can take away your momentum that pit Applause had we talk about Yan at the top and I just think hes the Catalyst for this Florida State team because he does so many things well for him low high off the glass oh thats pretty well that time when they switched on him they flatted everybody to the Baseline and he was going oneonone with Yuan how about the degree of difficulty on that shot for dayon Davis well you said you wanted some offense so they came out they said were going to give you what you want we appreciate it leg it good look it rattled out oh it looked good out of his hand too nolles by three Jackson foul calls is that on Austin I believe that is on Zack Austin it is and thats his third foul thir watch you it right there big time steal thats a big boy play and he finished it with the flush those are the type of plays to get your team going thats what leaders do Florida States got 10 points off 15 Pittsburgh Turner leading by three oldstar jir Watkins on the bench with three fouls heres y double team comes he spins away from it and the soft touch from the big man he is so tough in around the basket he can spin right he can spin left and he can also face up and drive you and backto back double doubles against the Miami Hurricanes and the Clemson Tigers last week for Florida State done has he shot blocked its Yan and now Chandler trying to push the pace for the noes hean screaming for it gets it counter and R for the big man what a sequence for Mo you know you come out offensively if you pit you get what you want youve been playing really good defense and Yan breaks your heart with two really big time plays and around around you see the block right there on done and then the bucket the post up hes just too big too strong and he puts himself for a threepoint Applause play you and started his career at Old Miss cant knock down the free throw gra the own Miss takes it in Mr do it all LLY VI those are the plays that coach C talked about that has been frustrating when theyve had to step up and make tough plays and people come at him theyve failed to do that at time huge block that was b b on the drive from leet Florida state has shot out of a cannon H spin move hes really feeling himself yes coach howon tell him to slow down Davis alyuk layup they need a time out 50 these time Applause out timeout taking pck type of effort do for the rest of the guys on the team oh but thats what your star player does I mean he picks you up and he puts you on one of those streaks where youre struggling a little bit cuz Pittsburgh was making a strong come run and it puts you back in control quick feed out of the timeout to the big man Corin ball rotation Le it had nine first half points attacks foul called on Applause you thatll be the third foul on mly huan so the no stars in foul trouble they lead by 11 they had no problems with Miami last night now 7 and0 in the ACC coacher they ahead above everybody else in the league at the moment theyre playing right now better than anybody but again you got to give the the Duke coaching staff a lot of credit how theyve handled that team and brought them along on a very difficult schedule this pit team has played pretty well this season trying to avoid a threegame losing streak and and I tell you thats what y has done in the last two three minutes because P came out and was playing really well they were attacking the basket they were getting really good looks they were defensively they were playing well and then Yan just stepped up and he just dominated game The Last 3 4 minutes how about the quick shot there from Papa amadu K first minutes of the game gets in the scoring sheet on the other and counted and one Al Mal and if thats on Zack Austin thats four coach Hamilton talked to both of us about ball movement and they count the ball movement of their team and there you see the Finish there because he believes when the ball doesnt stick offensively theyre much more effective and everybody gets a little bit of the sugar and is in the scoring column the NOS have shared the basketball well played unselfishly that is on Austin Zach Austins going to the bench with four fouls oh boy free throw sweet stroke from Malo The Freshman a talented project for the NOS theres Austin on the bench lot of foul trouble Austin with four The nlls Have uan and Watkins with three pretty layup there leg it blew right by the nlls defense well again theyre not trying to run any offense theyre just attacking and thats the best way to handle this Florida State Defense coach Gable told us earlier today thats what FSU does they take you out of everything you want to do youve just got a hoop against them bow finds an easy shot and connects the Florida state balls movement has really stepped up and they got easy Applause shots kante will slip from the screen low attacks finger up count it sweet left hand that time he went into the defense so no one could come up and try to challenge him at The Rim hes got seven second half points assertive here for pit now in this second Applause half Bowen working against low RS recovered though by B Bowen Davis lets it Fly that misses Applause everything transition Cummings high off the glass no crashing the glass leg got it offensive rebound looking for an Music angle good ball movement Cummings missed everything oh boy Davis attacking done Blow by reverse Lup how about the Freshman taking it right at a sixthe seing yeah D needed to retreat a little bit so he could get a better angle to stop the ball Davis has eight Florida State by 12 Cummings leans right hand short rebound no Davis to Thomas heing shot and he throws it down transition from Florida State and a reach in foul called on Davis biggest lead of the night for FSU every time it looks like pit puts itself in position Florida State off of their defense gets run outs and easy baskets and that is what has given them control of this basketball game especially here in the second half watching the film from Clemson against Florida State over the weekend thats what the Tigers did so well they didnt allow Florida State to leak out they made it a halfcourt game and they executed to ection well Clemson is a more veteran team than this Pittsburgh team low travels I mean stifling ball pressure from Florida State Jaylen low has a career high now in turnovers hell learn from eight turnovers tonight hell learn from this hes a competitor he will remember this and hell get back in the gym Florida stand is made made life difficult on the star sophomore guard and this Panthers offense in general they lead by 14 heres Hol a veteran of his own dang open three lets it Fly that rattles Applause out Dante rebounds pushes it up to low low looking to get downhill done ball fake Le it against Jackson lost the ball out of bounds a turnover for pit thats number 17 but when whenever you drive against this Florida State team you got two or three hands scking at the basketball because theyre in the Gap and there no easy drive to the basket and the nlls are doing this with you and Watkins on the bench at the moment Thomas Baseline Drive cut off there kicks it out Jackson oneonone against low good defense from the sophomore Jackson turning bobbing weaving heres hle eight on the clock pick and roll threw it out of bounds but not before a whistle a foul down low that is on dun his second the teams Applause four I thought in this game dun was going to be really important because of him being a veteran player and having gone through some of the wars and playing a more aggressive Ive physical style of basketball and he really has not been as impactful as I thought he would be in this basketball game are you surprised coach that pit has struggled with the physicality yes and just reacting there done just made a steal I just think hes a really good basketball player and hes got a lot of experience and he would be a calming Force good ball movement done finds a clean look that rattles out one the foul calls on dank good effort on the glass there from mad duante youre talking about a game thats exciting South Carolina women especially playing at home is really really exciting its a show in and of itself Don Staleys got a monster going tahina powpow might be one of the greatest names ever assembled by Humanity that shot there now not going to go down Le hes able to float at home leeds got 13 this is a very important time in the game right now especially for pit they have to wind up climbing back in this thing good shot right there offensive rebound Leed is stepping up and hes playing well right now hes been about their most consistent guy offensively and taking advantage of the things that he does well leg preseason second Team all ACC member and and Coach Hamilton must have heard me cuz hes bringing the troops back Applause in Davis change Watkins is back in you aint back in was told pck got a delay of game warning whats going through coach cels mind right now you know he he wants to see his team do some tough things and be physical and be aggressive theyve scoring theyre scoring now now defensively they got a locked up and they got a play thats what he wants to see plays like that at The Rim jge Diaz Graham sent that thing back lay up on the other end oh K missed it Diaz Graham little a burst of energy off this pit bench and hes H but but you see coach cap is getting after we got to fight I mean if to be a good team you got to come you got to fight you got to compete and thats what he wants to see great defensive play right there at the rim thats the type of effort that hes looking for Diaz Graham I told you earlier hes going to be a talent he he hes got to get a little stronger hes coming he can score the basketball you know what else was big about that jir Watkins picked up his fourth foul thats a huge play I mean he is basically been taken out of this second half Al together Jorge Diaz Graham splashes at home the Spaniard known for his threepoint proficiency 60 on the year from Beyond the yard well we know as coaches that our plays arent always going to work our game plan isnt always going to be perfect but through that we have to play through that and we have to do tough things and thats what coach cap wants to see his pit team do right now play through all of the what the adversity that they face and do some tough Music things Panthers trim the lead to 10 heres Jackson B Bowen working against dun wants to go inside kick to Jackson Jackson righthanded floater not there offensive rebound euan lost it on the way up but into the hands of Thomas who buries the three offensive rebound has hurt it and is hurting them again tonight that is the sixth offensive rebound from Florida State great defense again and then a Applause foul its against kante good a good offensive rebound kicks it out out Thomas knocks down the three right there but again it comes off a offensive rebounding Florida State play So Physical in the paint they make you collapse they make your guards come down to help and then it frees up open jump shots especially when they get offensive rebounds how about Malik you and Coach 13 points 10 rebounds uhoh Davis put it on the Highlight take broke the ankles and switch the Davis has played extremely well hes taken low out of the game now hes stepping up offensively as the hey I got some offense too that was nasty from The Freshman Davis NOS by 16 hand Shack foul calls

they really embrace the toughness in Baltimore Im telling you now you know coach Hamilton is a music guy and hes got all his old albums and all like that if you ever go over his house hell get the stepping for you some I mean thats really what hes known for and the players like to go over there and look at the the old soul songs and Soul music and they have a good time when they go over his house low knocks down the free throw the Lefty trigger Zach Austins back in there with those four fouls for pit well its a time in the game where if they dont stop the bleeding now by the time he comes back at about the 4minute mark it may not be anything to save so that thats why theyre doing that and it felt like Austin was going to make his mark on this game if not for the foul trouble had five points in five rebounds early on showed you a shot from Beyond The Arc as well and now theyre coming with the pressure trying to create something out of it and they do turnover forced low to Corin shot blocked by his former teammate flag it Second Chance three ball is how about the lift Jorge Diaz Graham has given the P hes a good Applause Music player oh and Davis shaking up Applause

second guy thats gone down and was told AJ Swinton right lower leg injury he is out for the remainder of this contest towards the end of that first half thats a big loss right there cuz he was playing

back in it under eight media timeout hovering Applause Jackson attacks righthanded floater stops the Run thats a big shot Jacksons got eight points to go along with two rebounds and three assists Corin underneath the basket lays it up missed it trying to stay with it Corin fighting against B Bowen and Thomas jump off possession era Florida State B Bowen has stepped up and have done a really good job defensively for this Florida State Applause team he comes up with tough plays and thats what you need from a leader and especially a post guy when you have so many talented perimeter players hes averaging nearly 18 points per game in conference play for FSU is Malle Gan good sign for the NES dayquon Davis back out there had the scare and went to the locker room Watkins still on the bench with those four fouls NOS byte trying to throw it up Yan threw it into the lap of Applause cour layup attempts blocking to that was a huge play that could have been a threepoint play but thats the way

the Finish there thats why hes so important to this Florida State Applause team theyve had to play most of this game without Watkins its been guys like Chandler Jackson steadying the waters so to speak for Florida State Jackson now at 11 his ACC high on the year but if you listen to coach Hamilton thats what he tells you he likes the balance on this team and that he plays 10 guys sometime 11 guys and anybodys capable of stepping up and having a night both teams have shot the free throw ball well here this evening both hovering around 90 nice move low and you can see low and making your adjustment from the first half to the second half and thats what Im telling you good players make real time adjustments his 14th double figure scoring game hes figured it out in the second half hes

him in there for he loves his energy he loves his aggressiveness hails from darar sanal Watkins buries the front end of the one and one Watkins is the closer for Florida State hes the guy late in the

category as well buries them both knocks down two free throws Florida States lead back up to n Applause low floater not there rebound how about Bobo Applause skying under four to go in Tallahassee on

looked like pit was going to seize control of this game either defensively or offensively and the guy on the foul line has a lot to do with that you and Def another strong night with 14 points and 11 rebounds Coach P down double digits got to come up with something here three ball in the air thats a good start from jayen low I tell you what Ive been so impressed with low in the second half I mean hes made the adjustments hes seen what was being done to him and hes figured out a way to get help his team get back in his ball game a sevenpoint game Davis bbo and back to Davis Watkins has a size advantage over low double team comes trying to get the ball out of his hands and oh not what you wanted to do there and foul him and its the double bonus now for Florida State you see coach capable I mean you know we had a shot we had the ball where we wanted it and we fouled one of the best foul Shooters in the Applause Music ACC Watkins has really been a leader when I talked to Coach ham uh with with this basketball team I mean he does it quietly he he wish he would be more verbal but he really tries to do it with his play cuz he steps up he practi hard all the time he plays hard and the guys look up and and get momentum and feeling from watching him execute he hits both free throws Saturdays ACC Network mens basketball triple header Virginia Tech Wake and blackburg and then Notre Dame Syracuse and finally Cal taking it on NC State should be a lot of fun blow attacks the right hand this time no rebound by you and jump ball heavy play by Jaylen low and the possession arrow points

are you kidding me this is not over we got a lot of basketball to play now hes got four threes in this game and Coach we we just saw Virginia Tech come all the way back to be NC State down double digits hit this guy has been unbelievable well he has and this is the effort that coach capable been looking for with this team take a punch absorb the punch and fight back and that what this pit team is doing and theyre really growing up right in front of our eyes the second half I talk about making adjustment real time because thats what Big Time Players do they understand whats being done to them they dont need a film session to go over it they dont need a practice to clean it up in the midst of the game they can make adjustments and thats what low has done with this ball club today its a sixpoint game pit not done yet Florida States going to have to work really hard for their first quality win of the season the Panthers trying to snap a two game losing streak in conference play not easy to do on the road especially here at the tuck Watkins against leet Jackson strong attack theyre going to call it foul the basket wont count theyre going to say see if they call Goal tending or not Jackson hung on the rim on the rim so I think that that will eliminate the bastard but there was a foul holds furthest ref from the play Tony Anderson but itll be two shots it should be two shots see right there the basket C the basketball it what didnt go through Music two Music shots so it is a foul called on cam Cor in his Music second you talked about Jackson earlier and again him making such a strong contribution both offensively and defensively hes got 13 now and hes been phenomenal from the free throw line see the numbers on your screen the junior lets it fly I technically didnt Jinx him the graphic did I didnt say anything pit will accept the free throw Miss as they try and continue to trim the lead low foul hell go to the line clock stops at 158 hes showing you how clever he is with the ball ball hes not looking right now to set up his teammates if it happens it happens hes looking to get put himself in a position to finish look like he may have caught a cramp or something hes trying to trying to shake it off is he yeah I was talking to Florida State associate head coach Stan Jones before the game and he said Jaylen low coming off ball screens is a pro he said its as good as youll find the way he reads the game said hes a tough match up for one one of the best guards in the ACC with the ball in his hands well in the summer he works out with guys that are Pros down in Houston his dads an a coach time out taken by Florida State Jaylen low 14 second half points diab gram has given 17 big points off the bench for Florida State jir Watton still with 17 tonight despite Limited minut especially in the second half due to foul trouble well he knows how to get his points I mean he he doesnt need a lot of minutes to know how to get his points and especially down the stretch they like to keep the ball in his hand and he either gets fouled gets somebody else a basket or he gets you a basket well eans got those 14 and 12 Jackson with those 13 and dayquon Davis with 11 but youre saying over the final two minutes Watkins has got to touch the ball yeah a ton here finish this one up yeah well hell touch it but he wont give it up the only way hell get hell either shoot it or get somebody a layup or go to the foul line these are some big free throws for jayen low one of the best in the League hits on the first hes got one more Jaylen low 15 second half points showing his toughness well real time adjustment that thats what Big Time Players do hits them both its a fivepoint game full court pressure coming from pit trying to force the turnover bbo and Davis shows retrieves stuck in the back court BB and the NOS trying to beat it pass half court they with time to Applause Music spare much better offensive set second half and this one from both teams Jackson eight on the clock seven Watkins puts the ball down gets to the rim High floater no grabs his own Miss block shot oh whistle who is it on wat plays Big Boy basketball in crunch situations drove it missed it went and got it through the offensive fou through the foul he was called on leg it underneath the play Corin came over the top and rejected it you can see his Applause frustration 90 seconds to play Watkins two be a huge win for Florida State noes in need of a quad one Victory letter Hamilton I think he senses the urgency of the moment Watkins has one four to push it to six does that hes got 18 it is a two possession game pit against a really good threepoint shooting team see what low Cooks up here screen set physical low calls his own number short Corin fighting for it long rebound Watkins got it foul cols 115 to play two more free throws for Florida States outstanding fifth year senior you dont think this game means something every play work for Rebound to somebody slow picking themselves up that time Jackson got hit with a Music bow hes over there talking to the trainer hell be all Music right Watkins a projected second round NBA draft pick last season came back to Tallahassee to improve the outside perimeter shooting as he knocks down that Applause one its amazing how hes found himself at the line so many times and thats what Big Time Players do its not an accident they know how to close they know how to finish tops in the ACC at getting to the line hes got 20 points the sixth time this season Applause Watkins has been a bucket getter leg it off to the left missed you badly Watkins fouled again and now the NOS can taste it its an FSU team searching for its first quality victory of the year they were very disappointed with how they played at Clemson and I know they came back they went over some things with the film the two biggest things with defensively cleaning up some things and sharing the ball offensively and moving the ball and getting better balance and they got better balance tonight these will be attempts nine and 10 for Watkins from the line tonight knocks down the Applause first Watkins has been dealing with teams essentially spying and to use a football term defenses theyve been game planning for jir getting him into uncomfortable spots hes had to learn on the flight hes the focal point foul called its on Florida State thats not a smart foul trying to deny the ball from low Davis will put low on the line Davis has done a heck of a job with low the first first half he definitely got in his head he denied him the basketball uh was right there every time he puts the ball down the big difference was in the first and the second half Lows not trying to run the offense hes just trying to space the floor so he can attack the rim and its paid off on getting other people easy shots and himself stepping up his storm the sophomore hits the free throw had a triple double earlier this season had a strong game against the nlls last year 17 points 10 assists he got 17 more tonight pit has beaten the NOS twice in a row in this series they lead at 17 to7 all time full court press coming traps Galore Watkins able to beat the pressure hes going to get downhill hes looking for the alley oh foul called on Cory and cam cant believe it Applause that that wasnt necessary really Yuan was Yuan was falling out of bounds look hes falling out of bounds and he got called for with the Applause Music push now youan is just a 56 shooter from the line four of seven tonight make it five of eight that average go north but hes one of those Shooters when he needs to put it in the basket I think from the foul line hes capable Old Miss to start his career committed briefly to USF never made it there went to Junior College became a junior college All America the number one Center in Joo in a Renaissance season for Florida State on the attack layup there foro hes got 20 all in this second half and hes called for the Applause hes fun to watch give that hell learn from this game what they did to him in the first half I dont think we he he wont see that much anymore and I think hell know how to handle It Gos up by eight felt like the spurt that Malik euan had really catapulted FSU in this one yeah they were struggling pit had all the momentum and that spurt just kind of restarted Florida state did it defensively and offensively Watkins trying to close this thing down he always is at the foul line I mean it thats thats just thats his talent thats a skill they put the ball in his hands and he doesnt give it up he either scores it or gets somebody a layup Watkins who scored 34 points in a game in his career now with 24 big 3000 miles away but the schedule sets up nicely for Florida State potentially to make a run Corin offensive rebound cant stick it home wow forgettable night for cam coring against his former team two points9 rebounds cherry on top Applause coming coach Hamilton should be really proud of his ball Club saw him in practice yesterday they did everything that they wanted to do in the first half they took the ball out of Lows hands made scoring difficult
