to Texas to Texas Tech to Tennessee and to Notre Dame so its a significant game its a significant afternoon and Georgetown will begin with a basketball Roger a is Jeffrey Clark and Clarence Armstrong are threeman officiating crew Georgetown of the road black here is the starting lineup for the Hoya fieder and sorber two very big players 611 and 610 for Georgetown M Epson PE really good scoring guard for the Hoya and the first Miss of three from Drew Fielder as Syracuse works the ball down the floor jquan Carlos Elijah Mo Chris Bell Donnie Freeman and heres Eddie lampin Jr the big his first taste to Syracuse geown and he misses one at The Rim this is mik a pebi and this threepointer grabbed by lanin for the orang still without their leading score JJ Starling what do they look like Chris without Starling in the lineup well theyre I think still trying to figure that out I mean its its both of these teams are so much better in transition you know they can play more instinctively more athletically its when you get both of these teams in the half court they have so many new pieces the chemistry is just not there yety talking to us today about 14 new layers one of them is peave their most experienced guy who opens the scoring and thats just too easy you know its a Syracuse mantoman defense that in the half court has not been great I I think the aptitude is there but the want to is not always and thats just a straight line drive with no help Eddie L gets a roll to scor and open to Syracuse scoring nine points seven rebounds a game with the transfer from Colorado Lins tough because of that size but it starts with him catching it deep hes got to get it in close Jadon EPS one of just two returners in the Georgetown rotation and there second leading score with his first basket those two guards for Georgetown a huge concern for red Ary Malik Mack and Jaden EPS lampkins taking the first three shots and that ball last touched by EPS it will stay its Syracuse its where Eddie lampkins got to do his work early a lot like he did in that game against Texas ear earlier in the year its his best game so far and it started with where he caught it and he just consistently caught it deep and around the basket its a Syracuse team that scores a ton of its points from inside the YK one of the worst threepoint shooting teams in college basketball and here Chris Bell is fouled shooting at three so B fouled by sorber foul troubles were a big deal for sor georgetowns loss last Friday at West Virginia well you know obviously The Scouting Report regardless of Chris Bell shooting percentage he wants three I mean that hes can be a little bit onedimensional in that respect he he wants to shoot three youre going to have to get out on that a switch by yes sir by sober the five coming out on that and its its a big foul you know its important for Thomas sber to stay out of foul trouble Applause well this is what were talking about from deep it its not a strength to put it kindly for either team 79 power Conference teams in D1 georgetowns threepoint percentage ranked 74th Syracuse is 76th well for Georgetown its shot selection you know Jay nips and Malik Mack take a lot of tough shots and so that percentage is going to naturally be down and in the case of Syracuse You got some guys who have transferred up youve got freshman and then you have Chris Bell who is shooting a low percentage so its a combination of those three fa theres Tomy Freeman off a season High 24 scores on his first shot you know I like the move by Red arrey putting both freshmen in the starting lineup today they they are Syracuses two most talented players now their consistency because of the youth will go up and down but You got to go in the direction of those two freshman Applause theres Fielder back for mat and both geown bigs it missed badly from three early the Hoya is 0 for three from out there men to the two freshman Mo making his second start of the Season second in a row Freeman came off the bench last game because of the elus and back in the lineup he has found the shooting Applause touch hes got all the tools he is incredibly talented Applause five quick ones for Freeman its a 7 nothing Syracuse run and another Miss three by Fielder whos just three for 19 now from out there on the year Freeman back for more back to choam Mo and look at Lin fighting for the ball hes on the deck lamin is down its a five on four for Georgetown PE will take advantage of it and thats where and that was in transition but regardless if youre Georgetown You got to make Syracuse defend the ball like driving the basketball I think theyve settled for a few these threes early in this game Carlos with a wedgie Syracuse will have it on the Arrow we were hes got the full I mean hes a threeway scorer as they say I mean he could score inside in the in the short corner he can score in the midrange at that foul line and he can he can hit a three and he does doesnt take bad shots I mean thats the thing that has has popped for me and he doesnt need a lot of shots to be effective its been really efficient this is here M clouds on the floor only the third time this year hes played for Syracuse a sorber a rem rocker for the Hoya just bad transition defense I mean its you know Georgetown gets down early s runs to the front of the rim and and Syracuse failing to identify and transition defense has been the biggest weak point in their defense theres a takeway Jordan Burks the Kentucky transfer off to EPs and he finishes and something that has burned Syracuse continues to burn them a long practice for red off three yesterday and there was a lot of time spent on that thing youre mentioning transition defense gave up 85 to Aly and a win on Tuesday and its not a good shot thats a tough shot from Elijah Moore contested in the midrange two Defenders went for the ball sorber with the uncontested offensive rebound and georgetowns on a little bit of a surge turnovers and bad shots put a ton of pressure in your transition defense straight fors McLoud moris wide open and he TS it and thats a quality look and he can really score you as his minutes have gone up his shot attempts has gone up and hes one of those microwaves and he can really get it going and plays with such confidence for a young player second made three for Syracuse Freeman and more the two freshman on the roll sorber hit by Freeman who is ding by Jeffrey Clark for a foul it look like he got all ball itll be interesting to see the replay he comes over a little bit late but comes over to make a play Applause you know but thats again thats another area you know pick and roll coverage especially with with McLoud or Eddie Lampton on the floor its been a its been a problem area versus when you have J Davis and frean out there playing together you can switch a little bit more well Davis is going to come in for Freeman first time we see the Delaware transfer Freeman with an early Five Points and another free throw for Thomas sord of Trenton New Jersey second leading rebounder in the Big East Fifth in free throw attempts 11th in scoring and hell take a seat for the first time as Dre Fielder replaces him sorber with an early five as well sber been so efficient he he leads them in scoring but hes fourth in number of shot attempts just got a really good feel for the game quick run for McLoud lampin returns to the floor for Syracuse for 11 to start heres Carlos and Carlos gets it to fall starting to see a little bit more these last few days from Jak PA Carlos you are he had he he looks a lot more comfortable really nice Cut there for communication by Georgetown shot by pe heres lamin more can handle it what a good distributor along with a strong shooter in this four game Breakout stretch for choa Moore theres a three to deep rebound to m Jaden EPS again gets to the rim the tip is there from Applause Fielder again just early offense you know getting into the heart of the defense early in the possession by Jaden X leading to an offensive Applause rebound Georgetown getting everything in the paint right now as lamp get is fou Jordan Burks with his first foul so free throws for lampin seven for 16 there on the Music year next game here on NC Network toir Watkins in Florida State taking on to Lane the Auto Nation Orange Bowl basketball classic in Sunrise Florida also streaming live on the ESPN app two you know when those two teams get together in the Auto Nation Orange Bowl classic were setting up for a classic I mean you throw the records out the window I think its the Georgetown Syracuse of t l Florida State gam FSU another uh early season pleasant surprise they did lose their ACC opener overtime at NC State theres a turnover on P and Georgetown coughs it up for the first time Applause impressions for you early as were getting through the the feel it out stage of the first eight minutes or so youve got a lot of new faces on both of these teams and it leads to some some clunky possessions on both ends offensively and defensively a lot of it chemistry fueled a lot of it you know both these teams are young in spots Davis ping his way in Z Davis strong into the paint to score it at some point youre going to have to come over and help Curtis Williams I mean after the seventh bounce Drew Fielder just comes over late and Jer Davis has been so effective scoring around the rim as ma gets to the rim and scores it everything coming at The Rim right now for Georgetown and Malik Mack on his first shot scores it Carlos sets up Bel for three rebound to M A pebi he is a really pushing Tempo in this game good luck mat a three goes down for Jordan burs just his second of the year its another transition bucket early in the possession Syracuse unable to match up with a good find by Ma the first three for Georgetown today after 0 for five start are back on top Kyle cuff off his best game with Syracuse against Aly zero in the game for the orange Bel forces it tried to draw a foul and its out of bounds to Georgetown a fist pupping Ed and the Hoya with a threepoint lead in the 100th meeting between these two proud programs experience for lot of these players Chris they feel a responsibility to keep this rivalry going yeah again it this rivalry and these two programs are iconic you cannot write the history of college basketball without either of them I think both coaches me certainly red ay played in this rivalry and Ed Ed coie is a big East lifer and and both of these gentlemen understand that you know it was interesting talking to Ed KY he he took the job he he had had a lot of work ahead of him and you and I were talking to him before the game he said you know theres when you take over a program like Georgetown where it was at theres more you have to fix off the court before you fix whats on the court they were not good last year they basically clean the Slate after last year hes got 14 new faces but hes a force of nature I mean hes he is you you know and hes a great coach so you know hes going to get this thing going Georgetown the last last three seasons including last year four and 55 in Big E play almost unfathomable onepoint lead here after cup f lampin for the Syracuse bucket deep shot clock P geown has been way way off the mark from three cup transition L there to clean it up lampin will scor nice job following the play by Eddie lampin hes got a particular set of skills when he is in the game and one of those is offensive rebounding hes taking few off the boards now for the orange clapping his hands in the face of sorber and the Freshman faces him up and then clapped his hands right back at him oh Eddie with a little bit of aedd soft elbow there sorber fighting hard right now the fifth year lampin and the firste sorber the Georgetown bench is standing up EG pulie scream for offensive foul lanin leaves it short and then Lin hits the deck again Williams knocked Away by Carlos for Syracuse steel jquan Carlos always these little moments in these games where you feel the heat start to build rise between Georgetown and Syracuse its a matter of when thats going to happen not if Davis is fou by Caleb Williams you know and wanted this game to to be he called it helmet to helmet game which doesnt sound particularly aesthetically appealing but you know he wanted his team to get back and then he wanted Syracuse to have to grind in a half court he wanted this to be an inside fight they are winning the battle in the paint so far yeah its pretty clear Ed Coy will not mind this game being physical Ed coie will not mind if this game is Scrappy feels like these guys have the size the temperament to do that Freeman and Lucas Taylor with a miscommunication in a Syracuse turnover that wasnt a great pass but but you know I think the adjustment for Lucas Taylor has been more than he maybe thought it was going to be I mean youve got two guys in this playing minutes for Syracuse and Lucas Taylor and jquan Carlos both of them transferring up and I I dont think we talk enough about that adjustment to the power five level jquan Carlos starting to come on Taylor still figing it out sherber over Davis oh Freeman just couldnt grab it luckily for him Taylor was there to do so a hopster transfer Carlos caught in the air Davis will drive it in the shoulder and the second foul and the Freshman Thomas Applause sorber Thomas its a big foul yeah again foul trouble has been an issue for sorber and a nice job by jar Jer Davis who Ian 220 lbs he see he plays stronger than even that and his efficiency has been off the charts hes 18 of 23 from the field and their last three hes really hit a stride over the last two games you surprised that Coy sticking with serber here with two fouls I am I am surprised young player and a big guy like you can live with an older guard you know playing with fouls but theres a lot of time left in this first half and hes too important and C did call over Thomas short talk said I want you to have a double double by halftime hes got seven points only one rebound and now two fouls as thats thrown away by peave looking for a back cutting Mac those are the types of plays that Georgetown is just not completing I mean Mack is open its a welldesigned set youve got to be able to pass and catch was that there are 14 new guys on this team trying to play a little bit of that yeah and to hide sorber here goes Ed into the two3 Zone take D over Storer scores it Zer Davis on backto back possessions gets two the versatility of Davis and Freeman stands out and playing those both both those guys together makes this Syracuse team really versatile this lineup oh inside sber is fouled and finishes wait Thomas sorber looks the part in this game onepoint Shai of double figures in the first half only a freshman hes got a really good nose for the ball he he plays with such a motor which means he makes plays outside of his area and hes got some skill to him but first and foremost he really loves to play with his back to the basket hes hes strong hes physical hes not afraid of contact hes got good footwork in there and a great Pair of Hands played at Archbishop Ryan in Pennsylvania and Kevin I mean we were talking to Ed Co he could not have been more effusive hes an A kid and just thinks his potential is off the charts yeah hes a player that was recruited by Ed kulia Providence whos recruited and offered by Syracuse as well in Trenton New Jersey and this was a really important pickup a big Freshman Class Greg kie this team has six freshman ton of four stars the first time George Towns had two ESPN 100 players since 2015 this go van Marcus dson and fair to say Thomas sorber has exceeded expectations in his first nine games he has I think just his again it the adjustment for young big guys is harder into college than it is for guards especially one who who is playing with his back to the basket you can tell hes been well coached you can tell he has a great relationship with his current head coach and he needs time like hes not a oneand done he may think he is you know hes hes a two threee type of player but he will play in the NBA theres no question about it TI the game at 25 hes got 10 lead all scor again playing with two fouls tried to poke the ball away it ends up with Carlos with five to shoot Davis he just owns that Applause spot he really does its such a weapon because you can just kind of flash him in there you can put him at the high post kind of a jack of all trads heres sorber lampin again sorber will push it off to Malik Mack under the corner Williams Williams was too far in the corner georgetowns fourth Applause turnover theres one of those freshman Caleb Williams in a Washington DC Kavon molet another freshman is out today lower body injuries so georgetowns probably going to go just eight deep need a little more from Caleb Williams and the sophomore Curtis Williams Jr at Coy Banks Davis again rare Miss from the Applause midrange from Jaden X in a while and well he in a tie up here Georgetown maintaining Applause possession time will get sorber off the floor right now Fielder returns as the five Applause X third leading score in the Big East a year ago X is fouled by Moore no shot on the play Early Whistle by Rod r just the third foul on Syracuse you mentioned Jay neps in his scoring last year he averaged 18 a game on a team that didnt win you know a lot of his points were largely on volume its a delicate balance with Jay neps between him staying aggressive and him shooting his team into a disadvantage he he takes a lot of bad shots but he also hits a lot of tough ones Fielder on two is good with a sophomore for Boise TI at 27 seven ties nine lead changes in this first half for 27 a piece Applause 20 seconds nothing has happened in this possession for Syracuse Lon thought about a three very deliberate shot fight the back to Davis hell go to the line thanks to some late clock theatrics from Eddie lampin I dont know if you run a double here like I I think you you take your poison the the shot clock was winding down forc lampin to finish that because he is such a good passer again like Liam n in Taken hes Eddie Lins got a very particular set of skills and there are some games hes not going to be able to play in but in games he can hes a really good passer hes pretty good in the offensive glass and when he catches it deep he is tough to keep from finishing just thinking about a taken remake now with Eddie lampin and Liam ns role and how many Takens are there three 5 12 time for a reboot you think Eddie does accent work I actually think so his shoes are doing accent work right now hes got multicolored shoes Williams deep one another Miss three by Georg they just have not hit from there all season more B get fouled take a shot from Caleb Williams thatll be his second free throws coming for Chris Bell this this what Syracuse has been at their best offensively when they run they play more instinctively they play more athletically you go back to their game against Albany you know thats thats where they sort of pulled out early in that game and it actually started with their defense yes sir was a 10285 win Tuesday red alry was happy it started with their defense he was frustrated it didnt end with their defense they gave up 51 in the second half against al and he said I put some people in the end of the game I thought we were ready they werent ready we should not have made this a game so well see what red off second half substitutions look like under five to play first half developing game the arms lead by two Carlos with a foul before the shot his first on the body of Malik Applause Matt that was the concern for R off between the two guards and their ability to go off the dribble there just an isolation from Malik Mack the transfer from Harvard and coie told us he said to Malik Mack I need you to get seven eight assists your scoring is going to come from there natural point guard iy League freshman of the year a year ago one basket one assist so far in this Music game hes got it now for a deep one rebound for burs EPS a three from the corner another Miss three georgetowns one out of 11 from Deep Carlos got it on the r and then Davis went charging in theres a foul its going to go against geord toown a heck of a rebound by Jer Davis outside his area in traffic thats a third foul on Burks who had just checked back into the game 29 seconds ago you cant believe it K still talking to Clark about it co hes looking for somebody down the bench hes going to get Drew McKenna who is not played a ton this year 68 freshman 12 points per game in six games but with Burks and sorber both in foul trouble its an unexpected first half entry for Drew McKenna one one for Davis whos got a team High nine its kind of an unusual thing around these Parks a great scorer Off the Bench think about the Jim beheim days it was a six seven man rotation often a little bit more from the Syracuse bench this year Georgetown meanwhile dominated by their starting five its hard to have a deep bench in this era of the transfer quter because if a guy is on the bench hes probably not going to be in your program the next year and so its getting harder and harder for coaches to to get production off of their benches and look in the case of Georgetown they get really young off of their bench how tough will it be for Ed to build this the way he wants to think because thats the era were in because he has so many freshmen on the roster well it depends on what his nil coffers amount to you know unfortunately a lot of its coming down to that what you can afford to pay it was 2 and 18 in the Big East 9 and 23 overall a year ago theyve gone really cold from the field EPS from Fielder back to Fielder and a low skting pass and then PE with a slash and slam Mel PE was a great find speaking of the portal just a veteran guy whos played in a lot of big games transferred in from TCU was at Texas Tech before that has played in the NCA tournament an outstanding Defender and a really good cutter and the ball right now p is speed L ohing it into the sophomore Fielder and Lin Cooks inside hes got nine Eddie lekins best game probably since that Texas game you mentioned in Brooklyn a few weeks back inside fielder in between Freeman and lampin an easy two six for Drew Fielder not far off his season average Mo steps into a three and tips it to mat transition again Carlos is the only man back and he foul Zs cannot happen but how in other leagues I mean Duke Maryland in the early 2000s through the 2000 had a great rivalry and and then once Maryland went to the Big 10 Coach K didnt want to play that game anymore and that rivalry kind of died on the vine the fact that these schools are still playing is is huge I mean this rivalry is is so big for the sport was a 2year Hiatus when Syracuse went to the ACC but they played 10 straight years since the contract is up after this year but they certainly want to keep this game going so I dont think were going to get another hi8 Freeman tough Bo for the Freshman cuse back in front for use of his length too hes 69 and he plays all of it highest rated recruit to come here since Carmelo Anthony back in 2003 another Miss three by pe one for 12 from Deep for Georgetown which has been tremendous in the pain and they keep taking these threes early in the possession if a three comes late but put the pressure on Syracuses defense knocked away from him with a couple of options another early in the possession three this one will go jayen IPS with georetown second Applause triple line in the game for absorber whos been on the bench about 5 minutes with those two fouls has 10 to lead way Ramin down by Fielder itll be a one and one for Eddie lampin through fielders first I mean thats a challenge and its a killer fat with lampin and thats its a killer foul I mean youre youre 17 ft from the basket trying to do your work early and you end up getting called for a cheap one one one for lampin eight for 18 on the year at the line hell get the second tomorrows 6 Eastern after our womens basketball triple header are nothing but Nat crew breaks down the day in the ACC highlights an analysis of every womans game highlighted by that ranked on ranked UNC Georgia Tech matchup and look ahead of the coming week its all right here on the ACCC Network under 90 seconds to play in this first half Lin splits a pair at the line again 3736 of Georgetown Edge EPS off a screen from Fielder and py nearly tipped it in right over the top of Chris Bell who secures the rebound theres big Eddie again its been a oneman show for pockets of this game lampin left it short out of bounds and it was lamin fighting with McKennon its gonna stay with Syracuse as Eddie theyre not going SE theyre not going to double him there I mean theyre letting Fielder go oneonone and hes hes hes getting lampin to catch it where you want and then lampin just in three dribbles ends up in front of the rim I know you didnt like the double late a little while ago Z point where you do want to double him hes such a good passer like I you know Fielder played it well there Ty Davis back on the floor with 11 to Le the orange Applause Freeman shot clock six get to freshman McKenna getting a big test here and McKenna f a bailout with 34 on the clock on the Freshman Drew McKenna you said it bailout I mean this is exactly the shot you want Donnie Freeman taking just a bad foul a couple bad fouls here down the stretch of this half by Georgetown Applause this the free throw line is really kept Syracuses offense on life support a r Miss by Prim whos 27 of Music 32 and well get a timeout taken by Ed in between free throws back in 30 seconds to close the half Music Music on Music I think kys team has survived where Thomas sorber and foul trouble sorber checked out 623 Mark Georgetown was down two so theyve actually outscored Syracuse by three since that point that was not the case in their last game one week from yesterday sorber was on the bench with four fouls for a big part of a decisive 16 nothing West Virginia run as Theo has lost Applause 7360 sorber EPS double figures for the Hoya Davis and lampin for the orange and one more free throw coming for Donnie Freeman after the uh towel operators clean the floor its their moment the tow guys extensive training goes into what were witnessing right now with the tow WIP is that right extensive training you I know dreamed of being a tow guy I wasnt qualified you had to settle for playing division one basketball instead I was wonder if the fans were cheering about the tal guys Im told they were cheering about Kyle McCord whos about of similar import finished 10th in the Heisman Trophy voting the Syracuse quarterback first top 10 Syracuse player in the Heisman is Dwight f in 2001 for the first time since people can remember the Syracuse football program is is way ahead of the basketball program right now a school where both used to be truly Elite on the national level EP from Fielder EPS is in a tough place right now and Bell or Taylor Just slaps it away from him Syracuse has the timeout red off hes trying to call it the officials didnt see it they still dont see it Freeman travels that red ay is pleading with his players right now why didnt you see why didnt you take the time out and he was calling it for a few beats there about five Mississippi and it was a really well executed trap in the corner down on the other end by Freeman and and Taylor the number so he mcclouds going to check in because Thomas sorber just came back in for the final offensive possession so R will get his 74 senior out there and sorber catches it and misses badle on a three well this feels appropriate this rivalry 30 Syracuse won a barn burner 40 to 18 AR JY Manley Fieldhouse and now here at the Dome Syracuse venues over the year Orange in possession to start the second half Chris belt did not hit a field goal in that first half into lampin they work on Fielder out to Donnie Freeman who got off to a hot start into the half with eight and along two it will be shortened lamin though was fouled under the basket ex Drew Fielder with his second its not a good shot by Freeman a long contested twopoint shot youd love to see lampin press the issue more make Fielder have to guard some extended dribble there in the post so Fielder and sorber with two burs Off the Bench three Georgetown baks choa Moore draws the spins it out rebound to Fielder J NS a 10point first half for Georgetown sharing scoring lead with sorber also had 10 the Georgetown starters 34 of the 37 for the hoers ball screen with sorber into the body of Freeman and sorber sticks it home high level play by sorber he caught it in the pocket on that short roll Syracuse sent two to the ball and then he did the creative work after that game high doesen aoya is back on top home crowd standing until the first field goal to the half as is traditional Carlos passes up an open three and then throws it away in search of Freeman ho is quickly out on the bre nobody even saw p and another way too easy transition bucket surrendered by Syracuse leading to an orange timeout turnovers for touchdowns put so much pressure on your defense you know and again Syracuse and the half courts had their issues when you just handed up on a silver platter Georgetown has athletes in the floor Music ladies gentlemen emphasis because red archery spent all day at practice yesterday talking about this to me its a matter of want to we have seen this a lot today guys jogging to get back on defense I me its a bad turnover it obviously send Georgetown off running but we saw a lot in the first half and on that play there guys jogging back Adrien ay said to Matt Park Ro the orange at halftime weve got to get our transition defense back we gave them too much message not yet received as Georgetown gets the first four points out of the break turning for the timeout with Lan on Fielder thats Eddie lkin Zone I mean they theyve got to its got to be a steady die of that Fielder cannot go him especially when he catches it that deep and not scored more than six in any of the last five games 21 total hes got a dozen here and hes going to try to De absorber had to throw it to Mack Mack lefthanded player gets to the right and Scoops and scores Georgetown back by four nice job putting his head down and driving it same five out of the timeout for the orange Carlos had a very quiet first half only two points one assist Lin again Lin finishes hes got Applause 14 so Georgetown team 7 and0 and home all against non power Conference teams their losses at home to Notre Dame on the road against West Virginia Max Strokes at three he can get it going now in the first half its a guy at Harvard last year led the country in scoring the first month of the year I mean you you you know he could put it the ball in the basket Max got seven tonight 13 game on the year S7 game last year for Harvard Applause Bell back again one of these guards that can take over a g hes trying to do so PV soaring in and hes the last to touch it again that was in transition that was early just attacking Syracuses defense that wasnt quite Applause set laen team that 201 and 12 a year ago again theyre own four against the power Conference teams they face this year winds at home some very close ones early in the year against Mo Youngstown State Elijah Moore fade away will Flatline its way in Moore not pretty but effective for his second make is that how you what you call that a flatline its a nice move to create a space and then we have a little Flatline up there on the on the rim we call that a euphemism I think Fielder around Applause Freeman thatll be Georgetown ball we come back this game is being played inside Georg down and Syracuse back and forth again the ho is looking for a major road win for that classic Jim Bim R smile on his face talking to Red arree about the kembe sorbers Miss ta out by pe and uh red said I remember playing against him and shooting a ball that went over the backboard because I was just so desperate not to have it blocked EPS with a three and a sixpoint SP toown lead thats the largest of the game for the ho the Tumo Alonzo Morning play together for spell part of that Legacy of outstanding bigs for Georgetown a program that is a long way away from the scho years trying to get back there slowly but surely under Ed coie this would be a significant win even if these teams are down Freeman that is smothered by sorber Music got sorber on Don Donnie Freeman I in part I think so he doesnt have to guard Eddie lampin and can keep him out of foul trouble but really good timing on that block there he placed wise Beyond his years fifth in the Big East nearly two blocks a game for the 610 sorber theres Jer Davis back on the floor he drew Georgetown fouls in the first half hes going to draw another here it will not be on sorber its Max second yeah the reach in there which doesnt you dont need to its overh helping by Malik Mack but you can see the emphasis I mean right off the inbound red arrey calls a set where Jer Davis goes oneonone to try to pick up that third on sorber first half Davison 11 five for six at the Applause line throws have been an issue for Syracuse two for Davis 35 points in his last two games first down 29 44 five minutes gone by in this second half it was a tie game at the half its a fivepoint lead for Georgetown theres not one here in the go in the last couple of Applause tries Matt sorber facing lampin and PE weasel his way into the paint there for a foul against Chris Bell hes been Relentless hes been relentless on the offensive glass Mike peave and hes coming from the the weak side the opposite perimeter which is a great place to offensive rebound from and hes a phenomenal Applause athlete seven NCAA tournament games in his career you mentioned the career Texas Tech TCU he bulying his way again this time Taylor got a piece from behind see if the orange can run a little bit with Carlos and Carlos on the off hand spins it home and a great decision to put on the accelerator and take advantage of the unsettled defense when is his crowd going to make it impact not here as EPS with a three silencer for Georgetown Jaden EPS with Applause Music 16 Davis go help and nice job by sorber there Carlos on the deck I mean where is Syracuse defensively this is way too easy again for Georgetown and if we can only get a view Inside the Mind of red arrey whos going to bring in patar Mage for the first time Applause today an eightpoint lead the largest of the game for the visitors from the capital Morris three Rs out Lin offensive blast lampin leftand it again you see Dan aastan off the Syracuse Ben the assistant screaming trying to push his team back as sorber misses an open look down the floor to L Moore is going to get called for a foul way behind the play here Jaden EPS just hit the ground hard Ed kie is way out on the floor asking for a monitor review cuse F number eight Elijah Moore his second personal second T its Mos second foul that happened well behind the play in the back Applause court the officials are going going to go to the monitor now lampin and sorber have to be separated he doesnt mind what just happened he wanted his team to try to get under Syracuses skin a little bit there and well see if this lightens up the Dome at all and it appears it will lets play ball Brown has the one here since 2016 John Thompson the thir well the ho is to a victory in that game EPS on the drive and thats going to be a tie up Taylor got the hand in there with the three fouls and forces a tie up the arrow stays with Georgetown and this is Health defense you know Carlos H he he may have fouled him but regardless that that was he gets into the ball and a nice job converging on it by the help Eddie lampin now ask in for more up and down the court here at the do EPS sorber for a moment there trying to get it to him and Lin rips it away Carlos well settled defensively by the hoes Carlos for Applause lin big man goes to work again he had Fielder draped all over him they cannot thats a fourth foul Chris un Fielder they cannot guard him and what theyre doing is theyre running that hand off on that open side so when the ball goes back to lampin hes got the whole side to himself and hes taking up the space that fielders giving him and then once they go body to body theres nothing Fielder can do except the foul so Fielder picks up the technical for his third moments later the personal Jordan Burks Off the Bench David patiently waiting a fade away way too strong EX in the hands of Lucas Applause Taylor maybe this is going to be Lucas Taylors moment and a tough start to his Syracuse career hes certainly been in the thick of it the last minute or so mat PE Sol Drive and finish for Micah PE for him to get to that wing all the way to the rim theres got to be help but what an athlete heres more its got for three ref Anda 5655 EPS rolling it into sorber hes got Davis on him burs will pass up a three and Brooks gets fouled its starting to feel like the Big East just a little bit here in the words of the great bust of Rhymes give me some Mo which can really do things to you in Syracuse hoping to use the energy of the building and come back from an eightpoint deficit here in the second half 11 minutes to play theyve cut the Georgetown lead to one in the 100th meeting sorber for burs burs wild pass found its way to Micah peie dying moments of the shot clock its Burks and its rebounded by Davis its one of Syracuses best defensive possessions of the day lampin with eight Davis 12 30 the oranges 55 theyve also combined to draw 10 fouls Carlos will draw a foul and the orange can take the lead back at the line jquan Carlos has really been a steadying factor hes had some plays today youd want to take back but hes J Carlos slowly and slowly be becoming more comfortable you know hes playing with almost a 3 to one assist to turnover and I think JJ Starling being out you know obviously you say you want him in the lineup but him being out as I think sped up the timetable on Carlos hes looked much more acclimated much more comfortable in running their team that is the Oranges leading score in JJ Sterling 20 a game fractured left hand in practice December the 2nd the good news is he does not need surgery theyre hoping hell return around January 1st but as you mentioned and say this to both of us its allowed Carlos to step up how they coexist a problem for the new year but for now theyre getting a little more out of Carlos whos put Syracuse back in front sorber rejected by Davis right back to Mack and EPS with the ball in his hand in a game high 18 nowhere to go burs Davis is on the ground and Syracuse has turned it up defensively Carlos down the floor and fouled again and these stops are allowing them to get out in transition I mean their half court defense has been turned up and part of it is theyre not theyre converging and their help is there really nice another great defensive play by Davis which they gets Carlos out in the open floor two great plays by G Davis on the other end a block shot and then the steal leading to the fast break M pes first six and a half for Georgetown freshman Caleb Williams will take over for burs Carlos a year ago shot 89 from the line at hopster we down this year but three for three Applause today they four for four threepoint lead for Syracuse a 132 orange run back on the ball hes got seven points seven assists and he brecks the tapped by Lin into Daviss hands Carlos crossing over PE in the corner that three short for more and wrestled Away by pe three on two Georgetown finish for Jaden X lot of contact to believe theres no foul there my goodness but again a play in the in transition and a really good decision by P and EP says 20 probably should have had a chance of 21 a peave in the face of Carlos two in the face of Carlos thats a seventh Georgetown foul of the half so one and one for jquan Carlos coming up be in the bonus its big to be you know for Syracuse now to be in a bonus it really has kept their offense on life support in the first half now the question is can they make them the foul line has been such an issue this year for Music Syracuse P there saying watch his foot telling the officials make sure Carlos isnt step over the line Applause five for five now for Carlos Syracuse team that shoots it to 69 from the free throw Applause line caros 6 for six nice little second half for Applause him nine to play in the D its a threepoint Syracuse lead geps has been the man and and he over dribbles it driving into two bodies Syracuse defense Applause converging Carlos gets a switch with sorber hes telling more get it to lamin who had PE on instead Davis a mo jier Davis slithering finish will Jer Davis has become the best player in this game on both ends been an impact on defense and look at the craft a little smooch smooch power conference its a guessing game as to how theyre going to fit in for the most part from early inconsistency gyro Davis has been a really nice fit here hes been great hes hes a jack of all trades does a little bit of everything you know hes a grownup on a team with some young guys I mean thats where you remember transfers used to have to sit out a year and and Im not making an AR Davis it feels like it was 20 years Applause ago D you youre tell youre not making an argument that that should still happen right but what it used to do is those guys would have to sit out theyd become acclimated you know and then they would hit the ground running now theyre especially the up transfers drinking from a fire hose earlier mat short of the three rebound wrestled Away by Taylor the lead is six this is the largest its been in the game for Syracuse Carlos find the back cutting Davis a takeaway Eddie lampkins just trying to grab Mack to stop that break it will be lamin first foul sixpoint lead at the underage Syracuse trying to hang on back on the air wve soon and we know hes probably watching every basketball game at once today so sended our love and thoughts to Dicky V announcing hes cancer free somebody whos done so much for that fight and for that Foundation we seen a lot of these great games over the years sixpoint lead for s PE miss up and it will go to Syracuse what has changed Chris man Ill tell you what out of a timeout what a really nice set drawn up by Ed kie in a game like this youre down six under eight minutes thats got to go man I mean you got to be able to finish that right at the basket 122 Run for the Orange thas sorber is two points and a half for Georgetown 10 in that first first Applause half deep one from Moore and out for three sorber got it first show of Zone from Georgetown in the second half we saw about five or six possessions in the first of that Fielder passes up on the three roll into to sorber can they get him going down the stretch gets it back from Ms thats why that layup that Miss layup by PB is so critical they have not shot it well in this game and theyre not going to win this game by shooting threes five for 22 now from Deep for the Hoya have not hit 10 threes in a game all season his hammer way short not a good shot hes not the guy at this point and good F by m thats his eighth assist and just another example of the first big down for Georgetown sneaking behind the transition defense of Syracuse and getting a dunk Taylor with Carlos Davis Moore and lamp couldnt patch that pass from Carlos Syracuse turns it over again three shows of Zone from Georgetown out of the timeout three empty possessions from Syracuse into sorber good catch good patience his second basket of the half and another really nice design on that set you clear out the backside good job by sober pinning his man good pass over the top Jak Quan Carlos and Syracuse take the third time out of the game with 553 to go backto back baskets for red hoes just really good design nice job by sorber riding lampin out of the paint and with no help on that backside good pass over the top good finish but hes really Advanced I mean hes got Advanced footwork great hand hands first of his Georgetown Syracuse experiences he seems to be enjoying it his so is down by two and led by as many as eight Syracuse has led by as many as six Zone look again Davis out of it to Carlos interior collapses and its back to Moore Moore trying to get around ma thats a really up two and it goes Georgetown starts in the zone They transition to a man at the end of The Possession and Elijah Moore The Freshman making a play at the end of the shot clock snaps a scoring Dr of about 3 minutes s oh D hatch and finish backto back buckets the lead back to Music two five to play the doome 16 for sorber to lead the hoyya behind EPS hasnt scored in a while but still has those 20 Davis caught in the air more with a tough patch and the foul against Matt deep in the shot clock thatll send more to the line for a one and one the Killer and thats where again being in the bonus is huge you know I I think if youre Jer Davis shoot that shot when you catch it in the middle there cuz Eddie Lins got great inside position for the offensive board you cannot foul at the end of end of the shot Music clock one of one for more eight for 10 on the year at the line misses the front end another tough shooting day at the line for Syracuse run around 70 Applause sver fou by lampin thats six on the orange so next one puts Georg toown and bonus sorber screens for EPS screen gives Georgetown the lead another great design you get STS on the flare and a big time shot to take the lead how good has Ed coing been these last couple of minutes Carlos green answer from the corner for the orange an unlikely Source two of 12 from three coming into this game his biggest three of the year a season High 13 for Carlos under four to play P wants Mack off a screen from Fielder Mack will roll it into Taylor and get bumped and fouled so Malik Mack Goes to the line when we come back the fourth foul on Lucas Taylor its dueling threes one on each end for you little flare screen popping Jaden neeps he says Im wet and on on the other end jquan Carlos Big Time game shot there just got big shots from out there there was Jade nips for Georgetown for the lead tayquon Carlos answering for Syracuse and Malik Mack at the line to try to tie this game the 100th meeting between Georgetown and Syracuse like most of them hes coming down to a frenetic Applause finish keys for you Chris for these teams in the last 350 taking care of the basketball making free throws these become big opportunities in these high leverage games and then securing the defensive glass amps goes one for two and then Syracuse does not secure the defensive blast sorber with the offensive rebound after a missed free throw those the first free throws Georgetown had taken in 19 minutes of game time sorber three for the lead rebounded by by PB shot clock does not reset Jaden EPS to the rim and Georgetown is back in front failure to secure the defensive glass twice how about mik a pee and the job hes done in the offensive glass for Georgetown today 25 for rep sets the season High Moore drives it strong Moore no Lin tipped it rebound Malik Mack and he says settle down boys love the decision by Elijah Moore pressing the issue at the basket sorber is going to take it in the lamin and get bumped lamin stunned Adrian alre Bamboozled its a foul lamkins third and a one and one for sorber good Music call so sorber for toown best free throw shooter on the year 79 his first taste to the Syracuse geown rivalry he misses the front end a killer missing a front ends like turning it over you might as well punt it into the 10th r Applause seven to shoot for Davis one dribble and a rebound to sorber two good looks you got to finish through contact Elijah Moore on the last possession and that one right there 220 to go the lead is one for Georgetown pe oh man just dribbled it off his fo now the Zone from Georgetown is really neutralized Eddie lampin you know in that man they they were able to isolate him he was able to play back down bully ball Syracuse hasnt had Freeman in the game for 13 minutes Davis denied at The Rim what a play by sorber The Freshman with a rejection and M the other end will be fouled it was all set up by Thomas sorber a shot stopping first year Hoya and two free throws at the other end for mat this a big time block and goinging right at the shot blocker was Davis and thats a bad call that is not a foul especially with the contact on the other end on the last two shots from Syracuse to call that foul youre looking at the game differently so mik a pebi nearly a double double one and one he gets FL bounce my goodness dont forget coming up next Florida state two lanane all donation Orange Bowl basketball classic ACC network streaming live on the ESPN app our games going a little bit late catch the beginning of that game there Syracuse has just made its first sub since the 1507 one with Donnie Freeman in the game for Davis and theyll make another one here with Chris Bell coming in for EDD no its going to be Lucas Taylor instead not lampin is this a counter to the zone you think getting Freeman in Bell it is no question and look I like Jer d in the middle there hes now not in the game so I I think youre looking for one of these guys he puts in to hit a three the fourth worst threepoint shooting team among power Conference teams Syracuse Freeman for Carlos gets it around to Moore good close out by peave Freemans got to look at the basket there deep one more no good rebound swatted by lamin down the Fielder Georgetown possesses with a 20 to go thats where I I like drer Davis at the foul line Donnie Freeman caught it he was wide open didnt even look at the basket Fielder against Freeman sorber has really stepped up great find Peavey holding and the Miss is not followed up by Mack got Flex cut Georgetown runs a lot of flex another Miss layup by pe into the final minute Georgetown by three at the Dome Bo has having W here since 2016 Carlos Freeman for the tie no and a rebound to sorber five straight misses nearly three and 1 half minutes without a point for Syracuse T to shoot for Mack heres hips hes been the man today EP drives and scores it 27 for jayen EPs and the lead is five for Georgetown you dont foul there if youre Syracuse right move but youre relying on your defense and Jay nips is so strong to his right I mean 98 of his finishes are going to his right hand and theyve run that curl as you can say the same for Georgetown this still might feel like Ed COs most significant win in a year plus with Applause Georgetown win today theyll be just one off of last years win toll they need to stop here Carlos drives it and Carlos is tied up and fouled what a bad foul you know again at this at this point in the game if youre youre Syracuse theres still plenty of time I like driving the ball there cuz cuz Georgetown typically you know theyre not trying to give up three so youre not going to get a whole lot of help and theyre you assume theyre not trying to foul this is a mystifying play by pe caros seven for seven at the line one more making a one possession game lamin out Taylors back in he does have four fouls he makes us do foul right away for sure I think you you let the ball come in you trap it well you dont let it come in you deny it to come in but once it does you trap it and then you lay a foul on Carlos hits him both pey will get it to EPS to inbound Freemans on the ball now pey will throw it into EPS double team comes and EPS oh good timeout got saved by a timeout by shorts down because Syracuse had the possession arrow and EPS came very close to traveling with it and Syracuse before the timeout was called yes I thought he did before he put it on the floor in that deep corner there with length on the ball you got Donnie Freeman and he cannot move the inbounder PE searching for EPS has a timeout in the ma he is fouled and a quick Music whistle sometimes coaches will say they dont love when a foul is anticipated at the end of a game yeah well they I mean thats exactly where that coffin corner back there thats exactly where you wanted Georgetown to catch it and its the fourth on Carlos two shot foul for M 70 on the year and he missed is the first if he misses the second the a foul if youre at cooler yeah you do but its it depends on when you do it like theres too much time left if you can get the ball Advanced to half court then you would now you need three if youre Syracuse quickly two possession game got to be a quick one for Carlos hustling his way to the basket he misses a two its rebounded by serber knocked away Freeman it doesnt matter Georgetown storms into the Dome and the 100th meeting between these great rid
