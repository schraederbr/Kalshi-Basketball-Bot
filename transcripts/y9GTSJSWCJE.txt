appearances with those teams so quite an honor indeed great to be here blustery but sunny outside like many parts of the country pretty serious weather last night in the Carolinas but everybodys in their seats and we are ready to go with Carolina really rolling right now leading the ACC in mid January the lone unbeaten team in the ACC they have ripped off five in a row their defense has been absolutely outstanding you think of Carolina you think of a fast break you think of points they can score but man they get after it defensively they absolutely do to the Delight of their head coach Hubert Davis who has been talking defense for his entire two plus Seasons that hes been at the helm and its starting to be realized here Applause now kadoo the point guard finds an opening off the window for two and a quick start for the heels and a great play by Kad recognizing that with Armando B getting so much attention he was going to have an easy run to the layup able to get it high off the ground coming up a really nice floor game this week against NC State as Carolina ran away with that one late jumper on the way here by Chris Bell but offt Target he comes in averaging about 11 points per game Syracuse at 11 and4 look at the starting lineups now brought to you by CDW for North Carolina Davis Bott Kau Ingram and Ryan they can score with anybody has mentioned about 83 points a game but defensively Cory theyve held opponents below 60 three consecutive games and a miss from threepoint Land by Ingram who had a huge game on the boards against the wolf pack and Wednesday had 19 rebounds yeah and Amanda bot was in single figure rebounding in that game and for Syracuse starting line up by CDW Mintz gets 19 a game Chris Bell makes 36 from three Eli Brown going to see increased roll for their team on the drive could overa lay it up with no and and Slamm to the floor on the foul with 1829 to go and able to get up Malik Brown as he picks up the personal from Armando bot Bott picking up an early foul you see Malik Brown unable to get his feet under him taking a hard spill on that one but when you consider Hubert Davis and University of North Carolina they dont want Bey getting in foul trouble in this first half dealt with that on Wednesday night in Robin yeah he picked up a flagrant foul which was debatable in the first half of that game but sat for long stretches Bell will Swit that in from threepoint L and Bell coming off of his 20o season High last time out vers Boston College getting off to a great start here offensively kicked around Davis off the fake hell locked up a long one but too strong so bell comes away with it Syracuse with nine sophomores on their roster not a great shooting team they only make 45 32 from the threepoint line men on his first drive denied by Bott Bott doing a great job staying home and it was deflected off minson on the play and Bott coming in he got recognition earlier for scoring his 2000th point but with that block shot hes now only two away from fourth all time at the University of North Carolina and Amo botts going to have one of those resumes thats Unforgettable by time he finishes this Fifth Season cross the board you mentioned the 2000 points a very nice moment for him at midport before the game got underway and also he of course is the programs alltime Leb rebounding leader as well on the Move heres Davis Davis took the foul before the shot that was with eight on the shot clock and hes hit by Judah Min will pick up number one but you like to see RJ Davis being aggressive early a great start for him especially in this building can really spark his team into one of those great offensive nights weve seen from Carolina inam swings Ryans open from the corner those are the kind of shots you expect him to make b c got one dribble down strong up for two regardless of the shot going up you always have to account for where number five in white is going to be offensive rebounding extraordinaire Taylor will pull up pop at the elbow cant get it to Applause go Carolina new schedule one of the toughest in America kenpom ranking it at number six entry for Bon and two and he looks like he means to be involved in the offense here this first half in a big way but with mahe McLoud out North Carolina is recognizing theyre going to get the basketball inside the Bott for him to have a chance against Malik Brown who has a 2in height advantage on also outweighs on on the inside Min slamming on the brakes lost his footing and lost the basketball up ahead for cormack Ryan on the attack cant lay it in Ingram but a foul to go against Syracuse so the heels on the breakout Starling with a foul OB be a week ago you and I went into the North Carolina Clemson game talking about RJ Davis and PJ Hall as the ACC Player of the Year Front Runners Amo bacot may have been a little offended about the fact that his name wasnt mentioned because he has been lights out ever since playing great basketball well that game he shut Hall down I mean that was one of the great defensive games Armando has played at North Carolina it absolutely was and again we talked about the defense of North Carolina but a lot of it starts with Bott and being able to Anchor the middle communicating from from under the basket to his teammates but also defending the rim that resistance blocking shots and thatll go for corack Ryan very good foul shooter 91 Jaylen Washington now on the game for Hubert Davis you see the pressure from North Carolina right to Ryan and hell lay that one up and in KOB this is the way they made the comeback against Florida State on December 2nd down big and hu Davis using the pressure early in this game and the crowd is on their feet 70 Run for the heels they open up a 93 Advantage starting with a good five and lays it off the window great response by JJ Starling recognizing the crowd getting into the game better to attack the basket there and wait for a jump shot trying to get inside and backs it in he can make that shot all day Harrison Ingram the transfer from Stanford he has made all the difference for Carolina slithering in heres minz trying to change his body angle the tip is going to be up and in on the second effort by Malik Brown but you got to get back you look how quickly North Carolina gets the ball down the floor even after made field goal Ryan being very active and thatll be lay up and in a quick strike by Washington youre right you blink in Carolinas on the offensive end yeah even after May field goals North Carolina is one of the very few teams that runs after misses and makes and you see how quickly they get down to the offensive end of the Flor Bell will back it out he takes a spell right to the logo shot clock at 10 here Starling on Davis Kind of a line driver Washington grabs the rebound J Davis coming in averaging 20 points a game Ingram he can be very dangerous beyond that threepoint line Washington trying to find that Baseline Scoops it up now knocked away wa Davis got in there so fast and draws the foul he beat everybody he did the loose ball in the paint but you love seeing RJ Davis averaging 20 points per game not only doing the things that look good but doing the tough stuff as Applause well now coming up here in North Carolina Armando Bott a curtain call for him nice moment at midcourt just moments ago grader reached out to me and said hey I want to come work out with you really and yeah and thats who he is you know when you watch him on the court you made the comment hes laidback hes reserved hes as chill as he gets hes not that way off the court he is a he is a Class Clown hes a guy that hes always in the center of attention but one of the best young people that you will ever meet and happy to see him having the success that hes had here he had a great career 75 double doubles number one all time at Carolina we mentioned the game he had against Clemson recently hit 16 rebounds in that game so its odd to see him coming off a single single on Wednesday nine points and five rebounds against NC NC State so he looks very motivated today he bounce right back Carolina on top 157 on the orange no as we talk about Armond botts Jersey hanging in rackers as Jud to Min steps on the sideline right in front of the North Carolina bench theres a criteria involved in having your jersey up there I dont know the full criteria I know its ACC Player of the Year its First Team all Amer there are different things that you have to reach now there are a bunch of jerseys up there but the retired jerseys up front are different so theres theres different classifications Ill have to make sure I get the research National play of the year heres Ingram off the window no big rebound by Washington to the other side of the iron thats just pure will last time Jayla Washington played in this building had a career high 17 points a career high seven rebounds so hes building off of that effort here confident playing at home already with four rebounds Brown working hard in the paint kicks it out for copelan and a reach in foul by corack Ryan its a big guy play here yeah Harrison Ingram cant get it to go jayen Wason doing what is necessary for North Carolina bigs you crash the offensive glass you want to be special in the Carolina blue this is exactly what you do and Washington able to get that done and two second chance points Carolinas 6 and0 at home though they havent been home very much the pullup is going to spin out Jud minz with a early Miss 177 Carolina yeah only the second ACC game here at home for North Carolina but the threegame winning streak on the road truly you in my opinion poal been right as to the top team in the ACC right now as a front Front Runners for winning this Championship this year even though we still got a long season to go another run here 8 to nothing Syracuse better be very careful this is an easy place to get run out of the building if you make a lot of mistakes Copeland gives up the dribble Williams on the attack tried for the window and draws the foul and North Carolina averaging 83 points a game they rank number 14 in offensive efficiency theyre number eight now in defensive efficiency Arizona Duke and Auburn the only other teams ranking in the top 15 in both of those he but this is not normal territory for North Carolina we know about them being able to score they ever since Dean Smith was the leader here youve always been able to score that wasnt an issue defensively that has been the struggle for Hubert Davis over the first two and a half Seasons but something clicked and it I believe it happened Midway through the Florida State game they were down double figures in that game on December the 2nd they went to the pressure defensively and that changed things for North Carolina of course they lost to Yukon and Kentucky after that but they recognize what they have to do to be successful and they are putting it theyre executing it very well right now you mentioned that schedule Arkansas Tennessee Yukon Kentucky Oklahoma Clemson all in the top 25 when they played and going four and two the turnover Davis will scoop it up working on Starling and before the basket there be no basket there it was fouled before the shot went in foul on Starling is his second already 1249 to go here in the first half at Chapel Music Hill and red ay will get Kyle cuff in the game guy who can hit a threepointer not necessarily A Forte for Syracuse he beat Boston College last time out beat Pittsburgh to losses to Duke and Virginia in conference play Virginia loss was very early that was another d December 2nd matchup in the first ACC game for new head coach Adrien ay the bounce here for Copeland Airborne draws a foul 198 former teammate of yours by the way red ay yeah red one of the four ACC alumni coaching at their alma mater alongside Kenny Payne of course Hubert Davis on the other sideline and John shy interesting the only one of these three the 30 mid30s year old sh that still has their hair everyone else going with the uh lower cut nowadays and I understand it completely my guy red going with the with the with the ball head and Hubert can pretty much make the same claim Hubert doesnt have the same hairstyle he had back in the day still got hair little bit just not the same same style Davis trying to Slender the pass there to bacon and picked off by copelan copelan wants to go all the way spins it up there the tip the follow neither one of those go for C and Syracuse has to commit a foul out of frustration they had great chances there thatll go against C is first and a ninepoint lead here talk about you guys being teammates on this particular group now there you are thats both of us about 40 lbs ago lets start with that but and of course in the far left corner would be one Roy Williams who was our head coach on the first segment of that trip we actually had training camp in Lawrence its back when Ol Roy was the head coach of the jhawks before the the return here to Chapel Hill Davis with the Miss how did that team do team the team ended up winning the gold medal in Spain a month later but this the that actual tournament we lost the qualifying game in Argentina well from the corner and the security people when we lost the the last game there told Roy Williams coach Im so glad you guys lost that game and he told him why you know its good for your country to win he told him simply no I dont think i have got you guys out here had you won that game not safely right the Civil Rights Movement RJ Davis of North Carolina thats a tattoo of Malcolm X Dr King and Malcolm X only met one time 1964 in Washington DC some notes about Dr King many may not know this his birth name was Michael King but changed at 28 years old to Martin Luther King Jr Obie Im the one of the many that did not know that and I can guarantee you that all of my papers that I had the choice of who I was going to write on was either on Martin Luther King or Malcolm X and I did not know that information so we all learning each and every day you come here to ESPN learn some history there you go heres Davis to S down on the money with a triple five early points think of History he may be one of those guys getting a 2000 Point ball at some point too he has opportunity to come back for a fifth season and thats something that RJ Davis may take advantage of senior now minz trying to get rolling uses the glass beautifully for two Judah Mintz coming off at one one for seven performance against Boston College and the only made field goal for him was a threepoint basket so this a got at leaves the ACC in free throw attempt so hes got to get to the rim swings it Trimble opens up for him beautifully and hell lay it in that trembles improved threepoint shooting forces Defender come track him down off the line but no help there when he attacks the basket very smart shooter rarely takes a poor shot try to get it inside here for heo but a bad missfire there for the 611 junr too The Freshman nice give there and that leads to a foul as Withers gets hit two the missz getting to the sweet spot but does a great job of pulling up going to the midrange not trying to get to the rim and getting the offensive foul with then the ball movement getting it out of the double team but bot does a great job sealing off hea giving sep tro an easy roll right to the basket and of course Seth Trum will I have a thing going on to where hes supposed to actually dunk that so there will be a conversation after this game he did have a big time Ali oop against Pittsburgh after our first conversation so he knows hes supposed to Dun his brother JP too dumped everything everything and Im sure hes watching Seth right now saying why didnt you dump that you know it your phone blows up which it does about nine times a game I know where thats coming from with sinks that really good at the file line to transfer from L will for so he has given Carolina nice Lift Off the Bench gets a big hug Huber Davis has a a much larger rotation this year than you would have seen him play in the past one of the reasons why he can extend this pressure full court but you see one of the things theyre doing trying to keep the basketball out of the hands of Judah Miss so Syracuse looking for an answer Williams straight on another line driver wont drop Ingram with the rebound there 19 rebounds against NC State the most a Carolina player ever against the wolf pack really thats a record that Bott doesnt hold Bott has most of them and now he has two more points give him six 28 12 a crowd really starting to come to life here noon time tip here at Chapel Hill mince will draw the foul by Bon of the act of trying a threepointer Mondo Bott picks up his second foul but on a previous possession he does a great job getting low into the legs of his Defender and then immediately the quick Spin and reverse on the other side not much will Brown can do about that one as bacock gets to two but the second foul is going to force him to sit for a while here in this first half so thats been a pattern these last couple of games hes a little frustrated Min at the line front rims the first one 79 there four more college basketball games highlighting our ESPN schedule today featuring these two number six Kentucky taking on Texas AM Arkansas and Florida after that eight more hours of college basketball you can also watch on the ESPN app from anywhere so mince at the line actually began the last game against Boston College on the bench a violation of a team rule red ay said minor no big deal hes going to start against Carolina that they wanted to make that point and that one thrown away and hes going to be on the line tried to scoop it up there Benny Williams tried to scoop it and stepped on the line so be Carolina ball right idea by Kad because Washingtons open but hes never looking for the basketball Benny Williams not expecting for it to go off the back of Washington unable to track that one down so good fortune for the tar Hills to be able to maintain that possession North Carolina wearing throwback uniforms today from their teams in the late 60s are great teams they went to three consecutive final fours Charles Scott right in the mix one of my favorite alltime Celtics oh yes one of my favorite by the way he won me Emmy for the record so just so he he was known very much as Charlie Scott yeah and thats how we refer to Scott refer to him as Charlie Scott so I had the opportunity and this is 10 12 years ago to come here spend the day with him in Chapel Hill we walked up and down Franklin Street we sat on the floor at Carmichael we did a thing interview for a couple hours and he told me then he prefers to be Charles Scott not Charlie Scott but of course the legendary Charlie Scott is one of the greatest accs ever seen of course the first scholarship AfricanAmerican athlete here at University of North Carolina Dean Smith called him Charles Dean Smith did call him Charles Boston we knew him was Charlie one of the classier players you were can find anywhere round and out there by mitz in transition is Trimble open for a triple cashes that in we talked about the improved shooting from Seth Trimble ran him off the line on the first one this time he steps up and knocks it down and just like Jaya Washington the last time Seth Trumble was here he had a career high in points and rebounds hes looking like he may go for another one good job by Williams and the save by Syracuse Williams staying home and the Slam by minz great job by the orange not giving up on that Benny Williams does a good job getting back in transition Washington gives it up from mgram yes sir another threepointer and a timeout Carolina Smith used to take them to lunch at VAR restaurants around town very deliberately at the time of the civil rights movement and they had a spectacular relationship OB I know youre a history major so you know this but the reason why Charles Scott decided to come to University of North Carolina is because Dean Smith actually took him to church on his official visit with the urging of Dean Smiths Pastor he brought him to church and that is what took him over the top and knew that North Carolina was the place for him to be because Dean Smith felt as though he wanted to include him in his life not just on the court but also off the court Dean Smith you know way ahead on the floor but also in terms of social issues and what really mattered in America at that time continues to be thats going to be a turnover on Brown just under eight minutes to go they turned it over six times and its all Tar Heels early Carolina bench is a Difference Maker this year too they have 13 Off the Bench 13 points so far in this game qu yeah we talked about the rotation that they have and when you can have confidence in Washington and tremble coming in off the bench and giving you you know quality minutes as well as Withers now youve got that rotation of eight or nine guys that can be successful K continues to make them better if his facilitating and does so against the Zone on that possession against NC State this week 116 assists only a couple of turnovers really good floor game when they needed it and another turnover Carolina with the pick leading 36 16 but Obie you look at it Carolina with this huge lead and they havent had to rely on Davis and bacock to do it theyve had so many different guys Step Up Syracuse coming out of the timeout in the zone and you see immediately cadell knows exactly where Ingram is he never looks at him because he doesnt want the defense to know he knows where he is but does a great job attacking and dropping it all for a dime freshman continues to grow barely turns it over its up top here for Chris Bell on a crossover Washington went for the block and he committed the foul so the heels up by 20 366 Bell will be at the line where he rarely goes Chris Bell who added about 10 lb of muscle said he gave up candy and soda and he just ate everything the mom made well have another womens college basketball triple header forie tomorrow afternoon starts at 100 on ESPN number 21 FSU hosting number 11 Virginia Tech and then Reese and number seven LSU take on Auburn and we cap the afternoon with Tennessee and Texas AM at College Station so some womens college basketball royalty on display tomorrow now where will you be of course you you cover all sports in everything basketball especially where will you be Ill be right here at North Carolina shot by Ryan wont go a little bit too strong from threepoint land so youll have the great days of Kelly and the Tar Heels and taken on Virginia heres Mintz off the back of the iron Syracuse having a lot of trouble making their triples its been a season long issue the swing here for Davis RJ yes got that one to go you know syrac staying with the zone right now we had an opportunity to talk with head coach Adrian arrey pregame I asked him how much are you playing The Zone he said we havent played it much but at times the manto man has been a struggle and its been a struggle with him here trying to defend North Carolina earlier in this game mcbryan freeze that one up Davis with the terrific pass Withers couldnt finish D Hill is not missing many opportunities like that Mintz inside no hes had a rough start here when they really need him averaging 19 cadell Davis gets a good spot and sinks the three RJ Davis with 10 and with that threepointer RJ Davis has now had consecutive threepoint field goals made 13 games the record is 15 by Justin Jackson in 2017 a year that North Carolina also went on to win a National Championship Jackson 15 in a row in 2017 as you mentioned and Elliot K does a great job finding RJ across Court RJ recognizing B to shoot the shot blocker coming out trying to take away the three run them off the line the side step and knocks down the three ball 40 shter beond the threepoint line for a 6o senior out of weight Plains New York 522 left in the first half all Carolina theyre pretty much getting anything they want and your earlier point this is with Armando Bott on the bench 2000 points score best rebounder statistically in the history of North Carolina and he hasnt played a ton for the second straight game and yet theyre rolling they are rolling along and and when you come home and North Carolina has not played here in a couple of weeks their last game here on this floor was a 45point win over Charleston Southern but they have so much confidence in this building but that confidence only grew when they went away and beat three top 75 in the NCAA net teams on the road held each one of those teams under 60 points yubert Davis now has a lot more confidence in their defense and their offense is doing exactly what theyre used to doing here in the home and I absolutely agree with you and you and I have seen a lot of Carolina here early on this season the defense is the separator weve seen so much of them that Steve kersner gave me he wants to make sure Im taking care of at breakfast time he gave me a box of raspberry poptarts just to to make sure I have breakfast in the morning well you know for reference on that last week while we were in Clemson with North Carolina we knew you had the game Wednesday with them in NC State and we you would be here as well today you made it clear that you were probably going to stay with K you like three pillows and you like your PopTarts theres our guy Steve kersner who always continues to come over and give us those great nuggets make us sound smart on television nice and to not to check with the family that it was okay for me to you know grab one of the bedrooms and the Music toaster Ingram thought about a triple and now willll shoot one but thatll clang away cup trying to start a break here for the orange a shoe and out of nowhere Here Comes Ingram and he is going to miss it but Withers will follow and Harrison comes away with a big grin on his face he caught a flat hes laughing because he caught a flat on the on the break and he knows when he gets to the bench his teammates are going to have a lot of jokes for him Bell from the corner and a three that only makes it 4521 North Carolina kadell for Ingram look at the ball movement here Withers will find the paint he lost it though up ahead mince mince to the other side will lay it in North Carolina a little too unselfish on that one I believe they passed up a number of good looks trying to get a better look ends up being a turnover and now back to back turnovers oh wait a minute now circus came up with the ball here was looking like a backourt violation see what they determine 347 to go here in the first Music half so as you mentioned little difficulty with the Music sneaker come on now you got Music now 45 23 North Carolina theyve had their way with Syracuse Syracuse getting it on the back cour violation they said the basketball did touch the line at midcourt swing for bell bell swooping in and draws the foul strong move by the 67 sophomore out of conquer California hes fouled by Zaden High the 69ine Freshman so its fell to the stripe its been a struggle for the orange on the offensive end of the floor shooting 27 give North Carolina a lot of credit for the defense that they played Syracuse hasnt helped itself turning the basketball over throughout this game as you see Adrien archery its its its difficult for me to call him Adrian got to call hes red I mean hes always been red but you see coach and Jud men having a conversation and you know I talked with r earlier today I asked him do you often reference when you were playing when you were 19 20 years old when youre dealing with Judah hes like its such a different game today that were not going through the same things but as a McDonalds allamerican as a great point guard that you know red was back in his day there are many things that he can still teach from the position that can help Judah throughout this game and his thing is is simply about developing these young players and not only being good basketball players but good people off the front s knocks that out of play Red ay played for Jim beheim key guy for him assistant for Jim beheim Jim still around the program of course you know by now I think you probably seen a couple of his games talking about our fans watching Ingram from the corner can sink it Cory youve worked with the Hall of Fame head coach you and westerm I think doing great job with doing those three man booths very entertaining the thing thats coming out about Jim beheim is what a great sense of humor he has but Obie I have been telling people ever since Syracuse came into the ACC 10 years ago however long its been Ive been telling people this man is hilarious very funny hes very funny and and our our first game actually was here we went to dinner the night before and I simply asked him hey let the people know what weve been talking about how funny you are but he doesnt have to try to be funny he just is a dry sense of humor but very witty guy oh always was basketball he is I mean you want to talk about basketball Minds it doesnt get better than Zim watches everything entry pass and a kick ball 241 to go in a terrific first half for North Carolina as they try to go to 50 in ACC play I know its mid January but 5 and0 would be 50 its a great start absolutely would be and this North Carolina this is the first time that Hubert Davis has had this type of start not only to his season but especially the ACC play and again its its different for these guys coming in and theyre not just taking over programs theyre taking over from Hall of Famers Huber Davis taking over from Wy Williams won three national championships countless final fours Hall of Fame coach Adrien ay taking over for Jim bam Hall of Fame coach and doing it differently going into manto man in comparison to playing zone right which has been the staple of this program for 47 years so theyre going to be ups and downs theyre going to be challenge Davis shredding the D flips it up no a whistle bit of a run here for Syracuse a nine nothing run hasnt changed the score a ton but two minutes to go and the opening half here at Chapel Hill Chris Bell with the foul but if youre Syracuse you string together a couple more stops try to find a way to get this management I mean you know North Carolinas controlled this entire first half so if you find a way to get this manageable and find yourself within Striking Distance coming out the halftime locker room you know its been this type of day for North Carolina though I mean theres a saying here theres nothing finer than a route in Carolina and thats what it started off as Amando Bott dominating the interior Jay La waston getting involved and of course RJ Davis knocking down multiple three balls already in this first half and everything has gone in Hubert Daviss way you see the 26 10 Advantage points in the p hbert in year three at the helm Washington will be at the line Jaylen Washington plays very limited minutes but 610 sophomore from Gary Indiana to shoots foul was changed to Benny Williams incidentally had a conversation with my guy Sean Smith out of like to refer to it as the G Gary Indiana about jayen earlier this week and of course Jaylen still learning how to be successful in this game and I just simply told him hey let them know one thing that always gets you menes from before North Carolina rebound that is it that gets you minutes on the floor anywh everywhere Davis off for Trimble play a very nice first half RJ Davis this with the bounce for Ingram and was free didnt shoot a chot clock down to four again Ingram the second effort and the slam needed two tries but Washington dcks it down Applause 4727 J toce looking for an opening nobody home straight on with Williams and snatched by Jaylen Washington so the bench really getting it done here for Carolina Davis Airborne draws the foul and RJ will head to the line thats never good news for the opponent 95 its a nice Patience by North Carolina and then if at first you dont succeed try and try again the deflection gets it right back to Harrison engram whos still able to drop the dime off to Washington who dunks it home right at the end of the shot Davis Carolinas alltime foul shooting percentage leader and drops in number one shooting over 95 this year and its a luxury to have a guy like that at the end of the game especially when its one of your guards your point guard your off guard whatever position you want to call RJ Davis but to be able to put the basketball in his hands in late game situations to have the confidence that hes going to make 19 out of 20 free throws when he gets there and that string of eight consecutive 20 point games 20 points or more hell deflect that out of play so Carolina has to be just delighted with what they have done to the orange here in the first half and yet Armando Bott has barely played a whistle and a foul at 515 to go in the half thatll go on Seth tremble is first Music the place is packed something about Saturday afternoons in Chapel Hill you know a lot of places John M would be able to attest this a lot of places the the prime time is 700 pm thats the game you want to play at night here in Chapel Hill noon 200 thats the time or day that you going to have the best environment in the dean John MRI are stats magician and a staple here at Chapel Hill John and Fred you know you got to include Davis with a three so theyre on a 100 Point Pace he is Applause 15 theyre five out of 16 from the three Hopeland gives it up Davis with the thefts Trimble up ahead went for the the Bank Washington had it knock free Ryan trying to win it on the Baseline and who has it its going to be Syracuse ball RJ Davis knocks down to three and then gets back on the other end does a great job taking the basketball away and you can see how important it is is this time corack Ryan continues to compete even with a huge Music lead downstairs and a quick strike they get it inside for brown right before the horn so that is a score at halftime Jaylen Washington with the offensive rebound the put back for him Harrison Ingram getting involved powering his way to the rim and so many different guys getting involved the beautiful find from Kadota Ingram and then finding of course the leading score RJ Davis knocking down multiple threes in the first half well RJs had a terrific season that continues 15 points for him mince with 10 points for Syracuse Bott only played 8 minutes in that first half that they are beginning to realize they can play and win without all their Stars contributing all the time and when you get everyone playing their role and thats what North Carolina had you have Seth Trumble and Jayla Washington both coming off the bench playing great basketball as Jud gets inside and will return to the free throw line where he leads the ACC and free throw attempts coming into the game with 128 free throw attempts which is almost 40 more than the next closest guy who happens to be number five on the opposite team Armando bov so D the Min attacking the paint is something common he has 11 fouled by Davis number one on RJ Vin and ACC Player of the Year candidate pulled out of the NBA draft consideration it surprised a lot of people returning to Syracuse this year Jud M leads the AC season steals per game but different this year because hes doing it majority manto man Even though Syracuse comes out to start the second half in that patented Zone but the change from Zone to man to man Judith m still doing what he did a season ago at the top of the ACC in Ste Carolina with seven turnovers Syracuse had 10 at the break over the top and the slam Applause play here the dunk by Brown yeah this is a good start for the orange to start this second half youve got Miss getting to the free throw line then you got great execution for the L for brown and Grim will take it out Kad over the top for Bas swatted away but a foul on Malik Applause Brown nice execution off the screen and roll and the back screen will would would have been a back screen from mince but he didnt even have to as Bott was away trying to defend the basketball Brown able to get the easy bucket armo is 78 foul shooter seven points pretty quiet day so far Jerry magnam there with Judah minz you what talking with Jerry mck Jerry M national champion from 2003 for the orange and you for dud to Min you got to love the education you get with not only Adrien arre as your head coach but Alan Griffin Jerry Matt my guy Brendan strong all point guards on the bench for Syracuse and its a daily routine of learning how to play the position a lot of really good voices to hear but a foul before the shot thatll be on Davis as well RJ Davis number two well you put the hands on two hands on thats going to be an automatic Music call and what many teams often did they did a lot a season ago they wanted to attack RJ Davis while he was on defense that takes away from his ability to be able to score but also they feel like they can get him in foul trouble hes a much better offensive player than he has been a Defender throughout his time in North Carolina off the fake on the bounce for Kad cant spin it in bot missed with a tip so just has some momentum going OB they do and from the corner Bell even more now with a triple and a little bit of a run here and down to 15 again within Striking Distance enough to make this crowd uneasy here to start this second half theyre going to allow kadoo to have that three oh he spun it up there hit the shot heuse trips as well somehow got it to go great body control there and that is a momentum breaker as kadoo just trying to get closer to the rim trips over JJ starlings foot throws it up and happens to get a Music bucket out of it Starling with his fourth as he commits the foul picked off by Ingram swatted away there by Brown right back out to Carolina Kad on a penetration the scoop for to and thats a fourpoint possession from North Carolina just like that pushing the lead back to 19 giving up an offensive rebound on a free throw mince forced it up there Carolina locking him up on that particular possession on the cut look at the ball moving and a slam by bacock well that was a thing of beauty they cob with 10 so its like when they want it that extra gear is there for the Tar Heels heres Davis working on Taylor lays it in timeout Syracuse 10 first half turnovers hurt the orange and that same problem is starting to creep up here in this second half Elliot Kad with another no look and then RJ dropping to D Dondo RJ with the pick and everybody getting into it because North Carolinas playing so well trying to go to 5 and0 in the ACC and win their 13th game behind RJ Davis who has 17 points and five steals by the way yeah the five Steels tying a career high and it doesnt look as though hes finished as RJ Davis has really Tak working on the challenge of becoming a better Defender this season than he has been in years back Syracuse had a window they had the momentum just a couple minutes ago cut it to 15 with the three in the corner by Chris Bell and just like that another turnover coming out of the timeout for MC Bryan gets hit down to the deck hell go to the Applause line with 1653 to go here in second half in the ACC Ryan coming up a big gimi we watched for back last weekend turned an ankle after a 10point first half where he actually carried the heels and now getting out in transition you see Chris Bell taking the foul the officials are going to go over and look at it great group on hand today B Smith Tommy morsy and markn I mean theres extra there maybe unnecessary so if they come away with the flag one wouldnt be bothered by that but again in the 90s that was just a foul they might not even get a call just a foul Chris Bell the offender Music here you mention RJ Davis in the first half passing Mitch cup and Hubert Davis on the career scoring list at North Carolina some big names there its some big names and whenever you look around this building theres always going to be big names and were missing one big name here of course today the first time Ive been in this building since the passing of Eric montro and still praying for his family this line the basketball family and everyone involved will miss that big Music G say it meets the criteria of a flagrant one so thatll put Ryan to the line in Carolina will have the ball and the reason that flagrant one is because that extra shoulder was deemed unnecessary and so that thats the reason for it being a flagrant one and youre sending a 90 free throw shooter to the line an opportunity to add on to this lead which was just 15 points a minute or so ago and made the pair talking about Eric a moment ago and we really do miss him you know coming into this building as you said first time we have been here since his passing so young but a great classy guy whenever you came in you always saw this big dude with a smile coming over to tell you everything you needed to know about tar Hills and it was always a pleasure see he gave you Tar Hill information he never would do that got a little bit anyway yeah got a little bit he never would do that with me not with you I absolutely miss seeing him and as you mentioned that big smile great heart yes Davis a bound speed for Ingram willll swing it for B to lost the handle on it 6439 North Carolina Starling in the lane drops in two AJ Starling staying on the floor even though in foul trouble rager and archery cant risk taking him out at this point recognizing that with Syracuse digging himself such a huge hole in the first half hes got to be able to keep his guys on the floor yeah hes playing with four fouls Ryan thought about a three Ingram wants to take that shot from the corner picked off by Davis thats the the most underrated part of RJ Daviss game his rebounding you wouldnt think that a guy he may be listed at 6 feet but hes not 6 feet but he has multiple games where hes double digit rebounding in his North Carolina career thats not something I think most people would answer on a trivia question big CAU with a hoop 6641 Starling another one on the way not this time Kad nice dumpson block from behind by Williams and a save by copen right back over to North Carolina at least for a moment Ingram takes a spill itll stay on this end the deflection off the orange with 1531 to go well when we come to Carolina one guy we think about all the time is the legendary Dicky V how many times has his voice I miss that voice the great dick by T a lot of great players here in North Carolina he called out their names and their accomplishments were so lucky at ESPN to have an incredibly deep roster of analysts including the gentleman to my right Cory Alexander and tipped in by Bott here but thats a voice we all miss you do too well absolutely I had opportunity to go hang out with my guy Vicky v a little bit at the city of Palms a few weeks ago and sat and talked with him for a little while just told him how much we miss him and how much we look forward to him getting back on the the microphone and joining what he really created I mean at the end of the day when you think about ESP in the college basketball it is synonymous with dick Bal none of us would be here without what hes done well said Bon on the entry the spin and the tip is up and good and they are just relentless on the glass to Ingram on the opposite side of the iron give him nine the other thing about Carolina today that really pops is the 11 steals that the Tar Heels have already put up there thats a season High yeah season high but it it it almost came away with a 12 right there but you got a credit Syracuse for being sloppy with the basketball with a lot of that also so Carolinas played great defense but Syracuse absolutely has not helped themselves with turning the ball over Carolina trying to hold yet another opponent below 60 Davis will hit it the threepointer and he reaches 20 again and RJ needed seven made threepoint field goals to pass Jeff Leo assistant coach for seventh all time today got to look at my numbers and see where he is but wasnt thinking that so hes hes made four in this one 7343 Monday night super Wild Card Weekend capped off the NFC matchup between jayen Herz and the Eagles and Mike Evans and the Bucks 800 Eastern on ABC ESPN ESPN plus our Mega cast coverage also includes Payton and Eli on ESPN 2 our ESPN Deportes Spanish language version coverage begins with the Monday night countdown crew 600 Eastern on ESPN so Obie you know Im a Cowboys fan you are indeed so Im saying go Bucks where did the Cowboys thing come from for you I mean I I grew up but the Patriots werent very good when I was a kid they got awfully good after that but you know I was a big 49ers fan I lived on the East Coast you were a 49ers fan because as corack Ryan dunks one home nice find from Bott the four Court outlet but you are 49ers fan because why Joe Montana because of Joe Montana Roger Craig all those guys and they were great when you really tuned in and started watch thats exactly right right at that time thatll be knocked down by Copeland in 1977 78 when I started watching football at age four age 5 Tony Dorset was my guy there you go and Ive been a Dallas Cowboy fan ever since fouled here with 1236 to go in a half thats the way it is you may not live in that region where your team is but you pick a guy youve got your dude speaking of a dude AR Bott throwing the West unsell Outlet full court rest in peace to the Great West unell and because cor M Ryan doesnt have to dribble that thats all aw an assist so a rebound and an assist on that play good piece of knowledge on your part scoring well heres the thing thats in college basketball in the NBA you can take five dribbles now and get an assist for it I see some ass this guys get I I want some of those back bod with a double double 15 and 11 thats his season average in both of those categories not bad for a guy who didnt play much in a first half yeah only eight minutes in the first half but has come back in the second half engaged in this game and Armando Bok came back to North Carolina because he wants to win this is a young man that won a state championship at treny Episcopal High School won a national championship at IMG Academy and once to win a National Championship at the University of North Carolina had an opportunity during his junior year lost in a national championship game and after getting that feeling he wants to see if he can make it happen again North Carolina this version coming in number seven mint on the drive finishes that Carolina trying to go to 7 and0 at home like their chances as we approach the 12minute mark swing for tremble heres Ryan haded to make a Nifty pass its going to be tipped out of play by Malik Browns trying to sell it that it was off North Carolina but it was not and 14 to get off a shot here heels had a 27point lead at one point in the first half and it pretty much been toying with Syracuse all day and another whistle as cormack Ryan takes the seat theyre going to be even more dangerous if Ryan really finds his shooting range here in the coming weeks he was only hitting 29 from three coming into this game but we saw him make the number of big shots last week at at Clemson and but this North Carolina team as you mentioned before it doesnt always have to be Davis and Bott you know Ryan can help with the scoring Withers Harrison Ingram of course but when You got a guy thats a top candidate the ACC Player of the Year whos scoring so easily and RJ Davis you can always rely on him and hes done it against some really tough teams he had 30 against Arkansas 27 against Tennessee 27 against Kentucky 26 against Connecticut done it against everybody hes played his best oh man a slam here by Withers off the feed on the alleyoop by RJ Davis that was a thing of beauty it absolutely was mince and they will whistle bot for the foul got him with the body but RJ Davis has played his best against North Carolina his best competition throughout this season and now hes doing more than just scoring hes also dropping dims as he gets out in transition and finds jayen Withers way Above the Rim another getting the history of everything that went on behind the civil rights movement and that Martin Luther King was involved in amazing to be able to go back through those steps you see just kind of how he lived during that time yes visited myself its a very somber experience hasnt changed at all no 8348 minutes at the line its wonderful to hear were playing Clips throughout the day and throughout the weekend players and coaches all over the country talking about MLK and what he meant and what the movement has meant to them and where they are today and you know the irony in all of that the first ever AfricanAmerican head coach Charles ball George rff when he was hired at Washington State happens to be the man who holds the original I Have a Dream speech is that right it is absolutely correct George ring was working security when Dr King delivered the speech in Washington DC and when the speech ended he looked onto the podium and looked at Dr King and said what are you going to do with the speech and Dr King just looked at him like its not I mean at the time of to Dr King its nothing historical so coach ring gets the speech you know you want this as yours unbelievable and he has it today can you imagine what thats worth Bell going up high trying to save it and cant do it I mean just think about the monetary value and my hope I hope this will be true is that one day thatll wind up in the National Archives I can I can tell you that coach R has been offered a forun for that and he has decided not to sell I dont know what his tents are but I know his daughter Leticia Hall and his family W and I have a feeling that its going to end up as a donation at something its a great story 10 minutes to go North Carolina in blowout mode here against Syracuse 85 to 51 theres rarely a point in this game where you said well Syracuse is right there theyre very competitive four or five minutes in thats about when North Carolina found fourth gear yeah at 15 they cut the lead to 15 Chris Bell knocked down a three in the corner and ever since its been an onslaught for North Carolina continuing to do the job defensively o got a good Look rebounded Away by Withers right back up and thats really where NORAD has dominated this game offensive rebounding points in the paint no Nim McLoud for Sy q and although his size may have been a little bit of a Difference Maker Im not sure he would have been much of a factor of keeping North Carolina out of the pain this one I right I think that would be hopeful on Syracuses end to believe he would have made a big difference Washington draws the foul underneath a very happy day here at Chapel Hill North Carolina looking for all the world like they will go to 5 and0 in the ACC only unbeaten team in the conference this was in Washington to the line we talked about all the point guard knowledge on the Syracuse bench how about Shawn may standing up in his Tage over guys like Jaylen Washington over Armando Bott The Bigs at North Carolina and you want to talk about Elite this young man was a special talent I can remember watching him actually my last year in the NBA in 2005 was the year that North Carolina won a national championship the first under Roy Williams and watching Shawn may dominate the NCAA Tournament of course ended up being a draft pick by the Charlotte Bobcats one talented family yeah yeah absolutely part of the reason why I had to retire there was no more room for me there when they Johny ins outside the three well launch he cant hit had an up and down day for Syracuse probably had to have his best game of the season on this board today and they throw that one away 88 51 so smelling the upset Tuesday through Wednesday you know Purdue Houston Kansas Tennessee all losing yeah I firmly believe especially the way North Carolina has been playing the three wins on the road and then coming here in this dominating performance on their home floorida that they will be a top five team as of Monday now not sure how high they will go up Connecticut who was four I believe most likely will Vault to number one with four of the top five losing this week but i definitely expect for North Carolina to be a top five team in the poll yes indeed the heels are surging and theyre playing like a top five team thats not its not a popularity contest these guys are playing extremely well knocks it away another steel here for North Carolina Trimble left it short Washington is real active under there will draw another foul and Washingtons been very active throughout this game Bott missed a lot the time in the first half emo with the personal number Music two so time to enjoy the mascot time to enjoy what has been a really fun day for North Carolina and more games four more highlighting our ESPN schedule today featuring these two number six Kentucky and Texas AM followed by Arkansas squaring off against Florida eight more hours of college hoops can also watch on the ESPN app from anywhere say what Kentucky playing great basketball one of the few teams that has been able to beat this North Carolina team this season but going into college station having to take on Texas AM thats going to be a tough task for John caliper and his group of youngsters on the other end Washington with a foul shot and got him into double figures five Carolina players in double figures so far and still eight minutes to go 8 minutes to go in North Carolina has 90 points so this is a team that could go over 100 for a second time this season went over 100 the last time they were here and a 45point win over charson SU both teams able to go to their benches pretty heavy here given the score of the game and the fact that North Carolina has been in blowout mode for a while and North Carolina firing on all cylinders Uber Davis still coaching up Jaylen Washington as he comes over to the Music sideline Music downstairs cono just into the game deflected away Syracuse with the opportunity to try to cut in here try to make it respectable Copeland straight on heres Mintz about to slice inside he drops in a bucket he has 19 well one thing for certain jul Jud will never stop attacking if hes on the floor hes going to be in attack mode both offensively and defensively trying to apply some pressure to kdo Withers getting it downstairs for the easy Music two the interior passing from North Carolina has been spectacular throughout this entire game you see these guys sharing the basketball very well especially within tight spaces Copeland floats in a bucket with seven minutes to go he has a 12point game 9257 57 point Syracuse may be the first team to score over 60 against North Carolina in this calendar year out it goes and back over to Syracuse here the 653 on the tire on the break he can smile about it because he knows hes going to be willing to get on the floor for his team even with this being rivalry you went over the table over there what happened during that moment and what did the fellow say to you I mean I usually just lose myself in the game I I saw the ball I do for it and I hit the guy I didnt know what happened I got up my knee was hurt and Im bleeding but I saw the old man he was I dont know maybe 80 said he was 80 years old hit his hand I want to make sure he was okay in the end he was okay Harrison came over I thought a really classy gesture there regardless of the Rivalry just to make sure the gentleman was okay and you know what he said back to Harrison he said you keep playing hard hey respect that regardless of the robberry they respect young players out here playing hard and playing as hard as can but Im going to be honest with you my disappointment my God John Madre to our left I mean just no effort at all he knew better John made the business decision he did protect John at all costs thats a 67 College athlete right right into your lap I tell you what I had opportunity to meet his father at the hotel last night classy young man you see exactly where Harrison gets all his personality from but yeah hes a big guy I mean again the effort that I was expecting from M would have been to move out of the way get clear not move into the way to protect anyone and see you see our guy John MRE right there with the headphones on oh he does move a little to the right he does protect you though OB protect the play byplay thats job one yes there you go protect the money maker my guy OB never even flinches right no I was I was flinching just out of the shot Trimble looking inside North Carolina able to go to their bench coo there on the sideline with 618 to Music play the largest Syracuse loss in an AC game to an opponent since joining the conference it was in 2019 March of 2019 against Virginia and Virginia smoked him by 26 so this is a record they they dont want to top but theyre on their way yeah fouling on a threepoint field goal attempt may push you over the top as establishing a new record as Adrien Archie can only look on and this is a place where that has not been kind to the orange 0 and six and their travels to Chapel Hill looking like thats going to move on to 0 and seven another one coming here for tremble and another one still North Carolina shooting close to 76 on the season flirting around with a School record for free throw percentage so this is a team that is very balanced from what they do offensively and defensively the defense is more recent but Hubert Daviss team is playing very well to start ACC basketball Taylor attacks and denied in the lane theyll keep it on this end 9450 nine North Carolina and a Runway today just kept building and building on that lead in that first half had it as high as 27 they were 22 at halftime carry with a swing with that left hand cant drop it in theyll win it back cuff will drive it lost the handle stay right here 537 a play North Carolina has louville coming up next and a game of the ACC Network on the 17th then theyre at Boston College Wake Forest Florida state Georgia Tech they could really get rolling they absolutely can theyre rolling right now it could really be serious yeah and when you consider of course theyre super dangerous on their home fol but when you see what theyve been able to do on the road and the way that their guys are locked into The Scouting Report defensively sharing the basketball because even throughout their road trip it hasnt been a great offensive trip for North Carolina but what theyve done defensively has been spectacular and you see right now sitting at the top of the ACC but how about Florida State their only ACC loss is here to North Carolina so the simos have been able to get it going at the turn of the new year starting ACC play Duke at 3 and one NC State now 3 and one Wake Forest as well North Carolina the only unbeaten Moi straight on but theyre going to wave that off and thatll go against North Carolina moic hit a huge three in that Clemson game OB there was a tie basketball game at 45 and he hit a three that g gave North Carolina a 48 to 45 lead and they never look back from that point I believe Seth Trumble may have hit a three right after that but that was probably the biggest shot of that game and after that they salted that game away on the road to Clemson Carolina hasnt been home very much Trimble airborne and rebounded away and stolen by cup now cff to sophomore copelan yes got it an official stoppage in play North Carolina with an injured player on the other end Zaden High goes right to the bench in some Music pain look like he took a shot to the gut jaylor Wasington going be to get back on the floor get more minutes an opportunity to get his numbers Music better Washington with the ball cant sink it thats what he does he is an elite level shooter at 611 it be interesting to see how his development goes a season from now with no Alando bacock can he step up into that road and played with the same type of force that Bott has played with for 5 years in chap carry with the bucket Syracuse on the road to Pittsburgh next that game Tuesday at 700 and theyve got Miami Florida State and NC State on schedule a Miami game inside the Dome next Saturday Miami coming off a tough loss at home R Kenny Payne going to get their first win of ACC season on the road he go from the corner no and thatll be Syracuse ball here

Wednesdays double header on acc Network Florida State Miami tip off at seven then its North Carolina hosting Louisville here at the Dean Smith Center again itll be next Wednesday on acc Network North Carina going into a Zone defensively so Hubert Davis has his guys and and part of the reason why you see this OB is because many of the guys that are on the floor right now are on the scout team in practice so theyve been playing a Zone to prepare their team for if Syracuse does come out in that zone so Yuber Davis going to go with their guys no for this week high with a triple to strong deflected Away by Leo mid courts been said before Oh thats absolutely been said before cig Leo son of Jeff Barris with the basket so the fans still in attendance loving the effort by the guys coming
