as Kelly will make his second career start in a row for Boston College Holy Cross is also down a couple of key pieces today both B Montgomery and Luth kabali are out today for the Crusaders so Holy Cross at 2 and seven this year though one of the two a big one to win over Georgetown in the second game of the season Under head coach Dave Paulson in his first year in wer longtime Patriot league coach with George Mason and bakell here is Will bat Elder whos a patriot League all rookie team selection last year KCK to Joe octave but he stepped out of bounds on the drive underneath so Boston College basketball and Holy Cross coming into this game last in the Patriot league in turnover margin we trying to find some consistency you see it with a lot of their guys and we talked to Dave pawson about it lot of big games and then they kind of come back a little bit to try try to find that consistent Pace theres a good move from Jaden Zachary to get Boston College on the board for the first time and one thing that coach paon mentioned before this game is that theyve had spurts in games of playing well and hell talk with his team about it and say hey we can put it together through stretches but putting it through a full 40 for this team theyve had struggles this season doing that that shelder nearly got to take it away it finds Applause octav there is Dave Paulson as we mentioned his first season at Holy Cross longtime head coach including in this area with Williams where he was a twotime division three National coach of the year and a onetime national champion for Williams as he said head coach at bunell and George Mason spent the last two years as an assistant at Applause Music forom there is Joe octave leading scorer for Oly cross at 16 per game including breaking out for 30 three points against Georgetown lost the handle there and that is three for three turning the ball over for Holy Cross yeah obviously a tough start for the Crusaders on the offensive end this is just good defense by post but you can see there Kenny just losing the basketball and three for three now on that end in terms of turning the ball over still a two nothing lead for Boston College Chaz Kelly step back three is a little strong good job by m Lockton though to get a piece of the rebound goes back to work heres Quinton post has a significant size Advantage you would think in this game today a league Bay is Music short ball stayed alive the whole way inside post from M Lockton nearly lost it but kept it alive and deons three is way off and this is not an offensive clinic in the early going and a tough start for BC on that offensive end just with one field goal so far through two and A2 minutes free ball DeAndre Williams is no Music Applause good H inside for Zachary got his Defender up in the air well and Jaden has the first score of this game hes bounced back well his last three shooting 45 from the floor after struggling a touch from the floor in the two games in Kansas City and of course the main assist getter on this Eagles team but doing a nice job there being patient right under the basket then flipping it up for two thats where he lives when hes getting inside getting to the basket he can really score the ball on the offensive end thats taken away by post a fourth turnover for Holy Cross here in the opening minutes Prince El League Bay steps into a three and thats off the mark So Holy Cross just one attempt from the floor so far theres the three ball that is well short from Joe Newton the first year from Berkeley Matt averaging seven points a game has come in seventh in The Patriot league and threepointers made per game Jazz Kelly trying again thats too strong and because BC is just off offensively in terms of just putting the ball on the hole I mean its a four nothing game right now but you think about where it could be with the fact that Holy Cross has already committed four turnovers octave nearly lost the handle on it didnt manage to get it to Williams was surprised to see see Jaden Zachary on holy crosss leading score Joe Octan and that one coming over to us see where it was deflected its off of Holy Cross so its another turnover wow 4 nothing BC well on the one hand a tough start for Holy Cross and we point you to the middle of that graphic they came into this game with the second fewest turnovers in The Patriot league but obviously a little bit of a tough start with five of them already however Boston College has not run away yet because the Eagles have also struggled a bit from the floor yeah just two of eight from the floor to start and 0 of four from downtown as well and teams against Holy Cross they have shot the three ball pretty well roughly 40 so eagles they just havent been able to figure it out offensively yet but thankfully on the other end theyve been able to force turnovers and Hoy cross has also shot themselves in the foot a little bit I mean its almost one of those you kind of just stop restart see what happens theres a three ball and its good Donald P Jr who we talked about off the top of the sh really taking advantage of an opportunity against Central Connecticut with some good playing time for the red shirt freshman who missed basically all of last season with a knee injury in the second game of the year against Detroit hes really been good it feels like hes going to earn more and more playing time for R yeah and especially if we keep shooting like that as well and we highlighted it in the open but three three pointers in that game against Central Connecticut state Williams Good from three so both teams with their first threepoint makes of the game and Williams starting for the second time this season he also started against Maine in a game that Holy Cross played against the Music Bears he showed you Holy Cross does bring back a lot of scoring but of course it is a firste head coach a lot of younger players with a couple of freshman including Williams lets watch both of those threepoint balls yeah nice set up there by post and then the three knocked down by Han Jr then on the other end you see Williams knocking down the tray freshman for the Music Applause Music Crusaders heres HS pretty good look after creating space against batchelder but couldnt find the bucket he wouldnt have threepointer that handmade you see just three of 10 to start shooting in this game Zachary got a piece again an elite Defender Jaden Zachary octave got back in position and it out on the three and Deon mton has the rebound and octave he can knock down those shots shooting 40 from Beyond the r coming into this one hes eighth in The Patriot league in threepoint percentage fourth in field goal percentage overall quitting post on the drive extra pass Devin mlon hopefully the Eagles do a little bit more of that because just getting it down inside of mton 67 body right on the right block ends up being an easy shot and again Holy Cross stepped out of bounds well theres no doubt as we talked about theres a size advantage in this game for Earl Grants team Caleb Kenny its 66 is the tallest guy on the floor right now along with Joe newon and especially with kabali out today as we talked about so Earl in his third season at the Helma Boston Music Applause College theres Donald H Jr again with it strong on the three and then a foul called underneath with mton going up and just to the point about the size Advantage this is what can sometimes happen when you get a foul on the rebound yeah and because that you see the foul committed there against nen you you wonder if theyre settling a little bit too much for the outside shot with that size advantage that they have they can get it down low a little bit more because you look at what theyve done the shot profile theyre four of 12 to the field but they taken six threepointers and by the way thats two fouls already on Joe nen comes in seven points a game as mson just checking in hes good for three so both guys who stepped up off the bench against Central Connecticut and and medson with an early impact for BC up 123 yeah just taking advantage of the playing opportunity here against the Crusaders and against Central Connecticut state in that last game and picking up right where they left off Williams guarded by Matson and a reset here with t to shoot for Oly cross Caleb Kenny takes inside couldnt finish and its out of bounds and stay here now you see the setup the Matson three it all comes with post right they double team him down low they kick it out and Matson knocks it down thats what you want your outside Shooters to do take advantage of an extra body being drawn toward the paint and thats what post can do for this Eagles team even when hes not scoring hes obviously playing a big impact in the game he averages more than two assists a game he already has four assists in the early going so Holy Cross really keen on him and hes found a way to find some other open bodies Dean Ryan a first year into traffic and a foul against Boston College as Armani Mighty just into the game the sophomore just going back to post I mean thats a sign of a great player getting a feel for the game and and figuring out okay how do I impact this game and obviously we know he can score the basketball but in this case hey lets set up the open shooters from Beyond The Arc and while theyre just two of seven they do have those two threepointers that has helped create some distance in this game to start Music 20 on the timer off the inbounds to Dean Ryan AJ Wills is good up over Donald Han Wills the first year coming off five points against Central Connecticut who Holy Cross also played in their most recent game last weekend hey averages roughly 10 minutes per game its the seventh game hes appeared in but now big match up here here against an ACC team in the Eagles and taking advantage of his playing time knocking down a big three skip pass Prince a league Bay little strong from three Armani Mighty got a piece of the rebound and then fighting for it got tied up couldnt grab it Dean Ryan did a good job boxing out long three ball is good KH Singleton and the three has helped Holy Cross get back into this game and Eric how about these freshman stepping up here at kti Forum knocking down some big shots and credit the way the Crusaders have rebounded the basketball you talk about the lack of size advantage that Holy Cross has theyre actually outrebounding the Eagles 85 to start this game a leag bay inside in and out Mighty an offensive rebound and is stripped in fouled so Armani Mighty with an opportunity when we come back to kti Forum so a nice little push back from Holy Cross Singleton from Deep for the Music freshman Music one of the greats here at Boston College Tyrese rice in the house over 2000 points in his Boston College career standing former Eagle in the house by the way when we went to break the score bug which said 128 on that AJ Wills shot they did go to replay and confirm it was a threepoint shot which is what we had thought initially so thats why Holy Cross is on nine now with three made three pointers and now Armani Mighty at the free throw line and he hits a couple so as we said the free ball get you back into the game a bit for Holy Cross and by the way since that first stretch with the five Turners with Holy Cross just the one since yeah theyve done a nice job limiting that and theyve taken advantage of their threepoint opportunities theyre three for six from downtown and freshman stepping it up and knocking down shots from Beyond The Arc an interesting start to this game BC meanwhile 5 for 15 shooting to begin this game here is Wills hands off for octave with a leag bay on him got it back with the league Bay going over to help octave at the rim no offensive rebound is blocked quit post call this guy on the floor in there and now nson in transition is good playing to the crowd a little bit as well pointing at them and boy he has been red hot from distance and a nice start to this game knocking down two threepointers he made three against Central Connecticut is part of his season High 15 points in 24 minutes well set a chance passed it up heres Dean riot Applause reset here from Wills got to go two to shoot Wills falling away is fouled by Claude L Harris who then looks at Tyrus rice asks if it was a foul and rice said yeah being honest with him and it really bails out Wills we see the nice post defense there from Quinton post and then that helps set up the threepointer PC just pushing the action quickly into the front court and Madson doing a nice job leading the way and then getting to his spot in the left Arc and knocking down the triple but for Wills with the shot clock winding down he just heaves it up and ends up getting bailed out and a chance for the Crusaders to stay in it Music Applause Music here by the way we mentioned the foul good to see Claude El Harris back into the game as we said he missed the Central Connecticut game coming off the bench today for the first time as you say so he really started to play better the scoring has come after he was down around nine points the first couple of games that season High 22 against man hes had a couple of nice offensive performances this year also 19 against Harvard he efficient in that game as well so Wills two of three at the line at its 1611 Boston College Applause lead Zachary falling away its off the mark and Joe octaves in there for the Applause rebound once again BC settling for an outside shot they do have six points in the paint so its not that they havent scored in the paint but this right there settling for the long twoo and and missing there but they got a stop on the other end Michael renovich who really at the best game of his career in this building a couple of years ago as thats an offensive batt called on post first foul on Quinton see just reaching around here was the call seriously theyre going to theres a reach there on the left side of your screen first turnover against Boston College its a shooting for the Eagles thats kept the Crusaders in it now 6 for 17 but a little miscommunication there trying to find renovich inside and the Eagles will try to go in transition Harris comes inside good luck for Deon mlon who posts up Miss F good that is one thing over the last five games the Eagles have been really really good at they are the best in the country over their last five games in putback field goal percentage at 74 so theyve been really effective putting the ball back in on some of those situations and I love that they did that in that situation taking advantage of the size that m has and medson steps into a three three from downtown from Mason medson and just like that Boston College opens the lead back to 10 back in 30 seconds to kti Forum 2111 Music BC well lets take a look at the last couple of looks for Boston College and in quick order the Eagles kind of reestablish things yeah you see them go download to mton first shot doesnt go but hes able to tip it back up and in 58 shooter so its always efficient when you get it to him in the paint and how about Madson from downtown Mason Madson hes had a red hot start to the game theyre saying one play we thought was a threepointers a twopointers so he has eight points two of two from down I guess that one on The Fast Break where he was out in front I guess they said his foot was on the line so eight points for Madson threepointer twopointer youre still efficient today perfect three for three half is hard its okay good octave inside fouled and Joe octave still trying to get on the board for the first time tonight theres madsons numbers again we talked about with this rotation that Earl Graham has mentioned still trying to find where the right options going to be behind Harris and behind Zachary this bunch of guards between the likes of Madson and hand coming back from injury and Chaz Kelly as well who got the start for the second game in a row theres the opportunity for someone to step into that role and I think both handed mson really as weve said second game in a row they both stepped up yeah theyve gotten off to a nice start today and for Matson specifically of course he was the guy that led BC and threepointers made he had 40 last year but he just continues to show his ability to be able to knock it down from long range and frankly this eagle team needs that threepoint shooting and hes been able to deliver on that especially tonight so two free throws for octave to bring it back to eight keep one from post was pulled down by renovich anyway starting to mention two years ago 11 points and seven rebounds against Boston College as a Applause sophomore octave for three thats a little short and then Donald ham going for the rebound is fouled by renovich and octav he just hasnt been able to find his touch shooting wise to begin this game he got those two points in the free throw line but 0 for four now from the field 0 of two from downtown and and they need his scoring and so far he just hasnt been able to deliver on that but he came into today averaging just shy of 16 points per game yeah its been some high highs this year for octave but theres been a a couple of games where hes been held in check kind of that consistency piece as weve talked about post to the bucket that did not go and then theyre going to wave it off and say it was in the cylinder when post touched it again on the follow so possession will go to Holy gross and obviously it doesnt turn into points but I like what BC was trying to do there score some points in the pain and and for post he hasnt scored yet today looked like he was going to there you see it pinball out and then say it wasnt out yet but post made Music Applause contact we talked about this match up Zachary defensively against octave its held him in check so far got rid of the pass though Williams drives kick out octave coming back inside and couldnt finish but the follow goes and the foul for Caleb Kenny an excellent follow there by Holy Cross and Kenny will have an n one when we come Applause back at amama we know the so 2215 lead for Boston College over Holy Cross we talked about this a bunch the Eagles generally take a lot more twopointers than most teams in the ACC and down in terms of threepoint attempts today its actually been closer to even threepoint shot has come along a little bit as the game has gone on yeah for the Eagles now four of 11 from downtown and four of 11 on two pointers as well but nice play by Caleb Kenny right before we went to break able to jam it down get an n one chance misses on that and a foul going against the Music Crusaders so thats the second foul on rabinovich credit the Crusaders theyve been able to stay in it you know despite committing a lot of turnovers at the beginning of the game able to knock down three threepointers thats help but glockton inside theres Kevin mton with six points for the red shirt sophomore and as this first half has developed they theyve started to feed him a little bit more down there thats a great entry pass from Harris to get it down to mton for an easy finish Eagles have passed the ball well seven assists on nine made field goals tonight thats no good from rabinovich and then a foul on the rebound try as Kenny got tied up with Music Zachary and on that shot there from rabinovich far away from the basket good defense by mton to set up what was a wide Miss and then a foul after the play and now the Crusaders with 16 fouls by the way just to confirm it we said before there was a slight mixup but everything correct now eagles with 24 points Matson has nine it is three made threes for Mason Matson heres claudell Harris wide openen triple its a little strong and if youre wondering why Quinn post only has two shots thats exactly why he gets the ball hes double teamed okay you got to find the open man as you see the Crusaders turn it over for the eighth time today and as we said four assists for post yeah so hes getting into the action hes done it defensively as well one steel one block and listen youre double teamed in the right wing youre going to pass it to the open man and thats what the Crusaders are betting on is get it out of post hand let the other players be you and for the most part the Eagles have done that being up by nine right now A glockton I guess says why not and has an offensive rebound good read on that shot Cycles around Harris on the drive this time good take rolls off and again its whistled off no basketball in the cylinder when it was touched so possession all thats the second time its circled around the rim and just not gone down for the Eagles think another look good attack there from Harris it doesnt quite go and then that second tip is where whistle came Music Holy Cross just one of its last eight from the floor that is knocked out of bounds staying here it feels like both of these teams Boston College has 11 more attempts from the floor than Holy Cross though the Crusaders have cut down on the turnovers a little bit since the start of the game so it feels like the Eagles have a potential to away here if they can start to shoot the ball at a little bit of a higher rate Holy Cross has kind of stayed in it because of that but the Crusaders also need to find a little bit more than 27 from the floor though they have shot the free wall ball well with three makes whats interesting too Eric you look at Second Chance points Holy Cross is actually headed that category 54 despite the fact Eagles have so many more shot attempts seven offensive rebounds just havent been able to capitalize a ton on those second chances that being the Eagles o is fouled by Jaden Zachary and now they have six team fouls so one away from the bonus theyve tried to get up in octave Grill and for the most part the Eagles have been successful octave 0 for five to start today just two made free throws for Holy crosss leading score averaging 16 a game try to three that was very strong yeah hes been off of those threepoint shots and again he can knock those down 12 for 30 coming into this game but now 03 from long range and that was well Applause off again the question here for the Eagles how do they create more distance going into the half a lot of which youre looking at in terms of shot attempts rebounds they should be a little bit more ahead and see if they can create a little bit more distance the clocked in inside no follow up bouncing around octave did a good job taken away it was headed right for Quinton post and Holy Cross down by nine 519 to go in the first taken back away and a foul goes against Dean Ryan after losing the handle on it quit post is the one who got his hand in on the initial steal Music as you said thats now seven on the team so Boston College will shoot and it sends mats to the free throw line a perfect8 for eight to start as you see the nice hands there from post playing a part getting the Eagles of basketball and now Matson at the charity strike so a bit of a strange game so far both teams leading scorers have combined for two points yeah pretty bizarre you think about what both players are capable of of course Quinton post everybody here at BC knows what he can do coming in averaging 20 points per game so they pitched the shut out against him but the problem is the role players have steep up stepped up for the Eagles and then defensively BCs done a nice job two at the line for Matson Gs the leading score with 11 and the Eagles will press off the made free throws Music Applause mson by the way now 10 for 10 from the Fon and Matson all over Wills right now the Freshman trying to throw him out of shorts getting some playing time in this game here at kti for him theres a drive by Williams too strong then the put back goes not even sure that was by Design but it works for Dean Ryan with his first points yeah again another freshman for the Crusaders stepping up and you know contributing here against the Eagles and just crashed in the glass stands at 68 nice job just putting that back in even if it was a little lucky a league Bay inside back in the game no got the offensive rebound and got that one and you figure the law of averages is going to ultimately even out as this game progresses again those Second Chance points Eagles now with six after that one but nice job making something Happ happen on that possession to now stretch the lead to double figures and where is Holy Cross going for offense with octave out of the game and shot from Williams no Music good Quinton post driving tough shot no and will celder the sophomore has the rebound and I think one thing you do have to credit the Crusaders for in this first half is the game plan against post that goes inside for Ryan and post with a push from behind itll be the second foul on Quinton post and well step aside its been about the second chance points for BC of late building the lead to n from behind a good look at it just the shove right there so two shots and the ball here for Holy Cross with 345 to go and it came after a Miss hes 0 for three from the field hes attributed in this game in other ways four rebounds five assists two Steals and a block but right after the Miss comes back the other way and commits the flagrant fou so two shots here and then theyll inbound under the basket so a gift for the Crusaders who are trying to stay in this game and and this could certainly help Dean Ryan is 7even for n from the free throw line this year so you know as weve been talking about it feels like a game where Holy Cross has had chance to get a little closer Boston College has had a chance to pull away neither team has been able to quite do that a chance here for Holy Cross with two free throws down under 10 now and the basketball and for the Crusaders you look at their stats on the offensive side five for 19 shooting and theyve committed nine turnovers youd figure the Eagles lead would be a little bit bigger but because of the way the Eagles have shot it the Crusaders have been able to stay in it Eagles have had 11 more attempts from the floor than Holy Cross in the game that pullup jumpers good AJ Wills the first year averaging four points per game up to seven now including a threepointer made earlier hes one shy of his season high and Eric Ive been impressed by him theres no fear in his game the way hes come out in play today seven points two of two from the Flores knocked down to three Jaz Kelly for three is off League Bay with an offensive rebound Cycles around Kelly wide open again and Off the Mark again so Boston College just four of 15 from behind the ark tonight and those are wide open shots too so you dont fault him for taking them three to answer Williams is good and what a little run here for Holy Cross has cut it to a four point game on a 7 nothing spurt over the last minute and you think about the Freshman playing in a game like this you wonder if the mentality is okay we dont have anything to lose in this one Ellie try it again three to roll they come in two of seven first year head coach for this program of course Dave Paulsons been in the college ranks for a long time but they have come out and and really put on an effort here to stay in this game only down by four and now two what a good pass that was to find Dean Ryan and Boston College is going to use a timeout six points tying a season high for Dean Ryan Holy Cross on a 9 nothing Music run so remember this run started off the flagrant foul we said there was a chance for Holy Cross to take advantage and credit to the Crusaders theyve done that yeah the the door was open for them they were down by 11 at that point and now theyve charged back into this game and you know credit The Freshman with the way that theyve played today a couple of baskets you just saw there were from freshman on this Crusaders team theyve come out and played and AJ Wills leading the way and scoring hes got seven points hes knocked down both shots from the field hes also hit a a pair of free throws as well and Holy Cross in enemy territory here on this Friday evening only down by two well as weve talked about with Dave Paulson who is the guy that could step out and be that second option along with octave octave has not been the one who scored in this game he has just two points but its been a group effort but Oly cross is hanging in three ball is off the mark from newon chance to take the lead and BC back on it MJ Harris falling away chumper is good Eagles Ed that bucket they were 0 are one for their last 11 from the floor good job by Harris to end that scoreless stretch which was at roughly 2 and 12 minutes was a Stoppers bucket for Harris at BC back up four with 90 seconds to Music go seven from Wills six from Ryan and Williams eckan Ryan against hand and Donald hand is called for the foul both teams in the bonus right now so free throws coming up and this was such a big bucket for the Eagles just to stop the scoreless stretch and wasnt exactly a easy shot either made away jumper from Harris who was ble to knock it down now Ryan heads the free throw line for a one and Music one he SS the first so hes had a nice game too Eric three for three from the free throw line seven points pitched in a couple rebounds too this is a guy that doesnt get a lot of playing time either just four 7 minutes per game coming into this one so a twoo game again its Holy Cross has continued to hang in there Boston College led by as much as 11 at 28 17 its 3028 right now Zachary good move inside at the Applause foul nice job by Zachary to attack there and then finish through contact this was a clear foul see him penetrate work his way into the paint and then spinning on Williams gets him hit his arms on the way up and finishing big and one chance for the Eagles Zachary coming up with a big bucket just like Harris did as the Crusaders brought the lead down to two and now its back up to five had been an 112 run for Holy Cross before that threepoint play from Zachary Music and a foul called wave from the Applause Music ball Dean Ryan with his second that is one note here for Holy Cross Dent rabinovic Kenny and Ryan all with two fouls in this first half yeah well see what that ends up shaping up to be in the second half if those players continue to get in further foul trouble and in my eyes it gives BC more of an incentive to try to attack inside the paint remember holy crosses without Bo Montgomery today and without Luth kabali their main inside presence the senior at 69 so a little shorthanded certainly for the Crusaders all across shooting 35 from the floor Boston College 33 the Eagles again 13 more attempts from the floor to the Harris pull up jumper noson got a piece of the rebound but its down to Holy Cross and BC theyve had open looks weve seen them in the first half but I do think you have to give the Crusaders credit for the way they defended they have defended tonight three ball bat shelder good well bat shelder who set a schore record with 88 made threepointers last year as a freshman knocks down his first of the game and again its back to two and these young players for the Crusaders they just continue to step up and they have no fear coming into Cony for him have to give him a lot of credit and that was a big shot Zachary just 3 seconds remaining M Lockton at the end of the half no good Holy Cross on a 145 run to finish finish the half has cut this to a twopoint game was impressive that Holy Cross came back in if the Eagles want to get where they feel like they have a chance to this year they got to dig deep in this second half Prince alag Bay on their home floor fights Chaz Kelly tend to shoot hand off Elite Bay is fou and if thats Kenny thats three on the Junior from Richmond Virginia and that was just such a great penetration by Kelly get it to a leag Bay set up the free throws see him on the Baseline sucking in the defense and then El Bay doing a nice job with the paint making his way toward the basket and then going up and getting fouled a prince who is a 70 free throw shooter that goes in and out first Miss of the game for BC from the line Eagles have been pretty good as a team just under 78 from the foul line this year that his fourth best in the ACC and its among the top teams of the nation to 20th in the nation coming into tonight so one of two for Prince he has three Austin College putting a little bit of pressure on to begin the second half its interesting to hear from coach Paulson about the way he thought his team played offensively thought theyd settled down as the first half unfolded and that was really the case because they committed so many turnovers at the beginning of the game and settled in free ball is good Joe Newton the Freshman on the board for the first time and this game is tied at 34 and to think it was a 2817 Boston College lead in the first half but just credit the Crusaders the way they were able to just stay in this game and now found a way to tie it DeAndre DeAndre Williams picks up his second foul underneath see the setup there for the threepointer for nent they one of the Massachusetts St of on this Crusaders team and just stepping up and knocking it down hes taken a lot of threepoint shots a significant amount of his shots come from Beyond The Applause Arc they came into the game shooting just shy of 37 from long range post inside was kind of losing his footing but did a good job to still make managed to get it in and that is the first points of the game for Quinton Post Yeah hard to believe but you figure maybe in the second half hell hell take on more of that scoring responsibility a little bit of a force from Williams Zachary no post second time no but a foul I think youre right I I mean we saw a lot in the first half the double team come on post and he kind of distributed from there but at some point when youre averaging 20 points a game game you just got to find a way and he and he does right there you credit the way he was able to get in position to get that offensive rebound and you know for the Eagles in this game thats something that they have done extremely well getting those offensive boards they have 11 now in this contest post sinks the first of two but you know for post as any great player would you get a feel for the game you set up your teammates and then as the great players do they take over down the stretch Music finds the home court roll so four Now quickly for post something to watch for Holy Cross three fouls on Dean Ryan three fouls on Caleb Kenny what is an underman Holy Cross team already without kabali and Montgomery today that three is short from the Freshman Newton a leag bay stops kicks for Kelly this time passes up the the three and finds Jaden Zachary Zachary knocking down the open triple and as coach Grant said in our halftime interview with him they had open looks and figured in the second half theyd start to knock them down well thats a big three good block from post well remember we talked about Kelly had taken a few of them from three hadnt made him this time passed on it and did a good job to find the open man which was Zachary and for BC before that shot 4 17 from downtown and just a great setup there to get it to the open person that number may start to tick up if they continue to get those great looks those open shots from long range six to shoot good pass inside will bat shelder with an excellent find for Declan Ryan and Ryan hes had a nice game for Holy Cross now up to 10 points the league Bas steps in finds Chaz Kelly this time TS and makes so since Holy Cross tied the game its a 102 run for Boston College and theyre starting to feel it from Beyond The Arc again another open look for the Eagles from downtown and Kelly is able to sink it and a steal from post knocks it away to Chaz Kelly Zachary in transition blocked but a flying follow from mton and a timeout Applause Music cross well Boston College needed a burst and the Eagles find one with a 122 run in a short span and the Eagles have reestablished a 10point lead youre find a way at Boston College did that over this last run and again the shots were there but they finally start to fall here early second thats the key theyre finally starting to fall but its just good process for the Eagles to continue to to roll with what they were doing in the first half yes they werent falling but they were still good shots and as you can see there knocking down the two threepointers that theyve attempted on a 122 run to up the lead to 10 after Holy Cross remember had tied it 34 a piece and that is a 10c violation against Holy Cross they did not get it over the midline and on top of the offense the the way that theyve played on that end the Eagles defense is also really kicked into high gear here in the second half by the way its worth taking the other side of it weve mentioned it a bunch the word that Dave Paulson continued to say this week was consistency weve seen it in spurts the guys have seen what theyre able to do but now its about P putting it together for more and more time and this is a great example of it right because at the end of the first half Holy Cross did that now can they stay in it even with the Eagles building the lead back to 10 got a turnover here octave for three thats going to be important for him to find some scoring but not there yeah octav he just has been able to find that touch from long distance especially now 04 from downtown and there is post again its worth noting with Quinton remember in the nen State game he only had the one made field goal in the first half but then still manag to find 18 points in the game so we have seen this a time or two where he really goes off in the second half Jaz Kelly commits the foul there little over aggressive after it looked like belder had lost the handle I like coach Grant though just clapping at the the defensive intensity there yes it leads to a foul and that obviously works against the Eagles but still amping up the pressure here on the Crusaders but as weve talked about with post hes the best player on this Eagles team and as the great ones do they they get a feel for the game and then when they need to kick it in high gear offensively and and get their own they do and hes done that here in the second half after not scoring in the first half tried to hand off the octave Zachary made it difficult for Ryan this is what Jaden Zachary can do hes so valuable he takes your top score out of the game he has done that again tonight Zachary on the run this time and a reach in foul with bat Elder the one tied up with Jaden 1544 to go here in the second the Eagles run is now 142 over the last 3 minutes Sofi is helping me get my money right to achieve my ambitions here at Boston College he started the project this summer and thats going to make the Vlog from the corner in front of the BC bench and the Eagles lead is 5136 and a 72 run now for the Eagles that thatll draw some more viewers to the vog knocking down more threes and what a game hes had perfect from the floor well hes followed up 15 last time out against Central Connecticut with 14 so far tonight Turn Around from Kelly left hand Mill and quick post with the rebound and now the Crusaders havent scored in over two minutes the eagles look to increase this lead and increase this run pick to the corner M Lockton on the drive nearly lost the handle still managed to get it to a lead Bay stops trying to find somewhere to go as Madson with Ken still to shoot Prince a league Bay for three is short rebound between post and Kenny and a held ball will give possession to Holy Cross take a look at that three there for maton right out of the timeout knocking it down his teammates loving it and you can just tell on that look after the three how much his teammates love him and and that thats what makes that Vlog fun that they get into it as Music well Mas who came in as a transfer from Cincinnati last year heres a three ball from Singleton is good his second of the game which ties his career high with six points for the Freshman thats now six in backto Back Games M Lockton inside left hand good 10 for dein mton and what this game ends up being for the Crusaders is a showcase for their new head coach especially these freshman now theyre getting some run here here at kti Forum a chance to earn more minutes as the season progresses and I think theres a lot to like if youre coach Paulson in this game even though now theyre down by 14 theres a turnaround shot from Wills another freshman as you talk about he now has a career high thats nine points for AJ wills and theres no doubt thats quite a take from Zachary that there are minutes to be had on this Holy Cross team Dave Paulsons talked about it whos going to be our second option after Joe octave and speaking of octave BC has defended him so well today hes 0 of seven from the floor still just two points Wills not there a rebound for medson and the Eagles On The Run Mason balling away Singleton was there so gets rid of it to Jaden Zachary short from three but Quinton post is right there for the putb thats the perfect player to have if you want to clean things up off a Miss but that was still a great setup to set up the three pointer there Madson not taking the shot swinging it to the left side and even though Zachary missed it post right there and just totally different offense in this second half than we saw in the first half Eagles are now nine of 13 from the floor in this second half that create another turnover thatss in transition free that was well short but an offensive rebound Zachary fights it and a good Up and Under move oh my God 14 for Jaden and the Eagles have their largest lead of the night remember not that long ago this game was tied 3434 but its a 25 to7 Boston College runs some people just know that the best rate well Mason Madson following up his 15 against Central Connecticut with so far tonight hes kind of a threepoint specialist Off the Bench but youre also seeing him do some other things in his offensive game as well yeah hes just had another nice effort tonight and we talked about it at the top of the broadcast the need for a first guard Off the Bench when this Eagles team is healthy and Matson has stepped up again back toback games hes really shown out dein oryan straight on three is no good and another rebound Finds Its way down off of mton to Matson mlon driving in dishes off to post but wave it off the foul does go against Holy Cross but before the shot so the foul right there goes against Joe newon before mton got rid of the shot that is the third foul on Newton and five now on the Crusade ERS with still so much time left in this second half Donald Han Jr is good and the Music foul boy this offense is on fire in the second half for the Eagles and n one opportunity upcoming for Han Jr just set up on the Baseline knocks it down the bench fired up again and Eagles just with a ton of Life coming out of that the half and in this second half theyve outscored the Crusaders 28 Music to1 so one of those you you have to pick out little moments even in a game like this where well see where the score line gets to I mean this was 3434 not that long ago as we talked about but the Eagles dig their way out of a little bit of a jam there and have obviously built the lead up now its now 62 to 41 six points for Donald Music H little moments of adversity over the course of a season inside Ryan who continues to have a nice day and thats a good find from AJ wills and he has 12 now but I think thats a great point they they face some adversity in this game the Crusaders down 2817 they end up tying the game at 34 and yet the eagles with a big punch back to not only regain the lead theres a little bit a good find by Metson to set up mton that was fun to watch what a setup even though Ho Cross was kind of there a little bit so it couldnt be the highlight reel Jam but still managed to get the two 12 points for mton which is one side Shai of a season high wave off the basket Ryan is fouled underneath Dean Ryan whos already doubled his season High by the way at points for the Freshman DC extending the lead its its largest point of the night at 21 we partner with the V Foundation to highlight the urgent need for cancer

go game that was tied 34 of piece in the early moments of his second half for the Eagles offense has come to life shooting 71 from the floor in this second half so as much as they struggled from the floor in the first half when theyve needed to they have found a way theres the three ball from hen knocks down his second of the game yeah they bound a Groove offensively and they just knocked down shots too thats sometimes basketball that you get good looks but they just dont go down but eventually that evens out if you continue to get those good looks good pass by mclt and its our Mighty who ties his season high with four and theyre doing it with post play as well so theyve been able to knock down those threepoint shots they three of six from Beyond The Arc but theyve been also efficient in the paint as well in this second half and just on twopointers theres Wills whos fouled as claudell Harris was a touch behind and going for the swipe so a couple of free throws coming up for AJ Wills see the setup there from mton down low and then Mighty finishing it off and for the Eagles now points in the paint they are leading on the Crusaders 32 to2 in that category and again when you look at the size mismatch on paper especially without Luth kabali who we mentioned is out today for Holy Cross that does make sense but you still got to do it and the Eagles have certainly done that here in this second half they certainly have and on those twopoint shot shots theyre now 10 for 12 on those shots in the Applause second host and Zachary return for Boston College Caleb Kenny as well for Holy Cross one more free throw to come for Wills whos now into double figure scoring tonight so both wills and Ryan as freshman who set new career Music Applause highs a lock mlock into the back cut Paris could finish second efforts there I think thats post and thats now 10 points for post after he did not score in the first half yeah so okay maybe you worry about him a tiny bit ow no points through the first half well hes already in double figures here in the second half theres still 10 minutes left to play and again its worth noting even with the zero points he still has been producing assisting rebounding he has 10 points six assists eight rebounds today and four of those assists came in the first what five or six minutes of this game and it was just what the defense was dictating for him and he was rightly passing out of double teams Harris walks into a three oh my God how about the threepoint shot for the Eagles here in this second half now four for seven from Music Applause Music downtown bat Elder slips inside and that could not find Kenny on the pass on the back cut thats turnover number 15 for the Crusaders the Eagles who made 62 of their shots from the floor in the first half against Central Connecticut which was their most efficient half of the season they might blow that away in this second half so far theyre at 71 Donald trying to go around and the foul and thats seven on Holy Cross so 924 to go the Engles will shoot the rest of the way and well see just in terms of season high in scoring it was against Fairfield when they put up 89 that was in the first game of the year and now its 71 with 924 Music left its just amazing theyve already outscored their first half total here in the second half 38 points in the second half after 33 in the first and there are hals where you struggle offensively that are made different ways there are the ones where you kind of have to force it because the defense is doing something and then there are once as Earl Grant said for again he liked the shots they were getting they just werent going in so when you have that situation sometimes it makes the adjustment a little bit less and to the Eagles credited has start started the fall in a big way here in half number two that is out of B going to Boston College thats turnover number 16 now for the Crusaders who came in averaging 12 per game so I that in part is a credit to the eagles and their defense and the way they generated some I think early on it was very self enforced there by the Crusaders in terms of the turnovers that they were committing Harris passed it up falling away and got it it just seems like everybodys feeling it right now in the second half for the Eagles and the shots look confident and theyre smooth and its efficient its just been well done I nothing run here for Boston College and claudell Harris and his return today after missing the Central Connecticut game game coming off the bench for the first time up to 10 points and a foul underneath another look at the Harris jumper here you just see silky smooth he fakes the shot from Beyond The Arc generates a little bit of space from his Defender octave and then knocks it down Eagles have to love to see that Harris of course one of the top scorers on this Eagles Music team Caleb Kenny no good from the line after the foul on Jaden Zachary which was his second Caleb Kenny another one whos been held in check today thats now three points for Kelly whos averaging nine game so octave whos averaging 16 points per game has been held to two Harris once again on the heat check no good and then Kenny has been helping check as well the Eagles have done a good job against Holy crosss top scorers some of the other guys stepped up and filled in for a while till the beginning of this second half and there is octave who has his first field goal of the game with 810 to go and this is the part of the game where you start to feel the lack of depth right now that the Crusaders have with some of those top players on the scoring side not be available Bo you really saw the burst of Donald H as he kind of picked up the speed cycling around the that is the fourth foul by Joe Newton another fun player Donald Han the Virginia natives now stepping at the free throw line of course coming off that great game against Central Connecticut state five of nine shooting in that game 22 minutes off the bench 16 points and now after making that last free throw up to nine a chance to get to 10 Music another guy who is really taken advantage of his minutes and to remember came in as a really highly touted recruit was a McDonalds AllAmerican Game nominee in 2022 this basically all of last season took a red shirt year after being injured in the second game of the season just 37 seconds in against Detroit Mercy nearly created a turn over and in fact does el ball though possession well go to Holy Cross 743 to go here in the second DCs opened it up and thats why performances tonight even if well see what happens over the final 740 but if the Crusaders dont come back from the likes of a Dean Ryan from the likes of an AJ Wills really do matter as holy crust tries to find some other scoring outside of octave on a night like this where he struggled to find his points and those two players specifically they have played great basketball tonight had a combined seven for 11 from the floor and 23 points that was uh just a bit outside because of Miss I didnt step on your call so that makes me feel a little better post was a bidding for assist number seven strong going to the lob for a leement tried the corner and Miss know Josh Mau does wuke Brewers games in the radio and get a chance to work with Bob Yer here is Ryan who we were just talking about hes got a little bit of a mismatch here with Zachary but James such a good Defender hes still a challenge he was hoping for a held Ball but they do call it a foul on Zachary which is his third so lets talk about Dean Ryan again 12 points so far tonight hes proven to be a pretty good free throw shooter so far this year came in seven of nine hes made all four of his free throws so far tonight had only scored six points as a season high in the game against winr and really had only scored in two of his other six games that he played so far this year averaging under five minutes so he has really taken advantage of the opportunity tonight a freshman from wher Academy yeah its a confidence builder for somebody like Ryan to play in this environment against an opponent like BC and perform as well as he has and at the free throw line knocking down shots to hes six of six from the free throw line to go along with a four for six performance for the field its a very impressive effort and he does it in front of his head coach in front of this crowd against this Eagles team that has high aspirations this year and is now playing as well as it has in the second half so I I think coach Paulson has to be nothing but impressed from what hes seen from his freshman big smooth take from post there is up to 12 all of them in this second half Kenny underneath for Ryan working against post tough task heres Singleton for three and didnt get the second bounce Elijah strong whos in there for the first time for Boston College The Freshman from Charlotte was in helping out the rebound and for this Crusaders team Ive been impressed with the Poise from the young players that they have they havent looked scared at any point today and for the Eagles on their end the way theyve played in the second half its been remarkable to see but the Crusaders just continue to come and come and come and not really give up effort wise and Singleton right there you know not relenting in any way and finishing off that play So the third Crusader freshman with a career high tonight Singleton now with eight there is post for three thats off the Music mark and for post I think thats his first Miss in the second half hed been that efficient yeah it wasnt as if he was missing a ton of shots in the first half the only in a couple but again was helping the game in different ways a lot of double teams against him here is Harris is stripped but got it back but then been quite find the ankle any other run sets up AJ Applause Wills that is now a double double for Quinton post eighth of his career in fourth of the Season that 10th rebound Zachary stops turns Music got and that was just for Jade just going to say that was a pretty play there for Zachary and he had the Freshman defender on him shook him off turn around knocked it Music down Ryan Falling Away not there that time time down to 430 to go in the eagles with an 81 55 lead haris with a step back three he got it 13 for MJ Harris in his return from injury and its the 19th made field goal for the Eagles here in the second half theyre now 19 for 29 65 12 that is really impressive stuff for BC Music Wills on the drive found Kenny left hand good Caleb Kenny who came in second in The Patriot league in field goal percentage those have held him in check though has five points two of four from the floor so just hasnt had a ton of attempts octave and Kenny Eagles have done a really good job defensively theres Zachary is up to 18 another assist from Quick post by the way yeah hes s closer to a triple double going theres probably not enough time left but a really impressive performance on a day that he did not score in the first half but in this second half 126 rebounds a foul called again Kenny going up and we will be back for the finish of this one largest lead of the day for Boston College after this offensive spurts Music 8657 8657 Boston Colleges lead with 316 to go and Caleb Kenny with two shots as we return after the foul on Elijah Applause Music strong second half that has been a total turn around round in this game 53 27 is the overall second half mark a game that at one point was tied 34 AP piece the Eagles have just gone on an offensive surge theyve made 23 of their shots in this second half for the floor yeah its been an offensive explosion for the Eagles now looking to add on to it nadson Kelly back in there for BC theres Chaz Kelly who knocks down a three second threepointer of the night up to six points the Eagles in total they have six players in double Music figures Singleton against strong so you saw a lot of different pieces for Boston College as thats blocked by mton step up in some roles especially in the first half half with post did not have a point talked about a very odd game two leading scores in this game post and octave for each team had a total of two points between them in that first half so you need other guys to step up its nant with his third threepointer now is three for six from the floor as guy that can knock it down from threepoint land came in with 18 threepointers this season coming into tonight thats a goal 10 and a Applause foul so count the bucket that gives Boston College new season High by the way really interesting game coming up on Sunday as the Eagles will take on Rick patino and St Johns thatll be Sunday at the barlay center in Brooklyn its officially a neutral sight game not a St Johns home game St Johns has really beaten up on some people theyve lost a couple of games to some Mary teams as well got Rick patino taking over with a lot of transfers coming in and another fascinating test for Boston Music College did look at the video review and say that the basket stands McDonald hand is up to 12 points in the game now and make it Music 13 that makes it 92 62 Boston Music College have a quick turnaround as well obviously it was played backtoback games in Kansas City but and will return to the floor Sunday against St Johns Holy Cross still with a few more they have a little bit of a break here 10 days before taking on quinnipiack and then Harvard and Elms in the nonconference before opening Patriot league play against Dave Paulsons former School Bucknell and I think the thing you take away from today if your Holy Cross is number one its kind of the same story you saw the spurt theyve had those spurts in every game now its about putting it together for longer stretches and number two in the face of needing some people to score on the days that octave is kind of held in check season high for the Freshman Wills season high for The Freshman Ryan season high for the Freshman Singleton it was interesting hearing what coach paulon thought about this season coming into tonight and and and talking about the balance of not wanting to have too many moral victories and use that term or or kind of go along those lines but at the same time take solace on the fact that they have had nice stretches this season and we saw that again tonight as a final three from Mets and with that a new season high for Mason Matson so he has 17 following up his 15 last time out against Central Connecticut Matson with five threepointers what a add that would be if he can continue to shoot the ball well from the outside I like the eagles still playing to the final buzzer thatss hes really come on these last couple games five of six from downtown its helped him out hes had some open looks at the same time you can have open look to not knock them down and he has done that he has been able to knock down those shots from Beyond The Ark and that just gives Eagles another element and a whistle and a foul Applause called and a ATA one of the lock on will come in for Boston Music College senior has been around this program for a long time getting an opportunity for the second time this year and in back to back games too with the Eagles being able to build up these big leads at 3 minutes of run against Central Music Connecticut still sorting out the last sequence last foul was on Devin mlon so thats why the free throws are here for Holy Cross and renovich senior from down the road in Hopkinson mass and another rebound for mlon that gives him seven for the game so 12 points six of 11 for the for seven rebounds on a nice day for mton trying to set up Abe a TIA passed it off theyre going to cycle it around for Abe again shoot Abe oh just off the mark but I love that everybody in the take 20 passes it was going to a and everybody was holding their breath to see if he can knock it down good to see him get one off and maybe hell get one more for benovic from way out and thatll do it so at one point this game was tied 34 a piece but Boston College picks things up and runs away from Holy Cross 61 30 from the last point this game was tied and the Eagles win B yeah great effort by The Eagles after
