Lets see if Cal can take advantage of it Cal is on the outside of the tournament right now looking in They need to start stacking wins And for Stanford on the bubble Joe Lonards got him as the last team out right now despite their four quad one wins And a win today for Stanford keeps them in sixth place in the ACC And the quick foul on AJ Roi who gets the start today Big Cardinal gone due to injury Chismak par who missed last weekends Duke Carolina games They announced this week hes out for the year And here comes Aorei the other way with the left hand swatted by Chris Bell What recovery speed Manory has an extra gear in transition Here is Justin Pippen John Camden Hes always a threepoint threat Number two in blue Pippen looking to body up the defender and the finger roll with the right hand Really nice job Four out or five out that time And that gives Pippen room to work inside on the switch There is the starting five You can count on at least 20 for key for them might be the others tonight And thats one of them Benny Geler their top threepoint threat And he delivers the starting five for Cal with Ames and Pippen and Camden And then Lee Dort one of the best rebounders in the ACC Here he is with the catch down low and a foul And that is two in the first two minutes for Rahosi and he will have to leave So with Akara out already trouble inside for Stanford as they will get Oscar Hilte to check in between free throws for Dort the 610 senior from Dallas Hes a big body and Stanford doesnt really have a body like that to match up with him So as you take a look at Akara yeah to Dorts got to play really well Tough break for the card Hes out with the lower leg injury suffered on January 10th So Dort at the line for the best free throw shooting team in the ACC Both have had a week to prepare for this game after they both lost to Duke last weekend and beat North Carolina in home games last weekend Theyre going to try to show two bodies on Okore when they can Theyre going to show numbers in the gap They have to keep him out of the paint Here is Okorei Yeah he doesnt want to scream Hes waving off Flattened out Flattening it out He doesnt want another defender Heres Agarwal Okorei can do more than score Nine times this year hes led the team in assists Agarwal couldnt convert on that one Heres Dort Twoman game with Pippen Well if you can take Oori to the paint and to the block you want to try to put him in some foul trouble But he did a good job defending right there Holding his ground against Pippen The first of two meetings They will see each other in Berkeley in late February Really good scramble on the back side of that defense by Cal O Cory draws the foul Thats his game Get it inside Get to the line Fouls on Bell Heres two players right here You see Camden stretching out on the hedge and then trying to recover But what Oy does really well and they worked on it this week That little hesitation right there allows him to read as the defense goes away to recover and scramble He does see the floor really well Second in the league in free throw attempts Debbie About 30 of his scoring comes with the freebies cheering Gets to the line about eight times a game A little over eight actually This is a good matchup right here I think Justin Pippen is a really solid guard with good size Of course we know the lineage of Scottys son Really understands the game Dads in attendance watching tonight Justin averages about 14 a game Heres Bell Scramble for the rebound And I think theyre going to get a foul on Borton Theres Scotty in attendance down along the baseline I dont think he liked that call Sixtime champ with the Bulls Michael Jordan Jordans Carolina Tarios got a big win today against Virginia Agarwal from Cororey Youre going to have to knock down those open shots Thats a really good job of getting in the gap and setting up that threepoint shot in the corner Kyle Smith thought that was going to be significant Can the other guys help out with the offensive production And theres Pippen on a drive and a foul on O Curry Justin will get to the line 63 sophomore from Los Angeles Theres Kyle Smith now in his second season with the card cheering Pippen hits on the first 82 free throw shooter fourth in the ACC in steals for the transfer from Michigan Was there his freshman year leads the team in assists at four a game Thats the challenge at this level with the way the ball screen coverages are to be able to see all nine players I think Okore and Pippen can both do that Agarwal keeping that dribble alive and thats going to be a foul Are they going to give it to Bell If its on Dort its his second Theyre going to give that to Bell And thats two on Bell So now each side has a starter in trouble I think both teams have equal depth Beth I dont think that would favor either one except for you know keeping Dort on the floor because hes got a bigger wider frame And rebounding is such an important part Hes so good at carving out space especially on the offensive glass They will keep Bell Cal will Mark Matson will keep him on the court with the two fouls Cameron Grant Aiden Cam and Jeremy Dent Smith all checking in for Stanford Agarwall rebounds the miss Dent Smith is another threepoint threat coming in off the bench 25 and White and theyre going to get a foul on the screen up top on Keman Eric Lewis with the whistle Anthony Eids Michael Kits our officiating crew today in California Camden Elich slipping that screen Wide open Cam from Dent Smith on the roll Two baskets that Stanford had scored have been in transition So right now Cals got to do a better job of matching up the Giler three and that screen and roll Camden hesitates and hits from downtown John Cam has made 49 triples coming into the game Its really improved his catch and shoot and his shot prep according to coach Mark Madson Theres his 50th of the year Okorei to the left side and draws another foul He I I think he can get by anyone that guards him and given some space he reads applause And welcome to Maples Pavilion here in Stanford Beth Mowens alongside Debbie Anteneelli and Ibuka Cororey A couple of free throws to give the card the lead early on here 10 to nine in this West Coast rivalry in the Bay Area tonight Packed house on hand The Cardinal won all three of their matchups two in the regular season and then in the ACC tournament headtohead a year ago Chris Bell up top Its been back and forth early on Both teams trying to figure each other out a little bit And theyre going to get a foul on John Camden for the Stanford Cardinal One of the best freshman in the country is Ibuka Okorei out of Ashawa New Hampshire averaging 22 a night And he is a key When hes on they win If hes not putting up a big number they struggle Well he impacts and affects winning in a lot of different ways not just scoring He is a top 10 scorer in the country And thats not just the freshman That is one of the best scorers in the nation He can fill it up in all three levels And right here he doesnt want to screen He wants to flatten it out and take Justin Pippen off the bounce Hell stay outside the line hard on the three Thats the third time hes asked for a clear out on the top of the floor Pippen whoa sweet move and then turns it over Backto back steals for Jeremy Dent Smith Nice pocket pass to Cam who gets another easy layup Theyve been a nice onetwo punch off the bench here early on I think one of the issues for Cal on the road early is I think theyve given up three transition baskets a triple to Benny Giler in the corner and then two backtoback pick and roll options They got to match up sooner Camden off the mark there Oki cant knock that down He starts out the day 0 for three with four free throws Well Cory has a different shifty change of speed doesnt he I mean even when it doesnt look like theres something he is putting pressure on your defense up the floor Day Ames the leading scoreer for Cal looking to go to work Hell fade and come up short Backto back defensive STANCE BY STANFORD Late shot clock Bears open up the game two for nine Dent Smith off the BOUNCE AND GETS THE HOME ROLL One of the things Cal talked about in shootound was making sure they run Stanford off the threepoint line They do that with Jeremy Den Smith Hes 9 for5 in his last two games outside the arc Lob inside and the nice rat for Enich the 610 grad student from Serbia Its a very experienced Bears team in terms of a lot of seniors and grads out there Dent Smith gets an open look and buries it You got to have high hands and take vision away from Okore He throws that on a bullet on a skip Stanford opens up shooting 50 here in the first eight minutes Pippen trying to go back door in a kick Jeremy Den Smith comes in the game and changes the rhythm defensively and it allows them up the floor to play a little pick and roll game in transition And heres his triple right after he drives Its a great skip over the top by Okori You got to have high hands on the ball handler Beth You got to have better ball pressure Subs coming in for Cal Carr and Campbell are out there and so is Nolan Dorsy Pippens fade cheering wont go and Dent Smith out top Both sides are down a starter with early foul trouble tonight Geler way outside that wont fall Stanford really not trying to break away on THE MISCUE AND HE throws it down applause How about the big guy rumbling stumbling up the floor for the dunk STANFORD ASKED CAL OUT OF sorts early on Just one bare basket in their last seven trips Pippen called for a screen Pippen got a couple of defenders to fly by and its Donovan Young weak side on the glass Both teams controlling the boards We mentioned earlier that rebounding was important Neither teams giving up an offensive rebound until now THERES THE ONE OH WHAT A BLOCK BY PIPPEN from behind cheering Denies the dunk YOUNG WORKING ON THE GLASS AND hes fouled HUSTLE PLAYS MADE BY THE CARD Top Debbie Both coaches worried about the rebounding situation and Marks a lot more worried right now than Kyle Smith is Well they have a minus two rebounding margin on the season so its been an issue for them this this year particularly in the ACC Cal started out just three of 12 shooting while Stanford is closer to 50 And Geler they get pushed on the baseline with 3 seconds on the shot clock And that is the seventh team foul 10 minutes into the game and Mark Matsons team is already in the bonus Put has put Stanford in the bonus Third season for Mark They started out hot In fact their best in 17 years with a ninegame winning streak in November and December Its been a little tougher sledding come ACC play Debbie But for both these teams in a fight to get back to the NCA tournament their schedules were frontloaded with ranked teams in league play They have a chance to do some damage now in February and forward I think both these teams have another level that they can get to Of course Stanford still adjusting without Chisum Actara who is out for the year with a knee injury Just announced this week and they will miss his toughness and physicality Terrific bench production so far for the Cardinal Thats been a big difference to their start tonight Shot clock winding down Campbell to Dayday for three and the lefty rattles it in and out And theres the first offensive rebound of the night for the Bears Well coming off the timeout at least they got the ball below the free throw line They have been playing on the top of the floor and deep into the shot clock Ames will step back for three Front rims it Another offensive rebound and its blocked How about Guill off the bench Hes been fantastic He and Jeremy Den Smith both have done a nice job The 610 freshman from Belgium is Oscar Heilte has spent some time in the Belgium national program and as were saying such nice things about he row All right Ibuka Cory back on the floor eighth in scoring in the country second in the ACC behind Cameron Boozer third nationally amongst this great freshman class in scoring with Boozer and AJ Debansa from BYU up there with him I think Kyle Smith does a good job of managing his minutes as well He plays just under 34 a game and right here hes going to get a steal Yeah in fact sixth in the league in minutes per game See how much longer coach Matson will go without Justin Pippen on the floor right now Hes really frustrated with his team Chris Bell is sitting with two fouls for Cal Starter AJ Rajosi sitting with two early fouls for Stanford Young they kick it out the other way and Dick Smith for three That is excellent ball movement and forcing ANOTHER CAL TIMEOUT FOUR and that is hard for any defense to recover from Step C has been a step late in the quarter court as well Beth And how about this for Stanford The others have been big early on with a Cory without a field goal and yet youre up a dozen We talked about others having to make some plays Jeremy Den Smith has made some plays off the bench Yeah look at that 14 of them for the card forcing Cal to get Chris Bell back on the floor with a couple of fouls And for Kyle Smith he talked to us today at shootound If we can get the other guys going to help Ibuka out were in business In his second season big improvement a year ago They got to 21 wins Its been a busy January already for them Debbie ranked losses to Virginia and Duke but ranked wins against Louisville and Carolina and beat Virginia Tech on the road their last three wins in league play Theyve got four quad one wins a couple of ranked wins their most in 11 years You got to go back to the 2014 season which oh by the way is their last trip to the NCAA tournament And at 14 and five they are on their way there Joey Brackets has them right now as the first team out with a strength of schedule of 65 and the four Q1 wins Projected nine ACC teams in the field right now Stanford leaning towards a 10th and more quad one opportunities throughout the remainder of February as the league only got four teams in last year on the drive and a foul will get Ames to the free throw line Yeah I think the adjustment for Mark Matson has been to get his team to get the ball more aggressively below the free throw line Try to set up some other options instead of staying on top of the floor Ames is the junior from Chicago His third collegiate stop Scoring has gone up this year as Pippen will also come back in and they need to do something to disrupt a 162 Stanford run over the last seven minutes You could feel the uh intensity from coach Madson out of that last timeout I mean he certainly understands the rivalry Played in it on the Stanford side coaching in it on the Cal side Ok Cory still searching for his first basket Offensive rebound and the kick out Dent Smith Another Oboard Agarwal Second chance Points around and down Just a tough gritty effort right now by Stanford They are really digging in Instead of letting Cal back in it they are extending their lead cheering No field goals in the last five minutes for Cal Ames coaching us Who is this Camden passes tipped They couldnt find him cheering Numbers for the card DENT SMITH GET IT AS OKOREI FINDS the three shooter in transition Smart I call it understanding the three Ws Who to get the ball to when and where Thats good point guard play How about Jeremy Den Smith Three for four outside the threepoint line off the bench He had his careerhigh last weekend in their big Carolina win Hit six triples out of Hawthorne California Tough defense there on Ames as well Day eight for three No cheering Stanford will come away with it Kyle just one of eight from downtown He throws a lot of onehanded passes over the top with his size You get high hands on that You get can can get that deflection Bells pass within the bench Heres Okore on for a similar outcome And they have started out hot 2913 18 points off their bench Coming off the timeout theyre going to get a Cororey off the ball And Cal shooting has been frigid thus far O Cory still without a basket but doing some of the other things for the card Theres a nice feed Pippen to Bell Theyre looking for an and one no call Yeah Im looking for Justin Pippen to get going here He Hes got to get going offensively Hes a 14point a game scoreer Here he is on the move and passes that one into the second row up the floor right here He sees Bell and he waits to throw the lob Bell looking for a foul But you got to get back See how hes calling for his teammates to get back in transition Stanford has really hurt them in that aspect of the game Bears only averaged nine turnovers a game already at six in this first half I love those possessions where you only dribble with a purpose and you move the ball because your spacing is so good Its hard for the defense to catch up Geler off the bounce Shot clocks winding down Theyve got to launch and a shot clock violation Are they going to get a foul first No Seeing a lot of Milo Elich with the foul trouble for Dort Hes got two as Dent Smith will come back on and a Cororey will check out All right so Cal has gotten four straight stops Can they chip away Theres Pippen The pull up three I think theyre going to look at that the next break Simple ball screen in transition Stanford dropped below the level of the screen and he was wide open Here comes Pippen again on the march Pippen good relocation on the perimeter and he hits on Q Hes got to go I MEAN CAL needs him And its a timeout KYLE SMITH Hes got four free throws but does not have a field goal The bench production has been terrific so far in the first half for the card I mean nice change defensively by Mark Matson to come with the fullcourt pressure especially without the oneman press breaker ORI on the on the bench Coach Matsons put a lot of energy into getting this comeback right I mean down by as many as 16 First foul on Ames will get Aggerall Agarwal to the line for the one and one And Stanford got in the bonus at the 10minute mark because Cal put them there with their sloppy defense right Theyre late on every play They seem to have picked up their energy Da Ames loves to go left Pippen Oh may have traveled down there Camden gets an open look and hell knock those down all day His second three tonight Camden a tremendous threepoint threat 39 in ACC play Theres a couple of guys right around 40 outside the arc for Mark Madson Agarwal trying to muscle his way inside Elish and here comes Pippen again on the run Bell will pull up transition three and hes fouled and three freebies coming Lets uh check out the Pippen Puppies Debbie Does he keep them down He lands on two and he pump fakes So his left foot is his pivot foot He pumps again He moves that Oh thats a travel Thats a travel Yeah And it leads to a Camden three Got away with one there That could be huge later on Heres Bell at the line And the first miss of the night for the best free throw shooting team in the ACC Now six for seven and Bell 90 from the line Transfer from Syracuse a th00andpoint scoreer number one And here comes a Cororey back in Lets see if Kyle Smith tries to get him an opportunity quickly here for his first basket of the night I would keep in mind Cal might like to press again They pressed last time Pick up full court Now back away Well it has been a while That was last Saturday His last bucket here Theyve been getting two bodies on him quite a bit Opportunity here for Grant Long rebound to Ames Good skip to Camden Nice fake and ANOTHER KNOCKDOWN HIS THIRD OF THE BALL GAME And here comes Cal WITHIN A BUCKET TRAILING BY AS MANY AS 16 here in the first half Agarwall just really quick shot by Sanford They have done such a good job of moving the basketball Over the top Elich to Camden Nice ball fake Too easy Last four buckets for the Bears have all been triples So Heilte with a pair of free throws coming Were looking ahead to February 5th womens basketball play for K Double header on ACC Network Carolina and Clemson Florida State and NC State Thats Thursday night Feb 5th Big one on Monday night Feb 2 when North Carolina visits NC State That one I believe will be on the deuce Thats the big play for K Thats the epicenter of pay play for K in the KL Cancer Fund Of course you played for coach Al Debbie at NC State one of the alltime greats on the womens side just like Tara Vanderver here at Stanford with her name on the court So is coach Ys Going to be a reachin foul here on the Cardinal Thatll be Okorei his second Well he got caught on a switch and Cal didnt really recognize it So on the penetration he reached in to foul Hes just not in rhythm yet Cal on the bonus for Bell And Oki will check back out Its a really great recruiting story about Oy Brewster Academy cheering commits to Harvard All his teammates at Brewster Academy are getting big D1 offers He puts himself back in the portal And Kyle Smith and staff were all over it Hes been a really great story across college basketball as have the entire freshman class this year Its been amazing Monsters Fell cant knock down the second Stanford without a basket their last nine possessions Good scramble here for Cal defensively Young down the lane SCOOPS IT UP AND IN Thatll end the drought Under two minutes to go in this half zone Stanford played seven possessions a zone against Duke 21 against North Carolina Camden spins in the lane over Grant hits Don Camden have a game Joins Pippen in double figures here in the first half Six for his last six shot attempts cheering They have really pushed that ball screen offense away from the floor and now theyre scrambling and recovering quickly They theyve definitely gotten better energy Chance to tie or grab the lead Pippen Theres Carr off the bounce Gets to the rim LAYS IT UP AND IN And a chance for a free throw to go in front Big comeback here for the Bears Nice ball fake Good ball reversal The lane opens up and then after the play you see Hilte just takes Carr out They were down 14 with five minutes to play in the first half And now a run over the last four minutes to go in front behind the play of Justin Pippen He got him going He was the spark and chance of California ringing through Maples Pavilion from the visitors Look how far theyre stretching and still recovering You You got a short roll You got to quickly move the ball out of that double Dent Smith high arcing shot wont go TT Carr the freshman from Mil Valley with the board Pippen uses the screen Final 30 seconds of the half Not that much time for Cal with the shot clock Campbell finds some room and hits the three THEY STARTED OUT ONE FOR eight from downtown Theyve hit their last five FINAL seconds of the half and they do not get a shot up FOR STANFORD THE FINISH WITH A FLOURISH FOR THE BEARS and theyve got the lead at the break He does not have a basket and he doesnt have a point in the last 15 minutes Well theyve brought two to the ball They have been in the gaps Theyve showed him numbers Theyve made it really challenging for him to get going He is number one in white and one of the top freshman scorers in the country Here he is with it checks the shot clock off the bounce Brian Aggerwall in the lane short AJ Roi with a rebound and around and out on the second chance AMES WITH THE PUSH AND THE FINISH When you can control the glass you can get up the floor Nice job of running ahead of the basketball by Cal since that Madson timeout A 299 run for Cal and Rahosi misses another one close range Dort showing some discipline right there Not to foul He had two fouls in that first half Well hes fouled out of four games this year so he is prone to foul trouble Only played seven minutes Thats 34 in blue You cant let Day ends get to that LEFT HAND AND ONE AND A FOUL ON GELER THATS WHY BETH GELER HAD HIM OVER THERE ON HIS right hand but you let him get back to that left hand Nice clear out here by Cal Nobody down the lane line and Agarwal cant help because hes got Bell in the corner Its a welldesigned play You help off the strong corner Thats a pitched for three to Bell screaming Day to the line 85 and that goes in and out Transition defense for Cal Much better They have been able to load up their D especially against ORI Stanford was settling for a lot of three attempts the last 10 minutes of the first half Theres Oy And theres his first bucket So in the first half Oy three times on the top of the floor called for a clear out because he had the Justin Pippen oneonone matchup He likes that matchup Here they are squaring off at the other end Dort wasnt looking for the pass And now theyre going to get a foul on Young So Cory finally breaks the seal here a couple minutes into the second half Its a somewhat isolation and just go make a play Your 22 point per game score second in the ACC Hes got to get going here at home Four 30point outings in his last eight games including a freshman record 36 in the Carolina win last week Ames another shot at a threepoint play as he goes to work on Geler Backto back possessions ISO on this end ISO on the other end Back to another ISO Day Ames just bullying Geler in the paint Six buckets in their last six possessions for Cal And this time Ames is able to finish off the three from down 16 to up nine See how they corral O Cory Theyd rather give that up on the backside and work to recover She misses another lay in the paint Numbers and a bad pass from Pippen behind Bay Day Thats a twoon one that you have to convert Thats a break for Sanford Cory going to get off the ball right here See if they can get him on a single side instead of the top of the floor where theyve been able to trap him Dent Smith will run the point He was huge in the first half for them 11 off the bench and here is Okorei Dort brings the big double Aggerwall three Got it When they reverse the ball and get a second side Theyve been successful Thats a much better shot selection for Agarwal His first triple He has eight Another zone possession by Stanford I think sometimes you could go zone here to minimize the lack of size in the back court because theyre getting picked on Pippen runs into the bigger defender Now its Dent Smith defending on Ames at the top of the zone Forces a tougher shot Uses his chest to stop him from driving Little bit bigger thicker defender on Dayday Ames Lets go Dent Smith baseline floater Air ball Pippen trying to work on the smaller defender and its a foul on Cory and thats his third So pip into the line 82 cheering Hey the latest in the war number one documentary series will be the 1993 North Carolina champs led by Dean Smith Never before seen footage and plenty of interviews with players and coaches Its now streaming on your ESPN app Pippen now with 11 points three assists Okore stays on the floor with the three fouls Here he is again They will throw a double at him with Dort Make him throw a bounce pass across the top of the floor Allows you to recover defensively Young rebounds his own miss No reset Dent Smith off the bounce Hes playing really good cheering Solid aggressive applause trying to get downhill Hes a tremendous threepoint shooter is Jeremy Den Smith Hes got 13 now on five of nine from the floor I like the zone switch right here Camden beats it from midrange Telling you John Camden can flat out shoot it When you got a stretch four that can manipulate space on the floor like Camden cans a bump from Ames Thatll be his third personal Cal up eight Didnt you today about the freshman around the country Im telling you right now look at this Keen Katon Waggler goes into Purdue Backtoback losses for Matt Painters team AJ Debansa has been killing it all year Kingston Flemings the 42 in a loss on the road at Texas Tech Then of course Cameron Boozer leads the ACC in scoring and hes been one of the most consistent scorers all season long He had 32 today 30 here for Duke in a win last weekend Dont forget Duke host Louisville Monday night on ESPN Dort couldnt finish on the jam Camden can on the drive and Cal has a crack at a third oldfashioned three in the first five minutes of the half Off the timeout Dort misses Camden right there on the rebound Foul Aggerwall I mean the floor feels tilted The way Cal has been running the way theyve been crashing the glass This is a 26point swing from down 16 to up double digits Started with Justin Pippen and a much more inspired Cal defense It just seems like Cal has pushed Stamford way up the floor with their offense Maybe they if their screens maybe were set a little bit lower maybe that would put more pressure on the on the rim and in the lane Cant get anything going in the paint right now Dort with a big block They have held Oori in check Just one of six so far in the game And Dort with the rim protection This is not the Cal team that showed up in the first 12 minutes of the game What an incredible job Mark Matson did in using his timeouts to get his team focused Oh Cory now one for seven tonight Sometimes in a rivalry on the road you may be a little amped up Your coach is all excited about being here And transition buckets TIME OUT KYLE SMITH HES SEEN ENOUGH RICHMOND hes got a family of athletes And its the shot preparation that Madson talked about Quicker release footwork footwork creating space finding openings on the perimeter getting behind the basketball when you shoot it getting stronger How does Stanford respond after their ability to drive it into the lane in the first 10 minutes of this game Its been a real struggle Cleaned up nicely there by Hilte as Cal has really just pushed him right out of the paint Bears are trying to end a fivegame skid cheering in this series They lost all three matchups a year ago including getting bounced in the ACC tournament So as the ball moves across the top of the floor John Camden flashes to the nail and when he catches it he turns and immediately looks to get to the rim Already the sixth team foul on Stanford Next Saturday ACC Network is alive with mens hoops Pit and Clemson will start things off at noon and then North Carolina Georgia Tech at 200 Two more games later in the day for the quadruple header next Saturday on ACC Another great job by Brad Brownell 27 wins last year Replace your whole starting five Dylan Hunter does not get enough credit the point guard for how well hes played And a great job in a portal by Brad Brownell and his staff They only have one loss in the ACC Theyre in the mix Yeah they picked up a win today against Georgia Tech Theyre one game behind Duke Blue Devils have Louisville Monday night on ESPN and then Virginia Notre Dame Tuesday night on ESPN 2 Good for the Cardinals and good for basketball that Muel Brown Jr is back after missing eight games Played today had 20 He didnt make the freshman graphic He only had 20 Need 30 or 40 today to get on that list Bell tried to draw the foul No whistle but Cory could use an easy one to get him going Look how they had all those jerseys keeping it out of the paint forcing a tough three He should have advanced past it up the floor to Agarwal He was open and then he can get it back You got If you advance past Beth you flatten out the defense you open up the top of the floor Thats where hes really good He needs some space Just one for nine now in the game And Chris Bell to the line already into the bonus for Cal Bears are 15 of 19 Front end is good Unless we got a lane violation Yes we do So wipe that one away Here comes the double Back to Camman who has the range Hell stay at this end This is where Kyle Smiths teams got to be really good is executing on situations right here and and typically his team is good Looking for an answer right now A spark to get him going Outscored 18 to nine so far in this third quarter Okore on the out of bounds One for 10 Ames lost the handle Numbers for the card Dent Smith Hes cheering got 15 35 points in the last two games for Jeremy They got to get a couple of stops in a row here cheering They got to get some momentum Get this crowd going too Take advantage of the home court Nice back door Off the wraparound pass And there is the second stop in a row for Stanford applause Okorei pushes into the lane short Just cannot buy one today and one cheering and finally a chance for the home folks to get on their cheering feet Couple of stops in a row can build some mojo How about going from fast to slow and finishing at the rim Opportunity will be their spark 20 last Saturday now 18 today as he threatens a new careerh high Pippen floater No thats four straight stops for Stanford They play without Okore right now whos had a rough night Oh got to hit him on the wrong slides through the double team and hell take hits And here come the card WITHIN A COUPLE OF SCORES Mark Madson told us that we would stay with the same ball screen coverage if it worked And it has been working They have stretched Stanford up to the top of the floor but you cant make that mistake on that roll right there You got to attack from the weak side Its a 70 run Ping inside SLOTTED The big Belgian sends it Nice help at the rim Good protection inside Teams are pretty even in the paint I mean the difference for Stanford is theyve got 17 points off 10 Cal turnovers They need to keep bringing their D Well they tried the loud door That wont go He lands awkwardly Hurt on the play Five on four Stanford And a foul called And Dort in some discomfort It looked like he he was maybe somewhat I dont want to speculate but maybe cramping He looked like he was hurt before he came down Theyve missed a couple of shots at the rim as well So that was the fourth foul on Dayday Ames by the way He stays on the floor but Dort does not Hes out So you see Ames with four Elish Camden Bell having some issues Geler came offensive rebound Aggerwall wide open corner wont go Im looking for Camden on this right here Pippen has had a couple of drives to the basket and not been successful Over three minute drought Theyve missed on their last five possessions Ames Yeah he gets to that Gets to that left hand Beth You got to keep him on the right side if you can Its so challenging because hes so committed He plays the game so low to high Wall driving on Campbell Has to pitch it back out Where does the scoring come from with this Stanford unit Tough pass through too much traffic Passes too long and then he commits the foul in transition Little frustration there from Jeremy I mean you make a mistake and you try to make up for it Hes Hes going my bad right now to his teammates cuz now youre sending an 82 free throw shooter to the line Stanford throws a lot of onehanded passes and I know it gets the ball there quicker but there are times today where they have resulted in turnovers Like once you start to make that motion you cant get it back Camden knocks down the first His season high is 25 He had a 30point plus outing in his days at Delaware and hes lighting it up tonight 22 now for John His threepoint shooting has improved has Camden six7 to as you mentioned earlier 96 threes last year at Delaware Really gotten better Oh Cory back in the game for Stanford Here he is ball in his hands One for 11 from the floor Just six points so far averaging 22 a night Stanford got to attack right here Okorei does just that high off the window and it tips out The connectivity on the defensive end of Cal has been so good I mean they are habits are outstanding Their short choppy steps on the close out Theyre running Stanford off the threepoint line They got high hands The the long staying with them on a hedge on a stretched out hedge has worked Stanfords gone back to zone Pippen short Well Cory has a oneonone opportunity He hasnt had many of those today And he drives and draws Thats a smart play because if you reset it and bring it back to the top of the floor you allow Cal to rewitch back and get the matchups they want He had a matchup that he knew he could take off the bounce See his eyes light up on that one Debbie He said Oh my god I only got one defender on me And its a punch play and its a post player 81 at the line Hes four for four all of those coming in the first five minutes You know hes just off and and what hes got to learn is that hes going to have to make a play on the defensive end Go get an offensive rebound Try to get disruptive with your defense See if you can get yourself back in it by making a play in another area besides scoring Thats the second one to go Screen to the top of the zone for Bell Camden Rare miss for him tonight Now seven of nine Cory attacks I mean that ball has hit every piece of the rim for him tonight and not the bottom of the net You could just sense the anticipation in the building and the gasp when it didnt find the bottom of the net So hes back to the free throw line Well theres no better teacher in times of adversity through practice than Kyle Smith Hes been so successful across his career And Jim Shaw right there next to him has been with him a long time as well They theyll figure it out for Oy right Theyve got times to with 8 minutes left Yep Theyve gotten it back to within six a few moments ago Down by as many as 13 after they blew the big lead in the first half And they got to get it done with their quarter court defense This is not a team that really likes to extend their pressure The door has been open Cal is just one for its last eight CARR LEFT DAVE SMITH got it Oh Cory wants it Agarwall quick trigger for three Hamnick No cheering Cant have it D Smith the spark tonight Blocked at the rim PIPPEN HELL TRY from downtown and thats going to be a foul on Carrer Bell was open on the wing 706 to go in a fourpoint game And while Okore has struggled one for 12 0 for seven he is seven for eight at the free throw line Coming into the day Joe Lonardi said they were the first team out of the NCAA tournament So holding court at home at a premium for Stanford See if they can stack up a couple more Q1 wins next month How about this A twopoint game Pippen whos been scoreless in this second half He was the spark for them in the first staying in that zone WHICH HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE FOR changing the rhythm of the game You have to change the rhythm somehow You cant play the same way all the time Camden trying to face up on Young does and off the ball A foul on Cal and a scrum for the rebound So Stanford shows zone They match up late in the clock doing a really nice job here getting another stop Then you see just uh tangled up in the paint Elich his fourth So the big guy will stay in there because we still have not seen Lee Dort return to the game He now has ice on his left knee sitting over there on the bench from an injury earlier in the half So heres Cayman and the next one can tie it up Both sides have seen doubledigit leads disappear tonight and Mark Madson wants a timeout Defense Yeah theyve taken away the Cal triple Six in the first half for the Bears just one in the second So heres Cayman to tie And now the crowds back too 100 run I like Camden in that nail area ACC logo area Bell hits a big three Good timeout by Mark Madson You get the bucket you get the shot you want Really good execution Theyre scoring like 11 points after atall probing leans into Ames And if thats on day hes gone Lets see who they give the foul to I think theyre going to give it to Bell after Bell just hit that three Thats his third I still think Okore is going to have something to say about the end of this game Beth Six minutes to go The freshman has not shot it well but he has not dropped his head Hes continued to stay aggressive Hes an excellent free throw shooter and he plays I mean the numbers show it Hes got to play well for them to win Hes still got time Pippen calls for a screen Den Smith able to get over the top of it Now they got to go Pippen keeps the dribble alive pitches it out to the corner Camden short Old board wont go Pippen elevates and I think he got fouled and he comes down hard Theyre going to get Donovan Young for the foul Well he hits his head on the back of Camdens leg Back of his head on the leg and Scotty whos right underneath this bucket tells Justin Hey step away Collect yourself before these free throws I thought Cal might want to check to see if there was goalending involved but no look So Pippen makes the first I thought Scotty was telling him Throw some dirt on it and get back in there Fourpoint advantage Five and a half to go Cory tries to split the double and a reach in and thatll be on Pippen One of the first things Mark Matson said to us today at shoot around is we cannot let him split us in the double Just did it And back to the free throw line Eight of their last 11 points have been from the stripe But its the only time hes done it so far in the game And he misses again at the stripe Well we talked about the missed layups Now we got to start talking about the missed freebies Seven of them Back to a one possession game Pippen gets some space behind the screener and hits a big three his third of the game Hes got 17 Their ball screen defense has been so good Cal nice play by Agarwal to tip it Its another missed layup and another opportunity D Smith for three Stanfords going to come out with it again Fourth opportunity on this possession Okorei floater short Hes one for 14 And now Cal will take their time Pippen just hit one Hell let Bell Gab have a go Out of bounds to the card Cal will make a substitution Get Ames out DJ Campbell returns Theyre going to get Oy off the ball this time I think Jeremy Dent Smith has been the most aggressive off the bounce Theyre going to run him off the Iverson cut and he rejects the ball screen Look at the jerseys that have been around him all game Cam gets it back out to Okori Weak side rebound each under four to play I mean Kyle Smith is trying everything to try to get him going He cant get a piece of the paint Cals done a great job gapping it up and their ball screen coverage has been outstanding They have pushed Stanford up the floor Pippen one v one Shot clock winding down Has to fade TIME OUT OH BOARD for Campbell who just CHECKED INTO THE GAME How did he get that rebound WHAT AN INCREDIBLE BOARD Time out Its a pretty decent free throw shooter And Oori just struggled from the floor but Kyle Smith has not given up on his young freshman On the other side for Cal the big comeback tonight 17 for Justin Pippen 22 for John Camden this evening And after trailing by 16 in the first half up by as many as 13 in the second as they try and end a fivegame losing streak against their rivals They need to start stacking up some wins They are on the outside looking in According to Joe Lonards brackettology they need to get it over John Camden worked really hard on that possession right there and ends up with the rebound Hes been fantastic all game Big hedge from Camman pushes Pippen out They had to switch Oh again cheering Campbell backto back offensive rebounds Deep on the glass with second chance points battling injuries all season long Coming up with a couple of really big plays here late and now its back up to a 10point lead The Bears in front coming up on two minutes to go Camman three in and out And there is DJ again DJs rebounding late When youre a team that struggles to rebound with a minus two margin all season you need your guards to help And he has done that Hes made big plays on the glass Camden open look for THREE AND HE NAILS IT That might be the one JOHN CAMDEN BETH FIVE for eight Hes tied his season high with 25 And its a oneandone trip for Stanford They kept their cool WHEN THEY GOT DOWN BIG EARLY Mark cheering Matson a huge timeout to help turn the tide They have kept Oore in check and they are trying to seal this deal Pippen OH MY GOODNESS THE FINISH FROM CHRIS BELL SOARING IN OH CORY FOULED ON THE DRIVE What did we just see What a finish by Cal Watch this TAKE that Taylor Tannon bomb in the studio to the guys Put that one up against the best of the day Monster jam from Bell swooping in The cal faithful are busting at the seams now in Maples Mark Madson did a heck of a job with his team They were late in transition They were a half a step slow in the quarter court defensively and when they got down by double digits and that second timeout turned everything around Pippen got it going and John Camden had one of his best allaround basketball games And now they will work the clock I wonder if Mark Matson will change his mind about the best moment in this building if it will be tonight versus the times he had as a player One of his biggest here at Stanford was against Cal and a 51point win which stands as the biggest in series history And for Mark music big success in this rivalry as a Stanford player not so much as the Cal Coach until tonight And this is a doozy First double digit road win against Stanford in 16 years California number three TG Car Jeremy Benson issue two in winning time Cal just pulled away They made the plays Yeah And theres Matson from his playing days Six and one coaching days one and five And that will change this evening as Dent Smith ties his careerhigh backto back 20 point performances But it is bare territory in hostile territory tonight The defense does the job holding Okorei to one of 16 shooting and they will have bragging rights at least until late February when they meet again in Berkeley Mark Matson told us if the hedge is working we will stay with it We will not change the looks on Okorei if that works And it worked all game They were locked in on the scout and their bigs did an excellent job hedging recovering and exing out on the backside Its a really wellconnected defense Pippen with the finishing touches and thatll DO IT CAL RALLIES FROM AN early 16point deficit and they pull away late to beat Stanford 7866 Their first wet at Maple
