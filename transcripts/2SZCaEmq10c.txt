Indiana did it over the weekend so thats why even though Duke is on the road theyre wearing white it all feels a little bit strange but ready to go here at the watsco center between Duke and Miami as Jay said Duke is trending upwards having W 15 out of 17 Joe Lenards got him as a four seed right now but says they could keep moving on up well see how it plays here Applause tonight with the ball number 10 Paul jobay making his first start the Freshman from Leo France he is starting to get a bigger r j because of the Miami injuries well benley Joseph with the ball right now hes going to have to have a good game as is tan George theyre going to have to be more active than they have been in past games because of absences Joe Bay gets the shot off cant finish it and Kyle filipowski down with the first rebound of the night so Caleb Foster getting the start again for Duke with Tyrese Proctor expected to come off the bench tonight D getting into a little horn set two up top two in the corners leads to a little low cross screen and then screen for the screener McCain into the paint surrounded the kick to Jeremy roach with the shot clock running down now the senior hoists a three and it wont go Mitchell with the rebound and draws the foul boy really good defense it just wasnt finished off with a defensive rebound and Mark Mitchell had a slow start to the season but one of the best offensive rebounders in the conference grabbing over two offensive rebounds per game but youll remember Dan he started off the season teams werent even playing him and forcing him to take threes in ACC play hes six of 14 from three and I think one of the really impressive things about him that was a mental hurdle he had to get over and he got over it and hes had a really good year he has either led the Blue Devils in scoring or tied for the lead in SC scoring in three of their last four games and you look around you see McCain you see roach you see Philip howski uh but Mitchell has been a big contributor in conference play look at poppler whos been dealing with a sprained ankle suffered that back in late December severely sprained ankle the numbers havent been quite the same since he came back but he is explosive when hes on and how about North Shadow oir everything but the Finish Duke is is switching just about everything thing and Jared McCain wound up on omir and he got him to the rim just didnt finish it thats unusual for omir McCain steps into it and buries his first three of the night is anybody in this conference playing with a better Rhythm right now than Jared McCain hes making a great claim for ACC rookie of the year he has been spectacular Miami four losses in a row coming into this one to Virginia North Carolina Clemson and BC everything but the Carolina game was is on the road and theyve been dealing with injuries all season along it seems like one or two guys are either out or playing through something wga Poler can play through things about as well as anybody as he gets the canes on the board well nadir rolled down Caleb Foster in the low post and they doubled him in the post it was with two guards he threw out of it and popper was able to get a drive on the weak side Foster to the Elbow now the kick to McCain popper closes on him in a hurry that was a really good close out cuz McCain is going to shot fake and a lot of people bite on that fake Foster from the corner short on the three Joseph the rebound benley Joseph one of the best defenders in the country and hes going to have to be offensive minded in this Applause game which he is capable of doing thought about the jumper instead the kick Kean George a little strong on the three The Freshman from Switzerland has really opened up eyes in recent weeks for Miami really talented a lot of spinning and right into traffic goes filipowski and eventually a foul Duke was fortunate to get that ball after it was knocked free and now theyre going to get to the free throw line too a foul on Jo B at Jim Lara asking the officials for a travel on that play and he is upset John shy 36 years of age his second season as the head coach of the Blue Devils you talk about a contrast year between a guy whos just in his second year and a guy in Jim Lena hes on the naysmith Hall of Fame ballot in his 39th season overall when Jim Lena got his first division one head coaching job John Shire wasnt born yet thats how long and how well Jim Lona has been doing it what are you saying Im saying hes mature careful wise right with were right with him you and are getting older but our maturity is not is not improving at all its not caught up no especially mine Miami is a challenge because they play basically five out youll see omir roll down into the low post and here comes the double its a small one and working hard inside is omir just having a sensational season averaging almost 18 points and 10 rebounds per game looking like a first team all ACC performer and when that double comes over that Doubles been small so far its been two guards coming over because of the way the Miami offense is spaced out and he can see over that double that was just a really good cut by Jo Bay getting to the rim roach cant get by George George six7 shot fake McCain put it up knew he missed it badly chased after it but its Miami B and there was that shot fake that wga popper bit on to allow that shot but still the shot was incredibly difficult Applause Music omir steps out he can shoot the three out there his threepoint shooting has come along way this year George with a crossover free himself but couldnt Bank it home Miamis getting some good opportunities just having a knock them Music down so far Miamis defense theyre staying in front not allowing driving Lanes to the basket Good Help by George great shot fake by roach great extra pass Mitchell to Finish Well when you leave the floor on these shot fakes you are really taking yourself out of the play really well done on those fakes against helping recover defense omir second year with the canes after a couple of years at Arkansas state where the sun Bel Player of the Year hler trains the three to bring the canes back within one you dont have a hand up on wga popper thats his 56 threepoint make of the year and hes had so many injuries hed have more than that if he werent out for a period of time filipowski unguarded for a moment down low omir recovers out and Mitchells got two more Miami scrambling right now defensively and Duke doing a good job of finding the open man trying to take away filipowski that Mitchell finds himself wide open what a start for Mitchell s to the 10 Duke points George the drive and kick Joe Bay misses the three and the weak side rebound to McCain now Joe B can make that shot but Im not sure off one pass thats what Jim Lena wants filipowski swings it to Roach in and out and Miami looking to push off and miss when they can George fouled by Foster to take us to the first mediate timeout of the night and Mark Mitchell you talked about him right off the top Jay and he is having himself a good start over his last 11 games Mitchell is averaging 15 points close to eight rebounds per game he has been a factor one a leave works all day so I can keep working my magic just want a leave 12 hours of uninterrupted pain relief a leave who do you take it for and for

do the fishing while yall en your SE food that youll love get them before theyre Music gone this is an action Dukes going to have to deal with all game North Shadow Mir comes and sets a ball screen and then after he sets a screen Duke is switching and hes going to roll his switch down into the low post but when he gets the ball hes going to get doubled now this double is two guards he can see over now opposite you see wga popper open he gets it over there mark Mitchell doesnt make a great close out and its an easy drive for a layup Miamis getting good shots thus far theyve made some of them they havent made their open ones if they can knock down some of these shots they can have success against Duke switching I got to tell you thats some alevel telestration early in the night you have set the bar pretty high for yourself I had to refill my finger with yellow P Duke up by three early in this one we mentioned the Blue Devils have won 15 out of 17 here are the two losses at home to pit but wait no Jeremy roach no Mark Mitchell down two starters in that game the other loss at North Carolina this is undeniably a team playing better than it did in November December Joseph penetration and kick and the three is way short for AJ Casey who just checked in shot clock didnt reset do they know it do they know it they dont know it and wga Poppers looking to the bench as if to say I didnt know somebodys got a yell they were on the far end of the Court away from their bench and just nobody realized one of the ways you can realize that as the ball never hit the r yeah I was going to say yeah Ill back you up I I second that one yeah Proctor is into the game for the first time now for Duke and Mark Mitchell is going to the free throw line again and thats just too easy allowing that middle penetration you know the first thing you want to do is keep the ball out of the middle because once youre into the middle you have to bring help and if you help up thats an easy drop off for a basket or a foul or both more basketball coming your way tonight after this one we will send you to Baton Rouge Kentucky is in town to take on LSU tonight at 9 Eastern on ESPN and the app how good was Kentucky at Auburn on Saturday their defense has been criticized and in some circles rightfully so but they they put out on tape that they can be a good defensive team when they want to be and I think John caliper now can hold them to that standard that was really impressive at Neville Arena on Saturday John Stewart into the game for the first time for Duke so remember Miami is thin due to injuries and illness we dont know yet if Matthew Cleveland is going to play he did warm up but he hasnt entered the game yet but theyre without Nigel pack and a foul going against the Blue Devils going filipowski Miami ran a little they call it false motion just to get the option that they wanted get the matchup you want and then take on that matchup if Dukes going to switch everything take advantage of the switching you saw Cleveland sitting on the bench apparently has been under under the weather for a couple of days and uh did some things that shoot around today but wont know if hes going to play until we see him check in Casey almost had it knocked Away by Proctor good pressure by Duke defensively omir over filipowski wont go and Stewart the rebound Stewart is such a great athlete his ability to run the floor rebound block shots boy McCain a little bit too easy getting in there but he missed it and back on the k this is where Miami can be dangerous in transition George lost it got it back but missed the shot and its out of bounds to Applause Music Miami both Christian Watson and AJ Casey and Watson just subbing into the game they have not shown themselves to be consistent or reliable but theyre going to have to play good minutes in this game thats why a guy like Paul Jo Bay is getting more time and with all the injuries Jim Lena is trying to patch it together game by game as Kyle filipowski who came into the game having hit just five of his last 27 threes still 35 of the Season knocks one down well not many big guys are going to run in transition straight to the threepoint line and hit a shot off the catch like this Miami scrambling back and youre thinking you got to get back to protect the lane with filipowski but he runs right to that right wing and knocks down the open three his scoring is up from last year his threepoint percentage is up and hes already got more blocks and assists than he had all of last season Kean George with the steel and the Finish he is one talented freshman when I first saw him earlier this year he reminded me a little bit of Anthony black that played for Arkansas last year as a freshman went into the NBA draft and was taken number five filipowski beautiful reverse Jam when he comes into a game with the mindset to be dominant he can be dominant hes had some games of late where hes had eight points hes been three of eight or something like that but he can put 30 on the board in any given game and he looks like he has that look and that mindset to start this game do we have well were going to break so Im not going to ask you that question right now ask you when I come back but itll be about Kyle filipowski take us to break thats called a tease in this business man and so well done look at that

Cavaliers in the hunt for a conference Championship experience number 10 North Carolina Virginia Saturday at 4 and ESPN on your left Kyle filipowski on your right Nord Chad omir when the ACC announces its first team all ACC at the end of the regular season both of these guys going to be on there to this point in the season yes theres still theres still some games to go but I would say that RJ Davis of North Carolina would be up with those two on first team and PJ Hall of Clemson I would put there now what you do with the fifth spot uh for First Team all ACC uh wouldnt you say like Hunter Salis of Wake Forest would be in that conversation Blake Henson of Pittsburgh uh I would have Armando Bott of North Carolina in there and I would also have Jeremy roach of Duke in that conversation there may be others but Jeremy roach has had a spectacular season yeah we talked to John sh like how can you be a senior guard at Duke having a good year as a team Very Good Year as a team and you look at his numbers and just about all of them are the best of his career as Bensley Joseph knocks down a three yet somehow Jeremy Ro nobody ever talks about Jeremy roach and this year hes averaging 14 of games shooting 45 from three by far the best turnover ratio hes ever had and he is having a terrific year yeah year last couple years people would say well you know he turns the ball over a little bit hes got almost a 3 to1 assist turnover ratio and his shooting numbers are ridiculous hes close to a 50 40 90 guy its absurd filipowski with the left hand and its down to Watson and Miami and Miami has numbers omir the catch and the finish and its a twopoint game anytime an offensive player goes to the ground and on that play Kyle filipowski went to the ground that means youre playing Five on four and Miamis too good not to score in a situation where they have that kind of Advantage even without Nigel pack and even without Matthew Cleveland at least to this point of the game there are a lot of good offensive players on this Hurricanes roster and theres a pretty good one right there how happy are Duke fans to see tyres Proctor back from concussion protocol and knocking down to three they missed the Florida State game but Proctor gives them another dimension because outside of Jared McCain I think Jared McCains the best shooter on this du team but Proctor may be second he can really shoot it and he can really push it as well he finds roach in transition and roach is going to the line for three Kean George just wanted to do a fly by but couldnt help it with that left hand just got a piece of it looked like the hands of Jeremy roach as he was letting that go just got his hand as he let it Fly this is too hard to keep your hand out of the cookie jar there you just want to fly by and make the shot a little bit more difficult make him see you and thats a big one for Miami because that is the second on Kean George and as thin as they are to lose him for what looks like an extended period of time Jeremy roach shoots 86 from the foul line thats fifth in the conference Applause Music kind of weird to see Duke wearing white on the road it is yeah because of these new Adidas fear of God uniforms Miami has George now after the second free throw making his way to the bench jakai Robinson will make his debut not a guy who gets a a ton of minutes although a little bit more recently but so George who knows how long Jim Lena is going to sit him if he keeps him out the rest of the half but that is a major loss for Miami I dont think you can afford to keep them out the rest of the half I kind of like the Miami uniforms theyre interesting although Jim Lena is given off kind of a bill bich Vibe with with his gar there Jim Lena can make anything work he is one of the best storytellers he really is Ive ever met we asking him today what was it like playing for Dave gavit when he played at Providence and uh we should have had him miked up it was just a great story impeccable memory for things as well Joseph with the ankle breaker but cant hit the three and Ryan young who is checked in for filipowski down with a rebound the fifth year senior former Northwestern player Mii trying to Blitz the ball screen out front and recovered Caleb Foster couldnt get to the rim McCain deep one I mean theyve got a big logo but he was on it he was on it that was 30 ft you got to figure Miami needs a big night out of wga poppler if theyre going to win this one Joseph kicks it to Watson now popler step back wont go really good recovery to popper by Mark Mitchell but so far the Miami ball movement has been really good you know Jim LGA has been talking to his team about when they catch and shoot they are really efficient when they shoot off the dribble far less so ball saved in the corner by Foster still 10 on the shot clock proor calling for the ball screen Young on the roll and the kick McCain young the offensive Rebound with a great kick Foster buries the wide open free Ryan young is kind of a glue guy when he gets out there he just makes these hustle plays I mean that was a great offensive rebound he couldnt get the stick back but at the presence of mind to look to the threepoint line for a step in three that was a big time play by Ryan young and Duke will take an 80 run into this timeout the Jim Lena just called the lead for the Blue Devils is up to 10 Music hey you singing this wait wheres the dish there aint one youre telling me you can get Direct TV the good stuff and you dont need a satellite dish oh I used to love doing my business on those

Joe Gerard off the threepoint line so what does he do shows the ball one dribble pull up bam eightpoint lead for the Tigers D and J Kevin Seth thank you very much the Tigers seven and seven in the league but had a very good nonconference Joe lardys got him pretty safely in right now as a six seed theyre 28 in the net you got Carolina and Duke up top looks like they might settle a conference champion ship on the last Saturday of the regular season Virginia which had been doing really well theyve now lost two out of three and they got blown out by Virginia Tech on Monday lost by 34 points and wake beat pit last night 91 to 56 Joe lardi still got wake as one of the first four out wake plays Duke on the weekend by the way wake feels like a very dangerous team but it may for this league it may come down to wake pit Virginia how many of those can get in unless somebody makes an incredible run in the conference Championship yeah wake needs some more quad one wins theyve got a great opportunity on Saturday but Miami just got another really good shot by wga popper on a little fade screen on the left side Miamis got to start knocking some of these down they cant rely on their defense to get stop after stop they got to start scoring and theyre asking guys to play more minutes and in bigger roles than they normally do because of the injury to pack the illness of Cleveland and now the foul trouble of George good cut but good defense by Mitchell got a hand on it Joseph with a tough turnaround rebound Applause young well you keep missing some of these shots and that was that was not an easy one but you keep missing some of these shots it puts even more pressure on your defense to get stops Foster got it and Duke is shooting it well they are five for 10 from Beyond The Arc Caleb Foster was two of his last 10 from three over his last five games coming into this one but he is better from three than he is from two so you have to run him off that line omir around and off the rim and he is kind of mumbling to himself getting back on defense M just beats him down the floor and stuffs it he is a star Jared McCain has a Winners Gene that just not every player has and he is starting to un unleash that on everyone what a play by Jared Music McCain only Daisy do satisfying and Fresh So creamy and Daisy is creamy pure cottage cheese only Daisy cottage cheese will Music do its a 130 run for Duke and the loudest two points of the Run coming right here thanks to Jared McCain little crossover in transition outside the charge Circle he took off and he is in attack mode and seeing a big basket at too his last two games 26 points per game 11 of 18 from three coming into this one you know you talk about how things can change from November to February and then into March and there are certainly a couple of examples of that on this Duke roster Jared McCain is one of them I mean look at his production his improvement over the last 3 four months and you talked about Mark Mitchell hes a hes a better player now than he was at the beginning of the Season omir working hard as he always does and another shot clock violation or did it hit the rim the officials are going to discuss did the initial attempt by omir hit the rim and theyre going to have a look at it the dreaded circle of the finger which means were going to to replay it did look like it hit the bottom of the rim yep that is the rim yes so thats a 20 second reset even though it hit the rim those are shots that usually Nord Chad oir finishes I mean hes shooting over 60 from the field thats second in the conference but weve seen him miss a couple of bunnies he does have some traffic around him but usually thats the bottom of the net when he gets that close to the basket you know Jim Lena has dealt with just about everything a coach can deal with how do you you know put aside who you dont have and just focus on who who you do have as you try to win a game I mean the easy thing to say is next man up but players will say they want an opportunity now theyve got it but theres nothing you can do about injuries you just have to deal with it but it means that guys like benley Joseph like keesan George are going to have to play more minutes and take on bigger roles and you take a look at Nigel pack right there whos one of the best Shooters in the country he was all Big 12 when he was at Kansas State hes an all ACC player and hes leading this team in assists averaging about 14 a game and hes made close to 53s on the season you take that out of the lineup you take a versatile uh player that can play the four really tough matchup and Matthew Cleveland out of the lineup thats a lot to make up for you it goes to show you how different every year can be in this or any other sport this is a Miami program as people well know that went to the final four last year and theyve got a number of guys back from that team well they were top 10 early in the season before they went to to Kentucky and rup and got beat there but if they had their full compliment of players all season I think it would be a top 20 Team all year long boy and just nothing going down until then on the third try omir gets it to go and thatll snap the 130 route how do you how do you move him away from the basket you asked nicely yeah when he gets position hes immovable how many guys in the country are as strong as him Hes listed at 67 probably more like 66 but good luck trying to displace him numbers again Blakes is down so its five on four do they realize it they dont take advantage of it though pretty good stand made by the four Duke players getting back in transition so Blakes could get back Bo and I dont know if I mean omir can do some stuff out there but Blakes pounding him as he kept dribbling beyond the yard what a rebound Michael noo off to jakai Robinson whos got a chance for three that was a fantastic rebound by Michael nooka whos got terrific size and hes really talented tough shot by Joseph but nobody really got a body on noo and he just flew in and really good cut by jakai Robinson noo is the guy that Jim Lena says he has spent about as much time with him as he has any player he has ever coached and if you want to boil the message down as Robinson goes to the line if you want to boil the message down on aoko its do the things you do well keep it simple you know the stats are when you do this it works this percentage of the time but when you do that not so much and when he keeps it simple he can be a very effective player and noo came in from prolific prep where he played with Aiden Holloway The Freshman from Auburn Eve Mei as well Corner three Jeremy roach thats a terrific pass by Tyrese CER he drew a double team and was able to see over it to get it to the opposite corner thats a Next Level pass hes doing a pretty good job of being there on the catch theyre not in passing Lanes but that was really good defense by Tyrese CER he was in the gap on that righthanded drive by Bley Joseph that makes it a oneway recovery if Joseph passes out of it but that was great position defense by Tyrese brocker and on the possession arrow its going to go over to Duke Philip housy to inbound 412 to go in the first half and Duke leading by 14 in Miami shooting just 31 2 for 11 from three duke 48 6 for 12 from three roach will try another one and hit another one when Sean Stewart set that screen and rolled to the basket Jeremy roach just lifted up so all the actions going to the basket he went against the grain and he wasnt wide open but he was ready to shoot when the ball arrived hes having a great year just so mature in his approach and his play poppler now Joseph poppler from about 4 feet behind the ark will miss it in the foul on the floor to take us to immediate timeout Jeremy roach shooting 44 from three on the season and Jays got a couple already tonight just that great pass to the corner wide open for the shot and off the Roll by Stewart he just lifts up to the threepoint line drills two in a row how many felt let me count for you 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 89 10 Music how many times have I felt this good its your anniversary today you

back at it tonight coach a lot to like about Duke so far Dukes backr is absolutely terrific you see these guys grow develop mature the one thing if Kyle Philip pasy continues to be aggressive and play with Force Duke will be a team to reckon with in the NCAA tournament key filipowski establishing himself in the low block Dan and Jay we will see you at the half we will see you at the half fellas thank you very much welcome back to Miami and you are looking there on the left of your screen my wife Lauren on the right of your screen Jays wife Wendy we asked them to come with us all the time but when we said Miami all of a sudden boom theyre they show up well actually on the right thats my college girlfriend dont tell me right other than their choice and life Partners theyve never made a poor decision in their life here comes the double when NORAD omir catches it he gets Applause Double Dukes defensive game plan not only has been good it has worked really well great pass yeah how about the ball Movement by the Blue Devils tonight nine assists on 11 made field goals holy cow that almost went that almost was a basket for Shawn Stewart but now he commits a foul Music and Mark Mitchell coming back in as a somewhat dejected sea Stewart is heading out Stewarts given some good minutes especially over the last several games you can come in with that athleticism play hard and adds a different dimension you talked about Duke switching everything and Mark Mitchell can switch on to anybody and guard them well truly a one through five kind of guy now oms got McCain on him filipowski over to hel and got a piece of it he drives right into filipowski so youre driving right into 611 or 7 ft transition three for Jeremy roach is third three of the game and Duke is up 20 right now so difficult to get back in transition after a turnover and not only stop the ball but get out to the threepoint line Dukes got so many many different Shooters and this would have been a tough task for Miami at full strength and they are anything but without Nigel pack and to this point and probably means for the duration of the night without Matthew Cleveland he hasnt played either tonight as poppler drives and draws the foul and NORAD omir when he set that ball screen he just rolled Jared McCain down in the post and when he tried to take McCain he just drives right in to Kyle filipowski and that led to an advantage situation you take the ball into the lane benley Joseph has to stop the ball but he cant stop the ball and guard Jeremy roach out on the perimeter its just too difficult thats too long of a schle to get from the middle of the lane out to the threepoint line I see what you did there at the line popper who came into the season as one of the trendiest you know hes going to re hes going to be a breakthrough guy reach a new level and hes had a very good season before the ankle strain at the end of DEC December you know he might have been a first team all ACC conversation kind of guy but uh severely sprained ankle hes come back but still does not appear to quite be 100 but even 80 of him is pretty good well hes not hes not the wga popper that we saw to start the year I me early in the season he was shooting well over 50 from three for a period of what 10 games but that injury has really set him back and you give him a lot of credit hes battled through it and continued to play hes missed a couple games but hes really fought through it but hes not nowhere near 100 Proctor the Stop and Go finds Mitchell in the corner but he was standing out of bounds when he caught the pass he just caught that pass and just leans back with that left Music foot Joe Bay off to popper Joseph on the drive got it on the rim omir had it knocked away and its Duke ball Miamis getting more close in Opportunities theyve just been unable to knock some of these shots down and sooner or later missing those kind of shots Tak some of the steam out of your defensive effort Music Applause Rockler calling out of play as he moves it into the front Court heres going for Applause across and again everybody gets a touch proor the miss omir the rebound really good ball movement go side to side they were well spaced out and that spaces out the defense and stretches well thats a tough shot but popper is going to bang it home a threepointer and its 3823 as John shy calls a Music Applause timeout all kinds of great games coming your way on Saturday 4 o Eastern Time number 10 North Carolina they are in Charlottesville to take on the whoos Jay and I and the rest of our crew will be in Lawrence as Texas comes to town to take on The Jayhawks and then Texas AM and Tennessee at 8 Eastern all that coming your way Saturday right here on ESPN have to go to Allen Fieldhouse and eat some of that popcorn theres excellent popcorn and didnt really know that at this until we came to Miami for this trip but Miami has some of the best milkshakes that Ive ever had at the baseball stadium its ridiculous I think there s an excellent chance we might have some video from our milkshake Odyssey from earlier today in the second half or we might just go back and get another one Duke called that timeout to get organized for this last minute of the half to finish it strong what Duke wants to do is get two really good offensive possessions to get a stop to try to stretch this lead Foster gets a good look and filipowski comes down with it Proctors going to back it outn Shire yelling out of play Proctor hears it and now they try to Applause execute Foster the floater tips it out Dukes got it again filipowski no Mitchell yes right over the top of a Miami Applause Music rebounder Joseph misses the three Mitchell down with it and the first half that John Shys got to be awfully awfully happy with comes to a close again Miami behind Kansas but this team is maturing and starting to hit it stride at just the right time toward the end of the season as were headed toward postseason play Jim Lenas made one change in the five who were starting the second half Michael noo is starting the second half Paul joob started the game for Miami the same five out there for John Shire n woko was active got on the glass and and just kind of scrapped and clawed and fought and got got some extra possessions for Miami they just couldnt take advantage of hes a true post presence but the the real benefit I think is having keesan George back on the floor picked up those two fouls set the rest of the first half missed the last 945 I believe it was of the first half he misses the three from the wing Dukes Gap coverage has been really good you know theyre getting into the right help position so they dont have to help and recover theyre already in position for help and then theyre making a oneway recovery out to their man L has it knocked away gets it back three threes in the first half for roach Foster on the drive filipowski wide open and the rebound down to Foster long shots lead to Long rebounds the guards can get those and the second time itll go Philip psky with a three the ninth of the game for Duke its just amazing Dan after an offensive rebound that is the best time to shoot a three and Kyle filipowski you dont expect your big guys to get out there good defense by Jared McCain to keep the ball away from wga popper just blew up that handoff opportunity Mitchell doing a really nice job staying in front of keesan George and now roach called for the block Miami starting to mix in some shot fakes when the ball moves from side to side and when youre shot fake against a recovering Defender theyre more likely to bite on that fake that was really good by kesan George if you ever want to see some NBA Scouts uh kesan George usually draws a crowd there are a number of NBA Scouts here today here tonight looking at him among others obviously interest in filipowski and Proctor and popper and other players as well MC yeah Jared McCain yeah with the way that hes playing in recent weeks Joseph the Lefty Scoops it up and in with the right Bley Joseph is a good player he puts great pressure on the ball hes always been you talk about a glue guy hes always been that three and D type but in this game he hes really got to look to score in this second half and be more of a threat when everybodys healthy for Miami he comes off the bench and he comes in and mixes it up up defensively and create some chaos but they have needed him as a starter a lot because of all the injuries theyve dealt with this year popper pretty impressive stuff and hes rewarded with a trip to the line so Shifty with the ball able to get by Mark Mitchell whos an excellent Defender with great length and athleticism but popper we saw him last week at Clemson and at practice he was limping just walking around you couldnt tell as much when he was running but he was comp red uh but Jim Lena said he had his best practice yesterday since hes been hurt and he looks a lot better today than he looked a week ago and even with the ankle spraying at the end of December and how that slowed him down a little bit you can still see the huge strides he has made from last year to this year remember they had Isaiah Wong Jordan Miller final four team hes in a bigger role this year and has stepped up into it very nicely old school development of a player he might have been the what the fourth option last year in the offense now hes option number one give a name nyine everybody knows him as Wugga the best Wugga youve ever seen in college basketball uh what about wowski from Something About Mary Music fair you you have to every time I hear wga I think of domanowski roach his fourth three of the game and from our vantage point where we are calling this game came from roach was right in front of us and you could see Jay it was right online as he knocks down another one his form is terrific hes having a career year in all of his percentages a career year in assist turnover and a career low in turnovers period CU hes had hes had the kind of year you dream of for a senior its been fantastic popper almost slit and then threw it away and Jim Lena is yelling at him shoot the ball he didnt like like the kick out to the wing he said he got into the paint shoot the ball and he might be feeling that ankle a little bit looks like hes trying to kind of jog it off as he makes his way back down on Music defense omir gambles Philip hsky has it pass just a little bit off otherwise roaches would have had a three instead hes got a trip to the free throw line Jeremy roach was good against North Carolina he had 20 points in that game but his last game against Florida State a road win for the blue delves he had 17 points four assists just sort of another mature game like that thats the the word that keeps popping into my head is his approach has been so mature his play has been so mature remember when Tim Duncan went from a junior to a senior his numbers didnt shoot up or anything but the maturity of his game was just so impressive and Im not comparing him to Tim Duncan and his his impact but Im saying thats the kind of maturity youre seeing in in Jeremy roachs game this year and in ACC play Jeremy roaches 44 for 49 including those two makes 44 for 49 from the free throw line in conference Music games go guarding with their heels on the threepoint line but boy their help defense Miami seeing only bodies theyre not seeing angles or paths to the basket the help defense has been in really good position for the most part this entire game talk about their defense in general weve talked a lot about their offense tonight Dukes a very good offensive team and you talked about the upward trajectory that they are on how good are they defensively in your mind theyre a different defensive team than people may think of Duke from years or maybe maybe decades past that are out in passing Lanes forcing a lot of turnovers choking off your offense but 22 of the 25 opponents that Duke has played to this point coming into this game Dukes held their opponent under their their scoring average on the season so theyre only giving up about 66 67 points a game and their defense has been I would call it Bend dont break you know theyre not a high turnover forcing team but pretty solid rebounding team so they dont give you a lot of second shots a really good defensive team I tell you its going to be fun Saturday 2 Eastern right here on ESPN Duke is at wake wake is a gifted offensive team at times they just scored 91 against pit I think thats going to be a lot of fun at Wake Forest on Saturday afternoon Wake Forest can really shoot it they shoot it from multiple spots and they can stretch it Duke in Music control Music when

ticket free I wonder what my 11th will Applause be hey youre trash living rentree in a hockey players head or maybe just make some Applause noise whats your 11th welcome back lets take a look at Dukes Jeremy roach a former McDonalds AllAmerican having himself a very fine night so far Jeremy roach is just having a spectacular year weve chronicled the fact that his numbers are up in just about every category but his leadership has been a huge factor in the development of this Duke team hes just a steadying influence on the floor never changed his expression yeah he went through a little injury thing himself and fought through it think we could have picked a bunch of McDonalds allamericans off this Duke roster and then Tyrese Proctor was a Maas all Australia the austral equal thats what they call McDonald I I learned that from Johnny Fury nice and and remember kind of Midway through last year where there was a bit of a role change right do getting on the ball more roach playing off the ball more and it really seemed to have benefit of the team last year uh and again this year the Duke has multiple point guards yeah like you count Jeremy roach as a point guard that can play off the ball Proctor can play off the ball Caleb Foster comes in he can handle Applause it Mitchell knocks down the three but thats seven of 15 now in ACC play for Mark Mitchell when he started the season he might have been what two of 17 to start the year and teams werent even guarding him like Arizona didnt guard him Arkansas didnt guard him and he fought through it J theyve got 11 threes already tonight that matches their high in any ACC game and theres over 15 minutes to go their high in any game was 13 back in the nonconference against Bucknell Mitchell with a nice look to Foster and it is one of those nights where they just cant miss 12 to 21 theyre all catch and shoot you know theyre drawing the defense they get it inside and Mitchel drew two Defenders everybody was sucked in well inside the threepoint line for Miami and just a really good kick out to Caleb Foster stepping in Joseph no long rebound to Roach and here they come in transition hes going to pull up and it is out of bounds back to the hurricanes that is its been like Pleasantville for Duke yeah you ever see that movie where they never missed y an outstanding display of passing and shooting and those two things often to go hand inand was it Jay Wright who said if you want to see a great shooting team Ill show you one its a great passing team CU you get the good looks Jim Lara took kesan George out of the game a couple of minutes into the second half very early on for one of their best players hes brought him back back in George missing a lot of time with foul trouble tonight and boed if theyre going to have a spark hes a pretty good guy to give it to him theres a switch and filipowski on George he can drive him popler with a three the assist to George and thats why Jim Lena wants Miami to take more catch and shoot shots rather than shooting off the dribble their efficiency goes way up its like 116 points per possession on catch and shoot good play by to keep it in bounds no look feed ahead to omir and they got filipowski on a on a hold omir is frustrated he just doesnt miss shots like this and hes missed several that were near Point Blank he is three for 10 tonight and he is a 60 field goal percentage guy on the season tough stretch right now for the Hurricanes again mostly injuries illness now for Matthew Cleveland as well and you can see uh the face of Jim Lena how hes feeling on the bench right now with his team down to by 20 Cleveland hasnt played under the weather the last few days he warmed up but has not appeared in the game and at this point obviously it seems highly unlikely that he will and the hurricane is looking at the very real possibility of their fifth consecutive loss midrange jumper for Christian Watson its so tough to go into a game like this and be shorthanded like Miami is I me you take two starters out that are averaging both Matthew Cleveland and Nigel pack both averaging over 14 a game and both capable of getting you 20 or more in any given game and realistically the way things are going for Miami 1511 6 and9 in the league for them to make the NC tournament at this point realistically theyve got to win the ACC tournament if they could pull off a miracle and come back and win this game thats a big time quad one win and all that but it looks like the hurricanes are going to have to do a lot of damage in DC if they are to have any kind of a chance yeah it is starting to look that way and one of the questions you have is how many high value targets do they have left in the regular season right and because of the way the rating systems work you know the ACC is a really good League especially at the top but some of the the teams near the bottom of the league if youre playing them theyre theyre still capable theyre just not consistent and their numbers arent good so when you beat him it doesnt give you as much of a bump as you would expect in a regular ACC year mcain nice little bounce pass to filipowski and again outstanding ball Movement by the Blue Devils Corner three wont go for McCain George the rebound that ball movement accompanied by penetration and then a kick is really difficult for Miami to defend and George cant get around people whether its Mitchell or whether its Stewart or whoevers in front of him and George is a hes a really talented player but he has not been able to get around Duke Defenders and really create tonight well Duke switching has affected Miami and theyre switching one through five because Kyle Philipi you can switch with him and he still stay in front of you another wow close in Miss with the left hand and give him credit for continuing to work he got hit on top of the head hes frustrated you can understand going to the free throw line but it has been a tough rough night for n Chad oir nor Chad omir is in the top 10 in the ACC in so many categories among them hes second in the league in rebounding and second in offensive rebounding he is just a a difficult player to keep out of the lane and to keep off the glass you can talk about blocking them out but you need to bring a gang with you to do it because he is as strong as any player in the conference maybe any player in the country and we get some of the stats on his bench press and his Squat and things like that I mean bench pressing 185 lbs 28 times in a row max squat was 450 and then the strength coach at Miami said you know what thats enough yeah thats enough yeah who Among Us hasnt been in that situation same with me when I get out of a chair thats enough I am told that did you bench 400 lbs back at Duke one once yeah its one more than me one more than most Proctor step back and hes going to the line the foul on Applause noo well you start to look at some of the other teams that are at the top of the polls whether its I still think that Yukon has separated a little bit even though they they lost a kraton on the road in Omaha but Duke is is looking like a team that they can challenge anyone you didnt feel that way early in the season or maybe mid Midway through but this team is trending in a really really positive direction yeah Yukon and Purdue with recent loss Arizonas had a couple of surprising losses but its college basketball right it it happens to everybody and Im with you again Duke has won 15 of its last 17 one of the two losses was to pit when they didnt have roach or Mitchell beautiful feed from George to noo who slams at home that middle pick and roll is so difficult to deal with noo Has Talent yeah he looks like hes going to turn into a player hes going to be really Music good Mitchell Baseline and an offensive foul Mitchell doesnt love the call but not much has gone wrong for Duke Kean George Michael noo try to get things going for Miami they still got a long way to go but down 19 no freezers how unusual is this for a rest restant I think that thats unusual because a lot of restaurants have freezers but we dont have freezers we have fresh food every single day how fresh is fresh its real food thats coming to our tables thats what sets us apart wow one a works all day so I can keep working my magic just want a leave 12 hours

Miamis breaking out an Adidas creation and the coaching staff wearing kind of these quarter zip hoodies with sleeves and you think theyre drawing a little Bill bichi inspiration here thats what I thought when I saw Jim come out for the Music game they are down 19 to the blue Devils here just over 8 minutes into the second half Miami shooting 31 Duke 49 and Dukes made 12 threes in this game noo turns and puts it up and the offensive rebound to Jo Bay now George and the shots just will not fall for the Hurricanes one of the most impressive things about Dukes defensive effort in this game has been the positioning of help anytime that Miami is trying to drive theyre seeing a lot of white white shirts you know theyre seeing bodies not Lanes to the basket Duke is switching everything including Ryan young switching out on a pick and roll out top and then recovering and Tyrese Proctor just got a deflection to totally disrupt the Miami offense under 10 to shoot roach driving soft off the glass Mitchell on the glass and draws another foul well Mark Mitchell when roach drives in there there was nobody to block out Mark Mitchell he just got an easy run in a relatively easy from the left side on the Baseline and part of thats due to some of the switches but youre not having blockout responsibilities but you got to lay a body on Applause Music somebody two of the top teams in the Pack 12 highlight our ESPN womens basketball Thursday Prime Time matchup Charisma osor and number 12 UCLA hosting Alisa peely number 18 Utah poly Pavilion coverage begins at 930 Eastern 630 Music Pacific Miami ball as filipowski comes back in replacing Mitchell so ni see filipowski and young in there together in the front court for Duke and well see if Duke continues to switch now theyre just sticking with a double and recovering and Joe Bay throws it out of bounds he and Watson a little miscommunication Miamis had so many different lineups and not all these lineups have been playing together much this year even in practice a low cross screen that was really well read but George couldnt handle it and roach gets it back for Duke no reset of the shot clock roach just set a low cross scen for filipowski and Bley Joseph guarding filipowski now Proctor no long rebound to Roach thats just pressuring me Miami spending so much time on Music defense Proctor loses it and what Hustle by Young on what looked like it should have wound up being an uncontested layup for the Hurricanes impressive Hustle by Ryan young to get back and disrupt that play that should have been an easy basket for Miami I me they have numbers theyve got basically a 4 on0 break but that was a terrific job by Ryan young not to give up on the play and just Sprint down the floor big guys got wheels omir back in for Miami oneonone here with filipowski here comes the help and just too much size too many bodies that needs to be a quicker move and go up because Ryan young was just waiting for Nord shadir to put the ball in the deck so that he could go double now George is steel popler for three and young the rebound popler had had a good game he doesnt miss many of those wide open shots especially in transition so dudes not trying to take the air out of the ball they just want to be a little bit more deliberate they dont want need to be in a rush right now clocks their friend the double on filipowski Qui pass thats got to be a thats got to be a flagrant doesnt and thats what the Blue Devils are Music Applause saying that that didnt look at least to me like a play on the ball so well take a look at it y but he just gets grabbed around the shoulders kind of a horse collar type deal yeah thats got to be an F1 Music y Jim Lara is talking to the officials now saying there was elbow thrown before that and take a look at that too I didnt see that but sure the officials will take a look at all of it and its been upgraded very quickly to a flagrant one tells uh says Brian okell so thatll be two in the ball for the Blue Devils a foul there but then the flagrant on the back end of it so filipowski at the line 65 from the line on the season averaging 17 points per game better than eight rebounds per game in his sophomore Music year filipowski shoots about five free throws per game you know thats the most on this Duke team he gets fouled a fair amount but I think he get fouled even more he plays post end perimeter but if if he were to spend a little bit more time down in the post hes a dominant post present made them both Duke ball and the shot clock is saying 22 but its going back to 20 now it was actually Ryan young who noticed that and alerted one of the officials Im sure they would have found it on their own but Ryan young was helping him out he went to Northwest smart guy smart Music guy lowski and a block is the call on Nord Shad omir he was probably in the uh restricted AR yeah he hes in there so theres no no question right not a help Defender so filipowski right back to the free throw Applause line Welly just a frustrating night for the hurricanes and for their fans this you know whenever Duke and Carolina go anywhere in the ACC obviously its a big deal and this was a big deal here tonight of a Duke kind of catch it to Miami at a time where things arent going very well either on the court theyre battling injuries theyve lost four in a row and crowd was so pumped up for the beginning of this game and it was close for seven or eight minutes with then Duke went on a 130 run and it hasnt been close since in that four game stretch you know Miami was right there in those games you know that game we had them at Clemson last week you know they played 35 minutes right with Clemson it was the last five minutes where it just got away from him but shorthanded is really difficult to play and especially when you shorthanded two starters the quality of Nigel pack and Matthew Cleveland right there against Carolina as well that game was here they lost by three to the Tar Heels as Bensley Joseph knocks down to three one of the things for Miami you want to keep competing but Jim Lara doesnt want anybody else hurt as well so balancing when enamel

witnessing the street for the Applause win I cannot wait were going to Washington DC this year for the ACC tournament uh a look at Joel lardys ones and twos right now sticking with the ACC hes got Carolina as a two at the moment Duke as a four but the highest of the four so 13th overall if you will and obviously a lot can and probably will change in the next few weeks but there will also be some bubble teams trying to play their way into the NCAA tournament in Washington all kinds of stuff to look forward to the one seeds to me seem like theyre just about locked in oh man I mean you feel for him because hes such a good player and hes just just having such a tough night and hes working his tail off he just hasnt finished some things but hes had a spectacular year averaging 18 points a game over 10 rebounds three offensive rebounds hes leading this team in steals he plays a complete game and hed be a great tight end mhm thats the feeling we always have every time we do a m a Miami game is if an NFL team uh after he graduates is going to say we come for a try well an NBA teams going to tell him I think hes play in the NBA he has improved his shooting range hes shooting a very respectable 37 from three taking more making more could be the end of the night for him now with them down 25 and 628 to go when youve had as many injuries as Jim Lenas team has had this year you probably want to play it safe and keep your best guys healthy for the next game theyve got Georgia Tech coming to town Saturday afternoon that game on the ACC Network the Duke switching has really caused Miami some problems they cant get into the lane Music Joseph to the free throw line and knocks down the jumper another guy who only knows how to play one way and thats working his tail off on both ends of the Court defensely Joseph having a double figure game in this one but it just hasnt been enough Bowski calling for it gets it and hits it Miami got switched off so benley Joseph was just trying to front and sit on the legs of filipowski but without any pressure on the ball he can just see over the top and throw over the top Good Help by filipowski right on the elbow same thing with Proctor theres nowhere to go yeah they have tried to get inside often and they havent been successful very often at all so taking a deep one and Joseph hits from about 26 ft away well you give credit to Miami for knocking down that shot but thats really good help defense by Duke their positioning basically has been their help and that way theyre only recovering one way theyre not helping and recovering which is really difficult we mentioned Duke is at wake for should be a great game Saturday afternoon 200 here on ESPN then they go home to play Louisville and Virginia go to NC State and then wrap up the regular season at home against North Carolina on March the 9th and it seems very likely Jay that that game could determine the ACC regular season champion and the one seed in the ACC tournament weve seen that a lot over the years in the ACC where Duke and North Carolina are playing for a championship and just not a very good pass guard to guard Mitchell with two more hes got 15 to go with five rebounds he has had a terrific evening and he really started out strong his energy is really important for this Duke team his defense and then you had that offense in theres some defense right there right on Q hes just in a totally different spot than he was at the beginning of the year its remarkable you give him a lot of credit that was a big mental hurdle to get over early in the season just shooting the Gap need to make a pass fake there and let him fly Applause by so filipowski comes out McCain comes out Mitchell comes out and John shy we get Jaylen Blakes back into the game TJ power has come into the game as well for the first time as we go to the under four timeout here at the watsco center with Duke rolling to a victory ah nuts no no what plans nuts its not a nuts its

storm the court thats big time they should play all their games at the rec center Rob Dillingham in Kentucky youre playing in Baton Rouge next coach Rob Dillingham he is an absolute bucket top prospect in the NBA draft SEC action coming up next Dan Kevin coach thank you very much here in the ACC it has been Duke in command since about 70 minutes into the game Jeremy roach with a big night good Balan scoring for Duke roach with 16 Mitchell and filipowski each with 15 and thats why the starters are sitting and smiling right now for the Blue Devils yeah roach with those 16 points four of

a minute and a half to go an impressive Road Victory is imminent for Brad Brown El team Clemsons been Road Warriors this year they they won a bunch of really good road games including at Alabama Early in the season w at Carolina those are going to travel well in the committee room noo gets it to go and he is giving Jim Lena something to think about obviously theyve got omir in the middle and generally noo backs him up occasionally plays with him but noo make it a bit for more playing time well hes made really good strides in practice according to the Miami staff and I think youve told the story about how much film that Jim Lena has been watching personally with nor shadir but you know the Duke team has been watching a lot of film lately but some of it has been of John Shire yes uh yesterday at practice tyres Pro coming back from concussion protocol so he was kind of in and out as a regular member of practice so at times they only had nine and John Shire laced him up and got back out there to to run up and down the court and a felt it this morning said he was really sore and then the best part as you say is when they broke down the film of Shys defense after the fact and he wasnt doing some of the things he tells them to do which is where the phrase do as I say not as I do comes from I mean whats the confusion about power as sh wanted Jay Lucas to play Jay Lucas is a year younger than sh but uh shy drew the Short Straw on that one well and I gave Jay Lucas a little bit of a hard time thats him sitting to the right of John shy was a great player not only in high school but in college as well played for Rick bars for a while was an assistant at Kentucky to John caliper before coming on John Shire staff I said arent you supposed to be like the Secret Service you know you step into danger for the president well I bumped into him on the street today and he had two coffees in his hand I said whos the other one for and he said coach meeting John shy so that was his his way of trying to get back into the good books with SH for not taking the minutes yesterday Ryan young with a bucket and now uh John Shire is going to empty the bench bringing in Neil begovic and Spencer Hub with a minute 32 to go and boy the seconde coach has to be so so pleased with how his team has played here tonight well this will be fun on the ACC Network at 9 Eastern uh after the Louisville Duke game on Wednesday February the 28th how about an extended sitdown with two legends two Hall of Famers Coach K and Roy Williams two of the greatest to ever do it Roy Williams had a Hall of Fame career at Kansas before coming to Carolina then had a Hall of Fame career Carolina the Duke fans here want Spencer hubard the 58 senior from Los Angeles to put a shot up with to Harvard Westlake and look at that hair man hes bringing it look at that make a shot would have been a bucket for begovic and an assist for hubard Neil begovich is going to the line hes a grad transfer plate at Stanford hes from San Francisco went four years at Stanford under Jared H who played for Roy Williams at Kansas not that not that you and I are not jealous of anyone with hair but Dukes got a lot of good hair going on on this roster y they do you and I could split that and have some left over and still be happy Id be happy with a hand Im just going to grow my eyebrows really long and comb them back was that necessary we are is that necessary yeah thought I was working with real pros here final 30 seconds here in Coral Gables another rebound for Nook boy what an effort he has put forth tonight you know sometimes in a game where things dont go your way players emerge and Michael noo has had some really good moments in this game and something that he can continue to build on shot clock turned off the Duke fans want hubard to put a shot up but he is not going to do that as the final seconds sck away and Duke now with 16 wins in its last 18 games made 13 threes tonight to tie his season high and needless to say
