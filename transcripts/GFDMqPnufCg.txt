cards have lost age straight they havent won since midDecember Somethings Gonna Get yeah both teams uh need a win Boston College booking to take care of home court were going to see one of the top scorers and the ACC on display tonight for Louisville L Ellis and Quentin post has been playing great for Boston College as of late and the tip is controlled by Louisville Ellis has the basketball averaging 178 per game his last five he has been a dynamic presence as the Eagles start out mantoman Louisville offense has been at a premium for them as they drain the shot clock and the shot is off the line and the rebound for a leaf Bay as BC tries to push the temple something you expect to see all night yeah and I think also get Quentin post involved with the offense early uh his last two games uh he has been uh well in double digits right here you can see Boston College trying to get him a touch in the paint Zachary for three for the Eagles and hes had troubleshooting 33 much like the rest of the team theyre only 29 from threepoint land as you look at the starting lineups thats four forwards for Louisville the only technical guard is L Ellis I think the key thing after speaking with head coach Kenny Payne today at shoot around turnovers for Louisville and theyre trying to find that third option to go along uh with Ellis and Mike James a league Bay with a rebound for the Eagles a freshman from Minneapolis heres Jaden Zachary third on BC and scoring as he gets doubled the league Bay hoists the three and the board Tracked Down by Jalen Withers two overzealous with a shot and Eric Grant talked about this said look we must be more patient on offense Ill get a couple of ball swings uh you dont want to Hoist the three early into shot clock and theres another three attempt by Jalen Withers whos been inconsistent for the cards 12 assists and 42 turnovers and theres a turnover for BC by Demar Langford Louisville scouter report they have been snake bitten for that man their first year coach Kenny Payne four one point losses yeah and they I think the thing that hes talked about and you saw today in their shooter round little things uh turnovers uh missed assignments on defense he said were uh certainly looking to correct those things uh but he said the biggest thing for them has been the turnovers you look at their numbers and ACC play a 73 assist and 135 turnovers that number needs to change as the game remains scoreless Earl Grant like the shooting the last nine games seven steals feisty defense 13 Force turnovers similar to the Louisville they can get off kilter on the offensive end too yeah I think threepoint shooting thats been the struggle for Boston College you talked about it but not a great threepoint shooting team they only make four threes uh per game they need to get out in transition uh before this Louisville defense could get set up yeah the Eagles hoping they didnt leave the threepoint shot in South Bend Saturday they hit a season best 11 in 19 attempts this guy had four of them thats not a threepointer but a twopointer for Clinton post and 29 and 14 at Notre Dame a careerhigh 29 Points he has ignited their offense hes coming back from a foot injury and thats why he becomes a matchup problem for opposing teams thats a sevenfooter hell step out and shoot threes he also can go down low end to post it was your first three of the night for Mike James on the wing and hes one of your Spotlight players he had a 248 game earlier and hes averaging 89 points shooting 43 percent in his last five games though he has really been playing well 14 points a game and shooting 46 from the threepoint line thats a breakdown for Boston College they got to do a better job that was a terrific pass by Jaden Zachary for the flush and quit in post Louisvilles concerned about defending the post yeah and thats great pick and roll action that time Zachary a nice read and fifth a dish down low to post Kenny Payne told us earlier that we need to play desperate on defense what does that mean yeah I think that right there your rotations uh it has to be a quicker sense of urgency uh but this guy right here L Ellis he could hit from anywhere one of the BC have to do to neutralize him on defense well I think uh you cannot give him uh open looks I think thats the thing right there hes a guy thats a volume scorer Here Comes James in transition on Zachary with the layin despite the contention by two Defenders thats great body control and yeah he is the guy we talked about his last five games that hes been playing well uh both he and Ellis are great at in transition playing through contact thats a big time finish Pastor Lankford with a three hes a 1 000 Point scorer after reaching that market Notre Dame and he drains another one for BC Master Langford 766 points in his bc career after spending a couple years for Ed Cooley at Providence almost a giveaway by Jalen Withers Zips the pass and theres a three by Mike James he is smooth isnt he and that again thats just a breakdown understanding The Scouting Report uh hes a guy that has been shooting really well 46 from the threepoint line the last five games cannot give him any open looks Mike James continues the ship says eight of the first 11 points for the Cardinals and its been a really uh you look at the ball movements take a look at some previous clips for him uh his jump shot over the last five games we talked about it over 40 percent uh from the threepoint line he does a nice job in transition playing through contact shes a guy that could score on all three levels uh he has been one of the bright spots for this Louisville team and Coach Kenny Payne and we talk a lot about teams rebuilding culture Earl Grant trying to do it in his second year any pain trying to do it in his first year he says its all about playing to a standard at Louisville theyve been there in the past he knows what it takes hes been part of championship teams its a matter of getting guys to buy in and thats what he said look we need to get back to that its already been done the blueprint is there I know what it feels like and looks like and were trying to get back to that it was really good to see him operate rate and shoot around today really the attention to detail hes getting these guys biggest thing sharing the ball like this right here going left to right and then cutting down on the turnovers go to veteran official calls an offensive foul that one is against Curry his first and Currys lost a lot of weight thats been used to his Advantage but too much of TJ bickerstadt yeah that time lower just shoulder right in front of the referee and again I like the idea though that time ball moved left to right they got him isolated down low on the Block and just lowered his shoulder there though theres Devin McLaughlin its a Tamara Lankford and the rebound stared by McLaughlin for a minute but out of bounds but Brockton an industrious rebounder averages more than six per game hes one of the top performers off ACC benches yeah that right there though again the good book off of nice ball movement thats a pretty wide open look from the corner but thats been the Achilles Hill for Boston College with the acceptance of their last game uh theyve really struggled shooting the three ball again only four made threes per game in conference play so the eagles with Ashton Lankford in the backcourt with Jaden Zachary damara Lankford Kevin McLaughlin TJ picker staff theyre five for the moment heres Ellis Applause big three good up fake by Withers had a good look here comes Zachary in transition one on Three the dump off smothered thats really good transition d by Louisville Im breaking up a fast break opportunity for Boston College deep three James Zachary the call continues to invade the BC threepoint game Applause theyre one for six from distance Ellis directing traffic with a screen Withers and out of bounds good decision by Withers to drive that was a nice head fake right here though were going to take a look at good transition d uh this was an emphasis today when we spoke with Coach Kenny Payne he said look we must do a good job keeping Boston College out of transition thats a great job all Five Guys sprinting back and breaking up a fast break opportunity for Boston College Jalen Withers has been a riddle for the Louisville coaching staff they say they need to unlock his consistency yeah they need that third guy again we talked about it LL is one of the top scorers in the ACC Mike James has come on as of late but they need to find that third or fourth guy to be consistent and give them a more consistent offensive threat better hes scoring something that Louisville needs more of theres the drive now great pass in the reverse for the red hot Mike James good job by trainer off their bench to find James and I think its all set up though by their spacing uh the ball is moving left to right they have Boston College spread out and now theyre not settling for jumpers and theyre getting some nice driving Lanes thats something Boston College needs to do on the offensive end dont settle for jumpers try to get the ball into the paint pretty spin move by Ashton Langford heres Mason Madsen gets bumped no foul as he always did the three Matts in the Cincinnati transfer Ellison transitioned and that was easy uncontested layup Pharrell Ellis and the Eagles struggling on both ends of the floor Louisville riding a seven to nothing run theyve also scored six buckets in their last C has to do a better job on the defensive end communicating Malcolm yeah they do right here this is a breakdown uh no help and then thats just too easy uncontested reverse layup I think the biggest issue right now ball screens uh nobody talks uh nobody Hedges on that ball screen right there and thats another easy uncontested uh layup for Ellis you can see the difference right now theyre getting open looks well Louisville its all about James its all about Ellis they have 15 points and those three guys New York Knicks in attendance theyll be playing the Celtics at the Garden tomorrow Randall Barron and quickly on a bad unit watching their former assistant Kenny Payne who was on the New York Knicks sideline for the last two years before coming to Louisville he has been around a guy thats well respected within the coaching ranks and by his players and I like this change up they go to a 131 it looks like Zone and its confused Boston College good adjustment made by Kenny Payne said we have to keep BC out of the post no pun intended Quentin post who has four of the Eagles Seven Points Paul an ACC Applause double headers starting at one Eastern with NC State Wake Forest and Kyle filipowski leads Duke against Georgia Tech followed by Hunter Tyson in number 19 Clemson taking on Florida State Jays capped off by Syracuse and Virginia Tech should be a phenomenal afternoon and evening of Hoops on acc Network and the referees uh stop play we got a veteran crew Ron groover Pat Driscoll Tommy Morrissey groover and Driscoll seven combined final fours I like that they dont qualify they see the game is getting chippy and the post Global whistle until guys knock it off if it continues then we are going to call some fouls an excellent job of officiating trying to clean this game up early Percy Miller with the ball 15 in black for the Cardinals theres a drive and theyll lay in by Jalen Withers whos been aggressive seeking his shot tough degree of difficulty off the charts right there not bad D thats just a great role in a guy playing through contact and right now Louisvilles got it going offensively as you saw at the bottom of your screen a big note largest lead in ACC play 10 points at this juncture for Louisville Music they are on a in conference but a bit deceiving because they have played better lately they have and I think the biggest thing and it was a theme in their shoot around practice but law movement and taking care of the ball and then as you said Kenny Payne told us look we have to play with a sense of desperation and urgency on defense I think the biggest thing for them they have some guys that can score when they dont turn it over early on theyve done a nice job being patient spacing the floor and then theyve been getting some high percentage looks and their offense is ticked up 67 points per game in the last 10 field goal percentage threepoint field goal percentage and points to the page so all around it might not reflect in their record but overall theyre a better offensive team in the last 10 and L Ellis is a huge part of that one of the top scorers uh in the ACC hes a guy that can score on all three levels again just too easy thats just another straight line drive he beats Makai ask on Langford a really good Defender and the help is late for Boston ballots posed for a three way off here comes Ellis you will hold waiting for the rest of the team to catch up Eagles shooting 25 percent like James blocked by Ashton Langford Applause thats the feisty defense youre looking for but Ellis uncontested again yeah this right here again uh the help is late and if youre Boston College in that situation uh you have to come over give up the three but good recovery that time by Makai Aston Langford youre going to need more of that Applause and a steal by Jayden Zachary with numbers to Prince a league Bay and he lays it in Louisville was running a 163 run before that hoop and Kenny Payne not happy right there again thats what hes talked about cannot turn the ball over and give up points off of turnovers Music 16 turnovers per game for the cards trainer a league Bay controls Here Comes Jayden Zachary transfer from Chipola Junior College a hop skip and the jump a Euro Step by the pride of Amsterdam quick post last two games averaging 23 points a game nine rebounds Quentin post the sevenfooter for Boston College and another turnover for the cards post has six and this was unorthodox but effective and this is why again he has become a matchup problem uh thats a seven footer doing a little Euro Step uh he can knock down three so you have to respect his jumper you look at what he did career high versus Notre Dame 29 Points I love the fact hes the alltime leader in threepointers by a sevenfooter in BC history Nate dornacamp record broken by Quinn post 17 threepointers what a luxury though for Earl Grant to utilize the three for Quinn close and a blocking foul on Makai Ashton Langford good call Id like to see it again again we have the luxury of doing this right here uh breaking it down yeah and I think thats a good call he was moving I thought he might have been set but youll see hes coming out and now hes moving back over to his right so again I think thats a good call and the key thing with refs positioning hes in great position uh to see the movement uh prior to the charge what a spin but a block by Ashton Lankford on Ellis and Quentin post is down for a moment see what happened here spin uh they both now again hard to see from that angle if they collided he got poked in the eye and the face and checking to see whether theres some blood but hopefully hes okay but Ellis quit post and I I think its a good call by The Ref again uh youre looking for intent uh hes not swinging his arm uh I think its an inadvertent uh hit to the face and obviously uh certainly thats a tough break though for Boston College having post out of the game as you take a look at what he is uh done over the last two games getting back healthy the seven footer does so much for them obviously offensively but his presence defensively huge for Boston College as well hes calling for the mask its like youre not gonna go there at this point as BC comes up with a basketball so Louisvilles getting sloppy in the last two minutes why is that happen again Kenny Payne did not in its words he did not make excuses for these guys so he said look a lot of these are unforced uh turnovers that one right there again not much pressure thats just careless with the ball and certainly he said thats something that we must clean up otherwise when they dont turn it over theyve had great spacing and then they get some good looks Mr Langford with the foul line jumper Eagles have made three of their last 11 shots as they have stuck back in he is the glue he is the heart of this team Makai Ashton Lankford uh hes the leader and theyre gonna need him what a pass by trainer two Withers a willing participant well right now whats going on defensively Boston College on their screens they have to do a better job communicating and tomorrow Langford left his feet thats an offensive foul on Langford he was out of control and crashed to the floor and a bewildered Earl Grant Earl Grant well this has got to be a jump stop jumper right here again you get by the initial Defender thats great team defense help side hes sitting there waiting and then on the other side Boston guys again that needs to be communication right there theres a screen right there by that time though it looks like Langford just got beat Im not sure he really got screened uh you have to be on the other side there thats just too easy for Louisville getting another uncontested layup Here Comes Mike James having a good night Applause Louisville shooting 53 percent season theyre 40 percent Pat Driscoll calls a foul on Jayden Zachary as quick post theyd go to the mask as he starts to Tinker with it trying to get back in the game you ever play with a mask it would bother me I tried it one time and I pulled it off within the first minute putting it on that just really tough to shoot with I can imagine disruptive although the technology is a little much different back when I played as we take a look at Palace long range Malcolm Huckabee for L Ellis he has 10 points one of two cardinals in double figures James and Ellis combining for 20 of their 24 Withers with the other four princely Bay freshman on the Cornell game in their opener with a tip in in the late stages and a foul on the cards heres our womens college basketball court Drupal header on Sunday Louisville Syracuse at noon Eastern and the 16th ranked Blue Devils take on Florida State fouled by the 15th ranked Tar Heels in Clemson at four and the cap today its number 12 Virginia Tech and Virginia should be another terrific afternoon of Hoops on accn and the ESPN app now you can pull off that mask couldnt you Im trying to figure out uh whats the outfit but as we take a look Jade and Zachary and Earl Grant uh clapping that decision right there foreign for Quentin post back on the bench but this is what Boston College needs more of a stop settling for jumpers right now youre one of eight from the threepoint line theyve settled a foursome jumpers and Earl Grant talked about that dont shoot the first open point you might just cause youre open that doesnt mean you need to let it fly right away or try to continue to make Louisville work on off of Defense swings and then try to get the ball into paint after the foul on Ellas first two freethrow attempts of the game for either Squad Louisvilles largest lead was 12 almost a steal by Ashton Langford and now a giveaway Here Comes Mason Matson who leads PC in threes with 21 a league Bay nice pass McLaughlin and a foul good ball movement thats what Earl Grants looking for all set up by their defense Makai Aston Langford with the steal and the nice interior passing the Freshman to McLaughlin the fouls on Zan Payne whos the son of Louisville coach Kenny Payne paying a transfer from Kentucky has appeared in 13 games you see free throws shooting theyve left points at the line 70 percent as a team McLaughlins been a good addition he has hes given them some nice minutes again Earl Grant was trying to find out his rotation with Clinton post out early in the season and McLaughlin did some really good thing for them another guy that he can put in Ellis to pain trainer Music detention again Ashton Lake for transition lays it in Well Done by BC all triggered by the defense yeah again exactly what Boston College wants to do presser Louisville and then get out and transition thats seven points off seven Louisville turnovers this is the match up right here Makai Aspen Langford versus Ellis wow what a shot my goodness Ellis the reaction says it all he has 13 points he averages 18 I said it at the top one of the top scorers in the ACC thats a big time deep contested three hes a 33 threepoint shooter and out of bounds off of Louisville with 13 to shoot for the Eagles oh this right here is going to be of the formula for Boston College to get back into this game but this guy right here not bad d Thats Just the fourth leading scorer in the ACC making a play but the Eagles counter so theyre swapping baskets as Makai Ashton Lankford has nine points Applause well pick and roll defense is going to be huge right here uh for Ellis The Bigs need to do a good job for Boston College edging on the ball screens and screened by Sydney Curry and a foul on Devin McLaughlin the inbounds pass by BC effective and again not much communication right here nice little inbounds underneath or out of bounds underneath by Boston College problematic though Louisvilles done a nice job offensively uh spacing and then getting some high percentage shots off of excellent ball movement early on in this game Quinton post getting set to check in curry down the lane with a thunder slam that one right there could show up on SportsCenter my goodness he almost ripped the rim off but the bucket swap continues with Makai hash to Langford whos in double figures with 11 Sydney Curry trying to reshape his body grabs the rebound and puts it in with an M1 situation boy if they can get that out of the car he could be that third score theyre looking for but Malcolm Huckabee look at The Rim Rattler for Louisville the screws in this Rim right here Sydney Curry almost ripping the rim off excellent ball fake and then the next time down on the offensive blast grown man move five uh four Boston College players around him showing off the great upper body strength and we spoke with uh coach Kenny Payne he said look were looking to find that third or fourth uh option uh to go along with uh Mike James and L Ellis and right now Cindy Curry doing a nice job giving them some offense that time on the offensive glass and put back as they adjust the mask of Quentin post checks back in a couple minutes ago went down with some issues with the face after getting sprayed by an elbow and he grabs the rebound Curry cant complete the threepoint play Louisville has controlled it from the tip you see disjointed on the defensive end of the floor allowing the cars to shoot 59 percent and five for nine from three TJ Bickerstaff gets doubled for a moment but draws contact foul is on Mike James thats his first well this is better offensively for Boston College the boss one left to right and Earl Grant talked about this we have to control the pace and then be patient on offense if were not able to get out in transition and be opportunistic uh offensively we must have moved the ball it cant stick that was probably one of the better offensive possessions in the first half bicker stops only a 55 free throw shooter theyd like his offense to continue to evolve hes only averaging six points what does he have to do to get better well I think that right there again it needs to be off a ball movement hes one of the better rebounders in the ACC I think it comes down to uh Boston College being patient and then uh the ball not sticking on one side of the floor get him rolling to the basket see if he can get some interior passing like you did on that last play BC hasnt LED since theyre up four to three with 16 and a half minutes to play in the half L Ellis good pass Curry again hes gaining position on the Block and thats great again recognition and entry pass its all set up by the postentry pass and the brush screen again theyre getting uh Curry some nice looks Applause you scored the last six cards points Ashton Langford the fade away from the elbow hes not shot oh theyre trading buckets uh right now offensively theyre getting some good looks defensively though theyre having problems last three possessions its big Curry oh they got to do a better job hitting him outside the paint and keeping him off the offensive glass Batson guarding Mike James but he still takes it and its tapped to Ashton Langford Zachary takes the three and out of bounds off of Quinton post weve seen some amazing fans across the ACC and now he needs your help this winter HTC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective so snap a pic or take a video and tag it with a hashtag all the devotion post it to your social just might see it on accn good crowd of students late night at Connie form created some buzz in the building and right now though Boston College 19 from the threepoint line thats one of the few mistakes Jaden Zach Jade and Zachary that time a little quick to shoot that three and really no need to do that in transition try it again work the ball around get a higher percentage shot and Pat Drisco was all over the hand checked by L Ellis Ellis grabbed the defender that picked up his second foul yeah again uh right in front of the ref thats an easy one for them to make now again you can make the argument call that one but this right here yeah thats a clear hook theyre right in front of the refs thats an easy call for them to make actions and our first half highlights and stats Kenny Payne has to be very pleased with what hes seen yeah again its been a really good ball movement defensively they forced Boston College uh into some contested shots and I like this change up right here out of the timeout Louisville goes to a Zone Boston College has been struggling shooting the ball try to keep them out of the paint and force another contestant three knifing through his Ash to Langford post Corrals the offensive rebound and hell take the three Here Comes Ashton Lankford athleticism at a premium he goes from right to left with 15 points Applause Ellis against Zachary Eagles mantoman is the drive and the true bouts he has not missed throughout the first half LL is six for seven three for three from distance and Jaden Zachary Mackay Aston Langford uh two pretty good Defenders uh El Ellis has just been in the paint uh really in this first half thats just the blowby and then beautiful pullup jumper floater over to seven footer ECC is guard heavy many great guards in the league and LS is certainly one of them and also by bicker staff to find posts for the slam what are you doing on defense in the last 16 seconds well you got to keep this guy with the ball in his hands L Ellis you need to keep him out of the paint here he comes on Zachary to the Baseline and punched Away by Bickerstaff Applause with Quint post PC is a much better offensive team no surprise without him its dicey yeah and I think the other thing too defensively obviously having the sevenfooter to Anchor your defense on the back end and rebounding has been huge for Boston College inbound by Mike James and Prince Alibi the beneficiary coast to coast and he misses the land Prince Alibi a golden chance to cut the deficit to four but at six at halftime yeah thats a missed opportunity to close out the half for after post return yeah but like I asked Lankford though you take a look at his numbers 15 points uh Kenny Payne though right on I think look uh they must take care of the ball Louisville for Boston College dont settle for jumpers to start off the second half try to get the ball into paint get higher percentage shots eagles with their original starting five Astra Langford and Zachary in the back brought to Mark Langford joins them and he takes the three to start off the second half he had a quiet first half well what do we know one of 11 in the first half to start off and knock down a three but youll live with that one though if youre Earl Grant its off a pretty good ball movement and hes wide open in the corner Applause L Ellis for three his second Miss from distance tonight Here Comes Ashton Langford to his brother Jamar theyre from Worcester Mass Prince a league Bay with the three too strong and youre shaking your head well I think right now uh Earl Grant Im mimicking what hes doing hes telling his guys look uh in that situation A plated percentages that has not been in your favor shooting the three good job Walling off the post by post Ashton Langford out of control but to put in by Jaden Zachary a good Follow by Zachary and Kenny Payne now shaking his head uh something that they did well in the first half Louisville a transition D that time a great second effort by Jaden Zachary picking up the Miss from Makai Aspen Langford Zachary only has three points and thats an offensive foul officiating crew Ron Gruber Pat Driscoll and Tommy Montgomery foul on Sydney Curry but heres the BC hoop and good Hustle by Zachary and I like though again little out of control behind McKay Aston Langford but the idea is what Earl Grant uh wants try to push the pace of when you get opportunities and then get the ball into the beat second foul on Curry Louisville has led but more than 17 minutes Zachary Applause goes out of bounds off the cards DC likes to move the ball from side to side deliberate passing but effective passing says Earl Grant be careful with it the turnovers have been down their last five games well I think the biggest thing for both these coaches they preached it and shoot around try to be patient on offense a good look for Zachary didnt go down rebound by the cards and Kamari Lance heres how Ellis Nifty dribbling putting on a clinic Applause Lance on Ashton Langford in contact batriscoll calls the foul Applause second on Ashton Lankford he was tenacious well I think he got him on the arm lets see yeah hard to tell from that but yeah certainly deflected it looked like he got a piece of his arm referee in a pretty good position to take a look at that and thats the key thing when you speak with these officiating Crews its all about their position and Clinton post uh going over I think hes got some blood referees are going to ask him to wipe that off they said trouble since about the 10 minute Mark of the first aft after he got hit the face but to his credit hes out there playing you said it would be difficult to play with a mask you tried it for a minute again technology back in the early 90s didnt ask werent as light and they certainly did not look like that Applause see if you would design one youd probably be the next you know billionaire youd be sitting here next to me let me put it that way all right now though Kenny Payne is changing up the defense again extending their pressure and now looks like theyre going to try to drop back into Zone Kelly and Chaz Kelly back up point guard from Houston playing off guard now theres a good shot from the corner Jalen Withers not usually his game but he still hits it threepointer for Jalen Withers whose father Curtis Withers played at Charlotte on a long career overseas come here Prince the league Bay to Chas Kelly Applause and Eagles stepped out of bounds a turnover first turnover since 718 remained in the first half for BC and Louisville uh when again theyve not turned it over theyre getting some pretty good looks uh Withers in conference play pretty good from the threepoint line 42 percent Applause and a breakdown by Boston College again nice uh Cross Court pass on that last offensive possession of for Louisville Applause Ellis outstanding in the paint for Kamari lands Eagles playing amoeba Zone punched Away by Kelly here he comes can he convert oh my goodness he blew the lamp Zachary with a board and he gets flustered from behind empty possession after Mike James punched the ball out of bounds but he sees missed a plethora of layoffs throughout the year yeah theyve missed some opportunities to close out the half right here though pretty good health defense nice Euro Step uh by The Freshman but again missed thats a missed opportunity but again on the offensive glass of Jaden Zachary he played that amoeba Zone Malcolm against Duke that they lost to Duke here at County formed by a point 65 to 64 they call it a swarming zone defense its not a traditional zone defense and theyre checking to see if the shot was at the rim for the moment but maybe its a good change up by Earl Grant to use that type of Defense as Kelly missed the layin well the reason why theyre going to Zone I think its uh to the problem of keeping Ellis out of the lane uh theyve had some issues uh keeping of the ball out of the paint off the bounce I think thats a pretty good move by Earl Grant try to go to zone or at least put guys in front of them and a good change up there to get the ball to Quick post fourth point lead for the cards thats 10 for the seven footer from Amsterdam Sydney Curry back tell us he sees missed six of its last eight shots Drive James he was a big boy on the Baseline and thats been the problem for Boston College right now again thats just a Blow by a guy getting into the paint you cant open up so much on your Closeouts of a James and Ellis theyve been in the lane pretty much all game thats been problematic for Boston College keeping them out of the paint Jason Matson has made six of his last 15 threepointers and thats what they brought him to be C4 for Cincinnati Applause princely Bay on Withers and that was pretty prince prince salima and new Arsenal thats a tough contested too not bad defense thats just a pretty tough turnaround jumper freshman from Minneapolis who played high school ball with Chad Holmgren and Jalen Suggs Applause Ellis the take on Zacharys skip pass three for James what else is new he has 15 points hes made three of four triples and what a read by L Ellis unselfish play again Boston College trying to keep him out of the paint he draws three Defenders and it makes a beautiful Cross Court pass post maneuvering awkward and out didnt start a well he seemed like he lost his footing spinned by Ellis and a foul on Makai Ashton Langford and Mike James right here straight line drive addition in Louisville and Kenny Payne says I value that I know what we need to do its just a matter of executing it and the players giving him a buyin he wants them to be very prideful the back they put on a Louisville uniform and I salute all those that came before Paving the way uh for guys like Kenny Payne he understands that history so thankful for what they did and certainly of the tradition that is a Louisville basketball he knows what it means certainly he is trying to get them back to that place they just need a spark this is the type of game where he said you know what you just need building blocks we need to start getting us some more confidence in ACC play clearly throughout the night theyve LED for most of the game theyre established that at this point well I think theyre backward uh L Ellis again one of the top scorers and hes a guy that can create for himself Ive been impressed with some of the Regis made but Kenny Payne again back to his uh theme uh he really repeated it multiple times when we talked with him this afternoon he said look its simple we have to cut down on the turnovers and their turnovers are at 11 they average 16 Jayden Zachary points for him at four hes averaging in double figures but when he scores 16 or more if he sees 40 and a stoppage coaching box violation by Kenny Payne foreign Applause has watched his defense Applause give up any easy buckets to Louisville as they are shooting 58 some not so easy heres a three Off the Mark by trainer eagles with Demar Langford Jayden Zachary quit in post Mason Matson and prince alibe in the post and hes fouled triple team and he picks up contact and nice high low acts in that time Quentin post recognizing uh there was a high low thats a nice postentry pass nice touch by Quentin post then thats much better spacing and recognition by Boston College thats the third foul on Jalen Withers with the league Bay at the line the bay injury played its played 15 games Saturdays are for college basketball on accn and the ESPN app this week we have a quadruple header starting at 18th Street NC State Wake Forest then Kyle filipowski leads Duke against Georgia Tech followed by Hunter Tyson a number 19 Clemson they are number one on the ACC taking on Florida State hes capped off by Syracuse and Virginia Tech should be a fantastic afternoon and evening of Hoops on acc Network so a couple at the line you see trailing by four its only been three lead changes Applause games been tied for two minutes and 38 seconds Sydney Curry pushed to them with offense of the first half and out of bounds off with the cards Applause well thats not a bad look uh for Louisville nice little set play they got Curry really two feet in the paint he just missed a little jump hook all right six first half points Zachary post coming off the game where he hit four of five threes at Notre Dame the fade away and hell go to the line Applause and if Im Boston College Im going back to more of this the previous play they got a high low with the league Bay in the post and then this second time they get a Quentin post isolated on the wing let him try to work his way A back down low in the paint the theme and you could tell uh Earl Grant wants uh his guys to get the ball in the paint and this right here really a turning point in that first half inadvertent elbow and he had to go out of the game and now hes wearing the mask Applause twopoint ball game hes safe hes made five straight free free throws Miller back up point guard and a steal by Madison here comes the Eagles Applause Jason Matson feeling it to post for three and they got the lead Quentin post first lead since they were up four and three in the early stages of the game and that says it all well Israel asked two games hes been averaging 23 points per game seven footer showing off the range Boston College have been out with their first lead basketball on acc Network Sunday Boston College takes its first lead since the score was 43 right here nice recovery four post entry pass and then on the other end Quentin post continuing uh his hot streak for Boston College score seven of their last 10 points hes Malcolm Huckabee Im shamita perel producer Russ Kent director Mike Baker outstanding crew a threepointer by L Ellis and a rebound by Quentin post why is Louisville suffered some breakdowns well that right there thats a wide open look Jade and Zachary slipped Im not sure if theyre going to be able to take him out of the game they may have to call time out he took a really hard fall Applause theres post maneuvering on Curry and a foul thats going to be on Sydney Curry and that will take us to a timeout BC with a onepoint lead over the cards in Chestnut Hill Christian show is enjoying joint Farm good form by Peyton Pritchard as the Celtics will play the Knicks tomorrow night earlier we saw RJ Baron Emmanuel quickly and Julius Randle of New York and four one point losses this season by Louisville incredible stretch Malcolm thats the most a team that has had that in the ACC since Georgia Tech eight years ago and its I think theyre getting close uh certainly a shock selection is something also Kenny Payne talked about uh some of the unforced turnovers and then breakdowns defensively on the road lets see how they close this one out Louisville led by as much many as 12 points in the first half you see his clock back in and taking the lead Eagles have had it 97 seconds of lead time and theres a three to tie it up good shot by trainer whos been quiet first bucket of the game and thats great patience uh thats something uh that well Louisville has lacked in some of these losses their response uh when they get down late in these games that was great patience ball move left to right and now they go to their Zone I think this is a good change up by candy paint lets see if they can keep Boston College out of the paint post finding some room but an offensive foul Applause foul a quick post his first and again not bad right here post has got to let that one fly thats pretty good team defense uh but again off that little bounce pass right there post is wide open as you take a look at Louisville foul trouble Ellis with three Withers and Curry uh each with three as well Applause Ashton Langford for the Eagles has threes on the floor with his brother demarl anchor Jayden Zachary in the back work Quentin posed to Prince Philippe in the front door heres Kamari lands freshman they think has a really bright future still learning trying to get his offensive game in sick waning stages of the shot clock and a travel on Ellis and it looks like he suffered an injury as well hes had trouble with an ankle in the past as he goes down certainly hope that young man is all right what a key player he is for Kenny Paynes cards he has 15 points and four assists in 27 minutes again pretty good individual defense of this time and yeah he just really dragged his foot right there and it looked like it just rolled over gave out on him I didnt start yeah right there so again lets hope that hes able not be out for a long time and be able to get back in this game be so important to what they want to do also plays 36 minutes per game the quarterback goes down its problematic 13 turnovers for the cards they average 16 minus 41 assist turnover ratio a large part of why theyre two and 17 theyve lost eight in a row battle one since beating Florida a m December 14th a lead day good idea about an errant shot and I again uh the Zone has given them problems of that time again another contested a jumper and thats exactly what you want when you go Zone you try to go to the low post and the Eagles fit to the cause to punch it out of bounds heres our womens college basketball quadruple header on Sunday Louisville Syracuse is at noon Eastern then the 16th rate Blue Devils take on Florida State balled by the 15th ranked Tar Heels and Clemson at four and the cap today its number 12 Virginia Tech in Virginia should be another fantastic afternoon of Hoops on accn and the ESPN app inbound by James look down and the duck by trainer He adjusted he had trouble initially yeah Boston College took away the initials cut Applause as Ellis comes back into the game so thats certainly a great sight uh for Louisville again a breakdown by Boston College a nice out of bounds underneath play by Louisville and patience guards have been outscored in the second half 1915 Zachary a three got it Jane the Zachary needs to increase his offensive production good way to start yeah and thats a nice Cross Court pass by TJ Bickerstaff better ball Movement by Boston College first three of the game for Zachary Eagles fourth three and 16 attempts screen thrown by wheeler whos in the game for the first time but Louisville Ellis takes a timeout he was hounded by Jayden Zachary and Alice is talking to Wheeler unhappy with those developments so well take a 30 second timeout its nip and Tuck at County forum hi Im Shannon storms Fedor when we started selling my Health Products online our shipping process was painfully slow then

TJ Bickerstaff and thats the area where Boston College has struggled throughout the season and in this game thats their fourth three and it was a big one off again some pretty good ball movement and theres a steal turnovers hinder the cards cause Zachary takes the three and makes the three good luck and he took advantage the Eagles have made five of their last seven field goals a trap and a foul Applause they got post is that questionable no or Grant or really I said theres no need for it all right now you have them right there dont bail them out with the foul Louisvilles been struggling the last few possessions offensively right here again uh you have the Trap and then they go for the steal thats right in front of the ref just keep them right there thats what Earl Grant is saying just keep him right there no need to try to go and theres a steal by post to Zachary to post and he gets fouled they change the foul but Makai Ashton thats his fourth moments ago wasnt on post thats four on Ashton Langford Post running the floor well as he has 17 to lead all scorers and again unforced uh turnover right there again youre trying to inbound the ball heads up play Jaden Zachary in this last three to four minute stretch uh hes had his hand in on everything the two threes that time a nice a simple pass and thats something Kenny Payne talked to his team about really uh you heard him uh over and over and over again in their shoot around make the simple play and take care of the ball how does the offense change for the Eagles who have built their largest lead of the game with Makai Ashton Lankford on the bench well I think its about their defense really thats how theyve created their offense continue to be solid defensively and then try to get out in transition see if you can get some more turnovers Louisville right now need to be patient and then do this right here get the ball into the paint Zachary that Im the ball and thats the Baseline goes out of bounds but Jaden Zachary two straight threes feeling it hell take it taking the Eagles about stir up by six Malcolm Huckabee 185 run in the last six minutes they Trail by seven with 14 minutes left post and Zachary of goodbye for 16 of those 18 points on the Run yeah theyve been huge and right now for Louisville uh L Ellis on the bench well with four fouls uh so this is going to be a key stretch for them Curry in the paint and a foul thats on Devin McLaughlin his third in only seven minutes and I like that uh by Louisville with the Clinton post on the bench uh you have a size Advantage with this matchup right down low but they turn it over here comes Zachary one on three and hes smartly holds and become careless with the ball in the last 10 minutes yeah missed opportunities again turned over now that time they dont give up points off of it you see diving with Louisville 5050 win for the cars here comes James and hes flustered at The Rim boy a chance theres Withers won the 5050 ball he comes up limping yeah both teams sloppy a pretty good yeah yeah pretty good recovery that time to break up with looked like theres going to be a uncontested too its getting chippy again we saw some of this in the first half Ron gruver trying to play mediator the foul was on TJ Bickerstaff his second Bickerstaff and McLaughlin rebounding Duo for the Eagles Off the Bench theyve only played a combined 19 minutes Applause made away three Withers that was special Jalen Withers helping the cards cause and thats tough contested three beautiful out of bounds underneath you know sometimes you can play pretty good D thats just a tough uh deep contested three and Louisville back into their Zone I think this has been probably their best defense when theyve gone to this its forced Boston College into some contested jumpers why does BC get flummoxed by it heres a throwaway Zachary a tie up and a jump ball possession towards Louisville but Withers a contested three and hes still made it and can conference play hes over 40 percent uh from three look uh theyre there on to catch Boston College he just raised up beautiful form on that one off a nice set play and now Earl Grant gets a Clinton post back into the game oh with nine threes they only average six per game theyre nine for 17 lands Baseline Drive the up fake Withers and out of bounds off BC BCs doing a good job collapsing though on defense in the post mount yeah well there weve got a break there though uh Quentin post got beat uh off the bounce right here again nice little head fake and then quick first step Mike James has been quiet in the second half he does have 15 Sydney Curry also quiet he had six first half points thats his first bucket of the second half yeah thats great patience and spacing beautiful spin move uh by Curry his grown man move again he is provided some nice offense uh for Kenny Payne and now they go back into their Zone lets see how Boston College attacks it great pass Zachary to McLaughlin but no look man that was Nifty and I like the adjustment Earl Grant that time chose to put Jaden Zachary at the foul line and thats a great answer to attacking that zone Ill put your guard there at an offensive foul thats on Mike James his third shipping is continues yeah right here trying to go off yeah right in front of the referee and then attacking the Zone nice pass that time uh by Langford uh two uh Jaden Zachary at the foul line and he makes a great read which led to a a layup fourth offensive foul of the game on the cards still Langford on the bench she wouldnt foul trouble three by Matson kept Alive by the industrious offensive rebounder McLaughlin Devin McLaughlin averages six rebounds and its a lot of that is just pure effort hes an energizing presence for them off the bench yeah this is great work out of the Zone sometimes your assignments are messed up thats just the individual effort and now I think the question is how long does Kenny Payne leave L Ellis on the bench post passed up the jumper instead with a higher percentage shot he was at the elbow open Applause back and forth in the second half after Louisville led by six at halftime Curry triple teamed and its punched Away by Matson turnovers piling up but a travel on BC foreign turnovers on the Cardinals BC has nine again this is great help side defense you got three guys on them you come up with the turnover thats just the unforced turnover to give it right back Withers from the elbow Applause he is so under control you have to respect his jumper we talked about the percentage hes shooting nice little head fake right into the pullup jumper from the elbow he has been impressive offensively for Louisville hunting a shot too hes taken nine shots hes made five Zachary to Matson theres a three from Cincinnati transfer Applause thats off of a nice dribble driving kick 417 to go and LL is still not in the game for Louisville and a steal by Matson the bump and the bucket waved off by Ron Gruber the foul is on Kamari lands and master will be at the line all right here dribble drive and kick textbook Quentin post with the nice duck that time thats pretty good offense and then uh shooting the gap another unforced turnover by Louisville these type of moments have created the losing culture this year youve harped on an entire game and no secret Louisville needs to cut down on turnovers and become more consistent on both ends of the floor they have three turnovers Malcolm in the last 90 seconds uh again right now I think uh still try to get the ball in this guys hands or try to get the something in the paint the drive by Withers and we will take a timeout Kenny Payne some pencil moments in the second half another close one for his cards and quick post to the Eagles pull it out the college Eagles have had a good second half with post is averaging 21 points per game in his last three outings Malcolm he had 29 at Notre Dame Saturday turnover is a problem for the cards but theyve been good from long distance just quiet in the second half yeah they really have I think the combo of Mike James and L Ellis uh has been impressive Mike James really in a three to four minute stretch in the second half a really good production uh for Kenny Payne and Louisville James and Ellis with 25 first half points five in the second half PC and Makai Ashton Lankford whos back on the floor with four fouls hes been scoreless in the second half after 15 in the first and now Ellas back in the game replacing Miller so they get Ellis back down by two Malcolm defensively how do they stifle BC well I think this right here the Zone lets see how Boston College attacks it lets see if they put either makayas and Langford at that high post area or Jaden Zachary to attack this Louisville Zone which has been affected Zachary three ball there it is again his third in the last five minutes he has been huge in the second half well for Earl Grant and Boston College his threepoint shooting The Hook by Withers good counter punch by the cards he is another guy that has been really good offensively in this game 16 points six of 11 throw to field and thats a big time turnaround a little jump up off the spin Eagles have led for eight minutes during the game and chalk up another threepointer the big fella with distance in his Arsenal Applause thats a foul on the Eagles but the threes in the second half a tale of two stories seven and ten that that would play and Kenny Payne not happy with his team right here again Quentin post a guide the last two games but hes knocked down threes hes saying look you must know the Scouting Report get out he is the one guy for Boston College you need to close out on Eagles largest lead matched its six Applause Louisville from the foul line four for six EC has made 17 trips theyve made 13 Applause killing some shot clock post dies to three and he back rims it board for trainer Ellis back out to trainer under two minutes remaining in regulation and a punched Away by Alice Zachary and its pinned beautifully but the put back by Asher Langford how do you like that thats just a great second effort a good recovery by Louisville but Aston Langford not giving up on the play first points of the half for Makai Ash to Langford who joined the a thousand Career Point Club Saturday and theyre winning Notre Dame Ellis Coast Corrals it Eagles impressive Malcolm on and all face facets in the second half well I think the threepointers they were able 10second violation what happened there thats just a really no excuse for that again you got to get it over youre trying to run clock and thats certainly a break for Louisville and Boston College not able to get a possession off a 10second violation feisty defense from James Zachary right in front of us on Ellis he gets it off to Withers they play a twoman game but under a minute left theres a three by James too strong weak side rebound by Withers but out of bounds Jalen Withers has been an Energizer for them but PC gets the ball back yeah right here again uh good hustle both guys getting after it I think theyre saying yeah Withers had the ball he was out of bounds but any pain certainly could make the argument that he got pushed but the defense again right here turnover by Louisville and Boston College out in transition good recovery but Makai Ashton Langford not giving up on the play and gets a uncontested layup off the block Eagles two and four in their last six games trying to win for the fourtime elite plays Zachary completes the touchdown pass 10point PC lead largest of the game on a seven to nothing run almost another steal by a league Bay but Withers cant convert Global has seen this happen too often havent they really have again played about as well as they probably could have in that first half get a lead uh but some breakdowns again have come back to haunt them in this second half after the foul was on trainer his first Ashton Lankford goes to the line with 17 Thursday at 10 Eastern right after a womens basketball doubleheader the nothing but net crew breaks down the night the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every womens game look ahead at the best games on the schedule in the coming week coverage can only get one place right here on acc network of the ESPN app so you can watch anywhere Google scoring drunk over two and a half minutes BC has only missed two second half free throws 11 out of 13 that snaps the drought by Ellis Applause Ashton Lankford of evading pressure but Ill have to scoop it up on the back court and then get fouled so the Eagles intestinal fortitude carry them six point lead in the first half they go to the locker room or ogrant still feeling confident and they short things up they made necessary adjustments and you look at the upcoming schedule for Boston College and certainly uh this is going to be a tough road for them they took care of home uh Court looks like theyre going to come out with the whim here now they go uh at Virginia they come back home they have Clemson Syracuse and then at Virginia Tech but I think if you look back at this game uh Jaden Zachary in the second half really he had a stretch where he knocked down uh two threes and then uh came up with some Steals and pushed this thing uh open for Boston College much needed win for them and if you look at Louisville on the other side Kenny Payne still work to do gotten better but through turnovers and a breakdowns uh come back to bite them again yeah the Eagles boosted by outskar Louisville 4630 in the second half they snap a threegame skid against the cards their first one against them since January 2020 year
