for the Panthers he is third in freshman scoring and second in freshman rebounding well we touched on in the Open Tom that uh you know NC State did a really good job of defending the three in that first game hit only five of 21 in that game but its going to be a taller order here at home and the Panthers went to the free throw line Mike in that game 20 times and made 18 of them trying to put the first points on the board fight for the loose ball over near the NC State bench and collected by the pack and O Conor NC State is 17 and 13 on the season 9 and 10 in conference play Morell off the backboard for two for the pack yeah and its good to see for him because his threepoint shooting has not been there in the second half of the season and uh they want him to be more aggressive get to the rim get to the line third year in the NC State program for Mor cell after two years at Virginia see how long it takes Blake Hinson to settle in here big night obviously senior night for him taken back by horn on the Run reset with DJ Burns trying to go back door and the pass off the fingertips of Taylor and out of bounds to Pittsburgh we talked about in Horn and Taylor combined for 10 points against Duke well below their average and this is even though a freshman back court very talented for pick there was a loss on Monday for NC State at home against number nine Duke 7964 Panthers had a win Tuesday on their home floor against Florida State second effort Austin goes out of bounds and that is NC State Applause basketball Jeff capable in his sixth season ass the head coach of the Panthers 95 and 91 overall well Connell needs some help in the back court there Mike we had four guys in the front Court Applause yeah Michael connells like all right he need somebody to pass to hes a transfer from Stanford this is Burns itll turn around High degree of difficulty and he comes up short theyre going to try to play him man on man with ferto Rico to start as long as he can stay out of foul trouble hon trying to back it down rattles out for hson Here Comes horn this is such a tough matchup against smaller cards he can go inside if you try to take away the three Miss from horn Hinson had 27 points a game high in the win against Florida State on Tuesday made six threepointers in that game in 37 minutes of action hes got the ball now interesting matchup with h DJ horn on Hinson to start with Hinson a difficult shot and the follow up is a jam feder Rico thats where hes going to do most of his scoring this love to throw the ball up near the rim and a l for him and a great Strong finish leads the team in field goal percentage not surprisingly often very close to the rim and 64 from the floor for feder Rico feder Rico from heli finle horn out of the corner and that is money you know we talk about the repost for a center that was just a return pass for horn he gave it up defense relaxed and he got a great look how about 89 made threes on the season for DJ horn shooting 43 from Beyond The Arc fed Rico inside it gets burn well again this is a team about making choices and I think for uh at least early on Kevin Keats would like to see the offense going through freder Rico rather than Hinson he averages just under five points per game hes got four in the first half guarding Burns spins around the defender for two he just he left he did did a nice job of keeping his feet right up until the very end that to good patience for burns he usually likes to work on the left Block its spin to the Baseline with 27 points on Monday for burns against Duke Mike the first time he went over the 20point plateau this entire season although he has scored in double figures 22 times back it in and scoring its the senior Hinson and thats you know again its a smart play for Hinson you got a smaller cover on you go inside do your work there but I you know for NC State Im sure theyd rather see him posting up than taking threes Taylor dropped it off to Burns for an easy two you see he hes got such quick Peet hes really good in the half court pit wants to run him as much as they can in this game try to fatigue him but he is so very good in the low block 69 275 lb DJ burns from Rockville South Carolina this is Hinson leening in against Morel he hits the deck and a foul is coming against NC State DJ burns with the move on the inside around the defender crafty and Nifty but on the other end of the Court Blake Hinson leading score for the Panthers hes got two and its a threepoint game you changed this last year SP AC basketball on the CW is brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve the Panthers honoring their seniors tonight certainly includes Blake Hinson teammates William Jeffers number 24 the number 12 KJ Marshall the senior from reding Pennsylvania honored for their commitment and dedication to this program and what a senior season it has been for Blake Hinson Mike he had 41 points in a home win against Louisville made nine threepointers in that game game what about his performance on the road at Duke in that Victory seven for seven from Beyond The Ark and uh you know this team pit has two of the more impressive Road wins on the year at Duke and then at Virginia at the time which was a terrific win they were rolling um so Henson will go to the free throw line early rest for uh DJ Burns tried to give him uh a little bit of time off in the first half and the thing I saw especially in the beep game really in the last four to five minutes a lot of fatigue of course he was having to do a lot of scoring also lead lead the wolf pack in assist that game hson able to track down his own Miss Music Carrington hson Taylor closing quickly hits a little bit of Music daylight so modara now into the game for NC State then middle Brooks as well number 34 along with OK Connell also Jaden Taylor in there and Horn middle Brooks conell lets it Fly and with Middlebrooks in there and PTO Rico can play center field a little bit defensively he can roam leg Music it well hes been such a huge part of uh his team coming off the bench his last 13 14 games really is settled into that role Tom hes a double digit score M 12 per game middle Brooks fedo Rico fighting inside and its middle Brooks nice job he had a he had a tough knife in the free throw line against Duke um but good bounce back there at just two points and three rebounds against him for Ben Middlebrooks transfer from Clemson hes playing in his 91st collegate game tonight lot of experience on the floor amongst these two teams that includes Blake Hinson playing game number 127 in the college ranks hell fire away may have been altered and deflected by the defense of Applause diara Kevin Keats the head coach for the W pack in his seventh season 67 and 73 in ACC games good record though Mike against pity he is seven and three and 3 and one here in this building in fact NC State is 5 and one against the Panthers inside Peterson rent well theyve been great on the road this year up top yeah we talked about it they like to throw L to the big guys he has Graham low set him up the emerald Diaz Graham who averages about six and a half points per game this is Middle Brooks charging to the rim and a whistle and contact its going to be Hinson heres the look and you let him get to his left hand and hes trouble but then you everybodys focused in on the drive you see three eyes set eyes looking at him and Diaz Graham has an easy tasket he just picked up the foul at the other end to put middle Brooks at the free throw line 70 free throw shooter Ben Middlebrooks the junr from Fort Lauderdale Applause Florida NC State is a team 72 from the stripe that is 10th in the ACC and he has given them hes hes been a double figure scorer in two of the last five games so getting a little bit more off thats you know you combine him with horn thats some pretty good production out of the five Applause spot so far the uh the back court for pit has been very quiet in this game that includes janen low had a double double against Florida state with 17 points 10 assists also had five rebounds for his first career double double for the Freshman Carrington freshman running mate falling awkwardly at the stanion and earning some free throws he pops right back up is wide open he got Middlebrooks on the switch out front he knew he could take it you know I thought now middle Brooks did a nice job forcing him to his left is off hand but uh picks up the foul and its you know as a guard take it right to the big guy 79 free throw shooter Carlton Applause Music Carrington so Mike Wake Forest has posted a home win against Clemson 8176 now as Burns comes back into the game in Middle Brooks leaves thats what pit needed if they can combine that with a victory tonight they will have a double buy at the tournament next week in DC which again starting 1 and five um getting blistered by Duke here by 22 and then turning around going to beating them in Cameron having the run that they had outstanding effort by this coaching staff at the time Duke was number seven and they beat him 80 to 76 this is horn long distance launch and carington goes up the ladder for the rebound like it nice defense on horn that time man take a tough shot he has Graham trying to follow his Miss cant do Applause it Bon passes into the game number 10 in red and black this is Burns trying to back his way in on hson has to Kick It Out Pass just inside the line hits the Applause jumper been getting a little bit more time lately and uh its only you know 10 points total his last five games it only attempted three shots Mike in his last four games so thats bonus offense low at the other end with the jumper for the Panthers he gets to that left hand and you know probably the Lesser evil making him pull up and shoot a jump shot but he has really improved over the course of the Year Burns in traffic turns around over the front rim for DJ Burns thats a couple times now that hes really gotten himself bury picking up his dribble but has been able to manufacture points so Burns is now three of four from the floor and six points leading score in our game so far as that was deflected leot trying to work on the Baseline it ended up with horn and now Burns is trailing the play Mike just joining the freay right now appears to be okay tried to drop that one low to Morel on the cut and Morel converts and thats what they do they give burns the ball up high theres a lot of cutting Lanes inside and he is a terrific passer its now a fivepoint lead for NC State Music Carrington Slams on the brakes little follow away and a kind roll well youd think Carrington hes got a big advantage sizewise over the entire back court for NC State so look for him to do some work in the pain area first field goal of the night for Carrington pass morel perimeter work with the shot clock down to five Morel behind the line follows the Miss attacks the rim and scores Casey morcel for NC State Hinson challenged the shot but he never blocked out morcel after that and Im not a you know Ive never been a big fan of following your own shot but morcel makes the pay off struggles continue from Beyond The Arc for Morel just three of his last 15 attempts not at the other end Diaz Graham the first three for pit in the game hes made a few this season 28 on the year pit makes the most per game of any team in the ACC and Diaz Graham separates ball from Wolfpack Applause player floater low has it for the Panthers ties us at 21 I think uh its always emotional for the team on senior night too I think theyve settled into the game with 10 minutes gone by Burns almost lost the handle he spins and shoots and travel well take a time out isou loves it as the Panthers come back and tie this one up 21 Noble and were keeping an eye on North Carolina and Duke for the 262nd time Mike yeah then uh that was about the score at half too Duke has not been able to carve back into that lead sheski and his wife Mickey there court side we saw that earlier North Carolina wins they are the outright champions of the ACC if Duke WIS you need some tiebreakers to figure out seating you know its funny and its an unbalanced schedule now with the number of teams but but coach Smith always said the winner the regular season should be considered the champion just because youre tested over you know over over the course of the Season against every team North Carolina 24 six Duke 24 and six as they are both inside the top 10 Carrington shot rattles out Taylor runs it Applause up NC State is try trying to stop a threegame losing streak two and four in their last six games this is Burns hit the cutter Taylor he done that a few times tonight Mike no that back door cut with Burns lifted has been there in the first Applause half and again the Panthers that they win tonight they can get one of the top four seeds they would be number four Virginia North Carolina and Duke have secured double buys at the ACC tournament how about DJ burns with three assists in the game already Leed carving his way to the rim well you know NC sts driven him off the threepoint line so well done there but the pit doing a nice job countering and getting to the rim pit is one for five on threes lety State one for four on threepointers the Panthers make about 10 per game to lead the ACC inside of 10 of the shot five and a lot of that Blake Henson has been quiet in this game so far to tie up with the arrow favoring MC State DJ Burns just threads that pass inside to a cutting tailor we are tied at 23 Kevin Keats kit pretty good at 50 as well thats a quick trigger from Taylor bounces around easy board for Diaz Brant lot of activity in the paint as you saw carington extending the range over the top fto Rico tapped it but that was a very tough jump shot for Carrington Bas line activity coming out of the corner for three in front of the NC State bench for jayen low and thats the best look theyve gotten to good drive good penetration into the lane and uh low had an easy look second three of the game for the Panthers and pit out in front by three after the low threepointer first lead tonight Burns twisting move first real double team weve seen and it was Big Leg it against oconnell offensive foul called ishma leot trying to drive the Applause lane heres the look on youll see the screen roll here and the the inside no weak side help and that thats great off offense right Applause there great camera work from our crew there great look fellas thats two of seven on threepointers Mike so they now have attempted 824 threepointers this season far away the most of the conference well yeah and 40 of their offense over the course of the year has come from behind the ark Orel heavyhanded Austin had the rebound low quickly even off those misses NC state has been pretty good getting back in transition defensively closing in on the sixminute threshold low course correction drops it low Diaz Graham fumbled it away and now Taylor congested area foul called low picks up the foul well the Wolfpack got the turnover and Kevin Keats he didnt necessarily think when he was talking to us before the game that he could turn hit over a lot but that he might be able to speed them up and get them to take some quick shots little early in their Applause offense youre watching ACC basketball on the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to Applause serve Jaden Taylor is at the free throw line NC state has gone over two and A2 minutes without scoring until that free Applause throw Taylor the junor from Indianapolis Indiana and a transfer from Applause Butler Panthers have one two in a row three of their last four twisting shot up and good and a chance at the threepoint play ishma legot you know we talked about the back cour car low but what an explosive move he got the switch on dearra and just blew right by him to the rim watch this thats against two bigs right there and finishing with a acrobatic shot Ross picked up the foul and the old school threepoint play for Applause leg fivepoint Panther Applause lead thats the stage theyre trying to get burn some extended rest here in the first half hes gotten some time on the bench ha has lost two on the road Marcel misses looking for a call didnt get it a little bit of a for shot in try that time puts defense has gotten a lot stingier in the last four minutes PTO Rico had it poked away it up with Austin sh clock is at 10 Austin Baseline move Ross came over to meum didnt stop Austin there been some pretty good finishes at The Rim by pit so far in this game timeout taken by the wolf pack Zack Austin on that move just a moment ago for the redir Jr from win Salem North Carolina now the lead is seven theres the look the fake and the uh the drive has been there for pitch and not bad defense going straight up but just a better finish but you can see that Wolfpack really really focused in on driving them off the threepoint line making them shoot inside Panthers make the most threes of any team in the ACC per game almost 10 per they are two of seven driving to the bucket to build a sevenpoint lead and the other thing too we talked about the big disparity in the free throw line in the first game in the loss in Raleigh and uh so far think he stayed nice job defending without fouling but uh pit just making some terrific finishes inside weve only seen nine combined free throws here in this first half with just over five minutes to go in the second meeting of the Season between these two teams they played on February 7th a threepoint win for the Panthers on the road DJ horn had 25 DJ Burns had 19 and a state and and lot of this lead has been built without Hinson really participating in the offense and Horn only has three points so far he has the ball Applause now just locked in on him lot of dribbling from horn burns with the shot clock at five hits the jumper freder Rico was helping out on horn that time and he was a little late getting back to Burns on the jump shot eight points now for DJ Burns Music carington free throw line into the corner leg it ran it down against Taylor Hinson up top fto Rico hell lay it in you know for a guy like Hinson in this in this game as important as is it would have been a tough shot but he gave it up for an easy layup really unselfish six points now for federal Rico oconnell lining up a three offt Target Ross tried to grab it out of bounds in Panther basketball so it was Blake Hinson after legot ran it down put it presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years well at one point it was even in the paint and uh pit has gone on a little bit of a Spur here stretching it out 2216 the key thing though is with P in this game theyre shooting over 50 also six offensive rebounds a lot of those have been tapouts to keep the possession alive NC States got to track those down pit is at 54 shooting in the first half NC State 52 here is the resume and snapshot 20 wins and Mike you mentioned it they started in the ACC one and5 and then uh and how about Tom one and five and theyre going to Duke where they had not won Mike since 1979 that was Gman Applause time long rebound taken by Taylor and Mike we just told that DJ horn has gone to the locker room fory State well keep you updated on that situation that was a that was a shot that Hinson took he was just he wanted to be part of the offense he had had touch in a while up ahead fedo Rico could not catch up with it out of bounds and to the wolf backat now thats one the Carrington ill advised decision that time there was no real estate to convert that but again youll see freder Rico out trying to run make Burns keep up with him in the open floor burns is up to eight points he is the leading score for the pack of this first half shot clock down to five Taylor catch and release for three long rebound low tough bounce pass to feder Rico and intercepted Taylor cell working quickly and that is going to be pit Applause basketball all right coming up on the Subaru halftime report the best of courtside Saturday well have a recap from BC and Louisville a game won by the Eagles and well check in with Liv Hong Kong well get a recap from that as well thats all coming up on the Subaru halftime report well pit has made a couple of bad decisions on the break and have not gotten hurt down to the other end State failing to capitalize how about NC State Mike just one made field goal in the last six minutes for the Applause back still hanging in there though Carrington has a an open path he knows his Ellies right to the Rim Yeah and it went to get to his right hand and what happened there was a lot of traffic around that screen up top and he was left all alone Five Points now for Carrington both legged and low have seven points will stay at this end of the Applause floor freshman Carlton Harrington from Baltimore Maryland Mike why so say look at all the traffic right there and then just kind of weak back and forth with it and burns not able to recover from the high post his nickname is bub and Bub has gone for five points so far tonight including that driving layup Burns without horn theyre going to have to have other people step up to score Leed Henson midair contact Morel the closest Defender diara also there forc State and H by trying to go for the dunk gets the call right there and uh our camera person right in on the action Morel picked up the foul fory State third stop for Hinson Mike two years at Old Miss also played at Iowa State second here in the pit program 65 games in a panther uniform its here that he really is blossomed into all League player is over for three from Beyond The Arc thats his specialty hes made over a hundred of them this season and hes third of the conference in threepoint shooting by percentage Five Points now for Hinson after his trip to the free throw line pit is on a 163 run late in this first half double team on burns Taylor they run him off the threepoint line he takes it to the rim score the basket and the foul all of that was set up they had the switch and they had to double team on burns and this opened things up pretty solid defense in the recovery by pit coming out of that except for the last drive so leot picked up the personal foul for the Panthers to put Jaden Taylor at the free throw Applause line six points now from Taylor Austin is back in for the Panthers Le it to the bench DJ Burns get a late breather with 120 to go you know Im going to its going to be interesting to see Tom in the second half if these extended minutes of Rest For Burns theyre going to pay dividends in the second 20 minutes eight points so far in the game for burns who is now Seated on the Kevin Keat bench minute changeed play in the first half fastpaced entertaining basketball in the ACC on the CW all kinds of commotion in front of that NC State BS and now Hinson trying to harvest the jumper any will yeah hes again with pass on him he had the he looked around for somebody to pass to but that was his best option to go up for the jump shot 19 points per game for Henson third best of the ACC and hes up to seven now after that jumper Taylor had it knocked away coming out of the corner trying to put a little touch on that one the Miss from pass thats going to be pick ball diara couldnt pull it in weve waited long enough the highly anticipated Return of the CWs Walker is almost here the all new season premieres Wednesday April 3rd 87 Central only on the Applause CW well I you know for we talked about it NC State you pick what you can what you want to defend and they theyve really done a nice job covering the threepoint line but hit has countered and gone inside and been very productive final 15 Applause seconds low to start the offense trying to work out the Hinson screen charges to the rim spins and shoots that shot would not have Applause counted 3929 at half time Hanson the leading score for the Panthers this season almost 19 per game and third best in the ACC DJ horn who is out with the lower extremity injury leading scorer this season for NC State well North Carolina slowed up that top seed 8479 and they sweep the series against Duke this year incredible bounceback year for North Carolina boy hu Davis has seen everything in his coach your e me how about Hinson trying to go over the shoulder to feder Rico ends up with Taylor let the defender fly off by and he knocks down the three ball and maybe thats the way Mike that NC State and Kevin Keats get back in this one without horn yeah and other people its not going to be on one person other people are going to have to step up Casey Morel is going to have to pick up some scoring as well so the first three of the game for Taylor who has now made 47 this season Carrington answers with a three ball at the other end for pit hes the guy hes actually the threepoint shooting has been better toward the end of the season Tom but uh again give him the choice Im going to be if Im a Defender Im going to like seeing him right Carrington up to eight points now leading score for pit this is Taylor looking for another three two strong Carrington entered the game averaging 19 points and six boards in his last three games trying to keep it rolling tonight again against NC State on senior night its Hinson for two knifing his way to the bucket yeah really you didnt have to worry about Burns blocking his Applause shot Applause Burns over the top diara preserving The Possession for Taylor Morel explosive Drive feder Rico recovered defensively up and in for NC State and the thing that pit has to guard against is letting down you know that the other teams best player and best scorer out of the ball game its not a time to take a you know a deep breath and relax Panthers working on a five game home winning streak wins against Florida State Virginia Tech Louisville noted a and wake trying to close out the season to get their 21st win of the Year carington money from threee all right so now hes now hes knocked down two in a row and now he gets really really tough to guard 58 thres on the season for Carrington Burns trying to counter Burns does not get the bounce does get free throws heres the look and you see theyre theyre going under the screen theyre going to give him plenty of room and make that an option but if he steps up and makes threes shake his hand and come out with another defensive game plan four of 10 now on threepointers for pit with Burns at the free throw line again little more rest than he normally gets in the first half lets see if that keeps him fresh for the second 20 minutes but without you know without horn they can defend guys a little bit differently I think they could be a little bit more aggressive in double teaming Burns if they need to so Taylor and burns have nine points leading scores for the pack tonight Hinson way behind the line ripping the ropes for the pit Panthers and he just kept backing up the is a good match up for him hes athletic enough to bother him on the three but that was was deep first three of the night for Henson on four tries morcel the kick and tailor diara over the top Burns trying to clean it up doesnt get the bounce out to Taylor he cant handle it feder Rico saves it he goes in for the jam Austin all the way for the slam for the Applause Music Panthers who is brought to you by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years at the Confluence of the bangil and the alagan to form the Ohio it is all Panthers they have made their last six shots in a row Austin with the save and then he tries to take the rim off its hinges well and you know Austins unique in that uh he leads his team and blocks in and Steals and gets rewarded for his work there hes a terrific defensive player already second on the team in blocks and steals he has scored over a th000 points in his career as a transfer from High Point University in North Carolina where he played a couple of years first year in the pit program and a thunderous ending to that last sequence as he saved it and then slammed it and this is a steep uphill climb for NC State without its leading scorer DJ horn this is the other DJ Burns Shak rock is at seven draws the double Connell he hits a three right in front of his own bench its interesting they dug in that time when bur when Burns puts the ball on the floor theyre going to dig in and try to double a little bit more but nice answer by oconnell still just three of 12 on three corns for the wolf back carington behind the backboard off the back of the class that was deflected theyre saying it was deflected so it will maintain possession when we come Music back 5238 the Panthers with the lead early in the second half against visiting NC stadi will be Panthers basketball lets take a look at whats going on around the ACC presented by TMobile Mike yeah some good score obviously the Way Clemson score impacts this game with pit being able to get the double by and then North Carolina taking care of business how about cormack Ryan with 31 points six of eight from three and the number one seat in tournament next week for Hubert davidon North Carolina Le it on the jumper for pit North Carolina this season although on the road today with 14 one at home the only loss against the cson Tigers who are also expected to join the NCAA tournament field although they lost today on the road at wake which only lost once at home Taylor on the drive wakes only loss at home was against Georgia Tech we saw them in overtime Mike on the CW and win a game in OT against Miami that was a close sh shave for Steve Forbes team and theyre trying to make the tournament as well theyre going to be uh some Kingswood work to do in the in the turn but thats the case every every year just about steel from Le if the Panthers win they will get the number four seed Carrington first time since joining the lead theyve ever gotten the double by first time in their 10 years as a part of the ACC last year they were the number five seed that had been their highest seeding at the tournament made it to the quarters and lost to Duke 9669 in Greensboro after a second round win against Georgia Tech no team has come out of Tuesday and won the tournament so far some teams have come out a Wednesday and done it NC State will be playing on Tuesday Mike as the number 10 seed theyll take on Louisville they made it to the quarters last year as well and lost to Clemson and Greensboro 80 to 54 beat Virginia Tech in the second round H it had a clear pass to the basket as Defender fell down and he took the step Applause back fou against the Panthers and Leed the CWs number one show making a comeback from the sidelines to the streets dont miss the AllAmerican season premiere Monday April 1st 87 Central only on the CW as I sit next to the AllAmerican from duke Mike jinsky Mike its been a pleasure another season in the books for us and its its been wonderful absolutely wonderful Austin Austin was always your wing man fantastic trip through the ACC from December to midmarch as we mentioned at halftime we started our first game on the CW mik was a court storm by Georgia te as they upset Duke at home in fact they went on to beat North Carolina at home as well yeah I was going to say we we had this pit team with two very impressive Road wins and that Georgia Tech Team couple of very impressive home wins Damon scire in his first year its going to be a fun week next week in DC for the 71st ACC tournament and the Panthers they can win this one wont see the court until the third day of the event that final on Saturday night in our nations capital Connell from the free throw line and that has always been a test too for somebody whos gotten the double byy time especially by a team if they just their first game was Wednesday theyve gotten one game under their belt a win uh you know sometimes thats a problem for the team thats not taken the court yet and although Duke lost today Mike they head to Washington the defending champ beating Virginia by 10 last year of the title game in Greensboro North Carolina which by the way for the next 5 years its either Charlotte or Greensboro thats the destination for the ACC tournament make it easy travel for us absolutely we will be Applause there Diaz Graham was defending how about the job that this guys done this season Michel just and he talked about it and uh you know just trying to be as positive as he could he thought he saw some things there even with the one and five start he wasnt totally convinced that they could overcome that there was a little bit of a fake it till you make it uh type of philosophy moreell at the freeo line keny state but we had a long discussion with Coach cable at the shoo around today and we asked him specifically about the start and he said we didnt make a big deal about it we knew we were going to Duke we went there and had perhaps our best game of the entire season and he thought too the best thing was getting away from pit and and going to Duke and then they follow that up with a win down at Georgia Tech so it was a great trip to gain some momentum and boy did they ever I mean theyve won 10 of their last 13 games and those are all in the ACC eight of their last 10 and three of their last four that is some momentum heading to Washington and you can see see the importance of this game it has been a very tight rotation hson followed his own Miss only seven guys have played for pick so far with C in Championship mode Panthers had gone about 3 minutes without scoring Hinson with that field goal on a second effort inside of 12 minutes to go now in our second half middle Brooks maintains the pivot foot and calculates the angle back cour was his friend that time for sure tell you what Mike NC State is not going away its a 10point game thats I to say it was way too early to go into the Home Run Applause try this is the thing and Im sure Jeff Cables going to talk to him about this at that time out lets keep our Focus here and finish this game off that was the theme of shooter around today finished the deal not ready for a bill mazeroski in the World Series 1960 quite yes

him out with some threepoint shooting here in the second half and uh that possession really not going anywhere and only about 3 seconds left on the shot clock three of six on threepointers for Carrington to double digits for the 22nd time this season for the Freshman from Baltimore Maryland hes one of the youngest players in all of college basketball and has a triple double to his credit Diaz Graham defensively he has Graham keeping his feet that time November six Mike CR Carrington a triple double first game of the year against North Carolina AT and and its Hinson yeah hes starting to feel it from behind the ark now too his second three of the game 17 I mean in a blink bite this was a 10point game just moments Applause ago Taylor pass three and pass connects and an immediate timeout by Kevin Keats so Brion pass hitting the three just the fourth made tonight on 14 chances from Beyond The Arc we talked about theyre big so are all very good shot blockers and stealing the ball great job keeping his feet right there and then right here this is Hinson hes really been seeking that threepoint line especially in the right side of the floor so Henson has made two threes tonight that gives him 106 on the season tell you what know NC State some pretty good answers without horn in this game theres pit and theyre making I tell you what with with a win here and the double buy thats a strong resume for the NCA tournament I think made it to the second round last year before losing to Xavier one in the first four Mike against Mississippi State and then beat Iowa state in the first round of the NCAA tournament a season ago Applause did it with older guys last year hes got a much younger crew except for hon they went last year mark they had not been since 2016 Henson behind the last line of the fence for the W back everybody lifted is kind of what NC State was running and that just opens up back door cuts for pit 27 times this season double digits for Henson he now has 19 of seven 13 shooting middle Brooks Diaz Grant pped it away momentarily Middlebrooks recovers and scores we talked about it hes given him some nice scoring hes got eight points now in the game nice job keeping his balance hes had some some very tough finishes around the rim in the game its above his season average of about five points per game from middle Brooks the transfer from the Clemson leot able to save that one from the front row here at Peterson Event Applause Center Le it got a little too deep there ball goes out of bounds and will stay with pit post captioning for ACC basketball on the CW is brought to by Sketcher basketball comfort that performs so glad that youre with us for ACC basketball CW Courtside Saturday Tom wormy Mike jinsky and our outstanding production crew we thank everyone at Raycom Sports and at CW Sports and Carrington inside the line for two dangerous guy the guy inbounding the ball underneath theres only 4 and 12 seconds on the shot clock and that was that was run to Applause Perfection 14 points now for Carrington Taylor nowhere to go got it back from diara wide open three makes no Music mistake Applause once again the leading scorer for NC State DJ horn had to leave and did not return to the game and not available for the second half lower extremity injury and Taylor has stepped up hes the only W hes the only packing double figures with 14 points had 16 points but he needs some help out there Taylor who did not score in the first meeting between the teams in early February now has 16 points he only had two against Duke on uh on Monday and didnt make a field goal M Brooks almost stole that one it goes out of bounds and thats pit basketball he was trying to get around feder Rico how B this game from Jaden Taylor oh my God back to a 10point lead from pit tournament in the ACC couple of big wins for Notre Dame the number four seed against Virginia Tech the number one seed without Liz kitley the threetime player of the year in the conference and NC State and Westmore advancing to the title game 6943 against Florida state which had an upset win against Syracuse yesterday those seeds youd expect I know obviously injuries but a little more competitive semifinal round so Virginia Tech will not be around to defend its title NC State won the ACC Womens Championship in 20 21 and 22 and there back in the title game against Notre Dame which won at four years years in a row when they entered the conference back to the action here at Peterson Event Center Carrington hes been terrific in the second half and you every time that pck though has tried to you know stretch this out to a lead NC state has stayed right there with them Taylor leads the way with 16 points he is the only player in double digits out of bounds and two pit so the turnover from the pack they have made their last four shots for Kevin ke Applause over 200 career victories for pets in his 10th season overall Harington wide the mark that was his first really forced shot of the second half spite the Miss still has 18 points Hinson has 19 leads pit burds the dexterity of the big man cant convert it well I think the big thing is freder Ricos been able to stay out of foul trouble in this game and and hes been a bother of burns inside only one personal foul for feder Rico needs a little safety valve here and finds Hinson Defender fell down thats enough time for Hinson to hit that jumper yeah not falling down is enough time usually for him to get that jump but thats second time hes had a clean look 21 points tonight Mich ball came right to Burns inside diara from pass and a foul on the play trying to recover defensively it was Hinson and you know despite it all its been a very quiet efficient 21 points for Hinson lead to 14 couple of Threes he really has not forced his offense in this game 14 times this season 14 times 20 points or more highlighted by the home game against Louisville where he scored 41 and made nine threes to tie his own School record cuz he made nine at West Virginia as well and scoring 29 Points and he had a bu of fall down at Durham too in that win eight he did not miss seven seven yeah 24 points in the win at Duke in fact pit had lost Mike 24 straight games on the road against ranked opponents since 2013 before the win on the road against D and that was the game you know when we we asked Jeff said this team felt a little differently about him itself after that win really started to build some confidence everything but the finish for Hinson tried to ease that one up on the rim with left hand changing in midair mind you three Dro Taylor Mike the lead is single digits yeah and uh again guys have stepped up that made plays made shots now we saw NC State do this Mike on the road at Clemson when DJ horn scored the winning bucket in the closing seconds Carrington is Open Taylor grabs it yeah I think hes got to be careful now falling in love with that at three and to try to attack the rim Harington is three of eight on threes and its Taylor free ball and timeouts and all of a sudden a sixpoint game NC State is connected on five of its last seven shot attempts just I mean incredible resilience by this team without their best score Taylor coming off a really poor effort against Duke has been outstanding in this Music game and they have they have matched hit from the threepoint line seven AP piece theres Jaden Taylor night the start contrast from the first meeting against pit where he was held scoreless 22 tonight hes up to 50 made threes this season Mike hes got four in the game four of seven and 22 points and that leads all scores Hinson has 21 for pit that is part of an 80 Run for the wol pack I would expect Henson to be a big part of this possession but the other thing too is lets I would like to see pit get something attacking the rim pressure the length of the court from the Applause Music pack Applause see state with that 80 run the Panthers trying to interrupt it right here inside of 4 and A2 minutes to go in regulation Carrington weaves his Applause way no Second Chance opportunities either for p seven of 18 on threes in the game for NC State four of those from Jaden Taylor he pumps up another one fouled on the threepoint Applause shots Le it with the foul for pit when we come back Taylors at the free throw line for three attempts the lead is six you see the threepoint shooting and over his last three going average him 50 from three so hitting that Mark in the second half but then Jaden Taylor is the one who has really stepped up for NC State with the horn being out of the game having a massive night Taylor has 11 points Mike in the last 4 minutes and 20 seconds and hes only two points away from his career high of 24 this is all after Mondays performance two points one rebound jaylor and all and those points coming from the free throw line didnt make a field goal in the game he is at the free throw line he will have three fouled by leot in the act of shooting Beyond 221 and 34 Ines away from the basket well Kevin Keith I asked him I said what has made you guys so tough on the road this year and and he says he refuses to let his team talk differently about the road as opposed to home you know we its its not this daunting thing that we have to leave and go out and win ball games theyve had five Road wins thats two of three for Taylor Connell and Hinson with flying out of bounds Connell trailing the play and favoring his left leg as he runs up the Applause court Jamie lucky called the foul on cam Woods Mike but NC State thats only their third team foul so they are nowhere near putting pit at the free throw line in the bonus just the one timeout for NC State pit has two that was oconnell on the hip and he picks up the foul Jamal Spearman right on top of the ball Courtney green is also with Jamie lucky and Jamal Spearman tonight Applause low Leed saved that kick great catch passing tight quarters feder Rico hell turn around teammates they kind of passed him into a tough situation right there early stages of this half Mike hit led by 17 points Taylor fouled prior to the shot by so Le it thats only the 16 foul so pit has one more before states in the bonus thats the fifth on leg it Mike we touched on it I mean the big issued in Raleigh was State fouling too much and theyve done a nice job defensively and as quick as those leads have occurred for pit theyve evaporated just as fast Burns didnt get the bounce diara boxed out by Hinson hes over the top for the Applause foul now the only bind that Kevin Keats finds himself in is theyve got one timeout left hes had to use those to massage his team back in hes done a great job to get it to this point fourpoint game with three minutes to go Trail by 10 points at halftime 3929 to the Panthers Hinson against theara spins and shoots fto Rico bounces that thing around out of bounds andc stay ball and I tell you that is a really good defensive matchup for NC state diara has got the quickness and the length to guard Hinson on the outside and then bothers midrange game Kevin Keat in the pack with a stunning comeback here in the second half still trailing by four 2 and 12 minutes remaining in regulation game in early February and Raleigh was close threepoint win for the Panthers on the road Taylor got two defenders in the air and hes going back to the free throw line feder Rico and Austin in the vicinity defensively for pit thats one thing and Jaden Taylor has been very effective at getting to the free throw line this season Che two four six tonight from the strip Mike he has tied his career high with 24 points and now hes got a new career high with 25 amazing performance from the Junior from Indianapolis Indiana so Middlebrooks will check in for Kevin Keats Burns gets the Breather offense for defense going down his last two and a half minutes still a onep possession game wow couple of Misses for Taylor at the free throw line though buckle up for the final two minutes and change with Peterson Event Applause Center Low around feder Rico low to the rim rolls off feder Rico Music follow didnt get the Finish but that drive took everybody away from helping blocking out feder Rico with eight points Taylor PPS up a three Off the Mark Panther basketball and the zoo loves Applause it moments ago the pack cut the lead to three fto Rico on the offensive glass to make it 7267 Applause potential mismatch Carrington trying to use his speed diara recovers defensively Austin kick Carrington lot of poise on that possession the shot clock right on their back over 3 minutes without a field goal for Ry State Morel trying to end that drop cant do it ball ends up with Taylor he hits a three as he hits the deck and a timeout the final one of the game for Kevin Keats fivepoint lead for pit after the three from Jaden Taylor my word Mike 28 points on the night and 5 b threes for Taylor hes been the story you know I aome you talk about when a guy goes out now heres that last play where the last pit possession Carrington has been huge from behind the line 21 points for him hes matched Hinson but um you know you dont expect one guy to take over for the other leading score and uh Taylor has done exactly that and more than filling in for horn the five b threes one shy of a career high for Taylor he has set his career high in points with 28 I mean he has scored this season and Jeff Cs well aware of it Taylor now for the sixth time over the 20o plateau right you got to look again well talk about the Freshman you got low at 85 free throw shooting Carrington at 80 free throw shooting so inbounding you want to get the ball to them leg it also at 85 so their primary ball handlers are guys that you dont want to foul and still NC State only five team fouls so theyve got two to get to the bonus NC State in the bonus hit with 17 fouls they can be really aggressive here going for a steal and not have it hurt them at all incredible night for Jaden Music Taylor theara and morcel closing down on Jaylen Music low so they give it to diara his second as Mike noted 16 fouls now on NC State up ahead to Carrington and stride Al he has grah rocking the rim for pit theyre going to give a foul on the push too on that lob and I love this I mean dont attack the Press just to get it over half court to just go right at The Rim great look ahead they got it over the front line of the defense and then tering for making a play Theo Diaz Graham twin brother Jorge is out with an ankle injury they are sophomores from Spain Canary Islands now the lead is eight as he finish off the old school threepoint play it exits the ball game eight points Diaz Graham time is a factor for NC State diara rattles home of Music three diar with the three Mike thats been a part of his game thats come alive in the last half of the Season he struggled early but hes been terrific from behind the arc I mean hed made 10 threes in his last seven games right 10 of 21 just can one there on his second attempt of the night so Carrington at the free throw line for pit here you go you can get this guy 80 free throw shooter front end is the oneonone Jeff capable will not be satisfied until the clock hits triple zero hes got some real looks of exasperation in those timeouts down the stretch cuz NC State keeps on answering with freeze M he knows about last second heroics right in a Duke uniform back in 1995 and the three point shot from just over midcourt to send that game against North Carolina to double overtime it was a win for North Carolina this evening 102 to 100 highest scoring game in the history of the Rivalry lets take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home or motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom yeah its going to be a senior night for him to remember for sure we talked about he really has not been overly aggressive but very efficient 8 of 16 two of six and three three rebounds couple of assists for him so the senior gets player of the game on senior night as it should be right G man somehow I think that Carringtons going to be on that all freshman team when that gets announced next week he hell hell get plenty of accolades they have combined for 44 points tonight and six made threepointers four from Carrington Taylor that was halfway down Middlebrook tried to follow diara as well and taken by Austin and then morcel was right there last years coach to the year Jeff capable in the ACC Kevin Keats his team Valiant effort mik considering the DJ horn their leading score did not play really most of this game he went out in the first half I would think uh Jeff Cap will get some votes this year based on the their turnaround although I got to think Hubert Davis might be a front runner for that Applause award 25 and six six on the season with a victory today for North Carolina and Hubert Davis number one seed in Washington next week looks like the Panthers are on their way to the double buy and one of the top four seats theyll be number four conell unable to graze the rim Morel tried to bounce it off of Carrington could not do it final seconds from Peterson Event Center double bu for the pit Panthers first one ever in the ACC for them 21st win of the season for
