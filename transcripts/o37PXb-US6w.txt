well put the ball in play between James Scott and ly kid and away we go cards are in Black they are wearing uh their Black History Month jerseys here today Miami the visiting team is in what would traditionally be their home Point theres back door look thats Edwards and the layup for Javon Applause H and Miamis lineup is the small lineup if you will Lyn kit Brandon Johnson Divine uku wears 99 for the kanes baa and also the veteran Cleveland and this is Lyn Kidd in traffic working against Scott tend to Applause shoot Cleveland with Hadley and now Noah Waterman who draws the start today as Johnson misses a long three for Miami now he can shoot the three West he missed his first 22 in AC play but has shot the ball very well since then Hadley turns left it short on the rim and the rebound for the Philadelphia freshman Bea its a highly thought of young man in Betha who its just taking a while to find his Groove a little bit Cleveland a three back rim Miss rain Smith and the cards want to run here and thats what they want to do Wes if youre going to miss those threes you really got to get down the court quickly Waterman missing a at three oach chuku punches it out heads the other way Bea tes one up from Deep thatll Bound Away and Hadley pulls it down again if youre going to take those threes thats fine Wes but lots of times when you miss him it creates long rebounds and you dont want to get in a transition match with this Louisville team nope on the bounce theres Edwards layup fell off and Johnson pulls it away the East Carolina transfer I wouldnt say Miamis fores is at the defensive end of the floor but if things start falling for them offensively is tend when they tend to play very well and there goes Matthew Cleveland on the drive and thats what Cleveland does extremely well and Miami will give up a transition basket to Hatley at the other end hes got all four of the Louisville points and Louisville they like to get the ball down the court West and they like to get it inside their points in the paint numbers over their last few games have been outstanding so 42 the cards here early playing without heer today tend to shoot heres Johnson with five down L thiss kid around Scott left it short with a left hand last Touch by Louisville the fresh 20 for Miami and very quickly into the lineup AJ State McCrae will check in to replace Betha and Louisvilles going to make some substitutions AB bubacar trayor checks in for Pat Kelce and you talk about a guy thats done a job now first year coach of the cards after the Georgia Tech loss last Saturday in Atlanta they rebounded nicely this week at Boston colge yeah they did but you can see by those numbers there West everybody talks about their threepoint shooting and their energy and that kind of stuff but they cant turn the ball over and theyve got to be able to rebound it they cant give up those extra possessions Cleveland misses on the three tapped Away by Scott and heres Edwards and Edwards is very aggressive Wes hes always probing this is Hadley the transfer from Colorado whos had a very nice year as well averaging 14 and six against the league back to a cut lay up good and what a nice pass from James Scott I very often see that overhand twohanded balance pass huku on the drive and scores dine oach chuku got the start against noted aim last Saturday nine points four assists three Steals and four rebounds and Edwards again thats twice now in this game Wes that hes gotten the ball all the way to the basket and hasnt been able to finish Brandon Johnson digging in on Scott with the right hand it cant fall and last Touch by the canes itll belong to Louisville and with that we get our first look also at Kai Ruth the freshman from Washington so very quickly Pat Kels gotten into his bench Watermans come off the floor now Scott has and trayor and Ruth on the floor for the Cincinnati native Pat Kelsey and that makes this a very small Louisville lineup and it kind of matches where Miami is doesnt it well it been a little bit Lyn kids the biggest guy out there Smith kicks for Edwards and a three got it Terren Edwards 363 of the year hes averaged 16 points in his last seven in this kind of run the cards have been on oach chuku hell fire for three and the back rim rebound pulled away rain Smith oach chuku has only made one threepoint Basket in AC play I dont think early in the shot clock thats what Co Cody Kimbell wants nope Edwards back out front heres Hadley Boy rign Smith just lurking at the right wing waiting on the ball instead out of the corner Roose missed the three AJ ston McCrae the Junior from Del re Beach ahead for Cleveland whos Runners off the glass trayor and Louisville Turn and Burn the other way three on two leave it for Roose and out of bounds itll belong to Miami Timeout on the floor we played just better than 5 minutes and Terrence Edwards has five of the cards nine here early in the ball game a triple from the perimeter and one around the rim really good move for Edwards it really has and Wes he shot the three very well at JMU and he hasnt done that yet here at Louisville out of the corner three ball from ston McCrae its Miami on the board from distance and now it is a 97 ball game both teams in playing manto man and Rain Smith so far hadnt had any openings Rim out whistle and foul bill Applause cumington I think he fouled Ruth Ruth is a very active player Wes hes the one freshman they have out there and hes not a muscle guy hes a finesse guy but he moves very well and Cleveland just pushed him trying to get the rebound so Matthew Cleveland gets the foul his first first of the afternoon called here is Hadley Baseline hes working on Kyrie huy couldnt finish tap follow is good and thats Bruth freshman from Washington DC and thats what were talking about hes very active out there oach chuku 6 minutes in and state McCrae had it knocked away Applause all right John thanks very much we welcome you to the KFC Yum Center those of you that have seen Kentucky roll to a win today at rup Arena here in Louisville at the Young Center cards off to a fourpoint edge against Miami with Dan Bonner West Durham great to have you with us Miami team that picked up their first ACC win last Saturday against Notre Dame meeting a Louisville team who got back on on the winning track wins the United Boston College layup jump shot pushed up there by Edwards and that wasnt an easy shot West but again Edwards misses one really close to the goal and thats going to be an illegal stream yep foul on The Applause KES the foul is on Kyrie huy itll be his first and the second on Miami no Chucky he today as you see at the Louisville bench growing injury in the early part of the second half the other night at Boston College but Louisville is in the top five and thats an important place to be with a month to go in the regular season and the cards theyve won 11 of their last 12 theyre only two League losses at home to Duke in December and a week ago today in Atlanta the Georgia Tech theres rain Smith his 863 of the Year third best threepoint shooter in the ACC and Dan hes the cards leader in scoring in ACC play it better than 15 a game and we all know Wes when he gets hot from out there thats bad news for the opposition and that time huie huy just doesnt get out quickly enough on the screen its rain Smith for heavens sakes thats why youre switching the screen you have to get out there he drops back into the lane with if Smith is out beyond the threepoint Arc who simply cannot get that far away from it yep Louisville pressuring the perimeter Johnson taking a quick peek inside kid the catch and flush so Lyn kid on the board gr transfer from Virginia Tech orig started his college career Clemson 7 minutes and change gone back door cut heres Waterman with the dunp Noah Waterman getting the start today instead of heurn in that opening combination for Pat Kelce responds with his first basket and Louisville continues to get baskets right at the goal inside is kid Austin Schwarz a rookie from North of Charlotte knocks it down 24th three of the year hes come off the bench in the last four was five of his last 19 before knocking that jump shot down but his reputation is a threepoint shooter you got to find him if hes out on the perimeter Scott going to try a three back rim Miss ston McCrae and oach chuku in transition hell go all the way through and push it up and in but now Scott he has two threes on the year but he also has 52 dumps and so he should be inside Waterman tes up a three Watermans 24th three of the year so hes got a dump and a three for his five and the lead is five for L I do not think that if youre Miami you want to get in a threepoint shooting contest with L ston McCrae rebound for Edwards boy look at Louisville into the front Court quickly Waterman another one nope barely got there ripped away by Hadley ball came loose now theyre going to scramble Waterman will pick it up in the corner rain Smith Wast no Applause Music time Scott is down web yeah Cody Kimo going to take a timeout after Smith banged home the three boy my Scott took a shot to the mouth but another look here Waterman got the dunk and then Scott comes up like theyre counting for the knockdowns over there huh W Wes keep in mind heurn is already missing from this game and Louisvilles had a ton of guys hurt all year Y and Scott hes got that Bloody mouth even if they can get that blood stop Brandon Johnson landed right on his head and he really pounded his head into onto the court Yeah you mentioned the two guys K Pryor and Kobe Rogers or not coob uh Im sorry Corin Johnson Washington transfer had shoulder issue case in Prior course Tor an ACL on their trip to the Bahamas and you see theres prior with his back to you transfer from South Florida who played last year for the late Amir Abdul rahee and the Bulls in that Resurgence it was almost prior was going to be the spark for another Resurgence right he came to join South Florida and pulled the trick last year for coach abdur rahee and was on the way I think to being a very vital piece of what Pat Kelce wanted in combination with James Scott inside now Scott was taken to the locker room with the bloody mouth well see where that goes well now trayor is in there trying to guard ly kid and thats an advantage on the inside for Miami if they can find it Pao with three to shoot skips it on the hard drive this is Joe Bay to the rim sophomore from l in France Paul Jo B averages almost seven against the conference hes pulled Miami to then six and look at Kadir trayor swing around kid but cant finish thats a little hard kids got a few inches on them and kid is very long and hes not bad on the inside yep heres Cleveland on the perimeter against hadin Louisville switches almost one through five on everything and Cleveland leans in and and Waterman the rebound well no Watermans presence today becomes a little bigger if Scott Camp return play Miss four games with that thumb injury Wes and again just having another body in there particularly one who can rebound and shoot threes that helps 15 to shoot for Edwards against patha whos back on the floor heres Waterman step back against K and offensive foul on water Dan its a point of emphasis in college basketball this is a foul and some folks will look at it and say well whats the big deal water moon was still moving moving when the contact occurred right absolutely Wes and when you set a screen on a moving player you cannot get right up against him because youve got to give a moving player a chance to stop or change direction so theres two things there he never stopped and he went right into him you cant do that Music yep sixpoint lead for Louisville J looking for kid now Roose at 69 thats a little better match up kid trying to fight for space and scores but hes really clever inside if they theyre going to need to get him to give up that ball once he gets it there hes really tough L kids been double figures in three of his last five hes averaging in his last five 14 points four rebounds and shooting 68 Miami will need that and in some today if they want to hang around against the C Terrence Edwards whos got seven to lead everybody early hes so good at that West getting down into that midrange with those little hook shots and Jumpers in there now hes missed a couple of those already today but he can be very effective down there Cleveland with a heck of a catch streaks Baseline and the rebound pulled away and thats ruths thats a really good match up Hadleys a tremendous Defender going against Cleveland foul on the drive I think were going to get free throws here for Louisville and at Terence Edwards Jr driving the ball to the basket and Wes sometimes he just goes foul was on Betha itll be his first third on Miami and free throws for Edwards Frank Anum eBay has checked in first time weve seen the fifth year player from Nigeria and and they ruled that a non shooting foul West okay so no free throws that was a very awkward looking play and Edwards will give you that from time to time this is a shooting opportunity for Smith three bounds away theres Ruth lobbing Anum eBay the kick out and the three ball from Hadley no good and kid the rebound and some eBays got to go up the dunk down yeah sixpoint lead Schwarz with Bea CLE Cleveland Off the Bench or on the bench now I should say stat McCrae ly kid and Joe Bay on the floor and heres Lyn kid working on Angela meay inside Schwarz the catch of a tough pass and missed it airball right in front rain Smith to The Cutting Roose layup good what a good looking pass from Smith and what a great catch I mean that was in traffic I I think Rose was a little surprised that the ball was in his hands he did a really nice job maintaining control and putting that one in the goal seven and a half to go eightpoint lead for Louisville pull up from baa heres Smith long drive blocked off the window score of the goal thats eight for rain Smith and Louisvilles got a 10point lead its their largest of the ball game and boy rain Smith gets you one way or the other what a nice pass the roots for the layup to work with in conference and interestingly enough both losses to the same team the yellow jackets of Georgia Tech yeah you talk about team thats been devastated by injuries oh yeah Georgia Tech down four guys they led the league in Hoots yes they did much to Damon stmy shagin Applause three ball missed off the hand of Paia look at Edwards with the initiative and hell draw the foul from ston McCrae now Edwards isnt always completely under control Wes but when hes coming at you like that you have to get in front of him and stop and Sten McCrae never did he smacked him from the side but you got to stop him hes not going to stop voluntarily Louisville is 75 at the free throw line and conference play which is 11th in the ACC Terence Edwards 77 now has eight here in the first half and 49yearold Pat Kels got a lot to be proud of here in year one at Louisville but if you watch a morning workout of about 48 minutes you would never know theyre 102 and 17 six would you Dan well certainly you would know that theyre doing okay because he is so enthusiastic I dont understand how in February if hes that enthusiastic every day how he can still have a voice at all of course a disciple of the late great skip crer in terms of his coaching pedigree and hes done a marvelous job here Louis on eight nothing Run State McCrae trying to snap look at that shot AJ State McCrae going to get credit for the basket and draw the foul its on Kai Roots itll be his first second on the cards and state mccraes got a chance here to cap the threepoint trip well he does and Louisville you know they they want to stop him out there on the perimeter and they didnt but Im telling you Wes if thats the kind of shot youre going to have to make its going to be a long day cuz not many of them are going in the basket State mccraes got six he was scoreless in 18 minutes last Saturday in the win against Notre D ninepoint lead for Louisville and Edwards looking to go to work again look at rain Smith at the foul line with Schwarz defending and Edwards just playing an ISO game on the drive and scor if its going to be that easy Terrence Edwards is going to have a feast but he got the switch and Brandon Johnson was trying to guard him and I think thats a mismatch and Edwards took Music advantage ston McCrae back into traffic another move with a right hand and AJ State McCrae now with eight in this first half Smith skip back for Edwards working against Schwarz punched Away by oach chuku kans on the run and Cleveland had it batted off the rim and Ted Valentine going to score the bucket for Matthew Cleveland and theyre going to review that at the next TV timeout so for right now its a twopointer before they review well show you at home and the ball hit the backboard Above the Rim thats a goal t yep so the call Will Stand and its a sevenpoint Louisville Advantage Edwards R Smith clutched on a three drives and hell feed Roose Up and Under a good half dozen for Kai Roose and Roose West has stepped in here with the injury to Scott and he has played very well on the interior sure has just ahead of five minutes to go in this first half Johnson is scoreless he came in averaging 14 in his last three thats a long two a long three rather that bounds away well when they play this really small lineup Johnson has to be able to score three Waterman had it stripped and Hadley cleaned it upy six for Hadley thats just not quitting on the play Hadley does did a really nice job the PA announcer just to Jak Waterman an assist on the announcement not sure about all that 11point lead for the cards Up and Under from Johnson and last Touch by Edwards and with that here comes Anum eBay and tror back into the lineup of the cards check out if theyre giving aist on blocked shots that somebody catches and puts in the basket thats going to thats going to change the the the definition of assist well Im Im going to say that the public address announcer awarded an assist okay Im not sure its going to be remarked in the notes Here in fact well they have an assist for Waterman I dont know if that was absolutely the play or not well have to check that out and report back no Waterman already had an assist okay good yeah theres no chance that that would they assist i have got a couple more assists because I got a lot of shots blocked Im sure somebody must have pick him up and put him in the BK if well assuming the blocks were back to your team heres heres the pass inside eay just his second field goal of the year danay instead of passing it out he did dunk it but that was a great job with penetration in the P by Edward oh guku missed the L Edwards with he not available today is directing this offense beautifully and Watermans three is too strong tror the rebound and had it knocked away and oach chuku with it State McCrae the other way scoop and another score okay maybe thats the kind of shots hes going to make Wes that was another tough shot and he very nice trip for Miami this a guy who played bucky ball a year ago at Samford in the Southern Conference hes averaging six points almost three rebounds hes surpassed his average here in this first half hes now got 11 in the half to lead the Applause canes well as as quickly as these teams have moved up and down the court West there havent been a lot of turnovers so far out of the corner Kadir trayor Baseline into traffic Up and Under he scores terrific move he got under there and I think he wanted to pass it and realized he couldnt and so he made a very very good Music shot lead back to a dozen inside a three to go Cleveland on a hard drive and score Matthew Cleveland now with six hes a very hard guy to contain weson I think hes got a you know Hadleys need some help from his teammates to force him to pull up Cleveland also 15 00 career points now in his college career at Florida State in Miami as Smith misses the three and 235 to go in a 10point game oh chuku all the way through and kid had it stripped Hatley Edwards oh nice pass treor the so Kadir AB bubars nickname his second field goal thats now five assists for Terence Edwards Jr hes done a really nice job handling the Applause ball and a three ball MCC State McCrae Dan has now got 14 and a season high in the first half in traffic heres Edwards with a right hand hell score and hes got 13 to lead Louisville but AJ ston McCrae has poured it on here well Stan McCrae is keeping him in the game yep he had 13 earlier this year against Charleston Southern his career out 29 last year playing for Samford against Chattanooga in the Southern Conference Cleveland on the reroute stripped of it by r Smith cards hurry theyll have three on two how about one on two missed the three and trayor couldnt hold on the rebound anel and eBay was behind him as well and thatll allow Kai ruths and Noah Waterman to return for the cards now Smith missed that threepoint shot but they are very happy for him to shoot that in transition but that was an outstanding defensive play WS to come up with that ball we just said they got to give Hadley a little help against Cleveland and he took the ball right away on the dribble yep sure Applause did and now here in the final Applause minute the cards by 11 ston McCrae for Clevelands three and its good Matthew Cleveland now with nine and that is the biggest Improvement in Clevelands game this year used to be able to lay off him from three but you certainly cant anymore and Pat Kels use it or lose it 30 here with 45 second seconds to go 12point lead or eightpoint lead for Louisville when we Music continue he should have been to be right here km Center for Womens basketballs last weekend game as they host North Carolina on February 23rd Time Low gold tickets are just 5 so get yours now last is gocardscom Music Flash well eightpoint lead for the cards and we just got word that uh James Scott will not return the 611 sophomore who was injured uh early in the game when he ended up having Brandon Johnson fall on the back of his head which forced his face into the floor we thought he had a bloody mouth and in fact has a tooth issue that his problem is with his teeth so uh its not it wasnt a head injury right but boy man so so already without heurn now without Scott ruths has stepped in and played very well and Edwards has done a marvelous job playing the point guard spot 13 points five assists four rebounds for Edwards here in this first half and the lead is eight tend to shoot heres Edwards working on OG chuku hes looking for Smith sure is instead may take the twoman ISO and now push it up and score who needs Smith yeah 15 for Edwards how about that Wes this is a guy who if hes shooting the three well he can get you 30 On Any Given M sure can huku with six kicks it in the corner ston McCrae off the iron Cleveland to re b and a foul called with 23 left to go in the half lets go back to Edwards though Dan its tough shot here W hes got a mismatch and hes trying to drive by kid and he cant do it and so then oach chuku is right up against him on the switch and hes still able to make the basket I thought the whole time he was looking for rain Smith but Smith couldnt get loose yep foul was on Hadley his first fourth on Louisville a non shooting foul yep so quick inbounds from Cleveland State McCrae turns oh went the other way and hits the shot boy what a half for AJ State McCrae hes got 16 of Miamis 38 in the first half Dan won hes Matthew Cleveland with Jalil Betha Divino guku Lyn kid and Brandon Johnson whos got the basketball well treor as a guy I mean he was the big West tournament MVP last year hes noted for his defense and his rebound heres Cleveland leaning in cant get the roll over Hadley kid gives Miami a second chance out front oach chuku 12 to shoot Divine picked up on the dribble now Betha boy Louisville does such a good job handing off man defensively I think theyll think of the cards in that light but theyve shown it to be really really a strong suit drive and runner for Cleveland hes got 11 now but now that was Wes I agree with you completely about l in their defense right there that was not a bad defensive series but Matthew Cleveland hes just been other worldly in the last six games no question hes played his way just from his individual effort into some sort of all ACC consideration even with a team that has struggled as mightily as the canes have here is Smith missing on a two Hadley a second chance and couldnt get the rebound the shot to go might have been altered by Brandon Johnson well you do not want R Smith posting up in inside thats not the ideal Louisville offense heres Cleveland OH with the right hand Matthew Cleveland the punch they get him the ball out on the wing West and particularly when hes able to go to his right hes looking to attack the basket every single time Kadir trayor from the Ivory Coast digging in inside had it knocked away fourpoint game or early second half and Ls really tried to force it inside on offense in this half and that has worked but theres a travel travel by Bea this is what were talking about when he gets the ball on the wing hes going to his right hand and unless somebody steps in to stop him thats exactly whats going to Applause happen and now were going to get a stoppage of play Cleveland will go to the Miami bench Sam Johnson their trainer out to check another listen Applause wow tell you what one thing weve had in the ACC this year is a Sam Johnson the fourth year trainer from Miami out to tend to Matt Cleveland weve had some finishes at The Rim Dan we had one in here 10 days ago Hunter Salis of Wake Forest weve had the Cooper flag dunk against pit worldwide we had Ian Jackson in Winston Salem against Wake Forest and now we got Matthew Cleveland here today now Clevelands got cotton stuffed up his nose well to stop a nose blade so you know did he go up so high that his nose just bled from the altitude its well done Dan two minutes in Smith left open makes him 11 for rain Smith on his third three and Lille had missed five threes in succession before that one back to a sevenpoint advantage huku leaner from right of the lane rolls in and thats what he wants to do W he wants to take the ball to the basket he can drive it pretty well and hes got a nice little pullup floater kind of game when he gets that close trayor for Smith 15 to shoot Smith will fire again front rim miss abubacar the recovery Waterman a three trayor okay hes got alive couldnt finish gets it back a fourth time and still missed it last touch Cleveland itll stay with the car that was like a Moses Malone sequence there just keeps shooting it and getting the rebound that is a great rebound right there but he cant get it to go that is some Hustle by tror we said thats his thing rebounding and he showed us right there and hes spent and comes out out of pack Kels lineup a Look Away lob right back for Smith a three ball good W that is a great shot because it was not a particularly good pass he had to reach down by his knees to catch that ball what an out of bounds off the Baseline drawn up by Pat Kelce and his staff kid into the corner three ball oach chuku and stepping on the end line was Bea and that will send it back to Louisville Kyrie huy and AJ ston McCrae check in but how about another look at this well Smith the balls down below his knees and he catches it most Shooters like to catch it right in what they call the shooting pocket where he can just catch it and go right up but thats not what he was able to do how about career threes made R Smith nows not gone to the biggest number among active players in the NCAA passing Jimerson of St Louis the bicin Jimerson played last night so heres Smith launching and missed left it short Bruce did a nice job dodging uku Bill cumington Jr didnt umpire he fell into the took a side swipe there and that ball went right through the wickets and out of bounds as both Edwards and Waterman were scrambling and big Noah at 611 Savannah New York has to get to his feet you cant you cant fault The Hustle but I think Edwards picks up that ball easily if Waterman doesnt dive on yeah and with that Waterman out and Frank ham eBay reports back and hes playing more today because of the Scott injury remember now Chucky he is also out of the lineup today for the cards in ACC play hes number one in assist they better than seven a game but Edwards is helping the cards close the gap to day and theres a reach on anay second on Frank in the first of the half wow now thats the right idea when Clevelands going to his right you try to put some pressure on him but not when hes going to his right over toward the sideline you just move your feet you got to get in front of him when hes turned and headed to the basket ston McCrae almost four minutes into the second half AJ fights for a spot basket and a foul and for the third time today State McCrae is going to go to the line to try and complete a threepoint play here Dan Wes this is just a really good oneonone move he gets close enough that now he can turn his back to the basket becomes a post player and even though Edwards has a couple of inches on him theres nothing he can do that is just a great spin move protects the ball with his body 18 for ston McCrae on Seven of Nine floor shooting and the free throw good Wesson this is a Miami team that just wont go away yep trailed four earlier now trailing five Smith Baseline RSE hard to the basket on the drive knocked out oach chukus got Cleveland ahead divine all the way to the basket and a foul and thats another foul on Edwards so Edwards is going to draw the foul his second third on the cards Miami cuts the Louisville advantage to three free throw to make it two when we come back important game in terms of the ACC race oach chuku to try and cut the lead down to two could not would have been as close as its been since the 12minute mark of the first half Terren Edwards the offensive initiative the other way and a bucket first basket of the half for Edwards Hes got 17 now louville now just three of 11 from the floor in this second half Dan again theyre they can be a very streaky offensive team and Miami has done a nice job battling back taking advantage of the fact that Louisville has been cold on the offensive end Miamis five of their first seven offensively thats helped them crawl back into it oach chuku with five to shoot skips it to the left side ston mccraes had the hot hand Johnson a deep three from the front and a back rim miss huy the rebound cant score Waterman the rebound and heres Edwards again Waterman all the way to the Baseline boy Hadleys been quiet today man just three field goals you know Hadley really has Weston hes I think their X Factor offensively hes another guy can go get you 30 On Any Given night Smith can get you 30 and he almost got you a fourpoint trip the three spins out for rain Smith on the state mcra foul well he didnt have much room there look at this you cant spin around much more than that its the second foul on AJ ston McCrae rain Smiths going to shoot three here he is now 36 of 39 at the line this year and 20 21 of 21 in ACC play so the second of the three and dont forget tonight at 9 Eastern over on acc Network nothing but net crew breaks down the day and night in the ACC highlights and Analysis of every game a look ahead to the best matchups in the coming week Taylor tanon bomb host the group with Luke Hancock and Joel Barry there tonight on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app Smith buried all three lead back to eight huku hard drive had it blocked by Edwards cards trying to pull away here and Hadley dribbled into trouble State McCrae forced the turnover there was two guys on Hadley and Rain Smith was all alone this is the guy you is going to go try to go get him a basket huku Baseline and lost it last Touch by Smith weve been talking about Terrence Edwards Jr and his offensive performance well this time he simply does not give up on the play and oach chuku is a small guy and he just stays with it thats a really nice block shot 11 to shoot ston McCrae backing down on Smith all the way under forced it up with the left hand Waterman the rebound of a Miss its a little bit of hot potato going on with cards in transition finally its Edwards spinning through TR trffic gets it to Hadley Hadley took that ball right off the nose right side Waterman threepointer good eight for Music Applause Waterman Kentucky he loves it cards lead 11 Waterman is another guy brought into shoot threes and he has not shot the three very well all year long but hes knocked down a couple tonight Miami time out the lead is 11 again started the second half so well and Im telling you you missed four in a row against Louisville youre asking for trouble yeah cards on an eight nothing run Miami had it as close as three and a free throw that was missed that would have cut it to two and bang like that its 11 theres Edwards matched up against Ogo chuku again and hes got a threein height Advantage there and uku is a guy wants to go to the basket ly kid only four points today Mak it six on the jump hook and thats where they miss James Scott because Lin kid is a very aggressive inside player and Waterman even though hes 611 hes not really an inside kind of guy he wants to shoot threes heres Edwards back out front Smith over kid wow rain Smith now five threes in the game what a pass 20 for Smith you talk about a pass being delivered at the perfect time 12 in the second half for the young man from Tasmania ston McCrae cant bang home the Applause triple boy Id get the ball to six in the black Jersey but what do I know almost 8 minutes gone Edwards had that partially blocked the Waterman Schwarz is over here standing in the shadow of rain Smith Edwards on the dribble with oach chupu eight to shoot Terrence Edwards will call his own number in here 20 now for Edwards what a game hes s Lead is 15 again 142 run the last three and a half kid has the only bucket for Miami oach chuk woo cant find the range ston McCrae back in traffic had it rejected here is Smith Schwarz does not give him up and now he throws it away trying to cross to Edwards Miami gets it through to Schwarz in the front Court ston McCrae took the contact and scored 21 now for AJ ston McCrae Edwards to the streaking Hadley Hadley eight for Hadley Edwards gets the ball down the so fast the defense Just Cant Get Set yep I think Terence Edwards a little winded here I think hes played every second of the game kid rolling to his right scores the only two Miami field goals well State McCrae just had one hes got two of the last three Miami field goals does Lyn kit look at Terrence Edwards talking about a guy who needs a water break I dont think hes going to get one nope not right now 15 to shoot look at this they clear it out and foul going to be on Schwarz thatll get us to a break Terence Edwards will gladly take the visit to Pat Kels bench the cards lead 6855 number five for Louisville off operating at the other end of the floor at times defensively I think thats right theyve had a they had a couple of instances particularly at the end of the first half where they gave up too many drives to the basket but they seem to have cleaned that up here in the first half of the second half R Smith Terence Edwards finally got a break for the timeout seemed most appreciative heres Smith off a screen thought about it Schwarz there defensively little Runner with the left hand is short by well thats a win when you can make him shoot at two oh no question Cleveland who put four on the board pretty quick here in the second half including that massive dunk and that time that ball got deflected you see the minutes Edwards has gone the full 30 Hadley a minute shy Smith two off of that so Chucky hubn theres the math on your absence today again hes out with a groin injury and I think the the return date for heern is going to depend on he Cleveland a kick out three done a nice job yep young Preston coming along nicely theres trayor and he got fouled by Bea I think and that was on the pass so hes not going to shoot Ted Valentine the whistle on the Freshman his second third on Miami this is a situation where trayor hes you know I dont know that he was passing originally but instead instead of acting when he got hit instead of keep carrying his arms up he moved his arms as if he was passing Smith going to leave that on the front rim trayor gives Louisville another shot well hes always around the rebound is he Applause yep skip into the corner Ruth nope and last Touch by abubakar trayor transfer as Dan told you from Long Beach State where he averaged a dozen and eight rebounds a year ago and Pat Kelce has put this group together everybody who saw the roster overhaul that occurs in the landscape of todays game well he got some great fits and theres Cleveland on a drive and a foul once you let him get past you out on the perimeter West and get going the way the rules are these days its really hard to step in front and draw a charge so you got to stop him at the point of attack or he is just going to pile up the points y 15 now for Matthew Cleveland who missed the free throw and hes a 79 free throw shooter ninepoint or 11point lead for Louisville Baseline is ruths trayor Smith a three ball oh oh my goodness went Sky High boy did he get up there that was really good ball movement youll take that shot by rain Smith every time Schwartz a three pair of triples now for Austin Schwarz from the Cannon School in Concord North Carolina just when you think Louisville might pull away Miami gets a little spurt out of the corner Smith that one spins away ly kid the rebound good pass good shot again youll take that every time Joe Bay with Cleveland kid Bia and Schwarz for Miami double team there for kid got to get rid of it and a timeout finally taken by Cody Kimble across the way so theyll take a 30 here and well step aside just ahead of eight to play Louisville by eight when we tough place to play yep and they they have a special relish for trying to beat Kansas in there Y brambl is not just a place you walk into and walk out of not if youre Kansas and not is the Yum Center either here is Jo Bay on the drive and a score tough shot Paul Jo Bay his second field goal yep the last two years have clearly been washed off the docking here in Louisville the cars are back and the building is on hand and alive again to watch Pat Kels first Louisville team go to work here today inside this is boy Hadley with a nice moving hiss 10 now for Javon Hadley again Hadley we talked about it Wes he can really be an X Factor with this offense he can score inside he can score outside that was a really nice catch of a tough pass from Edwards eight pointer lead again for the cars Jo Bay on the drive back to back baskets Waterman cannot guard him out on the perimeter Jo is just too quick Edwards SP into traffic and waited patiently to find an alley to push it up there and in when a guy can do that West he becomes almost impossible to guard 22 for Edwards 20 for rain Smith the lead is eight under seven to go need to see if they can get Joe Bay driving it to the basket again here he is against Waterman Fall Away took the contact and will get the foul on Noah Waterman and Paul job who played his high school ball in the State of Florida at West Oaks Academy to the line well hes a guy who can really get the ball to the basket West and hes just too quick for Waterman Watermans got 45 in on him but he just cannot stay in front of Jo B 22 of 26 on the year is Jo B and it spins out Kai Ro and Kai Roose is back Waterman is out for the cards I dont know why Pat Kelsey has a seat on the bench Dan Im still I dont think he does actually no I no he does he Applause does in fact Id like pedometers on Kelsey and Kevin Keats in a game in the AC we could do that measure the miles right does anybody use pedometer anymore Im not sure you keep it on a watch Dan yeah there you go sevenpoint lead nice kick oh look at the ball movement Edwards thought about it tend to shoot for Terrence Edwards kid tries to switch off Edwards oh my goodness left alone and it bounds away whistling foul inside called on the rebound by Lyn kid Ted Valentine is going to put it on Roose I think that three that Edward just missed hes probably a tougher shot than the three passed Music up Bruce The Freshman his second sixth on the Ville only three fouls on Miami we go inside six and a half still hanging around there goes Cleveland Baseline into traffic oh and a follow on the dunk by Kid 10 for lin kid that time he drove all the way to the basket and so many Defenders nobody blocked get out fivepoint lead heres Smith at the right all the way to the Music Baseline and now Hadley against Bea takes him into traffic skips for roseth to shoot heres needed to shoot that Edwards with two on the clock blocked Away Joe Bay scooped up the its a shot clock violation I think Cody Kimbell whos spilling Bill Courtney as the interim coach here wants Bill Covington to let him know why that was blown dead when Miami took the rejection you blow it dead Wes because and heres you see Lyn kid is two guys against him and thats Edwards that doesnt step in front of him two guys against uh Cleveland and you let a guy like ly kid just have that step to the basket yep thats going to happen every time but Hadley that time had a mismatch against Betha inside and I think he was worried about Lyn kid so he passed the ball out Hadley has to be more aggressive offensively heres kid the catch against trayor turned it over Louisville on the attack with Hadley out front Smith quick trigger with a left hand and one Music Applause fourpoint try now for Ray Smith and I thought that Edwards pass was going to be a little too late but Matthew Cleveland slow getting to rain Smith you cannot be slow getting to rain Smith in transition so rain Smith now has got 23 and a chance to make it 24 on the fourpoint trip and Terrence Edwards has got his first double double of the year with 22 points and 10 assists well weson he also has five rebound and Edwards has not been out of the game nope Iron Man so far they might get a break if they can keep this up but every time they threaten to pull away the hurricanes have had an answer yep record wouldnt lead you to believe Miami plays with the fight they do would it Joe Bay and a whistle and foul and I think this is going to be on Roose again tell you what canai Roose third Applause foul and that is the seventh on you know what if youre going to foul you may as well get your moneys worth and thats certainly what Roose did so here is Joe Bay at the line who was just one of two a moment ago and that misses what a great block out by trayor heres Roose shoots it across the Baseline Edwards R Smith double team coming lost it itll go to Miami on the turnover Miami continues to be very aggressive on the defensive end that was a great trap huku lob and boy that got deflected away trayor again got a hand in there heres the lead and Roose and one what is zuku thinking about Wes hes 63 hes not going to block a 69 gu dunk Kai ruse plays in a bigger elevator than others my goodness I mean he just runs and Hadley hits him perfectly no dribble you just got to get out of the way you dont want to give him an easy one so the Freshman from Washington averaging four points against the league has eight and make it nine well Wes he was already going to get some more minutes with heern being out but then when Scott went out he became a very valuable commodity seven nothing run and its a 12point lead z b Cleveland against trayor and lost it on the dribble here goes Edwards Hes got Roose for the Applause lob by Joe Bay great Hustle by Joe Bay Cleveland inside of four to go on the way up and gets a foul called and the foul will be on Hatley itll be his second eight on Louisville more than anybody elses right because of the groin and things like that Louisville plays Ed Raleigh wins the United against Inc State Chucky hman yeah probably a game time decision like today if he doesnt play then then they dont play again till next Sunday at Notre Dame Dan well they might elect to keep him out of that game of course youre going on the road to Raleigh and even though the wolf pack has struggled that is a pretty tough place to play youd love to have heurn yeah but youre right Chucky heurn has been such a key to this team they cannot afford to have him seriously injured they need him back as soon as possible but they dont want to risk injury at this point in the season yep and anytime its something like a groin hamstring things like that as Smith misses a three you almost want the player to decide yeah they can be tricky things yep and lingering by the way yeah Smith is trying to guard yeah ly kid you got to throw him the ball yeah 15 to shoot heres Schwarz off a kid screen jumper good twopoint goal for Austin Schwarz maybe not eight for the Freshman Wes its still a ninepoint game and we got lots of time left sure is and Terrence Edwards is back out there again out front Smith clutched on it State McCrae has been the scoring star today for Miami five to shoot here for edricks all he wants is a screen three ball away sure you B absolutely 10 and a half 25 in the game now for Terrence Edwards 49 of Louisvilles 82 belong to he and Rain Smith and the cards trying to get their 11th win in the ACC would be their 18th this year McCrae the Euro on the Baseline and a foul on the way up against Edwards another look at Terrence Edwards but hes just playing with such confidence and that was not terrible defense right there kids stepped up but then dropped back to I mean ly kids got to get his hands up first one from State McCrae is good dont forget to start your Super Bowl Sunday three great womens basketball matchup Stanford at Louisville is at High Noon on ESPN 2 followed by number two South Carolina number four Texas at 200 on ESPN and then at 4 another top 20 match up in the Southeastern Conference Tennessee and LSU the hurri youll be ready for Super Bowl absolutely the Hurricanes havent helped themselves in this half from the free throw line nope they have n 11point lead just ahead of two minutes to go for Pat Kels team Edwards foul out resets with three on Schwarz with the right hand wont go kid the Applause rebound 8271 its stays heres Cleveland trying to back in on rain Smith off the glass and in nine and the half 18 in the game for Matthew Cleveland and thats your textbook definition of a mismatch right there yep hes had five straight games of 20 or more there goes Hadley on the drive very quiet day scoring wise for Hadley yeah but he what hes got 12 yep I mean hes going to have almost his ACC average which is 14 a game theres oach chuku hes going to save it to Schwartz backro guku now heres Cleveland Cleveland on the drive and what do we got an offensive foul Matthew Cleveland Wes while its hard to draw an offensive foul against a guy who is shooting the ball you still can draw a charge if the guy hasnt left his feet yet if hes just dribbling the ball so Cleveland called for his third senior from Atlanta with a minute three to go little the pressure in the back court offered Here by The KES one minute and Rain Smith fouled by Devon oguk as he worked into the front Court second on oach chupu will be the seventh now on Miami with 58 to play well you know you commit the foul theyre in the one andone thats not a bad idea if youre going to try to come back in the game because you need possessions but you do not want to foul rain Smith no not this guy rain Smith who by the way played what is basically Prep basketball in Australia with Tyrese Proctor huh of Duke and last year he was the CAA tournament MVP when Kelsey and the College of Charleston cougars went to their second straight NCA tournament as he hits the first he was second Team all conference averaging 13 points and shooting 39 from three and he had multiple games last year of nine threes and what a drive by uku trayway the rebound and kid saved it to Cleveland Matthew Cleveland going to fire for three and hit and hes got a six straight 20point game now so Cleveland now with 21 on his second three of the day in his ninth field goal quick break in Louis there was Applause Music lard that whole thing you know you talk about net the definition of the net the first word is algorithm Im out okay but uh Joe has been doing this a long time so I will trust him about this but look at that the 14th best strength of schedule this aable team they have beaten some good teams Y and the cards Raleigh on Wednesday at South Bend next Sunday front Court foul on AJ State McCrae will be his third and thats the eighth on the Kings and to get back to our conversation about their team defense yes you want to go to NC State and you want to have your full team with you but I dont think you want to risk the health of Chucky heer the cards have played themselves into a great position we just showed you there on that graphic they dont want to do any more stumbling down the stretch but you got to protect Chucky heper and heres Terrence Edwards at the line oh what a day hes had head cant play much better hell sleep good tonight 26 10 assists for Terrence Edwards and the second one good wow what a performance this is 8876 here goes oach chuku on the drive TR slapped that out gending score the goal for divine Terrence Edwards by the Ways got a season high of 26 seven yep boy tayori takes one step and Kadir is out for the remaining 304 here Miami going to offer some pressure in the back for it its a 10point game still Tori played about 17 minutes he had eight rebounds Waterman not a great free throw shooter kid trying to draw the foul and does first on LY kid crowd doesnt like it theyre ready kind of wrap things up with 22 and A2 to go Pat Kelce you saw a moment ago knows what it means to win Dan I thought I really enjoyed being a kind of a listener of the conversation you guys were having about skip prer this morning Waterman missed the front end all the respect in the world for those guys that work for the late great skip procer huh I mean just a ahead of his time in terms of teaching and communicating huh well without any question but I mean skip proy was one of those guys West when he talked to you he made you feel like you were the only person there you were the most important person around cards are going to win for the 12th time in the last 13 games theyre now 18 six and 11 and two in the ACC in there at least for the moment in second place great to be with Dan Bon thanks to our producer Ben Ward our director Bob Prader
