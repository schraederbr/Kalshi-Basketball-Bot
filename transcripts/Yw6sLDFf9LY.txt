disappointing effort in Raleigh 10 days ago three of four and seven of their last nine and the other night they came from 11 down at halftime to be pit meanwhile Clemson held off pesky Louisville here on Wednesday night Proctor The Freshman runs the offense Jeremy wrote sidelined again for a third straight game the other rookie Whitehead now a fellow freshman Mitchell and heres Proctor on the drive against Galloway traveled with it Wes were going to see two of the best defensive teams in the ACC here today that was a great job by Clemson just moving on defense preventing penetration and the tiger lineup has not deviated since the injury to Alex Hemingway and that means hutter Galloway the transfer from Boston College at 25 years of age Hunter Tyson who he mentioned the sophomore in shefflin and then the junior PJ Hall well and the debate going on right here Wes is where should the possession arrow be pointed and they ruled that Hunter Tyson had the ball after the jump ball and then Duke stole it so since Hunter Tyson had the ball the possession arrow needs to favor Duke and thats what they just got straightened out off the turnover here is Tysons first touch with Mitchell defending Duke opens man to man Applause Clemson does a really good job moving without the basketball they run a lot of set plays Galloway for three front rim Miss Hunter gives the Tigers a second chance saves it to Hall PJ jump hook right over the top of the Blue Devils really a nice drive down the lane West and youre reluctant to come and help because Clemson shoots the three so well Proctor Whitehead Mitchell philipowski Four Freshmen and the grad transfer Ryan young in the lineup for John Shire phillipowski against Hall left it short Tyson will die for it and try to make the save hit the far sideline in front of referee Bert Smith it will stay with the Blue Devils its got to be a little frustrating for Brad Brownell and the Clemson Tigers because every rebound that you have a chance to get against this Duke team you need to grab and Clemson just couldnt control it Mitchell back for Proctor whos done an outstanding job filling roachs leadership role in the last couple of games Whitehead a long three and the rebound for Hall Music BJ Hall a couple of injuries side to land him the offseason and most of last year here is Hunter proctored nice job fighting through there Dan a hunter sort of stumbled a couple of times here early in the game Wes and that ball hit phillipowski on Hunters attempted pass Duke couldnt save it and stay with the tigers with eight to shoot Applause he knows hes getting trouble and I dont think he was trying to throw it off philipowskis arm but he did so a break for the Tigers inbounds it inside Hall is fouled Clemson had to be patient to get the ball in bounds Whitehead commits the person on his first when what power by PJ Hall this is a tough catch on the inside and Wes he does not collect himself he goes straight up in the air if he waits then the defense is able to get in position but as it was the defense is a little off balance and committed the foul had a foot injury at the end of the regular season a year ago an offseason knee injury and knocks down the free throw 79 percent at the line Clemson is the number one freethrow shooting team at ACC play at almost 87 percent look at the top six the Tigers and Blue Devils right there at the front of the line second one on the rim I Wes thats one of the reasons why youre 60 in the ACC you take advantage of your opportunities and Clemsons been getting a lot of them at the free throw line they attack two minutes in here at Little John sellout house watching the Tigers and Blue Devils young with shefflin defending tried to reverse it up couldnt finish tough defense at The Rim heres Hunter Dukes missed its first three shots Galloway had it deflected now shuffling heres Tyson for three off the back iron Tyson shoots 50 percent and ACC play from out there Proctor he drives the offense for Coach Shire Mitchell trying to find a path on Tyson Clemsons really good at cutting off those driving lands young got loose and scores Tigers lost Ryan young at the post he drives easily for Dukes first basket well your post guy drives all the way from the top of the key to the basket yeah dont be surprised you see to both ends today right theres some pretty skilled big guys thats for sure bounce pass Hall jump shot at the foul line PJ Halls got all five tiger points Dan and hes really got a great midrange game West and he can score close to the basket as we saw he can shoot the three but that little jump shot makes him so effective Mitchell thought about the three on Tyson resets on the drive left it on the rim Hall the rebound Brad Brownell out in front of his bench and there goes Hunter he left it on the front of the rim but Brad Brown now not only out in front of his bench hes sprinting down the court yep back door deflected Away by Galloway they go to the deck Brevin tried to make the save and rip it away and were going to get a hell ball and back to your point earlier the hell ball will stay with the Blue Devils all right so thats obviously the change there right at the beginning of the game is important we talked about Clemsons defense and this is a nice job by Galloway to just get his hand on the ball and then this is the kind of thing I think were going to see the entire game these teams are Scrappy tough theyre down on the court after the ball early substitutions both ways Granderson has come on the floor for the Blue Devils middle Brooks and beetle have taken the deck for the Tigers for the first time and theres a foul on shefflin against the philippowski drive Ians first its number one on the Tigers and that that is a hard matchup for Clemson no matter whos playing out there because philipowski is so good with that first dribble he can put that ball down and get by you and shefflin just isnt used to guarding a guy that good with the basketball that far from the basket third tiger substitutions The Freshman RJ Godfrey onto the floor corner for Proctor winding around blocked out of there by beetle four minutes old seven total points so far heres Galloway launching back rim Miss Middlebrooks collects grandison knocked it away skip pass for Tyson he stepped out of bounds and that will get us to a timeout turnover number two on the Tigers but Clemson and Duke are underway at Little John its a threepoint game early ACC Network basketball is presented by Subway Subways upping their game with the AllStar Subway series menu just ordered by name or number Music Brad brownells 13th season at Clemson and the tigers are off to their best start in ACC history and he looks for career win 400 today and they already the Tigers alltime leader in victories and you take Brad Brownell from Evansville Indiana the son of a coach and then you go to the Duke bench and heres the only Duke player with 2 000 or more points 500 rebounds 400 assists 250 threes and 200 steals Dan and John Shire whos done a marvelous job in following his mentor Mike shasheski and thats those are big big shoes to fill and hes really done a nice job so far youre right philipowski turns Godfrey bothers it they battle at the rack RJ the rebound I think he got a push against the Blue Devils Beatle The Look Away middle Brooks The Don what a delivery of the Rock by Josh Beadle and what a great defensive play by Godfrey he actually blocked that ball from philipowski Jalen Blakes on the phone for the first time phillipowski a three rolls in 16th three of the year for the seven foot freshman from West Town New York you know you dont want to give up the dribble penetration but you got to stay a little bit closer to philipowski on that particular play Middlebrooks heres beetle now Hunter Clemson really wants to get it inside Blakes is a tough matchup for Chase Hunter wholl take Blakes on the drive put it up Middlebrooks took it from behind grandison three to shoot out front Beetle Lefty launch Miss Padley twopoint game what a defensive step by the Blue Devils huh Blakes all the way through Middlebrooks blocked it well you can earn your keep going to the basket Dan you better not hope for a whistle West you got to be strong when you get it in there Hunter thought about shooting over the screen hell drive on lively it got deflected out and last touched by the Tigers turnover number three on Clemson Wes Hunter looks to me like hes pressing a little bit here early and that has been a problem but Beetle this in transition a great pass and a great job by middle Brooks to run the floor and this is just a great example of philipowski hes so versatile Godfrey got just a little too far away from him I think hed rather have Blakes driving to the basket than philipowski shooting three coach Shire plays both Lively and philipowski on the floor now with grandison Blakes and also the rookie Mark Mitchells come back out there for the Blue Devils now Duke is very flexible with the lineups that they can play with philipowski on the Drive Godfrey battling got it back scores and draws the foul five for philipowski of the Blue Devil seven and the foul is on RJ Godfrey its his first its the second on the Tigers well Godfreys in the game because they hope that he can handle filipowski out on the perimeter a little bit but thats typical philipowski what you see right there hes got such great balance he misses the shot but he goes right back up and gets the rebound 24 from the floor already couple of rebounds and cant hit the free throw Hunter the rebound Hall and shefflin have come back for Clemson during the timeout so is Galloway Applause BJ out front against lively thats great defense Beetle now 10 to shoot Josh in trouble inside gotta find an outlet turned it over to lively thats just dribbling it into trouble Wes not doing anything against Lively inside four turnovers for Clemson oh Lively almost traveled did travel says Brian OConnell turnover number two on Duke thats a turnover by Duke but Brad Brown that was really upset because thats the one thing you cant do you got to know whos in the game Lively is not going to step out and shoot the long jump shot but he is going to take the ball to the basket for a dunk and they just left him on that screen in role play Chauncey Wiggins has checked into the ball game 610 freshman from Grayson Georgia Wiggins played one minute at Louisville six minutes last Saturday at Pitt Hunter had it rattled out Hall recovers and scores seven for PJ Hall of Clemsons nine I think Chase Hunter has to see the ball go in the basket West to get comfortable offensive foul on philipowski Dan youve been talking about shefflins contributions really at both ends for brownells team but we saw it before that shefflin didnt move his feet properly but this time he does a great job anticipating establishes legal guarding position and hes allowed to move to maintain it as long as he doesnt move toward the dribbler and he just got right in filipowskys path and Wes Im telling you philipowski is going to drive the ball so that is a great defensive play Hunter was shuffling defended by grandison Music here is Wiggins the catch Chauncey inside back out for halls three fell off the back rim Clemson an outstanding threepoint shooting team West but not so far today over for five from out there the Australian freshman Proctor hesitates tried to bounce Lively in against Hall thrown away to shefflin turned over by the Blue Devils almost eight minutes gone first half hard fought ball game as we expected with the Tigers and Blue Devils Hall drives cant score it they crash the glass Lively the rebound Applause Proctor heres Blakes boy Proctor hits some big threes the other night Dan and hes the guys been struggling from threepoint range finished with 145 Blakes trying to reroute with 10 to shoot all the way through heres Mitchell Lefty three at the top good for Mark no its a two Bert Smith says a two for Mark Mitchell ties the game at nine theyll look at it West the timeout so for the moment were tied at nine Hunter now Hall on the Block over the top of lively and draws the foul Derrick Livelys first its the third on Duke and PJ Hall will be at the free throw line when we continue from Little John thank goodness the Tigers have Hall hes got seven under nine early here at home defended by Subway Dan were we thought it might be hard fought it really is a hardfought game here in the first nine minutes Wes we also thought the threepoint baskets are going to end up being a factor Clemson you can see there leads the ACC in conference play in shooting threes and theyre old for five yeah Duke has made one out of two and Duke does not rely as heavily on the three as Clemson does and Duke defensively they are known for their ability to defend out there and theyve done it very well so far BJ Hall to line to shoot a pair of free throws after the first foul on the Philadelphia freshman Derek Lively got us to the timeout philipowski young Mitchell Whitehead and Proctor on the floor for the Blue Devils as Hall misses his second in a row and hes one of his first three Wes weve played almost nine minutes and theres only two Clemson players whove even scored in the game Hall has seven and Middlebrooks has 200 Tyson hasnt scored shuffling Tyson Galloway hutter and PJ Hall picks up his eighth point on his second free throw puts Clemson in front backcourt pressure now offered by the Tigers against this Blue Devil set all they want to do is slow Duke down and they want to make Duke throw the ball back but the Blue Devils didnt they threw it right to the middle of the Court Proctor shooting over the filipowski screen and look at the box out on philipowski by sheffler well Duke had 24 offensive rebounds the other night they only have one so far tonight on the Drive Galloway leaves it for Hall short jumper Falls in 10 for PJ Hall fourth straight double figure game hes got 10 of the 12 yep Clemsons got to figure out a way to get Tyson and Hunter Gorn Whitehead with Galloway defending heres young now Mitchell against Hall Baseline jumper good tough shot nice result for the refreshment from Kansas City Mitchell is the guy who just makes plays he drove PJ Hall off with the dribble and then made a tough shot one point lead for Clemson heres Tyson double clutch to three almost turned it over touched it twice thats a double dribble thats a great turnover on Clemson great recovery by Mitchell yep Mark Mitchell last two ball games averaging a dozen points seven and a half rebounds but Dan I would counter his defenses also helped do conventionally plays West you know he may go for a while and not score any points but then he looked down at the scoresheet and hes got a almost a doubledouble Whitehead a bad Miss puts hunter in transition all the way to the basket and one wow what a move by Hunter for his first points Hunter has showed himself this year West to be so explosive and this time he just gets out in he just gets out in transition and hes very confident that that basically goes right up the back of Mitchell you know if youre Mitchell in that situation you just got to get out of the way it cost him his second foul with 9 38 to play here in the first half and Chase Hunters got a chance to go to the line to cap a threepoint play unless if youre a guy like Mitchell and you think you can line him up for an attempt at a blocked shot then you try that but if youre just going to run Underneath Him you get out of there so you dont get that foul yep middle Brooks has checked in to join shefflin and Tyson and here is Chase Hunter ninth best freethrow shooter in the ACC at 82 percent Applause first points of the game grandison has replaced Mitchell Jacob the other night six points on a pair of Threes against Pittsburgh phillipowski another one rebound from Middlebrooks heres Hunter thought about it philipowski the switch defensively Galloway trying to win on the dribble spins off in breving galloways that was really struggling yeah fourpoint lead for the Tigers young shoots a pass to philipowski they return it on the Block hell turn on shefflin and score thats a great job by Duke to just keep going back inside seven for philipowski of Dukes 13 Applause Hunters eyes of three rebound phillipowski on the box out of shuffling and ACC play Wes Hunter simply has not shot the three very well yep five rebounds for philipowski to go with the seven points here early too Dan heres Whitehead now grandison back to Young with nine to shoot on Middlebrooks and middlebrooks going to get called for the foul here he and Young Applause starting to jockey for position itll cost the 611 sophomore his first third on Clemson Well Middle Brooks hes okay if hes receiving contact but he moves into him yeah you know there is contact there yes but its is it incidental contact well unless one of the guys gets displaced the referees arent going to blow the whistle but when Middlebrooks pushes back and knocks young a couple of feet off his off the block there thats a displacement Dylan Hunter has checked into the ball game for Clemson hes been averaging just under six minutes their last three ball games hes the younger brother of Chase Hunter who by the way he replaced in the lineup for Brad Brown there theres the drive phillipowski young battling for it theyll go to the deck and were going to get a hell ball thatll belong to the Tigers well get a timeout out of all of this tell you what were not counting for the knockdowns here in the first half are we holy smokes 1513 at Clemson well hes been 100 whatever hes trying to do this afternoon Wes hes been the main factor hes got four field goals hes made a couple of free throws hes got three rebounds in the game hes I mean he has basically been the offense for Clemson everybody else has struggled Tigers need some help though Paul had some help Hunter Tyson has yet to score Brevin Galloway has yet to score yeah Chase Hunter had a threepoint play a moment ago and thats thats the only scoring the chase Hunter has done yeah Dylan Hunter the younger brother on the floor now for the tigers with shefflin Galloway Hunter Tyson and PJ Hall and backcourt pressure offered at least early by the Blue Devils on The Possession and run time off the clock here theres 20 seconds on the 30second shot clock in Clemson just getting into the offense they turn it over Galloway turned it over trying to find Tyson turnover number six on Clemson and Proctor gets it inside to Young phillipowski lost it on the way up and so Duke kind of gives it right back Wes young is looking to pass when he gets the ball inside I think if he Powers it up right there he probably gets a gets fouled and goes to the line for two maybe even a threepoint play Galloway heres Hall long three oh look out 13 for Hall but Hall and ACC play shoots 42 percent from out there you cannot give him that much room Whitehead nice move behind the back terrific basket for the freshman Derek Whitehead is special wow Music Galloways out there thinking whered he go yep heres sheplin around the post against philipowski and reversed it back up and in first points for Ian sheffler and Runner went back Wes fivepoint game six and a half to play philipowski grandison back to philipowski returns for Grandersons three Off the Mark Young the rebound second chance for the Blue Devils and Ryan Young on the board for the second time young just beat PJ Hall that time to the basket halls trying to block him out they got tangled up and he fell down and thats the first time that Duke has con you know converted an offensive rebound theres Hall setting the screen for Hunter PJ feeling it again nope background Miss Applause Blue Devils Come Away With It Proctor with Galloway defending Applause Whitehead working against Dylan Hunter heres Proctor trying to beat Galloway on the drive into traffic fouled and the basket for Tyrese Proctor first points of the game for the Freshman the foul will be on Brevin Galloway itll be his first its the fourth on the Tigers but this is just a powerful move to the basket here good quickness and West what did we say you cant be looking for the referee to blow the whistle you got to go and be strong in there and Proctor not only got the foul but he gets to go to the free throw I got the basket but he gets to go to the freethrow line as well he has been really impressive over the last couple games well and its all coming the wake of Jeremy roachs toe injury in the reaggravation of that hes missing today there is roach the Junior from Leesburg Virginia John Shire would hope to have him back in the lineup would like to have him back a week from Saturday against Miami at Cameron Blue Devils dont play during the week in the ACC slate coming up tied at 20 heres Chase Hunter trying to get to the basket knocked out by Whitehead it was 10 to shoot it stays with the Tigers well Hunter Tyson so far has had no room at all and and Galloway and Chase Hunter seemed to be they have to relax in the game a little bit Hunter Tyson front rim missile long three with Whitehead defending but hes been making those weapons sure has tough first half for Hunter Tyson heres Proctor backing out against Godfrey hes got a mismatch inside yeah sure do phillipowskis got Dylan Hunter around him theres a three ball and Proctors feeling it six in a row now for Tyrese Proctor and Dukes in front for the first time by three Timeout on the floor taken by the Tigers here sixth straight by Proctor the conventional threepoint play and then a threepoint shot from the left wing Duke by three on an 80 run the JMA Wireless Dome tonight Notre Dame and Syracuse Jay alter Malcolm Huckabee stand by for our coverage at seven oclock Eastern time on acc Network and always available to you on the ESPN app be hardpressed to find 40 minutes of basketball as intense as what weve seen here early unfolding at Clemson West this has really been intense and Dukes defense has done a great job Hunter Tyson has only attempted two shots he just hasnt had any room and they have made both Chase Hunter and Brevin Galloway looked very uncomfortable inbounds to Dylan Hunter who plays with his older brother Tyson Hall and RJ Godfrey who handles at the top entry for PJ Hall against loudly over the top of lively for PJ Hall wow what a tough shot that is I cant tell you how tough a shot that is thats a seven foot shot blocker 2322 and a long three goes begging off the arm of whiteheads Hunter front Court Music somebody else though Dan is needed for Brownells team here cant be just 24 can it Miss badly there s Blakes trying to find an alley for lively the catch the shot and the foul RJ Gottfried I think just picked up his second he did so Mitchell and Godfrey are the two players in the ball game for Duke and Clemson respectively with a pair and a couple of free throws for Derek Lively coming up Wes one of the key things in this game obviously is you cant turn it over but another thing is you cant take bad shots and that time PJ Hall thought that he had a mismatch inside against Proctor but when philipowski came over to double team Halls got to recognize that three ball from Proctor whos feeling it now Tyrese Proctor has opened things up hes got nine straight for the Blue Devils Wesson going into that pit game he was shooting with three very poorly sure was hes helped Duke to a fourpoint lead not anymore heres Hunter got Lively in the air heres Tyson cant pull the trigger on philipowski shefflin will spins out hes not the guy you want shooting threes heres Whitehead dumps to Lively for the dunk great ball movement first field goal for Derek Lively and Bert Smiths going to call time out here media timeout will take it the under four just lead to this first half here with 319 to go and Dan John shires team playing with a lot of boys here on the road in a tough environment today yes they certainly are and they have done a couple of really good things weve said they defended the three pretty well Clemson is one for ten and this is the leading threepoint shooting team in the ACC ENT but youre also getting a terrific effort from Tyrese Proctor here in the last few minutes well Proctors made two threes West coming into this game in ACC play he made a total of five were shooting 25 percent from out there yep hes got eight here in just a matter of moments its a big part of that run and now some backcourt pressure for Hunter to have to deal with against Blakes this is a huge last three minutes for the Clemson Tigers feels like it right Hunter Tyson still scoreless in this first half lob for Hall against Lively who blocked it Derek gladly wins one there after Hall got him earlier you know you go against the seven foot shot blocker that happens sometimes yep now heres Proctor Tyrese gets Galloway lob Lively the catching flush four for Derrick Lively largest lead now its eight here at the tail end of the first half for the Blue Devils Hunter and a foul will be called and it will be on Jalen Blakes Blakes is the latest and long line of defensive stoppers on the perimeter for Duke Applause and its been the Duke defense thats been the key they finally got their offense out of low gear Clemsons offense is still stuck there yep heres Tyson coming off a couple screens cant get him the ball its Galloway instead trying to find a spot in traffic skips for shuffling attacking philipowski back for Galloway rings the bell 263 of the year for Brevin Galloway whos had double figures in the last three seems like a big basket for Brownells team he gets a huge basket for Clemson and great ball movement they move the defense around they didnt try to force anything Proctor Wheels it back out with 15 to shoot grandison filipowski turning on shefflin follows his own Miss Wes how many times have we seen him do that he misses his shot but he stays his balance is so good he goes right back up and gets his own rebound for his size hes a terrific athlete hes now got nine in the first half heres Hall inside tried to score and does and draws the foul from Lively second on Derrick Lively will be the sixth on Duke West suddenly thats an outstanding battle in there yep really is its a really good pass by shefflin and a nice job by by PJ Hall that time to collect himself the last time I think when he went at Lively he was off balance but that time he got his balance use that big strong body of his 17 in the first half for PJ Hall Music make it 18 Dan when hes a hundred percent now hes one of the five best players in this league I dont think theres any question about that Wes big sequence for the Tigers they cut the Duke advantage to four we step aside in Little John Here Comes Miami to Reynolds Coliseum at six and then how about number 16 Duke and number 22 North Carolina Carmichael Arena heck of a double header for you womens basketball on acc Network and always available on the ESPN app terrific first half for PJ Hall Dan but got to get some help here huh but he does and you know if youre the Duke Blue Devils youre playing against Clemson theyre very well balanced offensive deep you got to give up something they havent given up any threes Proctor misses kept alive middle Brooks Tyson finally collects you know and they they have defended Hunter Tyson Drew up top Hunter Tyson hasnt hurt them chase Hunter hasnt hurt them heres middle Brooks Chase Hunter into traffic back out for Galloway final minute of this first half Galloway on the drive high off the glass and air boy thats a tough shot sure he is Duke lead is two down low philippowski thatll be an offensive foul thats two on philipowski seven on the Blue Devils Wesley Im telling you yeah I dont know that Ive seen anybody wind up like philipowski does gets the ball he turns and hes going right to the basket again does a really good job getting himself in position and philipowski just leveled it they did and the charge drawn by shefflin just fires up the house at Littlejohn its a its a huge house West and that run by Duke really took the crowd out of the game but theyre back in it now unless we said the last three minutes was going to be really important for Clemson and theyve responded heres Tyson still hadnt scored exactly Hunter thought about it spot up jumper back rim Granderson to miss with 30 seconds to play Duke can hold for the final shot and it looks like John shires setting his team to do that theyve got some foul trouble theyre going to have to deal with in the second half Clemsons only got five team fouls and heres Proctor with 11 seconds to go shot clocking game clock pretty congruent grandison thought about the three now for Blakes hell launch and was he fouled he was a whistle on Brevin Galloway that will send Jalen Blakes to the line to shoot three wow Applause its the second on Galloway and the sixth on Clemson you know he hits him on the way up West hes trying to put his hand there you just get your hand up Blakes the first Applause dont forget weve got great action all over the ACC footprint hashtag all the devotion put it on your socials when you attend an ACC event and you may see it on acc Network s hit both free throws heres the Third Applause and its no good sheplin with one second launches and offline and Duke will take a fourpoint lead to the locker room at 3430 Blue Devils got a flurry from philipowski a flurry from Proctor Clemson got pretty strong 20 minutes out of PJ Hall Dan to stay with it four and we got great intensity from each of these teams well this has been very entertaining stay tuned Kelsey Riggs is next Joel Berry Luke Hancock and the Blue Devil Hall of Famers for the Clemson offense all year long with the exception of PJ Hall they just havent shown up tonight and still Clemson only Trails by Four Points Duke will have the ball to start second half starters for both schools who began the ball game start this last 20 minutes here at Little John Coliseum Clemson 60 143 off to their best ACC start ever phillipowski offensive foul John Shire thought shiflin might have been moving phillipowski picks up his third to start the half West hes allowed to move once you establish legal guarding position you can move side to side or you can move backwards as long as you dont move in to the dribbler and philipowskis just got to learn that you cannot lower that shoulder and try to Bull through there shuffling down the hall young defends PJ Whitehead coming to help on the double team got to find somebody traveled with it thats a really good job because the guy they left was Ian shefflin yeah and sheflins not going to hurt you from out on the perimeter seventh turnover by Clemson remember they had a flurry of them early and kind of calmed down a little bit now each schools giving it away on their opening possession Russ I think with Clemson having to battle back in the first half the way they start the second half is going to be very important three ball from out on the right no good for Mitchell knocked out of their last Touch by the Blue Devils in philippowski for the most part Clemson has done a pretty good job with their defensive boards Duke has four offensive rebounds two of them by philipowski collecting his own misses wow Brad Brownell pretty candid with us this morning when he said look we dont rebound were not we dont have a chance Dukes that good at that particular discipline and John Shire knows it was a huge Factor Wednesday night against Pittsburgh especially in the second half when the Blue Devils came from 11 down how about Tyson sliding through first basket for Hunter Tyson comes with 19 minutes to go in the ball game that almost missed because I think he was so surprised thats as open as hes been Mitchell in the lane kick for Proctor back rim Miss of a three Galloway had it it got slapped around here is philipowski trying to clean it up they scramble off the Miss there Dukes got a new 20 third chance for the Blue Devils philipowski on the drop down bounds fouled by Hall no shuffling beg your pardon second on Ian shefflin the first of the half on Clemson Wes you were just talking about it the offensive rebounding if youre Clemson and youve got the chance to get the ball you got to get it chuckling comes over and trying to block the shot Whitehead turns air ball the short jumper hutter tried to beat Whitehead down the floor now hell spin him through a little soft Runner philipowski the rebound I Hunter again hes just a little loose with the basketball just looks like hes trying to go too fast out there young to phillipowski wide open for the hammer 11 now for Kyle filipowski thank you weve lost the ball that ball will end up the dunk was so hard one of our camera folks took a header in the end zone philipowski just running the court nobody finds him theres a rebound away from his eighth DoubleDouble would be a second in a row Hall heres Tyson driving by Whitehead for the dunk Id like to welcome Hunter Tyson to Little John Coliseum Tyson has in the this half West he has started out very aggressively you just have to be hard to guard you cant stand around and let people defend you young trying to find a seam on Hall now Whitehead off a young screen back door cut scoop and score for Ryan young but he can really catch it in traffic that was a very difficult pass third field goal for young fourpoint Duke Lee hutter skip for shuffling last time Hall touched that there was a double team heres PJ squaring and scoring 20 for Hall on his eighth field tiger when he scored 18 in the opening 20 minutes here today Whitehead had it poked away Proctor underhand scoop philipowskis three young the rebound lost it itll belong to Clemson grandison will get to reek Whiteheads spot meanwhile PJ halls trying to pick up where he left off in the first half well you notice they leave and so that gives PJ Hall thats the old Jack Sigma move there that reverse pivot and the short jump shot yeah okay the kids can Google Jack Sigma its sikma turned over by the Tigers in the half court and Brad Brown now its turned over because Hunter Tyson did not make the back door cut that Galloway Saul was there and again I think Tysons got to be aggressive on the offensive end Mitchell heres young Duke protecting a twopoint lead Proctor back for young turned over sheplin had it scooped up on the giveaway heres Mitchell and Duke was 17 to shoot inside phillipowski scores tough shot 13 now for philipowski West and yet another situation where the Tigers had an opportunity to grab the ball and they couldnt and Duke makes him pay for it Paul Burns a dribble shefflin right back to PJ challenged Young no whistle rebound on the backside philipowski and the Blue Devils thats a tough shot yep really really intense ball game here out front grandison Proctor behind the back slides down the lane the scoop can score with a right hand 11 for Tyrese Proctor on his fifth field goal West the Tigers had a chance to tie the game and theyve turned it over and then they got a defensive stop and they couldnt control the ball and Dukes made him pay every time yeah the details heres Hunter hes got to try and get on track here in the half and that rims out from three Applause been a struggle filipowskis got his eighth double double with the rebound at the defensive end of the floor Duke led by as many as eight in the first half its six here with five minutes gone young fouled as he got to the rim thatll get us to a timeout here at Little John Coliseum the struggle is real here tonight but its been a struggle in ACC play but hes done such a good job of directing the offense but the threepoint shooting hasnt followed because the threepoint shooting hasnt followed West and unfortunately tonight the overall shooting hasnt followed hes only made one field goal one for eight he just cant seem to get comfortable and one of the reasons is the Duke defense has really been pressuring him hard so the Blue Devils will have Ryan young at the freethrow line where hes 82 percent as we rejoin you from Little John Coliseum in a sellout house watching the 147th meeting all time between the tigers and the Blue Devils Applause dont forget every Thursday night on acc network is ladies night this week Diamond Johnson number 11 NC State visit Haley Cavender in

the ball hard and he goes right by good screen by Middlebrooks and Lively just had too far to come ball hit the board Dukes hit four of their last five heres Proctor sixpoint lead for the Blue Devils philipowski Applause Music Applause 12 to shoot Proctor looking for some help skips for filipowski three from the right no good and the rebound for Beetle and a foul called on grandison Jacob grandison who plays in his 142nd Collegiate game tonight draws his first second on Duke a really good view of shefflin dropping down in to prevent the drive and and thats just good scrap by Beetle you know if he doesnt hustle after that ball thats another offensive rebound for Duke theres Galloway trying to get in on Proctor slapped out by loudly Galloway stuck with it loudly goaltended the third field goal for Brevin Galloway well he got to compliment Galloways persistence here taking it into the middle phillipowski actually blocked it the first time and that clearly was going down so nice response by Clemson four in a row now they got to get a stop yeah courtesy of lively foreign Proctor behind the shoulder pass grandison missed the three shuffling beat Lively to the basket Applause Music shefflin backing down on lively heres middle Brooks now I thought he was going Galloway now he does at the top heres Brevin wrapping around two screens entry from Middlebrooks eight to shoot takes it in on philipowski up strong couldnt score it got the rebound back tried to take it back up draws the foul and Grandersons drawn another one his second its the third second half foul on Duke well this is really good scrap by Middlebrook that is a great pivot to get to the basket and then just like philipowski hes able to go and get his own rebound I actually thought Wes hes there in a big crowd and Hunter Tyson was all alone beyond the threepoint Arc first of the free throws from Middlebrooks is good to show you what Just Player Development means a year ago Ben Middlebrooks played nine minutes a game against the ACC average 22 rebound this year hes playing 14 minutes in conference play Dan hes averaging Five Points and three rebounds thats just simple freshman sophomore Player Development no question Wesson hes really been a valuable such a valuable guy because he gives PJ Hall the ability to rest a little bit six in a row by Clemson cuts it to two Whitehead around the philippowski screen heres Proctor 10 to shoot Proctor got caught heres Whitehead over shefflin bounds away Tyson the rebound saved it to beat him tigers can tie with a two lead with a three Applause Beetle the spin inside challenge score oh my goodness timeout Duke eight nothing run by Brownells tigers and the last field goal courtesy of Agent Zero Applause well with Dan Bonner West Durham ACC basketball presented by Subway here at Littlejohn we talked about rebounding being a huge point of emphasis really for both schools coming in ironic offensive rebounds are six each all right each teams a good rebounding team Wes and one of the things weve been talking about you can see Hunter Tyson there alongside Mark Mitchell and one of the reasons that Hunter Tyson is struggling today is Mark Mitchell Mitchell has been matched up against him on the defensive end most of the game Tariq White had a little bit as well but those guys have really created some difficulty on the offensive end for Hunter Tyson Lebowski calling for the ball against sheplin takes it in right hand move fell off the rim got it back and score 15 for philipowski thats his third offensive Rebound in the third time hes rebounded his own Miss already the DoubleDouble with 15 and 12 Galloway tried to go back door to Tyson got knocked on the ground theyre going to scrum for the ball and what are we going to get here we got middle Brooks and philipowski and what do we have out of this jump ball jump ball possession will belong to Clemson Clemson yes well take a break twopoint lead for Duke on the second chance points from philipowski back after this Jay alter and Malcolm Huckabee in a Saturday United well Im gonna have to get used to that JMA Wireless Dome all right I think you can handle it Clemsons going to have it on alternating possession remember we went to the timeout with a scrum underneath the tiger basket and Ben Middlebrooks is in the middle of the scrum Middlebrooks has really helped Clemson Chase Hunter back in the game hell put it in play heres Hunter Tyson and theres Mark Mitchell and there is shefflin feeding Middlebrook strong to the basket offensive foul called theyre going to wave It Off Brian OConnell I think is going to tag Middlebrooks here crowd not going to like this at all and I think the question is the discussion I think is number one was he in the restricted area its a block now and one for Middlebrooks well Applause so the foul is on Young not the charge on Middlebrooks Applause so middle Brooks to try and put the Tigers in front does clearly young is in the restricted area but young in that particular situation he was middlebrooks Defender hes not a secondary Defender yeah Clemson in front on the conventional threepoint play Beetle knocked it away young had it and he was tripped and theres the foul on middle Brooks no its on uh yeah Ben Im right his second third on Clemson the Duke foul was on young it was his first there the ball squirts loose and Young EST has such great hands with us there he does the balls anywhere near him hes going to get it grad student with two years of Eligibility left in Durham Proctor beetle has been a factor here in the half for the Tigers Blakes with five to shoot spot up over shefflin good tough shot first field goal for Jalen Blakes Blakes is not in the game to give him offense but boy he can provide it hes had a couple of 17point games this year hes got four thats his first field goal remember he was fouled on the three at the end of the half heres Hunter he lost it middle Brooks tried to clean it up young blocked it Duke out of there with the scramble Wes how many times have we seen Chase Hunter like slip slide around tonight Blue Devils the one point lead Proctor sets for a three front rim Miss shefflin knocked to the deck phillipowski back cleanly with the offensive rebound and basket 17 for Kyle filipowski I couldnt tell whether that was Mitchell or young in there for Duke that kept that ball alive oh Music heres Middlebrooks tried to get it to Tyson well defended now hunter in the traffic and cant find it Dan this is just nothing doing for Chase Hunter tonight clean look Tigers Trail three 14 rebounds now for philipowski Blakes Music Applause Music another sophomore from New Jerseys got Hunter defending another fall away two and Tyson had a shot Mitchell got the cameraman scores Dukes now got what their last three baskets on the offensive offensive rebounding thats right Wes and again Tyson Hunter Tyson had a chance to grab it and he didnt Timeout on the floor taken by Brad Brownells Club with 9 31 to go duke has pushed it back to a fivepoint Advantage wow Duke withstood that run by Clemson Clemson came back from an eightpoint deficit and eventually took the one point lead and now weve got a great response from the Duke Blue Devils and Wes you know we talked with Brad Brownell this morning and he was very concerned about the offensive rebounding and Clemson in this particular half West its not that they havent blocked out its when theyve had the opportunity to grab the ball they havent done it yep Blue Devils on a sixnothing run tigers have gone scoreless in the last two minutes its an 87 rebound second half for filipowski and here are the one in two teams in conference play in rebound margin and Duke now has got a two rebound advantage on Clemson at 2826 here with 9 30 to go but the key is the recent rebounds by Duke West have turned into baskets for the Blue Devils Second Chance points are 128 Dan in this ball game Music and it was 86 Clemson at halftime yep beetle is back on the floor with Galloway shefflin PJ hall now after a break and Hunter Tyson well again PJ Hall theyve got to limit his minutes Tyson for three out front Rim Miss they Scramble for it Hall had a crack at it knocked it over the inline out of bounds it will go to the Blue Devils the hall was blocked out by three different guys yep Tyson couldnt ask for a better Lookout now no but there havent been many free looks though there have not been and you get the idea that Hunter Tyson when you finally get a wide open look maybe a hurry a little bit because you dont go youre not sure how long its going to be for the defense gets there young working against Hall and trying to direct a little traffic along the way heres Mitchell trying to beat Tyson Baseline Mark Mitchell put it on the rim tried to keep it alive and sheflins out of there with it did keep it alive Wes but Clemsons finally able to secure that one Galloway floater with a right hand spins around and drops in not sure if he had a few more cracks hed make it but he gave that one that is a tough tough shot nothing to do about that if you do Blakes Baseline rebound Tyson six rebounds for Hunter Tyson shefflin in traffic dumps at the hall left hand 22 now for PJ Hall Dan definitely looks like hes got a problem with a groin muscle Proctor all the way through and he scores what a shot 13 now for Tyrese Proctor Duke by three how do you keep him out of the lane Galloway Music tried to go inside and knocked to the ground Hall and we get a foul out of there on the Blue Devils and it is on Ryan Young oh PJ hall now Clemsons leading scorer hes got 22 Tigers Trail three at Little Talk the longer term picture of this game Duke Joe Lunardis got him as a five seed this morning hes got Clemson in as a 10 hit a winner today in Atlanta Wake Forest playing tonight at Boston College Virginia Tech you know the struggles Mike Youngs team had the weekend off well Wes this is what youre looking at now your inconference play youre in the middle of it the heat of it youre looking for good wins and this would be a great win for Clemson not only to validate everything theyve done so far of course losing wouldnt invalidate what theyve done so far yeah but this and theyre theyre in this game theyre three points down despite the struggles by Hunter Tyson and Chase Hunter heres Beetle trying to drive it back hall right hand over Young well he hadnt struggled 24 now for PJ hall four off his career high Tigers to within one they tried to go back door turned over heres beetle through traffic shuffling skip Galloway thought about it drives put it up blocked out of bounds by Young itll stay with the Tigers that was pretty good transition defense by Duke and this is Galloway with the drive and again hes tried to force it a couple of times Paul against young in traffic heres beetle for the lead Paul the rebound stolen by Mitchell this is a guy who just makes plays yep sure does The Freshman from Kansas City has had a terrific game and only has three field goals philipowski with shefflin Proctor a long three Miss badly Applause Galloway three for the lead youre right Mr Bonner I shouldnt drive it anymore Ill just stand out here and watch thats a confident shooter Wes philipowski pull up on sheplin air ball Brooks into the game for Hall what about grevin Galloway Dan well I mean this is a confident guy hes got an open look hes struggled shooting the ball today but he knocks that one down a very good screen by PJ Hall a dozen for Galloway beetle out front middle Brooks Galloway again look out twerks through fourpoint lead for Clemson five in a row by Brevin Galloway and John Shire wants a timeout dont forget tonight following our coverage from the JMA Wireless Dome of the iris and orange its nothing but neck Kelsey Riggs with national champions around the table Carlos Boozer Luke Hancock Joel Berry full highlights analysis interviews and more coming up that follows Syracuse Notre Dame tonight on acc network and on the ESPN app big win today in overtime for Kevin Keats in NC State Carolina a winner at Louisville pit a winner on the road at Georgia Tech as was Virginia at Florida State Dan this league is delivering competitive games yes it certainly is well fifth time Duke has played a 60 ACC team in the last 30 years they are one and three in those games its amazing that people keep stats like that yeah well youre talking about Jack Sigma hes not a stat hes a guy out of the timeout taken by John Shire s philipowski on the drive against sheplin and loudly got it saved it to Whitehead Second Chance opportunity for the Blue Devils you get that drive into the lane you caused the defense to collapse that creates rebounding opportunities Proctor had it deflected Whitehead out front lost it fouled Galloway third on Brevin Galloway fourth on Clemson in the half West you know Kyle filipowski has a double double today as you get a look at this foul here I dont know if anybody can complain about that but Im telling you Ian shefflin has been has battled the entire game and is having a heck of a ball game for Clemson Mitchell twice offensive Second Chance basket for Mark Mitchell gives him a Duke to within two and Wes how many times have we seen that both from Mitchell and philipowski they missed their shot and get their own rebound who do these guys think they are Moses Malone unbelievable isnt it middle Brooks Whitehead tried to help on the Hedge heres Galloway Dukes got 14 Second Chance points Galloway from the Paul Applause nice feeling it that was a heat check but hes allowed a heat check Proctor philipowski Shoots for the lead kepalad middle Brooks Galloway recovers really good job by middle Brooks to tip it away from Lively what Clemson would do maybe for a hunter Tyson basket here Dan huh Galloway will try Middlebrook slapped it out of bounds and he got called for a foul and he got called for going over the back I believe a proctor third on Middlebrooks five now on Clemson Wes and you its youre talking about the fact that they could use a hunter Tyson basketball Tyson cant get open yeah but thats a great job by Proctor get in there Livelys in there but Proctor drops in to help out Tyrese Proctor handles against Josh beetle on the drive shoots strong phillipowski the rebound put it back up falcon John Shar came firing off the Duke bench theres the foul on Middlebrooks its his fourth with 357 to play so free throws when we come back the low of the Marquee players in the league Hunter Tyson and Kyle phillipowski both have been proficient in double doubles phillipowski has got his DoubleDouble today its been a bit of a struggle though for Tyson it has been for Tyson West hes got four points but hes only taken five shots he just has been a nonfactor today and the credit for that goes to the Duke defense and the other thing were talking about with we talked about with the Duke rebounding they have eight offensive rebounds here in the second half and philipowskis at the line right now because Proctor even though he didnt get credit for an offensive rebound he tipped his missed shot so Duke could recover 18 now for philipowski on his first free throw of the day and two tries now to tie the game and it spins out recover Galloway Chase Hunters on the floor with Galloway Hall Tyson and shefflin original starters for Brad Brownell back door cut Tyson the catch it fell off the iron Mitchell bothered it Mitchell did bother it and Tyson knew he was there thats a good play by Clemson though to get him open Proctor to phillipowski Beyond his reach turned over to Clemson hotter heres Hall Galloways been a threat here Chase Hunter slow to let the screen develop for PJ Hall back for hunter in a deep three tap follows sheplin he battles for it last touch Lively it will stay with the Tigers shufflings not flashy but he is good Dan well he really battles this is a great job getting position inside he gets the inside position tips it but cant get it to go but hangs in there against two bigger guys Chase Hunters one for 10 today heres Hall squaring on lively nine to shoot PJ slips it to sheplin five on the shot clock inside scores okay maybe he is flashy Wes I was just thinking thats not the guy you want to have the ball at the end of the shot clock but I was wrong Proctor off the Lively screen offensive foul oh its a block with sheplin in the restricted Zone Applause well Wes hes outside the restricted area but that doesnt mean that that wasnt uh that wasnt a block schifflin shefflin I think was a little slow getting over there and I dont think he established his position before Proctor left the floor Proctor is 89 at the line hes 3337 on the year the West shefflin is in the middle of everything Applause two shots Applause and last touched by Hall says Brian OConnell Applause I beg your partner was a one and one on the Proctor attempt 20 to shoot for Duke on a reset foreign wanted to foul didnt get the whistle 209 to go in Galloway against Whitehead Applause heres Hunter Hall fought about the three on young now Tyson Galloway on the drive and one um Russ Galloway just gets the lane and nobody steps in to stop him philipowski just waved at him as he went by Applause first free throws of the day for Galloway foreign 17 in the ball game for Galloway Mitchell lost it pumps and ball back from Middlebrooks now Duke of pressure now Brevin Galloway Applause what a second half for him huh and Clemson needs it yeah hes got hes got 12 of those points have come in the second half West yep pressure by the Blue Devils and the Hunter back for Tyson into the front court goes Clemson Applause Hall PJ almost traveled with it Duke thought he did heres shuffling on philipowski Ian in traffic scooped it up and it went in my goodness eightpoint lead 120 to go and a hand checked foul on Hunter Tommy Morrissey tickets Hunter for his first eighth on Clemson one and one coming up as I said before that even though filipowskis had a big game shuffling his playing as hard as you can ask a person to play and here theres hes not intimidated at all he just takes it against the big guy and somehow Wiggles in there to get a basket chaplain has been fabulous despite the fact that the guy hes guarding has a doubledouble young is out grandison has come back for Duke foreign Proctor at the line one and one for the Freshman from New South Wales free throw good five in the half 14 in the ball game for Tyrese Proctor well young is out because youre looking for quicker guys and youre looking for threepoint shooters and the free throws from Proctor allowed Duke to slip into the pressure here Mitchell will defend the inbounds pass its a sixpoint game and Brian OConnell on the whistle here Applause and Music lets see what happened here Im not quite sure what the Applause something with the clock yeah so a couple seconds 117 is what he wants on the clock yep thats what happened youll see that the uh clock may have lost a couple seconds yep thats what happened in bounds heres Galloway double team Brevin trying to get out of it in trouble fights through into the front court goes Clemson double team again cutter bounces to Galloway quickly to Tyson heres Hall and a foul on phillipowski and John Shire was not looking for filipowski to foul and that is seven on Duke with a minute one to go and its the fourth on philipowski and PJ Hall at the line hes got 24 today and a 11 here Dan Wes I I have to say that was a great job by the officials by Brian OConnell to recognize that that the two seconds went off the clock nobody else would have known it I mean they have so much that they have to pay attention to Applause heres Hall before you throw good so lepowskis got four Mitchell young grandison Lively two each but the problem for Duke isnt the fouls at the moment its the fact that its been a while since theyve scored a field goal Applause second one from Hall 20 6 now for PJ Hall and hes out Middlebrooks plays with four hes in Duke has not scored in 406 from the floor and well you Wes you remember in that Boston College game they went on a long field goal drop they were able to come back and win that one middlebrooks playing with four Proctor of three background Miss Long rebound battle four Tysons got it Brooks has just fouled out Ben Middlebrooks is going to foul out with seven points with 479 left to go on Clemsons ninth team foul boy this is quite the scramble here he nearly runs him over yep hes hes another guy Wes whos had a really good game second time middle Brooks is fouled out first time in Conference Point I think were looking at a clock situation here yep Proctor will go back to the line now I take that back Wes they were looking to see who was the person who got fouled that was proctored yeah it was Proctor yep so this will be a one and one for Proctor on the ninth foul against Clemson middle is standing over there telling PJ Hall that he cant come in the game yet because its uh theres two fouls and Brad brownells saying you got five fouls and so the referees get him out of the game yep one and one for Proctor got it Tyrese is now hit three in a row and Middlebrooks is out Galloway and shefflin three each seven point Clemson lead Ive got a block out here made them both presses on again for the Blue Devils Applause inbounds to putter Chase will bounce it front Court heres Tyson and a Duke foul and its on philipowski and that is five on Kyle filipowski so Kyle filipowski the terrific freshman fouls out for the second time this year and for the first time in ACC play well Wes he played really hard you cant ask ask the young man to do much more than he did today nope 18 points 14 rebounds and here is Hunter Tyson at the line the third best free throw shooter in the ACC on the eighth foul against Duke one thing Ill say about philipowski West he had those 18 points but on 22 field goals first one by Tyson is good hes got five as were talking about was philipowski he scored 18 points but again he took 22 shots because Ian shefflin made it really difficult sure did for him second one back room Miss seven point game now you got to defend the three now Proctor Galloway trying to help knocked it away Proctor is gonna drive and feed young and what do we got offensive foul Proctor on the drive how about that chase Hunter Dan ninth foul on Duke no free throws on player controls well Proctor drives into the lane and Clemson does a really nice job covering up these areas and look how far Proctor flies through the air you got a jump stop in there to make the pass into Hunter theres a double team and another Duke foul thats on Blakes so Jalen Blake draws his second that is 10 on Duke so two shots on the common foul in the final 306 well Duke you know theyve done a really good job holding teams under their scoring average but Clemson looks like theyre going to get to theirs in ACC play today John shires got one timeout left Hunters got his fourth point in conference play Hunter comes in shooting 2830 from the line so hes a guy you like to have there both of them and again Wes if youre Clemson all youre doing is defending the three heres Proctor against beetle step back fires and misses badly Blakes recovers and thats a block called on sheplin Applause and Ian sheplin draws his fourth that is 10 on Clemson with 189 left but were going to have a pair of free throws here were going to have a pair of free throws and again Duke is having a hard time excuse me Clemsons having a hard time securing that defensive rebound and shuffling just you know once needs you have to establish your position and then you cant slide once the guy who refuses the ground you have to have that established before the guy leaves the ground so the foul on shuffling his fourth and Duke I believe has taken their last time out here no theres still one time out left no the officials are going over the clock right thank you real quick let me remind you those of you looking for Syracuse Notre Dame tonight with Jay alter and Malcolm Huckabee its going to start for you on the ESPN app and we will get you to Central New York on a Saturday night as soon as were done here at Little John Coliseum and Dan weve talked about how big this Saturday would be in the ACC the Miami NC State renewal of a terrific game the first time wolf pack wins that Miami 52 Virginia win today theyre 52 sos pitted 52 Duke trying to join them Clemson trying to get to 70 well West Clemson has never been 60 in the ACC so obviously there have been 70 in the ACC Music ENT this has been a fun League oh yeah 21 and a half to play is where we settled on the clock our ACC basketball presented by Subway here is Jalen Blakes first of two no good all right weve got to block out second one by the Lakes is good that allowed Duke to press Blake says five in the game now eightpoint game with 215 left inbounds heres Hunter Chase fires across the floor Beatles breaks the timeline heres Tyson Duke has to foul and Mitchell will and Hunter Tyson will go to the line on Mitchells third foul with 123 to go and the sellout crowd at Littlejohn has been treated to one of the best games the ACC state so far this year I dont think theres any question about that Wes and if you doubted Clemson just understand that West they came back in this game they were down eight a couple of times and they came back in this game and theyre going to win with subpar performances from Hunter Tyson a subpar performance from Chase Hunter but they got great contributions Off the Bench from Middlebrooks from Beetle and Ian shefflin I mean what more can you say about him Brad Brownell has talked a lot about the depth and the chemistry of his basketball team and you saw all those cards today come into play here Applause second one good its a 10point game seven points for Hunter Tyson Proctor deep three and were gonna get a whistle and a foul on Hunter under the basket with 51 left Music Applause keep an eye on Chase Hunter and Ryan young say center right in the middle I would say thats a foul and Youngs free throw good Applause five and a half for young nine in the ball game second foul on Chase Hunter listen all you have to do here is get it inbound right because you dont have to worry about advancing the ball and Clemson is going to go to 70 they are 153 and the final is 7264 and Brad Brownells 400th career win Dan well West and how appropriate can it be Brad brownells always based everything on his defense they helped Duke without a field goal for the last five minutes and seven seconds of this game so the Tigers win
