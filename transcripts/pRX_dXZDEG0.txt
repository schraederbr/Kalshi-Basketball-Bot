years in each of his first 27 games of the season thats something to watch today yeah and it was a very emotional game obviously the win against Duke at home and uh you know he left a lot on the floor there and sure he would have liked to have slid over a few points to the Notre Dame game but uh they need that good consistent effort out of him first possession belongs to the hookies and baron turns it over trying to find K inside stolen by Fon Reed Salis looking for his offense early and finds it well this is how the game went early on down in Winston Salem turnovers turning into points and this winst way four team very opportunistic they want to Speed the game up Music and Aon matched up with Carr its kid versus Reed inside kid with a hook hes not going to get any better position on that an initial catch and he was looking around I think expecting a little double team help but that was a pretty easy catch and shoot hard to believe Mike this is the Hoke first Saturday home game 35 days its been 5 weeks and of January the Hokies were at home on the weekend and of course many of their students arent here starting spren break but theres a Hardy group of loyal hookies in attendance Padula hild SK rebound off the Miss games like this people normally not be able to come in and see game get a chance Salas too long in the second effort saveing a baseline from L Music kid thats the thing that Virginia Tech you know Steve forbs talked about hes got a defend sense and uh get out in front of things disrupt them they to be very patient and blocked by Reed make it Salis with a block but a foul called and free throws coming for Virginia Tech first just draws the man over Reed had to come over for help and uh just a little bit late there I mean just he have two guards on the backside for help and theyre not going to do much with kid saw a l Kid last Saturday in Pittsburgh Mike he was clearly under the weather played in short STS played pretty well Mike young said in his coaching show Thursday that Lind Fielding better and they expected to be full go today yeah I me he came back and had a nice shooting game up at Notre Dame and the loss um you know had ause Syracuse Im sorry but um yeah so he you know I thought they they got as much out of him as they could uh against it certainly against a very tall front line to need him Reed kicks it to car inside oh nice Anticipation by padulla Applause on the drive padulla finds kid hes got all five for the hes I just its really been fun to watch padulla play I mean we talked about against pit almost had a triple double in that game with really their best performer with such a smart player they him make plays and thats what hell do will take it make it think a guy over his last three has actually been shooting the three a little bit better four of 11 in that stretch Talent player and Carr from Pennsylvania to Delaware Collins going Baseline and goes over the car up and under for two I like to see out of him be more aggressive is hes not a threepoint shooter his midrange game uh you know gets better the closer he gets into the rim but uh hes got that great size use it inside in the paint these two teams that wa December it was all deacons all five starters double fers including boy Miller has wake for begun this one three of four from Deep three different players knocking one down talk about that first game I mean basically over in the first half it was a 20 point difference and then that was you know the second half was about even like young said after able to get your but hooked in the first half you dont really make any hay about playing them well in the second half got ly kid for an offensive foul and its going back to wake I tell you what th those are really tough for Frontline guys to pick up CU you know youre sliding you dont remain stationary I mean just youve got your guy has to use you you thats an easy call for the referee and its a cheap foul to pick up elel coach heat first Hy Off the Bench read to the basket four of the five starters have scored for wake and a early fourpoint lead buts been fabulous for this team hes hes really come alive in the last six games a shooting percentage way up but he has a physical presence inside keep keep it going today he a pretty good interior Defender Salis strips it bopy through the traffic finds the corner Hil to re hell take it for Music three thats uh thats pretty impressive over re shooting 18 here coming in it was pretty clear watching the H he and shoot around today that they were going to give Fon Reed that shot have to adjust the game plan after he knocks down his first maybe i stretch it to a second before I go out and cover him I thinko beating poti and rejected by Carr Miller lost it poti falling backwards to keep alive for Virginia ATT trying to do too much off the dribble pulla hits for three got plenty of action in the opening 5 Music minutes wakes five for seven Tech four for Music six H to the corner H the only starter who hasnt scored until now this you know wake usually has a very balanced scoring twos threes free throw line they dont rely on the three as much as Virginia Tech does but Music this HRA coutur stri by HRI he gets it back and scores with a left hand going GL thats just determination on that shot you know I thought hildr one of the better Defenders on the wing in the lead nice job initially that with the Couture thing they need him hes been in a little bit of a drought the last few games I about you Mike I dont think the defense has been that for the offense is scoring at Wills Sal keeps it going I mean that you know but I thought you wakes threepoint shots have been pretty wide open and I think Virginia Tech has been seeding those a little bit they may have to cover some out thats going to open things up inside for their last five P misses that one rebound oh potit just bulldozed Carr and hes called for the foul everybody can take a deep breath Deacon with a three yeah Reed is e Reed is the only outlier there the all the the other four are capable um but this is make no mistake wait for stand and Virginia Tech Two Elite shooting team through the W had made six straight field goal attempts before that missed from Reed Tyler Nicholls in the game for the hokes Parker fredericksons out there for the decks nich the guy that Mike young would love to see get going again struggled shooting the last few games just his first shot today the long rebound finds padulla back outside for Couture Collin nice pass to and Applause one theyve really made some nice interior passing having in this game and there a nice love the bounce pass right there no hands he got a great chance of connecting with it and K just fly in the scam second foul on Hunter Music Applause Salis see you know with that one I mean its its almost better this early in the game to let that go and mean if youre not just going to deny him totally from finishing the play rather than get up your second foul Tallis to the bench mil back in for Wake Reed working on poy the cutter was car and the fouls on padulla foul trouble was an issue for the hokes last Saturday at Pittsburgh and they bailed him out in that situation too that uh he was stuck without a dribble down in the post and teammate Carr came to his Aid with a nice Cut 11 Hunters got plenty of hype all well deserved 53 in scoring but on the pitch right now the free throw is good or is Po from the new movie Kung Fu Panda 4 might say scoo oh miss Kung Fu Panda four only in theaters this Friday one thing Steve Forbes has noted that is been throughout the course of the year that his team has really been outscored at the free throw line on the road especially and me that numberers even and doub have been in their favorite home but he SE that a big difference on the road so its good to see car get to the L coaches complain about that in your days in the ACC coaches have complained about everything since you have been coach some more than others but I get your point yeah and thats part of the deal its part of your DNA not generally relaxed Collins over Matthew Marsh four points for MJ Collins and getting us in his size but but you know you talk about I mean Steve Forbes is preparing for this team like the one he saw play against Virginia here yeah and you cant say are different good at home bad on the road what team we going to see you prepare for their best out of bounds off Miller second time that hes gotten caught off the Dural a little bit too deep yeah well Steve forb said earlier this week todays not about NCAA tournament seating its about ACC tournament seating like Forest up by five here in blackburg Brad Brown all is watching the tape he doesnt need to ask Ste Forbes or Mike young How the Irish are playing here that the stretch I think Michael Shrewsberry has done a fabulous job with that team probably exceeded everybodys expectations except their own well five right there for freshman the air three straight thats game two of our double header B around 745 in a couple hours all have an all ACC winers team Puck of later Hil slips keeps it alive with Hunter Sal remains on the bench with personal fouls Andrew Carr Rickson tips the rebound was deflected off kids fingertips out of bounds itll be wake Paul with the fresh 20 Tech caught a little bit ball watching that time and decent job by Hendrickson coming in normally just hangs around out on the perimeter but gets the recycle of the Music con H step back three that was pretty this a guy who his his wrist is really bother him and its not its his right wrist too but you look at the shooting numbers over the last couple of games I mean hes gotten pretty comfortable with it I know hes playing in a lot of pain he made two threes at Notre Dame that was the first time he made multiple threes in the game since early January NJ Collins also a guy whos had his struggles from the LD but everythings going in so far today well you know Collins starts making threes uh and po potit Applause next legal screen on week going back to Tech Music just a step back and uh just we were we were right on line with that that was good from the time you let it go and this is the part of the game that you really would like to see Collins expand is that perimeter offense had a tough start to the season Mike young at one point said he was 0 for November then he had a good game to start December against Louisville at e play but wasnt able to keep that going Robbie Barrett you know what his presence on the Flor let Couture takes a lot of pressure off them to the basket contact bucket count it for Cameron hrth see with him that last that three sets up the drive so you know youre youre wondering how do I guard this guy well when you got to sit on his right hand but he has got some strength in his own right and a good finish against kid Music inside tough dude mentioned CL with a wrist injury its a hairline fracture in his right wrist that might beat surgery when the seasons over but hes gutting through it youre right the shots have been going in more lately and you seen him weve seen him over the course of the year with since that injury end state but then the hes not playing with anything on the wrist right now it was pretty heavily wrapped when it first happened and hes just gone back to basics right now nine points for Hill hes got two three and oldfashioned threepoint play well with Sal out they needed him to step up and score some points looking inside Couture T the ke3 Applause back that ribon had a nice down spring only 813 in the First getsway first day and theres boy Miller finding space in the lane its become really stupendous those tear drops well thats thing and you recognize that at his size its just better for him to pull up and shoot that the little shot as opposed to trying to go all the way to the rim feeling it rounding out rebounded by Miller L be averaging about 15 12 points for for Game Pass to Reed kick out Frederickson three more seven of eight from three are the deakes and Mike young has seen enough my goodness yeah you know and sometimes EV good shooting can be contagious and right now every wake player is seeing the ball go through the basket its just a good handle that time by Reed kicking it out and this is what you know Hendrickson does he just FR just uh you know he spots up he finds the open space and no hesitation on that shot at all well its finally here the highly anticipated new season of the CWs number one show allamerican premieres Monday April 1st from the sidelines to the streets they are leaving it all on the field Monday April 1st 87 Central only on the CW you know its funny talking to Stan cotton there w course radio play byplay man before the game and he said hey you know if we shoot the ball were going to be okay and uh the first 12 and first 11 and 12 minutes of the game well done by the deacons Im glad you mentioned that because the disparity between wakes outside shooting at the Joel Coliseum versus everywhere else this year is drastic and frankly stunning y Thats it reflects in their in their true road record as well today perhaps flipping those numbers around par finds his shot thats money every time thats a good answer out of the timeout to get that screen get a good look at the jump shot I can tell you despite the barrage by wake four is Virgin Tech hanging in Music there Lake only scored 22 points the entire second half on Tuesday against Notre Dame thats the exceeding mat today e Reed the third well the way the games being played right now theyre going to let him go oneonone Theyre not going to double team him theyve got to stay at home on Shooters inside so hes going to have some time to work L is shooting at half decent 75 from the floor 872 from three 100 from the line I dont think keep that up they going be tough to beat if they do like Virginia Tech is shooting 56 from the four and 50 from three and theyre down down by nine Marcus Mar and getson first half minutes part because Hunter Salis fou trouble also maybe says something about where deari Monsanto is at right now on the depth chart rrick to Reed kick out for boy six to shoot rson fakes it takes it takes it wide fight on the F right there I mean you know if youre Tyler nickel keep your feet get a hand up challenge the shot youre not going to block it you give a great threepoint shooter a good look 8 for nine from three the Deep nichel cant connect Baron on the boards to nichel Knocked Away by Reed still loose frickson and Collins grappling for it neon Reed trying to call it timeout its a jump ball itll be wake ball and well get ourselves a breather Parker Frederickson did not score in South Bend on Tuesday hes making up for it today hes two for two from T young are very good friends they were talking on the phone on Thursday talking basketball they were talking life was asking about Steves wife Bing back to the stroke go back to their soan days had a lot of great battles poopy Miller makes the deacons 9 for 10 from three yeah it starts because of the double team inside thats what Brees Shooters up and you know at this point you got to stay home and everybody inside you make it a twopoint game let those guys operate inside alone legal screen malijah potit picks up the personal its his second and this is again just the very obvious thing for he never really I mean there are some linemen for Virginia Tech that would have been very pleased with that block yeah and next door Lane stadium that you know so effective especially Music the wait for his fast basetball team is on fire right now despite that Miss Ian wake has made double digit threes nine times in a game this year but theyre one away from doing it in a half but heres the problem you get the miss you dont get the rebound you know its for ball and this is the second time theyve had a long three that theyve uh Sal coming back in with the two personal fouls keep an eye on him T back in with a 15point lead Hunter hit his first shot hes got five points Rickson gives it Applause up hoopy bursting Baseline sets up Frederickson can go over to that possession whats wrong with the defense you think SW Tyler Nicholls off the back bracket no good and hes just struggling right now just battling himself instead of any of the Music defense L cooled off to 70 from the floor after that last possession theres the 15 turnover padulla the Steels and the Applause Music score giving a little casual at the ball out pun but P such a competitor hes been kind of quiet during this stretch five points for padulla for leading the hes with eight Carr slithers in between Defenders but unable to finish and the foul goes against Carr after kid secured the rebound you know was funny when he put the ball on the floor he was looking for the defense to collap he was looking for people on the perimeter to pass to and everybody stayed at home so that defensive possession worked well for Virginia Tech show little footb pressure which is something they showed a lot in the first game Im a little surprised and it flustered the H yeah it did it really bothered them Tech turned it over 12 times in the first half the last time these two met down in Winston Salem Mula gets it easy two beating Miller four straight for sha both uh both guards doing a good job keeping drible alive and just got a clear out on that side thats deflected well stay with wake but well get ourselves a time out first 358 to play in this first half wake has led by as many as 15 presently in more than 150 years and uh that actually that number is coming back to Earth a little bit they were eight or n at one point5 but then you got to think that that will even out over the course of this game but just a tremendous start from the perimeter Lake for and everybody getting involved deacons have gotten very comfortable wake is third in the league in field goal percentage third and threepoint field goal percentage you look at the top way fors the Virginia Tech the three best shooting teams in the conference finding down Z with three over padulla not this time they got Andrew car a little push off I believe yep thats number two on Carr joining Salis with two personal fouls in the half second over the back foul that hes gotten trying to go after an offensive rebound Marcus Maran back in the game and I think you know you talked about deari Monsanto has really been struggling with his offense and I think Marion you get a bigger you get a Defender and a rebounder out on the floor play bunch of minutes early in the season has not played a ton the last couple months though L kid cant finish block out by Mar Baron quiet too he hasnt had many tles in this game only his third field goal to 10 have missed their last four shots having scored nearly four minutes toall going back to Virginia Tech second number fredericksons coming back in to replace Salis and much better job Defenders keeping their feet that time Baron coming over being a road block Music too many ACC games through the years have had two Oklahoma natives on the court at the same time thats what we got here with padulla and Frederickson Hout over F Reed best on I remember a guy named Mark Price he was pretty good not bad one of the first times I think that Bobby Kem went outside of New York to find a guard we got Kenny Anderson from New York got Stefan Marberry Jose Alvarado more Music recently 60 run for virin Tech over the last few minutes four minutes wake is scored boopy with a left hand nope long deflection off the deakes and the hokes have kind of gradually sees momentum back here even though they still Trail by nine but you knew that threepoint shot was going to come back to earth a little bit and they forced some things inside Millers gotten too deep and uh better jobs with interior defending T underneath he got hit the eye stays with it kid spinning on re K gets the roll time out wa basically Virginia Tech was playing four on five once Couture got rid of the ball uh he was basically out of the play and is in some discomfort right Music now eight nothing run for Virginia Tech to cut a 15point gap down to seven minute 51 to play in this first half coming up on the Subaru halftime report got a preview from Tom wormy and Jordan cornette well have the call of the Tigers and the Irish later this evening get a recap of the live golf event that aired on the CW earlier today well also have first half stats and Analysis from the Gman here in blackburg nice job by Virginia Tech not panicking I mean you you see that ball you know can be a little disheartening but you know its the first 10 minutes of the ball game you see those threes raining in impressive synchronization from the fans in the front row there the cheerleader practiced that the fans usually pretty Music spontaneous see the numbers we can 20 to their last four nine of 10 and then they missed their last three Marion fouled by Applause Music Baron first Marcus Marion about to shoot his first free throws since January the 6th against Miami hes seven of 10 from the line so far this year the Freshman from Applause Denmark half of my family over in Denmark 139 have you heard of Scotland yeah its not too far away from Rosco my uh where my family is Copenhagen R Tony subb on my Wow Mike Youngs got to be frustrated to get two free throw misses on an 80 run you give up the rebound and then poy Miller scores two we touched on it the defensive glass and you know obviously there havent been a ton of offensive rebounds to get but those those definitely hurt especially on the offensive on the fre throw line left shot J Collins he stinks it re Mar face tell hes shown a lot more confidence in his jump shot than Ive seen him this year JS four to five in the first half Kookie once again finds that spot about 12 ft away and tell you with solide he hes been very aggressive looking for his offense hes got 12 points here in the first half to go to four rebounds three assists wild shot for padulla Fon Reed pulls down his third board and then climbs up his back and Sean has picked up his second personal I think youre pardon thats his first thought he had one earlier but I was mistaken will send poy Miller to the line to shoot one and one yeah was mean almost like I see hes behind me hes running up maybe I could just sto short on this and get myself a couple of free throws is that a boopy blooper and one Kevin poopy Miller and he played a few games last year because of an injury at a really solid freshman season for the central Michigan chipa 83 at the line solid we talked about Steve Forbes the portal and the getting Applebee and now this guy following up you know what heres the thing M poopy Miller is kind of getting Jake laravia treatment in that everyone wants to talk about Alis Williams and Hunter Salis and poopy Millers in the portal and hes having really fine first season too SPS mortal whisper and he hes been asked so many times over the past couple years years whats your secret Steve and from from talking to him I mean he hes talked about how his Junior College Roots have allowed him to build teams find cohesiveness more quickly because in junior college basketball you do get a brand new team almost every year but you know I think I mean everybodys got connections and they know people and they talk about players and whos not getting time and who could possibly Step Applause Up Fredrickson in and out and the foul and the rebound going against Wake Forest what a turnaround here with 16 seconds remaining Marcus Maran getting the foul called this looks like a perfect way to end up the first half and uh fans here wondering and I might be wondering too why a foul one called on the Play Im With You Parker Frederickson doesnt take too many shots shot from inside the ark he was a little too close to the basket there perhaps you need to pull out and shoot a three on the break that was only his 10th twopoint shot on the year seven of 10 two bar hits the front end of the one and Music one bar been a good veteran addition transfer from Northwestern today is his 149th college basketball game 150th will be Tuesday in Louis just for we talking about Pete marovich and his records and everything being he did his scoring in 88 games with no threepoint line with no threepoint line okay did he ever shoot it from you know K Clark territory no he shot it from everywhere final second to the half boy Miller with three over cure air ball halftime thats whats that held wake Force back from having a absolutely spectacular season theyve been unbeatable at home and if Im Virginia Tech Im locking in on number 23 Hunter Solace is you played 10 minutes in the first half foul trouble hes want to good going to an early start here second effort hes come up empty mention wakes homec Court success its the the deacons the Houston Cougars Iowa State Yukon and Purdue the only Power Conference team teams that are undefeated right now in college basketball its a jump ball will stay the same way yeah theyre theyre just theyre theyre fabulous at the Joel and you talked about it when you looked at the shooting numbers have been the big difference shot extraordinarily well in Winston Salem and they gotten good looks at Cameron indor and the Tucker Center and NC stage and others havent gone in Hunter Coutures got 12 in the hes are within 70 just waight falling asleep defensively the inbounder he just snuck in and youre expecting Couture to come and look for a three coming out of bounds P went for the steel didnt get it Noth unable to make him pay for the mistake really got lucky there it was an All or Nothing play lokis were down 15 have a chance to get back within five or even for front rim Miss for kid after the Notre Dame game Steve forb said we really should have been up by more at halftime I got to imagine he probably feels the same way today with how well is shot it Reed keeps it alive Carr stopped attacking back outside deep three poopy Miller no good all of a sudden w has missed its last six from Deep yeah those shots are going to get harder in the second half but a much better defensive Presence by Virginia Tech covering out on Shooters very active Baron for two and everybody else lifted out of the paved area gave him all the room he needed for a back cut Castle Coliseum Music crescendos Applause Andrew Carr I dont know if thats the shot that Steve Forbes wanted at that point youre struggling offensively Chan padulla this place would have really got L if that went in that probably would have been a w Force time out calls on Collins look at it you see it empty the great screen up top no communication nobody back there really to do anything about the play this really its its kind of a glimpse of what basketball looks like this time having you know five out guys lifted High gives driving Lanes gives cutting Lanes inside Fon Reed on the dive throws it down really nice answer that time good play fourth assist for cam hilr tonight L with 11 assists and 17 made field goals lead back to seven three minutes gone here in the second cure nice little pocket pass for potit and theyll shoot two car I think with his third foul at that look and he just uh you know Reed is just setting the screen to do that double screen up top and then to release into the pain area young start of the game really formal with a suit jacket game on now lost the jacket loosened up the tie intensity has risen scou Elijah po channeling his inner dragon warrior and for more excitement see Kung Fu p 4 only in theaters Mike this Friday and you know what and uh Ill give Coach young a shout out I you know most coaches didnt go back to the C Tha after uh co uh and uh he stayed old school I like that with that said are are you grateful to be wearing your CW quarter zip right now I love my quarter Music zip Mike young displeased by the foul goes against po number three in malij B Smith says enough and this is the thing with with ctit and with kid that fouls may become an issue with the front line that we puts out there I continue to hammer inside Reed gets the bounce like that I mean that play is going to be there F Reed into double figures the 11 time this year the fourth time in his last five ball games hes got 11 padulla that barely moved the net and that was under D well had he had have extra arc on MAR and challenge the shot very good defense with just a outstanding Music Applause jum pass deflected Mar and keeps it alive Salis almost lost his balance and hes fouled by Padula who is apoplectic over the call but his last bucket has brought the hokes right back in this thing sha padulla the Bride of Edmond Oklahoma Hokies with it four tomorrow here in blackburg Mike Kaminsky forest in Virginia Tech mens tennis mark it down on your calendar you were out into two balls today I love beautiful day Couture wi the hookies within one and how about a little quick check down at his feet to make sure he was behind the line before he let that one go in transition great look terrible pass intercepted by nichel padulla Kicks it for Collins nichel for the lead Padula the rebound hoky LED 5 to three have not LED since it was 7 to6 until right Applause now Music hok fans have come alive Virginia Tech on an 8 nothing run and wake fans got to be thinking here we go again on the ACC half in the first 10 minutes thats how cold theyve been here and theyve had to struggle for every possession KS have been out scored 14 to four so far here in the second half hild driff to Salis with six top two Coes for Hunter Salis tough shot is what theyve had every shot in this half he really had to manufacture that on his own its amazing how what happens when your offense is clicking how active much more active Virginia Techs defense has been in this second half theres no question about it Mike young has talked this season of times how whether theyre not theyre making shots it impacts how theyre playing deep toi five of eight here in the second half hure over and re for three 18 for Applause Hunter flipping in for Carr double comes that pass into the first row and they knew thats where the pass was going to be today in shoot around but a little bit more difficult you see again the active double team and all of a sudden that look becomes a little tougher what do you thinks going through Steve forbess mind right now he just wants to get a stop kid open underneath scor he actually made that one a little bit more difficult had trouble catching it initially great back screen by cout hildr with a quick answer I think thats what wake needs to do they just got to continue to pound things inside either attack off the dribble or get get Reed set up Corner three C missed it Reed for the rebound three deeps and double figures Hunter Alis currently with Music seven I figure someones going to drive this inside maybe an entry pass to read working on kid and its to reach him foul thats his third and this is where it might become an issue now he both he and potit have three fouls like as you know ptis going to come back in but this could get a little dicey for Virginia Tech down the stretch if youre wake you go right at yeah I you know with both of them with three just keep on attacking inside Virginia Tech is almost last in the conference in shot blocking Applause anyway to H the ball and a twopoint lead an ultimate home game of the regular season hopings will be home take out Notre Dame next Saturday they had their final two regular season games at home and they havent lost all year but hunter Couture doing work tonight here at bloxburg hes got a great defensive player and hrth on him and I just I I dont know what they can do to calm Couture down other than just flat out run somebody at him get the ball out of his hand there offensive game for hunter in a couple of weeks maybe if wakes Hunter can respond Hunter versus Hunter Salah scores yeah these made some tough shot keep W going in this Music game nine for Hunter Salis 20y for Hunter Couture cul is chipped in with 10 and has been happy to set people up cre for himself this time great feel just he knows other people he gets into his back court made Couture but then hes got the ability to knock down a shot when needed coach Jason Shane holds up the sign calling the play for the Demon Deacons Reed inside foul no traveling call against the Music deacons the for disagrees but its weits eighth turnover of the night and it takes us to a timeout Sean padulla leading the hoky back they Trail by 15 theyre now up Music five next the action continues on CW courtside Saturday oh its Prime Time Another foul if one of them gets a fourth its going to put a lot of pressure on Tech thats a great Point moment Virginia Tech has the ball in a fivepoint lead to out there kids on the bench I was almost say to the point where if youre those guys let a basket go inside rather even make close Couture three more yeah I mean and they are draped all over and hes just making unbelievable shots you all want to heard about players being in the zone well take a look at one right nowour is in one hes also cutting really hard moving well without the ball crck no tentative been an issue for Wake Forest this demon Deacon team has improved in terms of their ball movement as the season has gone along but early in the Season watching the deakes my thought was theyre not a great passing team they got a lot of oneonone Playmakers well if if you look at it their assist to field goals made is not very high in the conference so theyve got guys who are really capable of finding their own offense no call Salis over poti read the rebound kicks it out poopy teardrop with theres nothing clicking right now for the Applause decks the keyw theyve had to struggle and and strain for every basket oti locked by Reed Mike young might get a technical he is furious out on the floor again Pilla goes down contact play on and this foul is going on Andrew Applause Carr this game reaching a little bit of a Tipping Point and I would think that the referees are going to be calling a really tight game and I think actually let everybody back in the play by gathering right there right that was that was really close I thought Mike young and he might even be this might be a a planned technical foul I I dont think were going to see Mike young and Tony chza sharies together after the game tonight having a burger my Music goodness Aon lost his dribble pass Def flected and stolen deons in transition poopy to the bucket yeah thats what they need to get back to getting some turnovers out front Dar put himself in a bad way by picking up his dribble Geeks back within six P nice back throws it down I dont think there was any doubt he was going to finish on that play he thought he let one get away the prior possession 292 in the second half Fon Reed flips it in Steve forbs imploring his team to defend from the Deacon bench and a technical foul just one against wake for a seon reed it is getting very very chippy out on the Music floor youll see it right here now after the shot he bumps into Couture or poua and theres some words Applause exchanged sing the tongue out might have gotten them to take Tor just made the first you could probably assume that hes going to make these he delivers as usual Hunters got 25 Virginia Tech hunter that is wakes Hunter only has nine the technical on Reed only his first personal foul and now were starting to see some extended pressure up the floor by W fors its impossible to say exactly what the consequences to another road loss would be for Wake Forest but suffice to say it would not be good for their tournament hopes lose another one after the set back in South Bend kid count it and the Applause foul everything going right for the hokes theyve extended the lead into double digits for the first time and the deakes are in Ser Road game at Notre Dame with Tom wormy and Jordan cornet Courtside game two of our Courtside sday double header in about 40 minutes H Couture is six points shy of his career high of course that career high came in the most memorable win in his career to beat Duke for the ACC Championship couple years ago most outstanding player in that tournament and uh yeah hes you know bu has been really steady I love his I love his game I love how hes you know just kind of managed this this run in this team but uh he sees his back court made is on fire just get him the ball deficit 12 11 for the deak poies have been locked in defensively here in the second half too hes got a smaller team out in the floor now for wick for trying to get some scoring out there amongst the trees draws the fou youre right likee no Andrew car and that that really benefits Virginia Tech so what they made Virginia Tech has made weight Bend to down a little bit by taking that extra big out of there really takes a lot of the pressure off the front Applause line K HRI is probably not the free throw shooter thats going to give the hokeys free bacon and look this the Wake Forest basketball team thats number one in the ACC number three in the nation Applause that free throw percentage every Point counts here Al goes one for two 86 of nine from the fre throw line that is well below their season average of about 80 Hs doing everything he can door is still getting open yeah nickle deflects the rebound out for a fres shot clock for V Tech MJ Collins over Reed and kid creates a third opportunity here really has to be careful with that over the back though kid threw it off hilds hip Pokey ball 14 to shoot padulla coming back in with the stopage I would think you know even for these next few minutes its going to be you know as long as Wake Forest is smaller out on the floor they can go they can shuttle kid and poti one for one out there than Baron theyre theyre bigger than win right now do Couture zild trying his butt off and yet Couture is still getting free Collins to K boom L the foul number Z Mike jinsky did you see this coming no not in the second half but uh Ive seen some great interior passing by Virginia Tech in this game not just the threes and we talked about the balance been Couture on the outside and uh theyve stepped up on the inside what a crazy turnaround know we were we were bragging on Wake Forest shooting numbers in the first half what about Virginia Tech shooting numbers in the second half 65 from four since halftime wake 37 and it dips even lower as the deakes miss their fifth straight three and a half I think thats their ninth straight this three overall dating back to the first regression could be a painful thing nice interior pass again and Barett LS it in just everything Virginia Tech is running right now is working for him build out of control created contact got no whistle Hunter could in and out that would have felt like the dagger even with six minutes to play they would have had to review that one his toe was on the line and Miller finally gets to the rim oh instead of the lead ballooning to 18 back to 13 that was a huge fivepoint swing ironizing the untime hunter Couture and that last shot K Collins po unable to connect with Baron Pos turn it over for the second time in the half eighth time tonight tough angle on the L that time taking a couple dribbles to the Baseline would be able to complete that but really I mean kind of nitpicking with vir J Techs offense on that one anything spacular in the second half Rickson just came back in Miller Frederickson Salis Carr and Reed steeve Forbes decks Tas had it poked away padulla to the B baset Oklahoma on Oklahoma crime right there wow just put his head down and the guy who doesnt really dunk the basketball but uh was Fearless attacking the rim Miller fouled and Collins took the worst of it shot the chops this has been wild in so many different ways you know for Virginia Tech this this feeling a little bit like the Virginia game quite frankly well and the big thing too is you now youve got youve got the poor shooting by weight Forest but really no offensive rebounding at all to offset that the Virginia Techs done a nice Applause job dive into the nations most shocking Mysteries catch all new episodes The CW original true crime series crime Nation Tuesdays at 87 Central only on the Applause CW another missed free throw and Bert Smith our lead official says my time maybe some blood on MJ Collins mentioning different shot to the face hes got to cut with these took an elbow from Miller inadvertently another shot to the head on the follow through what what is the most interesting angle to you about what were seeing right now is it Virginia Tech comeback is it wake second straight for second half no I I think you know the thing for me is Virginia teex PO is in that first F you know first 10 minutes I mean you know W eight of nine at one point from three and uh they you know stayed through that play through it turnover Frederickson three wont go Baron cleans up the glass A guy like pure who gets on that kind of run comp I mean you he can flat out and hes closing in on his career high MJ Collins helps the cause for the hwys as well so everything that everything that wake is doing defensively theres a counter to it for Virginia Tech you know if theyre if theyre staying moment Shooters he got the driving lane and uh you know MJ Collins has been terrific in this game going into the rim thats his strength got the reach right there and it just you know they theyre really they doing a great job of the balance inside and out un aable to complete the threepoint play but its still a 16o lead largest lead of the night for Virginia Tech hter Salis still on single digits hes got nine it is 18 points for a team like this that can score now 20 second half in the second half thats a little shock Andrew Carr scor some points early his first bucket a long while so now what Virginia Tech does they just run their sets and they just use some clock Cur takes it have a couple chances to put this thing away Wake Forest clinging to their flickering life tonight Frederickson step back three cashes it in 11point game with three and a half to play if you you look at the guys on the floor he could be the wild card for Wake Forest nine for Frederickson pook do not need to hurry going to be deliberate theyll go under 10 in each of these possessions Pula 18footer rebounded by Kid he lost it there was contact hes cant believe there wasnt a call opportunity for Wake four is to cut this to single digits before the under four timeout which will come under three but a pretty good job getting back in transition defense but Solace nice take off hand Hunter into double figures Steve Forbes uses the timeout and brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you mle a home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom he has been phenomenal mik and he was the one really who got them off to the great start at the beginning of the second half threepoint shooting uh just extraordinary its been in Rhythm for good part of the game also making plays when theyve switched out on him but I will say this little theres a fine line between being delivered in your offense and taking your foot off the gas and Virginia Tech got a they you know they had a good thing going and all of a sudden now its a ninepoint game thes missed his last couple of shots both kind of looked like daggers in the air and this is a this wakens a dangerous team up Andrew car got a piece of that shot and it went in anyway for Robbie Baron with two points becoming the fifth starter to get the double figures the hes in Winston Salem in late December Fredrickson comes up short Baron controls the glass again hope he can take this under two minutes with a double digit lead five second chance points in the game for Wake forth thats the dagger good night drive home Applause safely Mike young and his coaching staff deserve just an incredible prise for the the effort their team has played with the second half the easy buckets theyve got Sal needs it that I mean look at the turnover the quick turnover Salis flag down there you know the pass thought he had an easy shot and he had three guys back it is defening here inside Castle Coliseum but Dua blocked by Carr W needs more than a miracle right now Andrew Carr my goodness DS started nine of 10 from three one for 14 since yeah only one in the second half you know we thought that percentage would come back to earth but not quer you look at the full game we shoot 42 from three thats acceptable yeah but uh the the the shots stopped falling and just like the hokes in Pittsburgh last week it affected Ws Music defense H gotten what they wanted have scored 47 here in the second half and counter to me the difference too Evan is that Virginia Tech shots have been right out of their offense really crisp you know great stuff wake has struggled mightily for everything in the second half one of two for Couture 14point lead for the Hokies theyre in the final minute poy Miller now with 21 points tonight to lead the deak kid back to Karen hook he want a blead clock right here and I think the big thing too is they course for the most part you know wake to go a little bit smaller and uh The Bigs for Virginia Tech were able to last through the game without any foul issues well Castle Coliseum remains an intimidating destination for any visitor thats the exclamation point from the big man Frederick in makes the second three of the second half for Wake Forest but too little too late the deacons fall to two and eight on the road in ACC play and the hokes improved to 132 inside the castle this season
