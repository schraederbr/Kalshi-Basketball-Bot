Music we are inside the JMA Wireless dome in Syracuse for an ACC showdown between the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame and the orange of Syracuse and welcome everybody along with Eric dandorf Im Doug Sherman glad youre with us and as you saw from the two records for these two teams identical coming in 8 n overall also identical in League Play so whats going to give this afternoon Eric Doug can Syracuse G any stops defensively and for Notre Dame keep riding their play for their two big dogs Burton and Davis indeed those two guys are a defensive problem for whoever they match up against Marcus B hes just Dynamic point guard as they come hes been excellent scoring the ball putting pressure on the defense and getting to his spots making plays for himself and for his teammates hes a tough shot maker as far as Tay Davis goes he might be the most improved player in the ACC he is a walking mismatch posting up smaller guards and taking those bigger guys off the dribble he has been Relentless at getting to the rim meanwhile for Syracuse Chris Bell will once again come off the bench hes been more effective the last four games that way one things for certain Syracuse needs Chris Bell to play well if they want to start to win basketball games he needs to be able to start off on a good foot and then that seems to give him more consistent energy throughout the game the Fighting Irish in their Road blue with the gold lettering and the orange in their home whites jier Davis jumping Center against Kea ji and its the Fighting Irish with it first and one of their captains Matt Alo the Princeton grad transfer had the ball first here is Tay Davis we saw the highlights he can put up he has really been a physical Force One of the most improved players in the ACC this year Doug thats a matchup we want to see look at early on Davis versus Davis I think obviously Notre Dame has the advantage just the way Tay Davis has been playing putting the ball on the floor getting to the rim JJ Starling again starting at the point for the orange and then the Freshman Elijah Moore stays in the starting lineup how does Syracuse get him back to the form they saw in the Tennesse game and earlier in the year I think offensively Syracuse they were out of syn versus Louisville to start the game they have to get some ball movement they have to get some clean looks and opportunities and its its funny how it works when the shots go in early on it seems like the Energy starts to pick up on both ends of the floor Syracuse just has to get that ball movement going early on and as expected right off the start Burton and Davis impose their will quick four nothing start for Notre Dame Doug I think its key for Syracuse to attack Tay Davis on the defensive side of the ball as well that they want to keep him engaged defensively hopefully am out for the other end shot clock down to two Taylor puts it up beat the buzer but its an airb so a shot clock violation these are shots that they do not want to be starting out with right now we talked about having ball movement but thats a shot that obviously coach red is is not happy with and rightfully so Adrien red ay in his second Years head coach at is Alma moer Now 52 years old got to look out for Braden Shrewsberry as well feels comfortable shooting the basketball anywhere and especially in this building he has been the orange killer and you see the trail that JJ had on shuberry you cant be late on Shrewsberry hes going to knock it down with or with the guy in this face great start for Notre Dame last year here in the dome Shrewsbury scored 18 points all in the second half and then in the matchup back in December he was excellent again shooting against the Syracuse defense see not today went to a little Zone on that last defensive possession mixing it up early on defensively Syracuse kind of gives Bren Shrewsbury the same kind of respect they gave to rain Smith at Louisville youve got to stay with him at all times hes averaging 33 makes in ACC play which is second in in the ACC and definitely you want to give him that same type of attention same type of shooter Taylor misses from the corner long rebound track down by Braden Shrewsbury the 64 sophomore from Granger Indiana the son of the head coach Micah shrewbury kebba ji gives it back to Burton fakes the pass calls his own number he is potent averaging 19 per game that would be fourth in the ACC if he had enough game in the dome this afternoon Burton doing what he does getting to a spot putting pressure on the defense knocking down tough shots and Davis he has been Relentless at attacking the basketball or excuse me attacking the rim and then Shrewsberry coming off that handoff knocking it down one of the best Shooters in the ACC last time they uh played out in South Bend back in early December coach shury team picked up a big win and they were without both Marcus Burton and their excellent freshman sir muhamd who was also back JJ Starling with the basketball he also missed that game for Syracuse so both sides said you know watching that tape from that game and it was so long ago really is not as relevant as you might think Starling around and out got a foul on the rebound that goes against Syracuse and there is the aable seconde head coach at Notre Dame former player at division 3 Hanover College in Indiana with a long NBA pedigree spent six years with the Boston Celtics before taking the head coaching job four years ago at Pence state had a couple of good years there and now has tried to translate that to Notre Dame Matt Alo with with the pullup now four different Irish in the scoring column Doug we we talked about Burton we talked about Davis we talked about Shrewsberry but how about Matt alako a guy whos shooting 46 from the threepoint line but more than capable as you can see on the last possession of getting into that midrange area and knocking it down and he is the vocal leader of this Notre Dame team goes by the nickname mush which his dad gave him when he was a kid as in Mushmouth and his coach at Princeton Mitch Henderson actually wanted him to talk more Mike Shrewsberry asking him this morning do you want mush to talk more hes like nah Im good but he loves having that type of leadership on this team just the communication from a guy who comes from a high quality program in Princeton and you see right there Davis knocking down to three finally Syracuse gets on the scoreboard but Syracuse just needs to calm down move the ball get some body movement Get Some Cuts to the basket and hopefully open up some opportunities where they can get some cleaner looks and with that made bucket as ji has his three Rim out the orange proud sits down and Syracuse tries to build on that by the way Jer Davis is now three for his last four the last couple of games on threepoint shots Alo left alone finds ji and hes fouled by Eddie lampin and thatll take us to break but an 110 burst to start had and we welcome those of you who have been watching the end of the game with Virginia Tech we are here in Syracuse New York along with Eric dandorf Im Doug Sherman Notre Dame scored the first 11 points of the ball game Syracuse got a three to get on the board but the Fighting Irish have dominated the first almost five minutes on both ends of the floor well the difference right now between Notre Dame and Syracuse is Notre Dame theyre being aggressive theyre attacking the basket and theyre taking whats given to them Syracuse on the other end offensively theyre forcing shots theyre settling for shots and theyre shooting tough shots theyre totally opposites Notre Dame and Syracuse right now all five Notre Dame players have scored in the first five minutes of the game Davis has the threepoint shot for Syracuse and again the shot clock a factor Davis on Davis Jer with the turnaround over Tay a little strong Burton pulls down down the rebound and the 2024 ACC freshman of the year goes to work against JJ Starling I mean just look how quick he is with the basketball theres a in and out behind the back he just needs a little angle to be able to get to a spot and then once he gets to a spot I mean hes one of the best in the ACC if not the country finishing off two feet in that lane well in this building a year ago he had 28 points in a loss 20 of those 28 came in the second half when when the Fighting Irish nearly came back from more than 20 down to beat the orange Starling gets it back now returns it to lampion wide open for the wing three is Chris Bell its a great sign for Syracuse right there Chris Bell hits his first shot its a great look by Eddie lampin great patience faking into the corner then seeing the open Bell on the wing knocking it down he is now 10 for his last 18 on threes since being moved from a starting role which he had had for 2 and 12 years to coming off the bench Burton had a crease missed the pullup Keva ji pulls the rebound back and then turns it over orange down by eight with the basketball Doug thats another thing Syracuse needs they need to try to create turnovers instead of coming back here on the offensive end trying to score every time in the half court they need to find Opportunities to get out and get easy buckets and transition foul given before the shot after Marcus Burton left his defender in the dust well turning over the opposition has not been a strength at all for Syracuse this year you see right here Burton I mean he has one of the CRA most craftiest Handles in the country just gets to wherever he wants to on the floor drawing fouls and creating opportunities for himself and his teammates and so Matt Alo the grad transfer from prinston will inbound along the Baseline to Burton out to Kev ji we get our first look at number one Julian rooper II key piece for Micah Shrewsberry Club Tay Davis draws the contact he goes down no call play continues Kyle cuff Jr with the basketball the cans is transfer into the game for the orange and Doug just talking going back to rooper he was a key guy in Notre Dames win against Boston College coming in the second half really just changing and Shifting the momentum off his energy and his effort well he had in 18 minutes off the bench Eric in that game he was a plus 26 and he only had two points but two assists seven rebounds and great defense and he really has a lesser of a role this year but hes really bought into his role and what coach shwb is wants him to do come in bring effort bring energy and really be the best defensive player on the floor and you like the fact that hes Detroit tough hes Detroit tough hes those Midwest guys are just some different tough shot by Burton Here Comes Syracuse Starling with it cuff leaves it for Starling I dont know if he meant to pass that or if it it went off a foot or yeah thats why I said leaves it I didnt want to say pass I wasnt sure either Burton for three this is a very good shooting team at 40 from Beyond The Arc in ACC play number one in the conference Doug I think Marcus Burton really excels at getting by guys and and creating opportunities but when hes hitting that threepoint shot you got to watch out because what are you going to do to be able to stop him and you know his size I think scared a few recruiters off he was the Mr basketball a senior year in the state of Indiana he committed early to Mike Bray he said when I got that scholarship offer it was a dream come true and when there was a coaching change it was real easy apparently for coach shrewbury and his staff to get the recommitment and man they are glad they did how awesome is it to be able to really be playing in your backyard with all your family watching you and and supporting you and we talked about being the Freshman of the year last year he hes one of the most dynamic point guards in the country Peter movich with his first two points off the Syracuse bench alako 43 23 to8 Notre Dame Doug no no disrespect to my guy Pistol Pete but if hes guarding Matt alako its going to be a long night and you see alako taking advantage of it right there knocking down a threepoint shot we got to let people know if theyre not uh sure who pistol Pat is that is Pete movich and again Burton able to do what he wants anywhere on the floor and that draws yet another timeout Notre Doug I think were going to be saying Marcus Burton a lot this afternoon 6 for9 14 points in the first nine minutes of this game I mean hes just controlling the game getting anywhere he gets to on the floor and just making tough shots right now his confidence is at another level for Notre Dame they LT him at 6 190 probably not that tall off to a flying start he and his teammates four of five shooting the three ball well the walk said it all after that last basket just walking back to the Notre Dame bench I mean he is feeling good today and you obviously can see why jquan Carlos has come off the Syracuse bench hes being defended by Applause Roper Starling over the top for three Syracuse needs more of that JJ Starling asking for the basketball and being aggressive whether its a one dribble move into your pullup or just getting all the way to the basket maker Miss JJ Sterling has to be aggressive Makita constantini into the game for Notre Dame big number 25 got an offensive foul against the Irish called against Braden Shrewsberry Doug we were talking to coach Shrewsberry at this morning shoot around he said his uh Notre Dame teammates like to call him tricky Laughter Nicki well he is from ke Ukraine he is one of three triplets hes got a brother who actually is serving in the military for Ukraine in the war against Russia right now and you know that part of the world from your professional playing days I do I I spent eight months over there in denro Jin uh I tell you what it was a heck of an experience Eastern Europe is uh its different from Syracuse New York I tell you that but one thing that is similar is it is gray like it is here in Syracuse right now so thats thats one similarity it has theres number 25 last year played at Monmouth for Rice King average 98 rebounds a game fourth in the CA in rebounding and so hes another one of these guys able to build his game and transfer up and use his final year of Eligibility at Notre Dame well coach Shrewsberry just talked about Nikita playing his role being around the rim being physical being a present at the B Presence at the basket and just playing your role buying into what the coaches want you to do it just makes the team so much easier to coach when guys are buying in to what the coaches want him to do Chris Bell has left the game after picking up his second foul Burton showing the whole bag here today I tell you what I dont know if Syracuse is going to learn it today or theyre going to learn it next weekend but Marcus Burton can score off the pick and roll youre going to have to step up and meet him a little bit earlier how many times has he gotten to that spot and just hit that little floater already in this game Taylor to Carlos and he buries the three caros 6 senior from Brooklyn again coming off the bench Bullet Pass Shrewsberry couldnt handle it from muhamd but weve got a foul on the pass that goes against Carlos coming up next our basketball triple header is capped off with Cal squaring off against NC State in Raleigh couple of teams kind of in similar position to both of these teams its hard to imagine in the middle of January but were already thinking about in the new ACC with the EXP expion only 15 of the 18 teams will qualify to go to Charlotte for the tournament you certainly dont want to be one of those three teams on the outside looking in and these two teams and its you know theyre fighting to play out of that bottom three or not be in that bottom three to be able to play and participate in the ACC tournament and I think Notre Dame their record doesnt show what type of team they really are theyre better than their record shows obviously they missed Marcus Burton for a good amount of games but having him back on the floor as you can see today it it just makes everybody else job a little bit easier Notre Dame is a much much better team with him playing yeah this Notre Dame team had 86 of its scoring from a year ago comeback led by that man Marcus Burton whos already almost got a season average of 19 per game and we still got 8 and a half minutes to play in the first bad pass by stovich stolen by Julian rooper and Doug I think defensively Notre Dames gotten better theyre a little bit more active they theyre a defense theyre a disciplined group defensively but activity has gotten much more and then you see Burton hes just continuing to dominate Syracuse getting to wherever he wants to get knocking down the midrange jumper so in the last two halves in this building and again there are eight minutes left in this half he has scored 40 points well I I guess hes telling us that he likes to come to the Dome and play a little bit of ball Taylor strong Drive fouled by rer and he will be at the free throw line when we come back but Marcus is confidence is Sky High let me get to my spot and just knock it down Im a Michigan man so if I picked Ohio State i the 8 SE the Buckeyes are the favorite and our producer christien Hennessy is from the Buckeye state she is dismayed that both of us picked against her school Kristen I forgive youo threepoint play completed by Lucas Taylor first three points for the senior from Raley North Carolina meanwhile what are the orange going to do defensively the Irish led by Burton have made their last seven shot attempts well every single time Burton comes off the pick and roll they are just lagging back in that paint and he has a wide open jump shot or he has an easy floater at The Rim they have to be able to adjust make him make a play get the ball out of his hands make somebody else do something thats a part of Bren shrewsburys game that is better from a year ago he is still a lethal threepoint shooter but better able to go into the paint hes averaging 15 per game Starling misses and the rebound pulled down by Berton so youve got Burton who averages 19 a game Shrewsberry 15 a game Tay Davis has his average up to about 17 per game and oh by the way Matt alako and another double figure score a lot of weapons for Notre Dame Starling is fouled its kind of hard to figure out how Notre Dame had lost four consecutive games until beating Boston College on Monday this is what Syracuse needs to be able to stay connected use that athleticism and length to make it tough for Burton at The Rim great job by Taylor getting the block shot but on this side of the ball offensively they have to get some movement theyve been out of sync since Louisville they have to be able to get some open opportunities to get confidence on this side of the ball Carlos on the pull Applause up five points off the bench for the senior out of Thomas Jefferson High School in New York City and and for Carlos just be aggressive right youre not the biggest guy in the court youre not the most athletic guy but be aggressive and be a threat on the floor dont just be out on the floor be a threat off the Tay Davis Miss Starling drops it off Jer Davis has it knocked away and itll be Syracuse basketball underneath with 21 seconds on the shot clock Id like these last two possessions by Syracuse JJ just being aggressive to the rim and Notre Dame may have got away with a foul but nonetheless being aggressive creating opportunities at the basket darling gets it back misses off the curl now Doug the next step is to make it JR kesn another one of the local recruits for Notre Dame into the game Bren Shrewsberry starting to heat up hes got eight points Doug heres my thing for Syracuse how can you continue to be late on the best shooter on the floor he just made one on the trail youre locking on his hip and youre not letting him get any open space and Coach Shrewsberry really has a good foundation to build around as Starling hits the pullup Marcus Burton and BR shrewbury were both on the all rookie team in the ACC last year and they became the ninth hair in conference history to lead their respective team in scoring for the season by the way we have a 10th Duo who will do the same thing this year at Duke but Notre Dame has a good young team to build around for Coach shrewbury Carlos back to staring thought about it now puts it on the deck back to Carlos for three thats a shot JJ starl has to shoot he being hesitant is not going to do it shoot the ball if youre open heres shrewbury Burton tries to dump it off and hes fouled by Carlos heres tomorrows ACC Network womens basketball quadruple header BC will host Syracuse in Chestnut Hill at noon Eastern then 19th ranked North Carolina takes on pit followed by Louisville Virginia attack in blackburg and we C the day with Hannah hialgo and third ranked Notre Dame hosting SMU and it sounds like hidos ankle is feeling better and she will indeed play in that game Taylor does a good job to stay with Marcus Burton and yet he still is able to score he did a good job staying but he get hes getting into that ACC into that orange area every single time and hes a tough shot maker if hes able to get into that area chances are hes going to make a bucket or make a play for somebody else 22 points for Burton by the way his career high as 31 well on his way this afternoon lampin will shoot a pair first time weve called big number 44 today whos been on quite a roll lately been a very effective rebounder up to over eight rebounds per game sixth best in the ACC look I think Eddies a guy who just has to be able to assert himself being aggressive on on the offensive side of the ball Notre Dame is going to try to expose him in the pick and roll you see hes lagging behind hes waiting for Marcus to make a decision and thats been hurt Syracuse but offensively you have to be able to be effective on this side get the ball use your big body try to be aggressive at The Rim if you dont finish try to get opportunities like you have right now knocking down two free throws Kyle cuff back into the game for Syracuse matako out there along with Burton in the back court and Shrewsbury for Notre Dame constantini inside with Tay Davis lanin doesnt get the roll one out of two from the line its a 16point Irish Lee Doug another thing that Syracuse is really missing is just communication on the floor right when things arent going well when you have a turnover you have a mistake get your guys together and regroup you know communication is key not from the coaches but from your guys on the floor stanowski with the offensive rebound back out to Burton a rare Miss for number three in Blue by stovich and Moore back out there for the orange good ball movement to find lanin inside Burton on the reach in foul will send number four hes getting everywhere he wants to on the floor and Syracuse needs to figure out how to get the ball out of his hands or or just make it a little bit harder youre doubling him off that pick and roll making him get rid of the ball and when he does get by he has to see bodies he cant get that deep because even if he doesnt have an opportunity to get a shot somebody elses because the defense has collapsed Eddie Lin back at the free throw line he is two for three here in the first half the grad transfer who spent last year in Boulder Colorado is replaced Now by Jer Davis transfer from Delaware Doug we were talking about it off here Eddie lampin has not had a shot attempt and its 345 to go in the first half that cant happen Happ for Syracuse now for a big guy Shrewsbury no Movic good box out grabs the rebound for a big guy how much of that is on his teammates not getting in the basketball well he has to be he has to communicate to his teammates and in some is on his teammates for sure but he has to just be a threat and be aggressive if he doesnt have an opportunity hes going to open up an opportunity for somebody else just by being aggressive trying to get to the rim Elijah Moore now scoreless over the last seven games just needs one of those threes to go down back out front Tay Davis and a rebounding foul did they get movich indeed they did foul on the Freshman from Serbia Eric and Doug I was just going to say once Tay Davis gets a consistent jump shot you better watch out he hes an NBA Prospect once he starts to knock that jump shot down consistently because 69 215 he plays with contact hes able to get to the rim once he can bring Defenders out there and and really be a threat on the perimeter it changes this whole game puts it to whole another level well for me along with Andre stojakovich at Cal Jaylen Blakes at Stanford Donald hand at Boston College and then Tay Davis those are the four for me most improved players in the ACC this year I agree Im on board with you I think Tay Davis is up there as one of the most improved players in the AC see and he has been playing at a high high level Kevin ji the Penn State transfer who followed M shrewbury from State College to South Bend makes the score 40 24 Kon Carlos flying with two fouls off the bench at the point JJ Starling on the bench to Mo hell try again from the corner cuff got a piece of it cuse retains possession see Notre Dame going to a little Zone Action again and those are the opportunities youre going to get you see choore had a great look in the corner and another thing out of the Zone its tough to rebound out of the Zone theres going to be offensive opportunity rebounding opportunities for Syracuse as youve seen there Kyle cuff knocking it Applause down Davis Movic did enough Walling up and here comes Syracuse Carlos to the corner more around to loo back out front to Carlos and back to more for three k it hell have a chance for four and Doug really I I thought he should have took the first opportunity but hes lucky that it it came back to him great job penetra Carlos being patient and Shrewsberry just late all motored aim for the most part here in the first half as Elijah Mo finally got to see the ball go in the net and a fourpoint play for the out of the Bron Doug one thing about the game of basketball its a game of runs especially when you have Shooters on the floor youre always able to get back into the game two point blank shots missed by Notre Dame under two minutes to go in the Applause half Carlos to the corner more around to loo Jer Davis the extra pass finds Applause cuff yeah despite the miss it was great ball mve and I really like what Carlos has brought in to this Syracuse offense and defensively he has been active and we talked about being a threat making an impact when youre out on the floor hes been doing Applause that Shrewsbury draws the foul on cuff and so the sophomore out of state college area high school in Pennsylvania will shoot to I found it interesting in talking to Braden and uh his father Micah as the family followed Micah through his coaching career he had a lot of stops along the way and I would have thought that might have been a negative but they actually both thought it was a positive from West Lafayette Indiana to Boston when his dad was with the Celtics back to West Lafayette when he had a second stint as an assistant coach at Purdue to state college for a couple of years theres father and son he said actually having to become more adaptable and play with different groups of players in each location has actually made him better especially now with the landscape of college basketball the turnover of of teams every single year it seems like youre getting new guys and I think Notre Dame is one of the more luckier teams bringing back 85 of their scoring but just being able to have that experience going through those different levels it helps you for where youre at now and you know hes done a great job putting this team together and hes hes done a great job of letting guys know what their roles are and what he wants them to do Moore on the pullup they need offense from number eight they need choer more early in the season especially against Tennessee you see what hes capable of doing scoring 24 points against one of the best defensive teams in the country and not much of that as of late but Chopper Moore is a guy who could get going he had a big game against Cornell as well Starling back into the game with the steel for Syracuse more calling for the ball and he puts up an air ball is it easy enough just to chalk up choa Mo season so far as well hes a freshman he he is a freshman and hes going to have those learning curves he can have moments where youre scratching your head wondering but just just like that right there you shoot the first shot thats given to you I mean hes known as a shooter coming in here when you have an opportunity even if its a little bit of space you shoot the basketball you cant second guess yourself as a basketball player you got to take what the defense gives you final 13 seconds of the Applause half Burton on the turnaround no ball batted around and thatll do it for the first half well the Fighting Irish came out and scored the game obviously hes not an offensive threat but on the defensive side of the ball he has to be more of a presence at the rim and just being being a protector Starling Taylor jier Davis Moore and lampin starting the second half for Syracuse Kea ji trying to keep Lin out of the paint ball comes loose to the corner Tracked Down by Matt alako starts alongside a man of the hour so far Marcus Burton with his 22 points last years ACC Rookie of the Applause Year Tay Davis Bren Shrewsberry also starting for Notre Dame as they did in the first half dug right away you see the adjustment on the pick and roll with Eddie L coming up higher stopping Burton earlier not letting him get into that ACC area alako beats the buzzer but missed it into the corner more for three dier Davis got a piece of it at its Syracuse basketball last to touch was Tay Davis that was a great look right there by choore every opportunity every look that you get shoot the ball thats what you are youre a shooter you can knock it down I dont care if you miss five in a row you have to continue to shoot the Music basketball darling had a quiet first half only five Applause points he talked after the loss to Louisville on Tuesday about having been punked like he took it personally he didnt want for that to happen again how did you interpret the way he reacted to that loss to the cards well a big thing that I saw in the game versus Louisville for JJ was he ended up one for seven you want to continue to be aggressive regardless if youre making or missing you have to continue to put pressure on the defense and I thought later in that second half or early in the second half excuse me he stopped being aggressive and you know that favor Applause Louisville dier Davis turned down the midrange jump shot for the jump hook its a sevenpoint ball game good job by Davis eating up that space that J let him have but hes a guy thats capable to knock down that 15t jump shot if Js going to give him that shot Im shooting it every single time good recovery by Moore on that back door pass to knock it out of bounds the Irish will keep underneath with 14 seconds to shoot and Doug one thing that I know coach red wanted to see from Chopper Moore was just a little bit more effort and energy on the defensive side of the ball youre really seeing that from him late in this first half going into this early part of the second half great defense right there by choer Moore Tay Davis had a quiet first half made only one bucket he continues to struggle then commits the Applause foul he has been so good in recent weeks has the scoring average up to nearly 17 per game ninth best in the ACC but hes stuck on two here today hes just a guy thats re Relentless at getting to the rim almost 109 109 free throw attempts that shows you how hes attacking the Rim Yeah he and Burton both put so much pressure on opposing defenses thats Tay Davis fouling jier Davis who will go to the line thats where really Jer Davis can be effective just using your strong body attacking Davis we said it early in the first half he has to make Davis play defense its going to make it harder for Davis on the offensive side of the ball but great job just attacking his chest and trying to get to the rim tonight at 8 Eastern after our mens basketball triple header the nothing but net crew will break down the day and night in the ACC with highlights and Analysis of every game and look ahead at the best matchups on the schedule for next week weve got you covered all season right here on acc Network and the ESPN Applause Music act J Davis into the lane KCK it out Burton five to shoot Alo gives it back to the sophomore point guard a good goes to work around Taylor to the bucket blocked by lampin pass up ahead to Mo who lays it in its a fivepoint game th if Syracuse can get more of those easy opportunities those transition buckets great activity on the defensive side of the ball ending in a Lampkin block and great Outlet pass to Moore for the finish here come the orange again lampin again to Mo but a locko took it Applause away raen shoes baring bad pass knocked Away by lanin who continues to be active inside here in the second half I tell you what the last eight minutes of this game four minutes last in the first half excuse me and then this first four minutes in the second half the activity on the defensive side of the ball for Syracuse has been really great its been leading to shots like this when your energy is like that on defense usually it helps you on the offensive side of the ball these from Toy Tay Davis tough shot off the window for Applause twois Doug if youre Syracuse youre playing in the half court set you just want to get some ball movement you want to get some Cuts right now you got to have some movement off the ball you see theyre over for helping Nifty pass off the bounce from Davis to Lin 4442 a great big to Big passing right there by dear Davis finishing Eddie lampin at The Rim Tay Davis is bumped and fouled by lamin nothing in the blink of an eye down by as many as 17 and now trailing by just two Tay Davis seems like coach rosbury really wants to establish number seven he attacks the rim again and is fouled by jier Applause Davis Tay Davis talked about him being just Relentless attacking the rim theres another example of it right there get an opportunity for two free throws but you love the defense that Jer defense or excuse me Jer Davis is playing an Davis just continuing to be there making it tough for him at the rim and you just need to continue that throughout this second half theres his mom caranda his dad DeAndre senior love the shirts that theyre wearing in support of their younger son takeover Tae and their sun with a couple of free throws to make it 4642 Notre Dame Davis on Davis Jer over Tay no ripped away by Braden Shrewsbury quickly up ahead to Burton Starling takes it away but is called for the foul third see Marcus Burton right here a blur get to the rim but I thought it was a good defensive possession right there by Starling Applause and I dont know Doug looked like he just said give me that I agree he did say give me that but nonetheless opportunity for Notre Dame at the line and so Burton does the job his first points of the second half leads all scorers and the lead is back to Applause six Lin calling for the ball good job by Kaji to force him out from around the post the behind the back pass leads to an and one for Jer Davis well how about that pass right there by Eddie lampin great job being patient eyes in the back of his head Jer Davis right spot right time finishing at The Rim opportunity for the an one and Doug you just love to see the energy back in the dome right its something that really has been missing throughout this year but Eddie lamin bringing a bit bit of energy into the Dome and he is the energy guy for Syracuse his teammates feed off of it it is infectious and hes always hunting for the pretty pass like we just saw he loves the goggles Applause again Tay Davis on the attack and the foul comes against Syracuse and its against jier Davis Davis well Doug what I really love about Tay Davis is hes not worried if he turns the ball over or if he misses four or five shots in a row he gets that ball and one thing is on his mind attack attack attack you just love to see a guy whos not affected by makes or Miss and just continues to be aggressive well he has known his head coach Mah shrewbury for 5 years since Micah tried unsuccessfully to recruit Taye to Purdue Taye originally committed to Louisville to play with his big brother Dre but both flipped to Sean Hall after the hiring of Kenny Payne but after a year at Sean Hall the younger Davis brother transferred to Notre Dame and they are glad to have one of the most improved players in the ACC and something else he does Eric is force his opponents to commit fouls thats the third on Jer Davis by the way he attacks the basket Starling attacks off the spin alako rips the rebound away for not Applause D got away with a little little Shuffle right there diir Davis wins that match up with Tay Davis Starling feeds lampin who faces up the big man into the lane left it short on the rim its like two linemen just crashing into each other right there dog glad to be sitting over here yeah Applause alako from the foul line under control for two Im really impressed with alako you come in you see hes shooting 46 from the threepoint line but hes a tough tough player and he seems to be able to get to his spots in that midrange and when hes able to do it hes able to rise up and he really has a pretty jump shot hes using that extra year that was lost because the ivy league didnt play during the pandemic so he transferred to Notre Dame as a graduate from Princeton Moore with an airball on the close out by shuberg the blowb and the reverse no more the rebound Syracuse back the other way Starling lampin count the basket the field goal L subti great job by Syracuse not waiting on Marcus Burton but getting the head of the defense Eddie lampin finishing with the goalen on tay Davis great job by Syracuse Taylor and jier Davis take a seat Kyle cuff and Peter movich back in for Syracuse Nikita constantini has come in for the first time here in the second half for Notre Dame also got Julian rooper in and now Starling will take a seat for the orange and Chris Bell has come back on the floor so is jquan Carlos so almost a full hockey line change for the orange four new players out there Doug we both watched Syracuse quite a few times this season and really this is the first time weve seen them create turnovers and then get out in transition consistently theyre doing a great job this half just creating turnovers and then getting out in transition and getting easier looks and playing in the half court T Davis lost it on the way out cop hes always in attack mode and the whistle comes which will take us to break and when we come back on this Martin Luther King those two visits to Syracuse he also made a trip to South Bend Dr King made a stop at Notre Dame in October 63 when he addressed more than 3000 people inside the step in center and we have come a long ways since those days as Kyle cuff makes a couple of free throws 52 Syracuse 4 Syracuse is never LED Notre Dame is led by as many as 17 Shrewsberry off the window for two with Burton out the game with Davis out the game you would think theyre going to Shrewsberry in a locko for more offense sir muhammd is more than capable of scoring the basketball as well jquan Carlos inside the lanin and before the shot attempt weve got a foul sir Mohamed called for the personal Marcus Burton the man of the hour so far back into the game with 24 points Syracuse has done a really good job on him in this second half the first half the first nine minutes he had 16 points this first N9 minutes of the second half two points coming off free throws lamin took it back after the poor pass from Carlos gave it to Notre Applause Dame Chris Bell is on the floor for Syracuse he made a three early then picked up a couple of fouls we havent seen him since here is Bell off the shot fate for three way off the mark long rebound track down by Carlos five to shoot looking to go oneonone with a lock up the ball is up and no good right now sorry dog right now if Im Syracuse Im looking at Eddie lampin you got Nikita guarding him Im going back to Eddie lampin on that next offensive possession what has Syracuse been doing defensively better against Burton here in the second half theyre just showing bodies you know theyre not letting them get into that ACC area as much and and when they do theyre crowding them theyre making it tough for them and when you got guys there two three rather than just one its going to be harder to score the basketball Syracuse doing a good job with just s bodies in front of them and crowded them the foul against Applause movich dff draws the assignment Burton dribbled it out of Applause bounds car cuff and Bell around the perimeter lamin inside and Movic flying the for Alo steps out to defend Carlos see Syracuse right now trying to get Bell an opportunity but off the fade screen though they get a halfway decent look the foul and so Bell will go to the line for two you dont want to you dont want to force it if its not there you want to get somebody else to look but Bell doing a good job of just getting his body into rer and drawing the foul 75 on the year with the Junior from conquered California third foul on Julian roer the second and so now kesn will come back in replacing rer lampin takes a seat for Syracuse Jer Davis back in Doug for Syracuse Chris Bell we talked about it early on in the pregame hes just a guy that Syracuse really needs to play well for them to try to win basketball games and hes one of the best shooter in act he missed both free throws right there but when hes locked in on both ends of the floor it makes such a difference for the Syracuse basketball team and the mental side of the game is something red ay and his staff have continually worked on Chris Bell part of the equation for having him come off the bench now foul on the drive Dish as Burton got into the paint Jer Davis picks up another that is his fourth and it looks like thatll bring lanin back up off the bench after a quick break back to your point about just the mental part of the game basketball is an emotional game right tempers are going to flare youre going to get fouled hard youre going to miss shots but you have to be able to play through the adversity to miss shots those thats what great players do theyre able to play play through those things tuck takes it away had Bell out in front but he was fouled in the front Court by Applause alako coming up next our basketball triple header is capped off with Cal squaring off against North Carolina state in Raleigh deie antonell the North Carolina state alumna will be on the call along with Jay alter on another marvelous afternoon of basketball here on the ACC Network and into the evening so Alo goes out as cuff goes to the free throw line Tay Davis has come back in that being the seventh foul on Notre Dame this is a one and one for the former Kansas jhawk his career in LA or in Lawrence never really got off the ground suffered a leg injury had to have a medical red shirt and then transferred closer to home New York native coming back here to Syracuse talk about adversity Kyle cuff Jr knows a lot about adversary but he continues to play through it every time I see him he has a positive attitude he gives energy and effort and he hes a big reason why Syracuse is back in this ball game its no coincidence when he comes into the game his energy changes things for Syracuse we saw it late in the first half again here today Shrewsberry juggled the ball ran oconnell the official right there said he bobbled it no double dribble 11 minutes into the second half Burton off a good close out by cuff its an air ball Starling myovich and he couldnt haul it in you see the difference in the second half on how Syracuse is playing the pick and rooll with Burton theyre hedging out High theyre not letting him turn the corner once hes able to turn that corner and get to the paint Thats when youre in trouble when you can force him to play side to side youre going to give yourself a much better chance J Davis goes against two Defenders missed the shot ji kept it alive Davis again with it and brings it out to Burton kesn great shot fake dump it off for two Kei makes it once again a sixpoint game movich went down Applause now so the officials you see Lee Cassell along with Brian oconnell and Isaac Barnett have called a flagrant one after the basket as you take another look keev ji catches movich on the chin with the right elbow yeah you see him I mean hes making hes hes going up aggressive and and J just just raised That Elbow a little bit too high and so there was excessive contact to the chin and its the third personal foul on ji and it will after further two free throws from my store Blue 14 the ball had yet to release from the net so the ball was still alive be too shots for white six in possession of the ball so a break for the orange which has struggled the last four minutes to score theyve gone nearly four minutes since their last field goal and my stovich who is only seven of 12 on the year shooting Applause two Syracuse this season they obviously theyve been in some droughts offensively but I think the difference in the game today is they were able to get some turnovers defensively and then get out in transition and get some easy buckets it makes it so much easier to get out of those droughts when youre able to get stops defensively and then get easy opportunities on the offensive side of the ball rather than play against a set defense in half court every single Applause time over the last three minutes the Irish against that better Syracuse defense has turned it over four times helping keep Syracuse close Carlos to cff back to Applause Carlos cuff on the pullup kzne grabs it for Notre Dame right now its time for JJ Starling to look to get the ball and be aggressive on the offensive side for Syracuse Kei hands It Off bodies Tangled on the perimeter and cuff is going to be called for the Applause foul despite the foul I just like Kyle Cs energy I mean it could have been it could have gone either way Doug honestly dont you just love Kyle puffing his energy that hes bringing to the floor you need that and unfortunate for Syracuse sending Notre Dame to the line but you got to continue to bring that effort and energy especially on this side of the floor wbury makes the front end of the one and one hes got 13 points Notre Dame has gotten all of its scoring from its starters nothing Off the Bench and they have all logged heavy minutes as we head to the later stages of the second half much better job defensively in this half for Syracuse given up 16 points so far this half Starling cant get the roll lampin keeps it alive Eddie snaps the slump the first bucket for the orange since the 1211 Mark Doug lampin doesnt jump very high but hes able to use that big wide body to create space and hes a great rebounder averaging 10 rebounds over his last seven games and theres an example of it right there Burton change of pace finds a little opening finds a crease in the lane and quiets the crowd for now back to a sevenpoint Irish lead its so tough at that size finishing among the trees when you get to the paint but hes one of the best at the country getting in there and then hes just so creative at finishing at the rim lanin with the slam off the feed from my St of it the D he heard me he told he said that I could he couldnt jump and now he comes on the other end and gets it dunk great finish by Eddie Lampkin Burton goes back door pulls up around and Starling trying to get downhill able to put it up on the window and he gets the bucket and it was almost like a semi transition they did a good job of pushing it up and going into the quick screen Eddie really not even screening them just getting in the way allowing JJ to turn that corner and get an opportunity at the rim and opportunity for an oldfashioned threepoint play now Starling the second Syracuse player into double figures averaging 18 per game cant complete the threepoint Applause play Tay Davis on the right wing uses the ball screen the pullup nothing but net eight points for the Junior from Indianapolis back to a fivepoint Irish lead not having his best game but you seen him get to that area on the court multiple times just hasnt been able to finish with a tough float right there by Tay Davis Carlos cross Fort Starling got it St JJ Starling is a guy that Syracuse obviously needs on the offensive side of the ball hes getting to the rim and you know hes feeling good when hes knocking down that threepoint shot Tay Davis left his feet and was Applause fouled rovic third foul number three on movich great find Right There by Burton and one thing I know about Tay Davis he is not afraid to give up his body and thats why hes had over 110 free throws this season for Notre Dame but Tay Davis hes hes just Relentless at attacking the rim and hes not afraid of the contact at all mom and dad hoping their son is okay as hes at the line hes third in the league in field goal percentage although hes not had a good night in that regard here at the Dome 77 from the field uh from the foul line makes it once again a threepoint game and it really is a good looking shot on his free throw you wonder why he doesnt shoot a a higher percentage from the perimeter he doesnt really shoot a high volume at all but again if hes able to extend his game out the perimeter and knock down that shot next level for Tay Davis Carlos waits for the screen Starling to lampin give it back to the Junior from Baldwinsville and the local recruit will head to the line shooting two against Burton Young Players I Want You to see this real quick JJ Starling gets it into the but then moves right away relocates and puts Marcus Burton in a tough position to have to contest the shot and great job by JJ Starling just moving without the ball being consistent in his movement second foul on Burton and so Starling with those 13 points at 70 on the year what do you see in JJ Starling shot right now well its not fluid he he he want to go through one motion you know with your shot and its almost a little pause at that top but you want to try to be able to just go through it in one motion and just hold it right there it looked much better but it its not consistent as far as the motion and as far as just being fluid but hes still able to knock down the shot and its you know I guess if if youre knocking it down you dont want to mess with it too much but in the off season you do want to try to get it to where its just one motion its a its a fluid motion through it and the former Notre Dame player has now tied the game for the first time today five minutes to go Kyle cuff is called for the foul Applause Zyle Im not really sure where the the foul was on Kyle cuff he just ran into the screen and alako fell down blindly ran into it didnt see it coming Alo after having drawn the third foul on cuff makes the first if anything it would have been a foul on AO you would have thought throws BYO goes out offensive defensive switch here with Julian Roper back onto the floor out of St Marys prep in Applause Detroit see he goes the guard JJ Starling right away Julian rer is Notre Dames best defensive player and known to be on the best player of the other team Starin tough shot to Tyle 65 a piece Doug when when youre the man and youre feeling it you can make those type of shots you have to have the confidence in yourself and the belief in yourself and those are the type of shots that go down when you have that belief T Davis into the chest of lanin and he traveled Syracuse gets it back with a chance to take its first lead of the ball game Doug the difference in this basketball game for Syracuse is one thing that I see energy energy I its a whole different Syracuse basketball team when theyre playing with this type of energy and it switched Eric over the last 5 minutes of the first half the orange has made its last five shot attempts lanin over the left shoulder no gets it back puts it in plus the Syracuse on top for the first time its been a reversal from the game here at the dome for the last 5 minutes of the first half without a field goal and they have maintained that in the second half and what has Syracuse done against Marcus Burton to get him under control well first half the pick and rolls he was just turning the corner getting into that ACC lowo every time getting easy opportunities at The Rim or creating plays for his teammates second half adjustment Syracuse has pushed up out of that made him play side to side not allowing him to turn the corner as much and when he is turning the corner theyre putting bodies in front and making it tough for him at The Rim Notre Dame playing from behind for the first time today pass was kicked by cuff out of bounds another part of the equation is that cuff has been playing the second half against Burton making it tough for him he has been attached absolutely his energy his effort his his physicality with Burton Burtons not the biggest guy and cuff has the size Advantage hes just up hes just playing hard hes being aggressive Burton uses the screen shoots over lampin itll be Notre Dame basketball ran o Connell says lampin was the last to touch and Doug another difference too is he was getting the same shots in the first half those little midrange opportunities but what Kyle cuff is doing defensively is hes making him work a lot more to get to that ball screen and now when he gets to that opportunity hes a little bit more tired a little bit tougher to make those shots Notre Dame got the shot it wanted a corner three from Shrewsbury where he makes 45 this Applause year on the switch now another switch Shrewsberry they try and stay in front of staring cant do it staring able to score to make it a fourpoint orange lead when you need a bucket if youre Syracuse you go to JJ Starling this second half 15 points much different than the first half just being aggressive attack in the rim looking for his own opportunities Davis long rebound Starland from the Notre Dame bench Micah Shrewsberry encourages his team to pick it up on the defensive end now down four and on this side Doug now you see Notre Dame starting to force it a little bit more just taking shots that in the first half they would have been attacking now theyre settling just a little bit more Syracuse defense has had that type of impact this half out of bounds Syracuse ball T Daviss foot I believe kicked it out of bounds they ask the Notre Dame bench to sit 20 on the shot clock 209 on the game clock jquan Carlos will trigger from the Baseline Doug if Im Syracuse and if Im JJ Starling Im not taking those type of shots Im attacking the rim Im being aggressive the last few possessions have worked out keep going to it no surprise these two teams have played a lot of tight games lately big block by ji out to cck Carlos on the offensive glass and he rips it away from Burton love the effort right there from Carlos going up against the 610 giant coming down with that rebound Starling hunting that shot movich back out to Cuff its a fresh 20 on the shot CL here goes Carlos creates space lampin is fouled where did this energy come from Doug you got to give credit to this JMA Dome crowd just staying behind their team giving them the energy and Eddie lampin Jr has been a spark in this second half just from his energy alone on the boards we talked about hes not a big athlete but using that body creating space and just his effort alone hes getting opportunities at the rim and a chance to knock down two free throws Applause that was the third foul on Burton and what do you know big number 44 has himself his seventh double double of the Applause season four in a row big free throw here coming for the Houston native 0 for two Shrewsberry hands to Burton Here Comes Notre Dame with just over a minute on the clock and and Burton calls timeout Houston held Notre Dame to just six made baskets here in the second half they are 0 for four from threepoint land and they are usually terrific shooting the three ball alako forces his way into the lane and scores over Starin 6967 great job by alako right there not settling and just muscling his way to the basket for for the tough finish but its all been on the defensive side of the basketball for Syracuse that has allowed them to get this lead and its just created energy for him on the offensive side of the ball and gave him more confidence that was Notre Dames first Basket in nearly four minutes 10 on the shot clock 35 seconds remaining in regulation Starling Tay Davis staying right with him bodying him up makes it tough on Starling who missfires Shrewsberry the rebound the shot clock is off timeout Notre Dame time out Notre d coach now they got Shooters all around Shrewsberry kesn and Alo and then obviously Burton and Tay Davis different look for the Irish and now that will trigger a timeout from Syracuse so now does Micah Shrewsberry draw up a third play on this sideline out of bounds well they got they got a little back and forth going on right now its like theyre icing the field goal kicker that type of that type of stuff going on but you dont want to make it too complicated you want to give the best player on your team the basketball and allow him to get space and make a play Syracuse defensively you have to communicate right now is the perfect time to switch the ball screen if you if you get it 10 seconds under under 10 seconds youre going to switch the ball screen and then you just got to be able to man up you dont want to allow a threepoint shot if youre Syracuse if anything everything to the rim the Fighting Irish led by as many as 17 points in the first half Syracuse took the lead for the first time late in the second half at 6765 Notre Dame out of timeouts has to get the ball in its going to be in the hands of the Princeton transfer mataka into Burton and here we go cuff defensively Burton gets around him and an illegal screen is called a against Tay Davis not number T and just what you expected get the ball to your best player and just let him go downhill and unfortunate for Notre Dame Tay Davis moving on the screen third foul on tay Davis and now jier Davis to inbound for the orange Starling comes to the ball and he is fouled by Burton Irish foul number three Marcus Burton thats his fourth personal fourth foul on Burton H now back to the line where against Starling on the year 70 coming Applause in hes three for four as you see so far today he was a ACC all freshman team member for Notre Dame back in Applause 2023 now kesn returns rooper goes back to the Notre Dame bench if youre Syracuse you knock down this shot you just keep one guy up on the free throw line just so Marcus Burton cant have a full head of steam going downhill at you a three will tie it Burton goes around cuff and lays it in clock stops at 89 seconds to go Davis gets it into cup waits for the foul to come with 78 showing on the Applause clock Davis thats the fourth on tay Davis and so Kyle cuff who is like Starling a 70 foul shooter goes to the line he is a perfect four for four today so still an opportunity for Notre Dame even if Syracuse knocks down both these free Applause throws 7269 Here Comes Burton again the three no jier Davis clears the rebound and the orange should escape and now Micah Shrewsberry came running out out of the court to get into the face of Brian okell and now being restrained by his assistance and hes been ejected Ryan oconnell double technical Andy Applause rejection doual has it must have been from something earlier right eron yeah Im not really sure what Happ it didnt look like anything happened on that particular play right there but maybe the earlier illegal screen on tay Davis Im not sure what prompted that well Doug when youre up 17 points and Syracuse comes all the way back youre going to be a little bit upset so something got into his mind where he he felt it deserved that how about Syracuse though hanging in there Notre Dame 110 lead to start the game but Syracuse they continue to stay in it continued to fight continue to fight in the second half defensively they really shut down Notre Dame which led to great opportunities on the offensive side of the ball yeah the energy in the defense presented by Kyle cuff Eddie lampin with another double double and then JJ Starling got going in the second half and so the orange will escape and get back to 500 on the season and more importantly get to three and four in ACC play and now Jer Davis takes his turn at the line a disheartening game for the Fighting Irish for sure they took an 11 nothing lead and did not Trail until late in the second half and yet Syracuse comes all the way back to win it 7769 you cant say enough about Syracuse effort it started
