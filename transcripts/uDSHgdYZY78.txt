Diana just shared a hug near midcourt with Casey Morel about to jump at center circle with a guy that hes battled with and practice many many times here in this city what a night its going to be here on Tobacco Road college basketball we got a rocking atmosphere here inside PNC NC State looking to make it two wins in a row after three consecutive losses good win over Miami on Tuesday DJ horn coming off another excellent for in game and he tips in his own Miss to get it started Horns momentum on the floater took him towards the basket and how about the intuitiveness to stay with it get one hand for the tip in get him going early we talked about the activation its begun and how about this freshman Nate George the Lefty layup Runner against a pretty feisty tarel defense and going with a right hand down the alley George will earn a quick trip to the free throw line Damon Stout year one at the helm of this Georgia Tech program their three ACC wins Jordan are against the three teams that began the day projected in the field of 68 really enjoyed being around coach STM Meer today watching how he engages with his team he coaches them obviously theres a level of respect because of what hes achieved as a player but lets not forget also as a coach really resurrected the Pacific program on his way out as a coach of the year goes to Boston with the Celtics and took a lot of hiside deals from there has established them with the Georgia Tech team that has had some surprise wins already the fact that theyve beaten Duke Carolina and Clemson but that those are their only ACC wins in 10 games what does that say to you about a team with a new coach in year one it says that theres a buying and at their best theyre scary now what coach is challenging them to do is find that consistency dont get bored with winning can you turn around and rise to that level when its not verus the top 10 team well find out this afternoon oh Donnell steps inside the line and DJ Burns tips it up and in D J Burns hes got a soft touch even on the tap this is Crafty Crafty player played a lot of college basketball today the 146th game of his college basketball career to emphasize your point by Dongo if youre not familiar with him a very talented freshman from Sagal plays prep ball in Connecticut one of the more talented freshman in the ACC misses his first shot and burns the rebound quickly to oconnell good block out for burns DJ horn pulls up and Applause Music hits Rees Alex negligently to go under the screen giving horn a nice cushion to step in and bang down for distance DJ horn has made three threo ERS in each of his past four ball games hes got a quick five points today Baseline jumper wont go and danana not getting the hometown whistle anymore that was right in front of the official the old push in the back with the ball screening off the rim sold it well to the opposition to earn the whistle proper call Kevin ke was critiquing your fashion what do you think about his wol pack top hes got on over there coach is always on point with the outfit from head to toe coach is always a winner in my book when it comes to the fashion game what the alltime great guys too love hanging out with him hes going for his 200th career win as a college basketball coach at the D1 level here tonight 199 up 114 down for Kevin Keats a little bit of a dig here but Burns going to do his thing always an eager passer oconnell cant connect and Dongo pulls down the rebound Id go further to say Id like to see Burns Flex his early muscle try and really Chase back baskets Dongo filling the lane gets his first Music two the DJs have scored all seven for NC State The Freshman have scored all five for the jackets Casey Morel welcome to the action there needs to be more of a sense of urgency from this rambling wck crew and defending through screens to challenge those threepoint shots Kyle stur it Off the Mark he had a fantastic game scoring the ball on Tuesday had 18 points in the upset win over Music Carolina First loss of the Season an ACC play for the tar Applause Music Hills burn Zips it cross beautiful swing pass oxygen Marcels shot might have been deflected thats where Burns is dangerous in that low post and eager pass passer a skilled passer can look to swing and find looks for his guys and a rare turnover for Nate George who has done an uncharacteristically good job of taking care of the ball for a freshman who plays with such a good Pace as a high IQ and understanding of the game in talking with Coach STM said how did you land on this guy that seemingly was overlooked by so many major programs said I went to watch some other guys this guy caught my attention and I noticed he was as good as the other guys if not better I said thats the one we want would and got him and hes been a huge part to these wins for this team in his last six games hes been special yeah 142 points per game over the last six for George then middle Brooks into the game for the first time Jaden Taylor looking for his first shot well defended oh saved on the Baseline oconnell splashes into three Applause George able to silence this Rowdy wolf pack crowd again the efficiency in the last six games a guy who hovers around mid 20 from three has been around 38 hes confident wild shot there from horn but Tracked Down by middle Brooks energy effort from the pack fueling them early on bombs away from outside early in this game they made three threes they missed four other attempts less than 5 minutes in its Dongo from the corner he comes up short a nice job by NC States Taylor blocking out and the foul is going on Dongo in the back court you love the energy Jad Taylor no Jad Taylor yes with the save finds oon three your thing entertain TR in first 5 minutes tonight here in Raleigh meanwhile Nathan George for just a freshman has hit some incredibly clutch shots this season Jordan I keep going back to it when youre a freshman there comes a point in the season where you start it starts to click the way he approaches the game is very cerebral in nature but now hes starting to become confident with his shot and so now he becomes that much more Dynamic not only can he score it but as a setup man he makes that offense that much more Dynamic for George Tech we always hear the term freshman wall but his best basketball has been over the past three weeks goes to coaching right coach Don Meer saw what he could be and it started to mold him in that in that likeness and its really its a late whistle but its the right whistle as gari was hit crash into the cup and free throws here for the young man from New Zealand running the floor absolutely the foul I dont know what the Boost are coming from with the home crowd here gari all the tardiness of the whistle is why why they were booing do matter they got the call right first on oconnell this is an really intriguing young Prospect too taara gari Damon Styers has said hes one of the better players on the team he could be one of the better players in the league he about turning the potential into production and hes kind of a microcosm what this team is they they need to find a Chase consistency to be great cuz the talent is Applause there har had eight rebounds against Carolina on Tuesday night Middlebrook swallowed up by gari theres your length of the 69 gari didnt try to just block the shot try to literally inhale that thing took it with two hands give me that I mean that clean left hand to right hand takeaway how many of your alltime blocks were like never had one like that nothing that resembled that mine were def flections not blocks midd Brooks kicks it nice extra pass straightway three wont fall for Taylor thats why okons on the floor to generate high level shots for his guys did so there just could punctuate the offensive sequence Sturman kicks it kapari rebounded by middle Brooks thought it was interesting what Kevin Keat said about how having oconnell in the lineup helped make Casey morcel get better looks as a facilitator everybody also iate some of the pressure from horn to have to operate as the primary Handler and he can become a more natural scorer where hes best suited both pack have cooled off after a scintillating start theres the block from diara but the stick back is good for taian Claude bit of a homecoming game for him he grew up in goldboro about an hour from here hes got about 15 friends and family in attendance and Claude was massive in that Carolina win especially when Dongo went down going for nine and eight ton of energy and you just saw it in that last sequence free throws for Middle Brooks the foul on gari this is a physical basketball game right now through 6 and 12 minutes and its exactly what you expected from two teams that are CL and fighting to improve upon their records and where they stand right now but also two supremely confident teams coming off the wins they just had Marcel back in thought it was interesting what Damon STM said yesterday in terms of moving on from the big win over North Carolina they said were looking for a little bit more maturity and expectations I feel like we can get a little bit of a run but in order to get a winning streak got to win two yeah beauty of this one is this is an electric crowd here NC state has showed up today so there is that present juice from the road team in Georgia Tech thats hyped up to try and get one on the road in conference Taylor long two air mails Applause it some indecision over whose ball it was going to be if it was States ball there would have been two10 on the shot clock NC State just one of its last 11 theyre old for their last eight they havent scored nearly three minutes too much dribbling not enough movement not enough Cutters youre not getting the defense into rotation to be to to be opportunistic its easy for that defense to stand congeal and just wait for plays to happen and thats easy to Music Applause defend Applause was just thinking Miles Kelly hadnt taken a shot yet snaps that streak with a Applause Miss Burns back in the ball game its a beauty of burns when youre stagnant you can go down low to a guy who can start to make things happen on the other Block its diara Georgia Tech Music basketball I would go a little bit further if Im DJ Burns I love the eagerness we talked about how skilled a passer he is get Glutton on those low post touches go chase a basket your offense is struggling start to be a little bit more aggressive in your own ability to produce baskets rather than work it to guys who dont have it right now offensively Miles Kelly tear drop two eight nothing run for Georgia Tech back within one diara not this time either Burns keeps it alive and well get a trip to the free throw line after we get ourselves a timeout started both teams were red hot from the outside now its turned into a little bit of a rock fight onepoint game Music here Music NC State lead Georgia Tech 1312 8 minutes gone here in the first half ACC court side Saturday on the CW Tuesday night on inside the NFL the matchup is set for the big game and the guys take a look at the keys to victory for the 49ers and the Chiefs Inside the NFL Super Bowl preview Edition Tuesday 87 Central only on the CW who you got Im not betting against that guy named Patrick Mahomes Im with you it pains me as a Bengals fan because that is our our new rival here in these last few seasons but greatness is great greatness well the only team thats beaten Kansas City in a championship is your team and my team thats right talking about the Patriots in 18 Bradys last harra got us to Super Bowl in 21 yes indeed cerent pulls it back outside Debo Coleman out there for the first time today Dongo into the lane and a good contest from Burns but hes called for the foul and Claude will shoot twoo but its how Dongo operates in that short Corner position on the catch sometimes guys get sped up on that catch its an unusual place to operate thats why zones typically work but on that one as the dive guy in the man defense he catches composes delivers to Claude right there in the middle of the paint to earn some free throws taian Claude Moravian prep to Morehead State to Western Carolina to Georgia Tech some day in the life of a college basketball player in this era tell me Im wrong what were you thinking staying at the same school for four years in a row I dont know Im sure coach Bray would have loved to get me the heck out of Dodge sorry coach maybe if you blocked a few more shots like taian Claud I stuck around for the weather there in South B it was beautiful during basketball season DJ Burns banging on the Block cant score Tennesse state has missed its last 11 shots Jordan thats when the difference between this years iteration of DJ Burns compared to last year the efficiency has taken a 7 dip those were finishes last year unable to convert those this season and its pled this group why do you think that is I think conditioning has played a roll in it I I think DJ has all the talent in the world if he can commit to better conditioning himself hed return back to that star cuz thats who he was star for the pack a season ago strong onehanded rebound Kellys deflection goes right back back to Taylor count the basket and one the pack need to chase chances for early offense it may not look pretty it may not look how it was designed up but the ability to get these athletes out in the open floor can reignite an offense thats currently stuck in third gear snapped a long field goal drought for the wolf pack I Ive enjoy watching Jaden Taylor this year hes a guy that plays really hard every possession hes a competitor and I do want to go back to DJ Burns whos leaving the floor right now he is a charismatic young man in talking with Coach hes a joy to coach so hes a good young man I just think theres wow how about tayor showing off the defense showing off the effort in the back courner I just know what DJ Burns can be and how it can lift this team and I know that he wants it and if he locks back in the final stretch for the season for him could be magical and get this team back into the tournament in March o AC Reed stripped on his way to the rim third Georgia Tech turnover second in as many possessions DJ horn wont cash in the three hard Landing for the Freshman Dennis Parker Jr slow to get up but he is up but the games becoming an NC State game now this is the type of energy this is the type of game they want theyve got Georgia Tech on their heels theyre turning him over third straight Georgia Tech turnover jackets only had one turnover in the first nine minutes swing one more Morel fakes it takes it swatted but a foul called Dongo met him at the summit we talked to Coach St beginning of the game he says Inc State could be sitting there stuck on a number but then when they start playing Fast Watch Out theyve gotten there the contact tough to see from that angle cuz at the Apex that was clean its a second foul on D it was the body coming into the elevation where the whistle was Music warranted so Casey morsel to the line he was honored before the game here presented a ball in honor of his 1000th Career Point which he scored in January against the Tar Heels heres our look morcel coming in there with bad intentions and yeah there was body from the left arm though that extended out to prevent Morel from getting towards the rim dont get enamored with the right hand blocking the shot its what led to the separation preventing moreel from getting there right Cole Im curious if that same play happened in the NBA whether we get a green light special on it well Ill tell you what if youre talking about NBA is officiated compared to this theres no such thing as defense in the N come on Jordan guys are stepping on the floor Dr five right now come on players not teams players now you extend it out a little bit starting to get some conversions now they can really apply that pressure 70 Run for the pat Georgia Tech has gotten sloppy Georgia Tech has gotten sped up that thats the biggest problem which has led to the sloppiness absolutely evident tenis shoot the Freshman George finds his space and puts it in Iron sharpening iron Taylor all up in him and what youre taught is a offensive player when that type of pressure is applied rip through and attack the Lead Foot exactly what George did there to convert the floater he scoring double figures just twice in his first 12 ball games but five of his last six he has really heaten up as we shift into February shot clock down to seven here for NC State Jaden Taylor pops and buries the three Marcel did a elite job of sucking Kelly over towards him to then allow the step in three from Taylor feels like all of NC States 25 points came in like two three minute bursts the first 3 minutes of the game and these last three minutes here since the Under 12 timeout now theres a renewed sense of energy and defensive effort too its infectious when the balls going in the basket its a tail as oldest time in the college game 18 to 22 year olds fall in love with the jumper when its going theyll give you everything everywhere on the sounds like theres some old post guy throw the ball inside to me too seeping into that comment timeout taken by Damon St maybe a tad 834 to play in this first half winner of this game will be finishing off a 2 and 0 week and who knows whats going to happen down the road in Chapel Hill tonight talk about NC State trying to get into the top four for tournament season purposes but really every game just feels Monumental right now around the ACC presented by TMobile busy seven gamees Saturday Miami was down 10 at the Under 12 timeout in the second half probably to win Coral Gables and Clemson former NC State guard Jack Clark had a shot at the buzzer top of the key but Virginia prevails how about Virginia a team that was left for dead so early to season 8 and three at conference Z other Dame pit just getting underway wake Syracuse game two of our double header tonight theres a general prevailing narrative out there with Carolina Duke that oh it was a blessing in disguise UNC losing to Georgia Tech on Tuesday now theyre refocused heading back home to play Duke do you buy into that at all I never saw a loss as a blessing in my life in any facet of my life I dont know how such a thing can be true thats why I said its a narrative I dont I dont know if its true spoken from a guy whos taken several Ls trust me Ive never found the good in any of Music them Georgia Tech basketball Claude Coleman George Sturman and gari the five on the floor for Georgia Tech in and out for dbo Coleman but on the glass kapari on make a clog keeping it alive sets up stur it for two its great effort from clog to chase the second chance opportunity not force one just cuz he got the offensive rebound but kick to a cutter with momentum to get a floater to go important basket trying to keep Georgia Tech connected here in this first half horn nearly NC States first turnover but instead its a foul on gari and now gari and Claude and all have two fouls a piece and with that well take you to a timeout we got 743 to play in the first half Damon St has some foul trouble to figure out ACC basketball for the wolf pack 743 the play in the first half in front of a rockus PNC Arena crowd lets take a look at the significant stats brought to you by JP Morgan Wealth Management notice the turnovers for NC State theyre taking care of the ball its not been an offensive clinic by any stretch of the imagination for either team but some stats worth noting additionally upon that zero turnovers in this game for the pack through almost 13 minutes of play thats massive but also look at the shots attempted 16 for Georgia Tech 25 from NC State how are they taken nearly 10 more shots theyre turning the opposition over which is translated to seven points off of those turn turnovers and second chance nine second chance off seven offensive rebounds for the pack the idea is take more shots at the goal even if youre shooting a bad percentage youre probably going to beat the opposition thats whats happening right now with the pack little full cor pressure out of the timeout 10point lead kapari shows the versatility and earns the trip to the line late whistle but its on diara and thats his first that makes you an aure Prospect a sophomore whos 69 at tar kapari who can handle full core pressure take it the leg to the floor maybe use two dribbles once you come across the timeline to extend at the rim and draw the F that is a sequence thats eye popping to me his parents are from Zimbabwe they moved from Zimbabwe to New Zealand right before tar was born when his older sister was a toddler they moved when he was a a kid Jordan he played rugby cricket and water polo along with basketball but hes found a home on the hardw I dont know look maybe this is a soft basketball guy I me I look at his build how does rugby work for a guy I mean hes got some muscle to him but hes pretty long and wiy am I missing something did you see him dribble from midcourt to the rim there youre not allowed to tackle in this sport well if they cant catch you they cant tackle here yeah thats true Casey morel tough turnaround for two good move and isolation there from Morel repetition move saw him working on that nearly another backourt turnover now morcel made the shot there but as he was making the move I wanted to ask you too much dribbling or was that in the flow no that was in the flow and he was playing to a side there was no helps side there thats one V one basketball he was Victorious Debo Coleman bullies his way to the basket and has it poked Away by Yara itll stay with tack 11 a shoot credit the pack defensively they have not allowed any easy offerings at the rim for this Georgia Tech Squad in a half court setting DJ burs J DJ Burns coming back Music in Burns been active Four Points four rebounds two assists while not giving it away at all in just 6 minutes so far fouls on cam Woods number two cam Woods for the one back thats his first foul teams fifth foul fifth foul on the pack here in this first half Georgia Tech has had success recently here in Raleigh lost last year but won the four previous trips to PNC contested Corner three wont go but its another offensive rebound Tai Jean Claude fouled by Burns Music to the dismay of the Wolfpack fans here in Raleigh and it was a travel for the record before the contact and Coach DM Singa Claud slow down I know youve got some of your people here as youre returning semi close to home but slow it down let the game come to you coach do is such a good feel and pulse for his guys you can tell theres a mutual respect from player to coach theyre absorbing everything he tells them whether it be in shoot around or in the of the game excellent defense by midd Brooks who just came in after Burns picked up his second Applause foul at this end of the floor Wolfpack have made four their last five shots eight first half points already for Jaden Taylor Woods for three rebounded by George Nate George has seven points to lead the jackets looking for for more got them all three for George hes in double figures for the sixth time in the last seven ball games and defensively hor has got to do a little bit more youre allowing a nice Rhythm bounce comfortably from George to step into a three you got to apply a little bit more pressure make it uncomfortable for the Handler you can see Georges confidence growing its fun to watch Taylor unable to answer gari pulls down another rebound for the yellow jackets Claude on the dive into middle Applause Brooks Ill tell you Claude more good action great energy if on that catch he plays off of two he might dunk on top of the contact there is an element now that coach donamire has TI me off to it understanding claudes energy is helping that activity but also play with a little bit more of a pace see can have some an to one opportuni on tomorrow live golf Maya COA concludes with the final round you can watch John Ram ha nean and all the live Superstars battle it out to see who walks away with the first win of the 2024 season live golf myoba tomorrow 1 pm Eastern 10 am Pacific on the CW Applause Claude brings Georgia Tech back within six been an entertaining opening 15 minutes only meeting of the regular season between these two Applause schools Marcel hands it off for o Connell over to Taylor clock down to six Taylor hops skipping a jump turns it over first giveway of the day great defense for Miles Kelly discipline George kicks it Kelly fumbles the catch wanted to shoot it before he caught it Marcel rebounded by Claude this game has had just a weird feel to it Jordan both teams have been hot and both teams have been cold yeah theres been a lot of cold from Beyond The Arc from these two teams dare I say start chasing uh better looks from two at this point in the contest Georgia Techs two for eight NC States four for Applause Music 16 free throws coming here for Georgia Tech OK Connell picks up his Music second so George gets his second trip to the line hes two for two so far its a one and one and he earns the second you are watching ACC basketball on the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve Georgia Tech 10 and 11 NC State 14 and seven yellow jackets have more wins over ranked opponents than anyone in the ACC except North Carolina makes some sense of that the 10 and 11 overall that theyve got a talented group that once they understand the rigors of a conference season come year two nobodys going to want to play a coach St Meer Le team although Id say right now nobody wants to play them understanding what theyre capable of in the pack in the midst of it here this evening Parkers 3 blocked by gari tfar gari has done a little bit of everything in this first half you know what Ive been impressed with not only his but Georgia Techs effort and energy making this highly competitive in the first stanic life game summary presented by Pacific Life creating Financial Security for more than 150 years Jordan cornette we have seen a little bit of everything in this first half yeah there has been a ton of offense but it has been high level competition from both teams fighting on the backboard defensively locking in has been a lot of shot making thats been at a premium in this one for sure but watching Nathan George uh he is one guy who has been efficient hes been taking care of the basketball again its kind of a staple with how he plays only one turnover hasnt been the setup man weve been accustomed to hes taking upon himself to go score the ball from a field goal perspective George is three for four the rest of his team is 4 for 16 12 points for George 13 for the rest of the jackets first game of our Courtside Saturday double header here at PNC Applause Music Arena kick to the corner George Tech cannot buy a bucket from three gari comes right back to it and brings the jackets within two a forgotten Arc to the game following your own shot not only did he follow it but the defense gave up on a 5050 which allowed him a gap to just go lay the basketball in its a 9 nothing run for a tech and a turnover Jordan you were open but uh I dont know if you can knock it in from here yeah Im not Im not as skilled and agile to leap over the scores table grab the ball Cel over there no not even in my Prime we are fortunate to be here court side great perspective great environment one of my one of my favorite things here at NC State is an hour before the game theres like a Stampede of students that race in for the best seats right behind us theyre some of the most passionate fans in all of Athletics going to show up for their group admire that passion Ive experienced in a lot of different ways I bet Kelly hangs in the air and scores the fact that Georgia Tech is tied my Kell Kelly has been pretty quiet says something about what the jackets are building around him absolutely he but theres a belief within this group I mean when you go against George Tech theyre never going to lay down at a game mid grs met by an army lot of contact and on the second effort we get a foul impressive Rim protecting defense on the initial attack though yeah and theyre theyre really closing help side theyre contesting everything not giving up anything easy at The Rim first go clean but middle Brooks to his credit sticking with the play eventually earn that whistle NC State 7even for seven at the free throw line so far tonight then middle Brooks had 14 in the game against Wake Forest a few weeks ago where he didnt miss a shot only 12 points in his last four games since then one for two blame the playbyplay guy if you want a little bit of a jinx just a little bit he made the one right after I said it though long pass staring pass it worked out beautiful ball movement you got to take that one for George got to take that George OK conell the steel plays it back for horn Applause buckets big swing right there got a taste of okon the distributor to step into it and then allow wh leave it back to a threepoint Applause shooter Arrow belongs to Georgia Applause Tech and F you just cant do this if youre three of four the lone bright spot offens if you cant pass it off George had the shot then alado in transition looks draws to Defenders eyes in the back of his head understanding for stepping into a three its a great look for my my colleague here leaves it for him and dials down from distance thats the value okono brings is the primary Handler a true setup man that delivers great looks for the other four guys on the floor and you think thats too unselfish too unselfish for George perfectly unselfish for okon on with a clock winding down Kelly tough two tough two and the foul love that young mans game love how Kelly plays the game opportunistic when he needs to be another guy who could be a little bit more selfish with his but hes a long 66 wing that can score from all three levels and remain composed through the contact to get the oldfashioned threepoint play opportunity youre watching ACC basketball on the CW brought to you by Ram trucks built to serve Kelly unable to complete the threepoint plays still with six points jacket still Trail by two but the fourth NC State turnover in transition stur ofan rebounded by Music horn Horns got 10 points three rebounds in this first half looking to add to it perhaps working on the Freshman welcome to the show and he comes up Applause Music short you got to take advantage here George George turn beautiful ball movement Kelly connects all starts with Georges ability to get into the painted area at that point you collapse the defense the Packer firmly in rotations Advantage Georgia Tech and Kelly gets a Sublime look from distance first lead of the game for Georgia Tech they were down 72 and 134 in the opening minutes Trail by as many as 10 at 2515 in fact they Trail by as many as 11 at 2 9 Music 18 final minute of

the final four the past couple years true 9 seconds left NC State just five for 18 from three middle Brooks to the basket 710 on the clock and middle Brooks will shoot two miles Kelly was in position understanding come helps side with middle Brooks as the dive guy you just have to step in and take the charge there not try and defend like Kelly sees it you got to get one more quicker step there offer your body up to the basketball higher Powers take that charge there was room for him to plan outside the anticipated he just didnt execute that final step in to let the contact and the momentum of middle Brooks do its job how will that go in a film room and from your experience depending on what the point of emphasis is with the coach but if Im sure coach with his IQ sees that says one more step in take the charge thats a turnover thatll do it for the first half Georgia Tech despite those last free throws closes the half on an 186 run chatted with DJ a couple weeks ago when I was here for the Virginia Tech game and the first thing he talked about was how college basketball feels different here in Raleigh than anywhere else hes been because of the passion of these fans educated too like they understand the game they understand all the games and all the teams that they support down here and at the Forefront obviously is mens womens basketball and football uh but theres a ton of great Sports here in the in the area Casey Morel quick shot no good rebound for Georgia Tex Kelly this an important 20 minutes here for both teams in for NC State this the middle game of a threegame stretch at home Miami Georgia Tech and pit every game counts every moment matters kaasi Reeves was silent in the first half gets his first points of the game 30 seconds into the second half and that feels big a ton of game obviously entire second half but to come out making shots after the run Georgia Tech went on to begin thats got to feel good for this group couple outside shots missed in the opening minute for NC State Dongo pads his rebounding stats then kicks it back out and Reeves cant go back to back Taylor challenged at The Rim by Dongo Here Comes George to Tech George filling the lane dishes and unable to finish danana danana lost his footing there coming down on the catch as he caught it then trying to elevate simply stunted first field goal attempt D only played a couple

hit it DJ horn at the line full pack shooting one shot the 142nd game of DJ horns college basketball Odyssey of course he was a high school senior here in Raleigh at Trinity Music Christian so he had some sense of what the fans were like Music so far would you say that Georgia Tech has overall done a pretty good job of handling NC States pressure no question no question especially early on with the struggles they were having George not this time rebound battle and diara emerges with Music possession horn why Music not dj 19 for DJ horn next highest scorer on his team Jaden Taylor with Applause eight Kelly made oconnell fall down unable to make the shot though and heres oconnell the other way morel to the basket tall effort from morcel hustl to get out and fill a lane and hes rewarded by okado who imp perpetuity has his head up looking for the early offense too strong on the layout to keep youre probably tired you got to keep running if youre the pack 80 run in the last 76 Music seconds DJ gives it to DJ horn feeling it thats a thats a bad shot thats a bad shot I know horn that green light thats a bad one as soon as he left his hands he knew it yeah thats a bad Applause

Nifty dribble step back OK Connell secures the rebound thanks to the blockout from Burns and Music diara Marcel going past Dongo Dongo gets a piece of Applause Music it Kelly hit a wet spot able to maintain possession everybodys got to be aware of that wet spot near the top of the key right now as we play on tend to shoot George to the foul line teardrop around and outs the onehanded rebound its a good move within the rhythm of the Music Applause Music offense horn to Burns and we get a foul I think theyre going to call it on the floor take a deep breath everybody eight nothing Run for the wol pack andc stay back up too 4644 dont forget to check out the CWs brand new hit series that critics are calling fresh and fiery and quote a damn good time watch wild cards this Monday night 98 Central or stream for free any time on the CWF before the first media timeout here in the second half Jordan cornette we had 22 shots taken from the field in the first 5 minutes 8 seconds so the pace is quick two teams only shooting just a hair over 30 combin though but DJ horn shot out of a cannon in this second half with those nine points couple triples burn unable to tip it in gets it back go tender and an unnecessary go tender from Dongo I I dont know if that angle was going to be a conversion once again well get another look here I mean maybe but either way not thinking it by not even giving it a chance taking it off the glass six points for Burns and its now a 10 nothing run for NC State Applause Jaden Taylor up in the pressure on Kyle Sturman and theres a bad pass intercepted by lonell the veteran takes it for Music two Georgia Tech had to know that NC State would have another run like this the question is how will the jackets respond gari wave it off traveling Music violation the look says it all its not exactly Jim beheim in terms of the facial expressions reacting to calls yet but itll get Applause Music there OK Connell inside for burns hes a big man but cant convert that time loose ball finds Kelly outside these are the same moves that these shots were typically fall a season to go theyre just not at the clip this year jackets needed that in a massive way resilient punch theyre always going to stay in an attack mode now chasing the early offense off of Misses Miles Kelly has now got 15 points leading away for Georgia Tech Nate George currently on the bench hes got 14 they got 13 and change left in the second Applause half oconnell looking to driving pass but Taylors going to need a shoot with a clock winding down he gets to the rim Burns back from in birs did a good job of carving out some of that real estate loitering on that low block simply catch a finish 8 points8 rebounds for DJ Burns hes been more active here in the second half stur it takes it ninth rebound of the night for DJ Music Burns Taylor blocked but fouled I dont know how Taylor got that open on a scene coming across the timeline nobody defensively on the left half of the floor getting back in transition third foul on gari he thought he had his own coming away from it I dont even think he knew anybody was in Pursuit ambitious elevation there from Jaden Taylor and and look the the foul wasnt egregious it honestly looked like it was more ball than anything but youre not going to reward a defense its lack of daal getting back and his beat down the floor by the ball and number three for the number 34 midd Brooks middle Brooks back in Burns solid good few minutes stretch there number 14 k Morel also back in for Applause Music diara Claude rebounds the Miss free throw one of two sixpoint lead for NC Applause State Wolfpack would love to get this one today would love to win Wednesday night against Pittsburgh before hitting the road for Wake Forest and Clemson pretty good look there good defense with Middlebrook staying vertical and not violating but still challenging and altering the layup Applause Music Applause opportunity Taylor takes it kicks it now hell take it make Music it how about this possession kapari met at the rim by middle Brooks shot clock at 25 might as well turn the clock off just let these guys continue to play 93 ft 1145 to go NC States open up 9 point long time veterans great atmosphere as always in this building and look at this graphic Jordan it has been truly a game of runs 134 at the top for NC State jacket scored 83 to get back within one back and forth we go on a seesaw yeah but this is not what coach Dyer wanted this was his big concern coming in is that this is an NC State team that can go on runs and we dont want to be chasing we want to keep this game playing at a certain Pace but not let it get away from us and right now the shot making a these explosive guards who can play at that pace and Thrive at that pace is overwhelming Applause Georgia jackets nine of 14 from the free throw line Applause Music now on Tuesday Georgia Tech was 15 of 17 Carolina was nine for 17 certainly played a part yes no question Georgia Tech win on Tuesday night was their first home win over a top three team since January of 1994 back at the old Thriller Dome Alexander Memorial Coliseum jacket trying to follow it up here on the road but NC state has an eightpoint lead and the basketball midd Brooks backing down Claud kapari rips down the rebound Tara kapari gliding all the way and he cant finish wow its like gravity just didnt apply he so long covers so much space the foul its on Georgia Tech they going to call are they going to call it jump initial signal from Isaac Barnett was a foul and thats going to be the call said o Connell got the ball and he was wrapped up from Music behind MC connells ball be hug from behind kapari gari couldnt keep the jump ball and the tie up without coming over the top thats four on kapari which is too bad for viewers who like guys that can fly that was different the way he moved down the floor nobody picked him up Music gazelle Casey Morel its a nice Music Applause move 11 for Casey double figures now in five consecutive games guards really coming alive for the pack propelling them to this lead as they continue to build now double Applause figures oh OKO rips it away and I didnt even hear the whistle in here its gotten so loud just a miscommunication here CL looking to hand it off start stman and quite simply cman didnt come to the basketball like claw needed him to and hon just jumped right in with the physical effort to rip it away Claude just picked up his fourth foul a minute after gari picked up his fourth foul quad stays out there though with 10 plus minutes to play jacket Shi into his Zone in this Zone you got to get more sell the touch thats where you collaps the defense at that mid post touch for Taylor missed the shot Kelly tapped the rebound off middle Brooks head he keeps it alive inside Morel catch and finish Applause Applause Music Coleman comes up short horn looking to add to the largest lead for the wolf pack its a 224 run over the last eight plus minutes these guards not taking their foot off the gas most especially off these misses pushing on that initial thrust looking for a bucket horn step back hes halfway down wouldnt stay even the Miss is looking good now for the pack offensively well said who is going to step up and stabilize things for Georgia Tech offensively miles Kellys a nice candidate give him a ball screen here let him op try to get downhill he threw it off more ss foot but we dont get a whistle Outlet pass to Taylor Applause Showtime time out George attack you are watching NC State basketball that if they dont handle business some of that may not matter yes theres a beauty in having five quadw opportunities right there you got to complete this one you got pit at home you finish that three game stretch which started with Miami then you can start to look to those quad one opportunities you cant take on any bad losses to this point inate truly has not no bad losses but they are 0 and five and quad one G yeah thats why thats up there its a very smart graphic because those are needed when the opportunity comes Evan leeler with Jordan cornette thanks for joining us on a busy Saturday in ACC basketball kind of reminded me like a round of 32 NCAA evening in the ACC games at 536 630 730 8 its a fun evening for ACC basketball fans go just picked up his third foul and now hes got just two points four rebounds and 17 minutes Jordan averages about 13 points per game Damon stomer asked yesterday is he okay and Damon just answer the three words yeah he playing yeah thats exactly I said it very matter of fact but you still got to factor in you dont play those 36 minutes of that game there is a little bit of rust thats how finetuned College athletes are and creatures of have it oh Connell rebounded by Kelly co tech down 14 needs to score points quickly Corner three for Reeves kaasi Reeves with his second triple of the half its good execution of the early offense an initial push from Kelly George back to Kelly then ultimately Reaves in the quarter good threepers kind of weave of sorts in half court Music Applause setting Taylor NC state does not want to just settle for outside shots right now especially quick empty possessions that allows more possessions and a team trailing by 13 to climb quickly back oh beautiful pass Better Block but a foul on Middlebrooks will send Dongo to the line after the timeout 730 remaining NC State on their home floor forget about it thats where the pack currently are right now now this game is far from over couple of those quick looks that arent highle shots allowing Georgia Tech to take the Miss and Chase the other way weve seen this game be run for run Georgia Tech a team that doesnt quit could find themselves right Music Music Dongo at the line out of the Music Applause Music Applause timeout smooth stroke for Dongo makes them both just a 59 free throw shooter for the season though back to a ninepoint game see if geordan tech can turn up the defensive intensity a little bit more patient here in terms of how they operate understanding assistant coach Jo Justice is now want yeah now now youre down to 12 now you got to go morcel the burns what do we got its a foul on Dongo and its his fourth so Dongo kapari and Claude all have four personal fouls a piece Claude is coming back Music in Ill tell you Ive been really impressed with DJ Burnss effort in this game today his ability to playj stay in this game play minutes that are you know right around I think theyll be happy with if they can play him around 20 right now hes trending towards 15 minutes but the rebounds how hes competed on the backboard how hes drawing the whistle to get some of these Georgia Tech defenders in foul trouble its the most rebounds hes had in the game in 2024 and it started right away there was an effort that was very present from him from the gate and then when you can sub him out for a guy like middle br theres like a ying and a Yang Vibe with how they approach the game youre a little bit faster more athletic more versatile middle Brooks so then you get the scoring the facilitator through which you play through his main artery when you have Burns in the game never thought about Burns in Middle Brooks as Yen and game but I like it theyre going to check this to see if Sturdivant beat the buzzer it was exceptionally close let me put it to you this way nobodys going to confuse middle Brooks for burns when they enter a room is that fair to say I think thats absolutely fair to say there is a contrast in uh stature just about Music everything 310 210 Music one10 I think its no good by everybody your hand about 3 100s of a Music second its a big shot would have brought Georgia Tech within seven if it stays they did not make a clear signal on the floor so its not clear what their initial decision was and worth reiterating 6 and2 minutes of in regulation is an eternity especially with how Thompson turby the game has played to this point wave it off says Cassel remains a 9point NC State lead when you get a basket waved off you just want to say son of a crit you that growing up was hard Tred doing it in the 80s you can catch an all new episode of The CW original comedy son of a crit Thursdays 98 Central only on the CW you can stream for free right now on the CWF but wait till this games over cuz its going to be interesting here these next Music 6302 about 20 minutes away too from tip off over in Winston Salem just about 90 minutes down the road to the West deacons and orange oconnell pounding the dribble finally gets it to Morel Burns sets the screen eight to shoot Taylor gets a touch horn hasnt touched the ball this possession Taylor forc to Fire and he knocks it down sometimes you just got to look and say good defense simply better offense thats just what it was one team shot at the buzzer of the shot clock do count NC State good point of St of it and one sort of it got okell on the hip and never relented as he pursued that angle taking a look on the other side I mean this is just Jaden Taylor spin to win and on the other side sternan sturdy on the drive keeping him on the hip and playing through the contact see what you did there one at the Applause line stent double figures three of his last five games coming into today that gives him seven points this evening threepoint play cuts the deficit to eight I tell you Jordan Techs not going to go away as they extend down to the Zone throwing a bunch of different defensive looks at the pack to try and confuse him Taylor wide open B no confusion clearly good swing good reversal lack of a sense of urgency for the defense to close out and Taylor steps comfortably into the threepoint line 19 for Jaden Applause Taylor Kelly answers its a big time move Shifty great use of the head fake to beat the initial defender in oconnell and play off two from the short corner with the floater offer to reiterate your Point Georgia Tech not going away NY State trying to keep him at a healthy arms Applause length both horn and Taylor 19 points a piece Taylors been the hot hand recently shakes his Defender and scores oh that was pretty Damon statamire not happy with that last possession Taylor thought about it morcel will take Applause Music it baddle for the rebound couple jackets there Reeves pulls it away from Claude 11point deficit four minutes to play stur it not there I give the ball back to Jadon Taylor see what trick he has up his sleeve here before the under four by the way oconnell just grabbed his sixth rebound to go along with six assists and five points and thats beautiful for NC State morels been the third scorer and the Wolf Pack extend their lead this group is a four guard front is a tough out they found their lineup kaazi Reeves has had the hot hand here in the second half its his third three since halftime Tech back within 10 three and change Applause Music Applause Music left DJ horn rebound Applause Kelly Kelly himself claw keeps it alive Time start to be a factor for Georgia Applause Tech and a foul before the shot its only the fourth team foul on NC State so itll be Georgia Tech ball when we come back I can promise you this J Taylor wants to keep playing basketball whered he go George get up go ahead finish You by Pacific wife creating Financial Security for more than 15 Music years student has been rocking here in Raleigh 7161 with 253 to play coming up Judah Mintz and Syracuse at the Joel Coliseum just about 90 minutes down the road on I40 to take on the Wake Forest Demon Deacons Judah mince number two in the nation in free throw attempts only the big man from Purdue Zack Ed has attempted more free throws this year wakes undefeated at home this year good ball game in theory get in the car maybe catch that one live Im Im thinking about it in case wormys voice gets tired late Ill be ready to be the righty out of the bullpen I thought I would have warn you out here partner for punishment want to do more work sit here with me for a couple hours do I go home or do I go to the Joel Coliseum to catch the last 10 minutes itll be a decision made on the drive home not this time for Reeves but Dongo is going to get to the free throw line cracked in the glass Tony yaza makes the call from the Baseline with 247 to play middle Brooks wholly unaware that the shot was coming off missed so badly Dongo was there to catch it before Middlebrooks could gain his bearings No F fault to Middlebrooks was that bad of a Miss Dongo staying with him Ben Middlebrooks has to go to the bench cuz he just picked up his fifth foul three points six rebounds in 15 minutes for Big Applause Ben now the folks here in Raleigh in late G situations love to make noise in pursuit of free chicken not today I dont know if theres two better words in the English language than free chicken free bacon free anything truthful thats true just free come on all Ill say is this body is no accident all right bacon chicken throw them all together put the bacon the chicken chicken in the bacon I dont care what Applause one one for two DJ Burns just grabbed his 10th rebound of the Music game really love the game oconnell has played his defense his energy his offensive decision making have all been wonderful Dongo grabs the rebound Georgia Tech needs points and they need him quick theyre certainly not out of this down nine with two and change left oh Nate George doesnt get the call but he gets the three just like that its a two possession game Damon stom ready to play defense Kevin Keats will take a timeout with 204 remaining it had been a while since Nate George had gone on the attack he cooled off a little bit hes got 17 points now on the night and of course he has been the man in late game situations this year think about the shot late at Little John they looked off The Defender as if he was going to pass it the step back I hes become a confident scorer now this was Tuesday which was massive with the off hand again hes a three LEL guy and then he hits a shot like this all of a sudden make it interesting the cross collects delivers I I would challenge George a little bit more aggressive in these final two minutes yeah five of 11 and look the percentage isnt great but its not bad but hes found something I mean hes three of four from three like you got to find a way to get him and Kelly the looks here down the stretch State led by as many as 14 at 62 to 4 48 Reeves on the floor three of five from three as well worth noting indeed pour to the basket its a quick shot but he does draw the foul two minutes on the clock thats just a defensive mental lapse I I dont know how you allow a gap like that with whats on the line two minutes remaining in the Music Applause game right Applause now Dongo just fouled out home fans love delighting when a visiting player fouls out the right left champ yeah I mean look at this angle like thats youre almost all the way home without any real resistance as horn got there almost unscathed but youre talking about the right left champ when you foul out so you know what I would do cuz I fou down plenty of times do a little foot fire I would never sit out so the official would come over and make me and I just shift back and forth off the right and the left how long you want to play the game we might get this a bunch cuz both Kari and Claude have four fouls a piece too smooth at the line for horn if you didnt hear Dongo just took a seat not his best game 57 rebounds 20 minutes but you see the tools in the 69 freshman from Sagal all right eightpoint game 21 for horn George gets it right back takes it some contact heavy contact shot theres no whistle there for George ooh and they call stur it reaching in from behind one and one here I think youre Parton Two Shots you tell me as we take a look right here I mean the hand on the hip it looked like some contact on the right arm the hand on the hip doesnt worry me as much but I thought there was contact on that right arm unless maybe I took the bait from a shooter trying to sell it our vantage point isnt ideal for that one but it did look like there was some content how you feel about DJ Horns kicks I dont understand fashion any anymore so I that could be the coolest thing going so I feel like I should just stay in my lane and try and analyze the game I respect that had to ask Im Im a big sweats hoodies pullovers I understand your wifes the real hero for finding your tww Polo its big time shes a real hero in life no question 90 seconds gone left I should say and uh Mell held him up absolutely the right call didnt allow stent to go behind his back number four in okell fishing through all Music Applause over this will be a one and one in a 10point game with a minute 31 Music Applause Music left Jordan NY state with only three turnovers today going to be the 18th time in 22 games this year that NC state has fewer turnovers than their opponent its incredible to only turn a basketball over three times nearly score 80 their season low previously is four so they could set the new season and play it to speed their play its its incredible missed the front end of the one and one unfortunately the fine print and the deal for free chicken means you need to have two consecutive misses at the line so Im apologize to all the fin folks here in Raleigh but they have not earned free chicken quite yet talk about motivating your group I dont know how you implement that into everybodys work life but dangle free chicken youre going to get the best version of everybody Taylor rejected gets it back and he stepped out of bounds 14 re J for the number 23 got have a quick hitter here down 10 time clearly not on your side with 62 ticks left in the game unless its a very clear layup path you got a hunt three here and you got to do a quick one in the game without be any wasted Music dribbles eightpoint game 538 left try to chase the steel if you have it early on force a timeout here thats good good action defensively NC state uses its penultimate timeout Music which gives us a chance to remind you that Hunter Salis and the deakes are getting ready for tip off over at the Joel like Forest had a disappointing loss midweek against Pittsburgh wake has been a different team Jordan at home versus on the road this year theyve dominated ACC opponents by about 20 points per game at the Joel but they are just 1 and3 away from the Joel Coliseum in ACC play including a loss at pit on Wednesday night but thats how you build your resume going out there and getting those Road opportunities within conference because it broadens the net you go out there and you win on a road against a team 1 through 75 in the net an opportunity for a quad one but it also just proves that hey we can win someplace thats not our home floor you find out with a lot of bubble teams really good at home they cant go chase them outside of their friendly confound Wake Forest is 5050 in the net right now so its a quad one chance for Syracuse tonight yep NC State will have a quad one chance at wake next Saturday afternoon at 400 Jeff capable will bring his pit Panthers here to Raleigh on Wednesday night for a 700 tip third and final game of this threegame home stand spanning the months and a quick foul will send DJ horn back to the lineer surpassed 20 points for the seven straight time this year got 23 as he heads to the line hes seven of seven at the stripe tonight DJ hor at the line for the wolb shooting two Music shots number 23 Mohamed diara in for Georgia T number three Carolinas open up an 11point lead on Duke second half just Music beginning be a good week for the fighting pit Panthers they can finish off your old team the Irish Kelly for three puts it in 44 seconds left theyre not going they are not going to go away look weve seen crazier things happen thats just a lack of defensive execution which is going to frustrate coach ke like fan out to Shooters should be able to get that quick of a three in transition understanding the only thing you want to eliminate is the easy threepoint Music look Jordan lets take a look at our player of the game brought to you by Progressive Insurance save when you bundle Auto home and motorcycle insurance visit progressivecom were giving it to Jaden Taylor cuz the sequence he had he had eight quick points in his stretch in the first half and in the second half three possessions in a row to help break this game open yeah he s the tone in both halves its that old Bill bellich mindset of how you start a game and how you finish or start a half and he absolutely did that set the tone for his group but theres been a lot of impressive individual performances you could easily turn and say oh what about DJ horn going for 24 points eight of n from the free throw line five rebounds what about case Morel struggled from three one of seven but 15 points on around 50 shooting and how about the rebounding of DJ Burns almost finishing with the double double if you can get two more points but already has garnered those 10 rebounds pretty impressive individual performances that add to the collective that Propel you to this sixpoint lead with under a minutes of play the feny state can continue to avoid turning the ball over which theyve been very good at today I like their chances offer them free chicken oh that let lets run its course all right fair enough I Ill tell you EV you tell any team in college basketball that youre going to only turn it over three times really doesnt matter if youre a welloiled offensive machine thats a bunch of shotmakers youre giving yourself a chance every time down to have a full possession youre eliminating the empty youre giving yourself a rhythm youre taking a shot every time down that is massive speaking of massive s foot tall transfer from Gonzaga via LSU Fon Reed thei that is Fon Mass what you say thats massive yes hes a big dude hes like 71 even to you thats a pretty big dude try to get me on the hiccup what you say Im not going back down the path and a whistle with 349 to go the fans here are ready to go home and cheer against Duke and Carol I was going to say theyre not even going to turn the game on they dont care well theyre ready to go cheer against both yeah theyre going to go about their night there is no other game on except this one and thats what I love about the pack families hey heres a nugget for you courtesy of our fantastic statistician the first time all season that NC state has had two different players score at least Applause Music 20 this pursuit of free chickens getting a little frustrating now Music theyre getting a lot of opportunities to chase them is not happening you can still pay for the chicken folks it doesnt taste the same doesnt taste the same but its still going to taste good again one for two close but no Music cigar and Kevin keiths takes a timeout before the foul 307 remaining G give me your 30000 view perspective on what Kevin Kats has right now and what NC State could potentially be over the course of the next month I think hes found a lineup a four guard lineup uh playing with with a burds playing with uh middle Brooks in there playing with a whomever but a four guard front with okell in that starting lineup and okell being the ball dominant guy as a distributor to allow those wings who are so dangerous that threeprong attack of Horn of Taylor and of morcel to truly Thrive theres an explosion to this offense that is very intimidating uh much like weve seen in years past where coach keatss squads have thrived theyre starting to capture that at an important part of the season do you enjoy projecting forward can you look at that upcoming schedule and tell me what you think I look at opportunity I its a must 27 no matter what anybody says 27 vers pit at home is a must that finishes his three game stretch that was important to not have any SLP bumps you want to get one of the two at w you got to get one on the road at Waker at Clemson you got to take care of Syracuse and Boston College at home which is no easy task and then you got a split versus Florida State and UNC youd love to get both in there that would have them in a really good spot but its possible with how theyre playing basketball its possible its its very gluttonous but thats how you need to think about it when youre going in players dont think about net rbii any the net ranking the quad one wins they think about winning its the coachs job to Circle and say what do we have to do but players must focus on on the floor the controllables control what you can and there certainty this was after a Miss free throw so he cant run the Baseline and he traveled yeah morels played enough basketball hes got to know better right there this would be fascinating if it were a sixpoint game but sevenpoint game 30 seconds again andc stayed is out of timeouts right now J Tech has one left well get you to Winston Salem as soon as this is Music finished jackets need points quickly George and Tech coming off the great win on Tuesday over Carolina running out of time sturdivan will get free throws which I guess for the fans here is another chance to go crazy Desperately Seeking free chicken you just think about the irony of Georgia Tech you know they they went at Clemson they beat Duke they beat Carolina NC State I going to be happy with look youre going be happy with losing if thats ultim where this goes its 21 seconds to determinate but theres been a level of competitive fight and Edge from Georgia Tech on the heels of that performance at home vers UNC that is promising Damon statamire with his no poultry for the fans Game Applause Face fivepoint game by the way I think the spread was seven and a half so there are certainly a lot of folks out there who might still be very interested in the outcome of these next 171 seconds and the fans get to do the Left Right chant again because kapari just picked up his fifth shout out to mallerie Jones on Twitter who said Caleb Martin was actually the first one to do the standing up left right left right chance just to mess with the home fans thanks for that tidbit Maller 25 now for horn season High 27 against Louisville now hes got 26 10 of 11 from the line Georgia Tech needs like a fivepoint play here and that does not exist Coleman gives it up Sturdivant kicks it Reeves needs it got it with three seconds left good for the folks who took the jackets and the points but ultimately its going to be NC States day diara and one with 12 to go and this might be entering bad beat territory Ill tell you what thats a dangerous pass the right pass but if that gets mismanaged no time leaves the clock and then Georgia Tech has a chance to come down and chase points with 3 seconds left but jackets are not giving up up here its a right pass and a smart pass on Morel to look ahead to Dr for the layup missed the free throw six points is the final margin Kevin Keats wins his 200th game as a D1 basketball coach Wake Forest in Syracuse is coming
