Music Isaiah Wong Jordan Miller North Shadowmere Nigel pack and look at Poplar the starting five for Miami Keyshawn Langley Mohammed Abdul Salam Keandre Kennedy Dante Tracy and boss lyta the starting five for the Spartan balls in the air Nigel pack comes down with it and itll be Miami ball to get us underway here this evening Miami started slow on Monday shot more threes in end game in which they did all of last season took 34 threes on Monday night Jordan Miller in the lane hook shot gets it to go well Jordan Miller I like Kyle how hes starting off aggressively attacking the basket I think thats one of the best ways that the team to get themselves started and in the scoring column early its going to be a theme and a story line to follow all season long but more often than not Miami will be undersized in each game in which they play they will be and well talk a lot about those coach Lara Nega talking about playing smaller ball this year undersized but theyre going to take advantage of their speed and quickness three in the corners good and the foul Keyshawn Langley the twin brother of Kobe Langley this time Keyshawn the senior out of High Point North Carolina has a three gets it to go and hell head to the line for an unconventional fourpoint opportunity fouls on Isaiah along in the corner Keyshawn Langley is a potent threepoint shooter a weapon from Deep gotta make sure you not only have your hands up but not allowing him to capitalize because hes also a great creature Langley a senior guard started seven games for the Spartans last season posted nine double figure scoring efforts in the spartanss backcourt free throw is no good Applause starts by one early one minute into play here tonight Music both offense is very similar a lot of motion above the perimeter Music Wong gets a high screen from omear and thats an offensive foul wellbeer couldnt set his feet a couple of quick fouls here on Miami high ball screen about five feet above the threepoint line and North Shadowmere couldnt get set well I like the intention but I think early on if Miami settles into this game were gonna have to pay attention to those details that not only omir is hitting the screen its Isaiah Wong waiting for it to be set and let the play develop Tracy and the lanes are the left hand comes back with a right cant get it to go down to the rebound his own mirror into the hand the left hand of Jordan Miller is good Applause mere Miami by one Music Kennedy stopping at the free throw line got caught shots locked down to five into the hands of Abdul Salam and he walked traveling violation into turnover Miami basketball with the defensive intensity for Miami turned up in that last possession hence they get the turnover coach leonaga liking what hes seen from this team early on the defensive end go back to Monday Megan this Miami team allowed 54 points that was fewer than at any point and in any contest last season they allowed 55 in the NCAA tournament to Iowa State allowed 54 in their opener to Lafayette on Monday shot clock at five Miller finds Poplar 43 from the win no good rattles in and out Kyle to your point I think defense go defensive identity is what this team wants to be known for theres gonna be moments when theyre over undersized but theyre gonna have to rely on their defense to create offense this year Kennedy a deep three and its good thank you Ill get both offenses very very similar here tonight neither team afraid to shoot it from distance Music Applause Keandre Kennedy is a flat out shooter a name youre going to hear a lot this this afternoon this evening Applause Music UNCG two of two behind the threepoint line Nigel pack has his first points of the night Mo Abdul Salam with a high ball screen into the corner here comes the Miami pressure defensively life to the basketball he gets blocked and thats going to be an offensive foul on Mo Abdul Salam who pushed off when challenging North Chad omear polite to letting it fly a mirror thats a matchup were gonna have our eyes on lights of omir on the inside I think whoever wins the battle on the paint their teams gonna have the advantage this evening Abdul Salam takes a seat Applause Music Applause wide open Jordan Miller whos going to fire away for three thats a bit too strong UNCG had three players underneath the rim it was into the hands of Keandre Kennedy who had it fall out of his hands a little miscommunication down on the Baseline its Miami basketball yeah by Jordan Miller just not able to knock it down but Miami with the opportunity to do it again miscommunication and a lack of communication should have been an easy defensive rebound for the Spartans so another life here for Miami Applause Nigel pack gets a high ball screen left side From omear Poplar with a shot fake Nigel pack pulls up and thats a D3 thats no good dorks handle mirror comes down with the offensive rebound and I believe theyre going to get boss light though with the foul 1559 on the game clock here in Miami theyll talk it over all square six aside Music boy a bit of a dangerous play as we went to break North Channel mirror and bonzalitha got tied up High Above the Rim fouls on like to uh but thats certainly a match of to watch here in this ball game this evening Megan yeah you see a very interesting matchup I think one thats going to dictate the outcome of this game and he is going to dominate the interior between lyta and omir but I mean from the Miami Hurricanes omir the presence that he has on the inside his pure gifted athletic ability I think is something thats really Gonna Make Me A Difference Maker for this team this year Anthony Walker checks in for Miami your channel mayor will take a seat and Jordan Miller there for the flush off the inbounds pass Music nice Baseline out of bounds play there by coach layer Nega to energize this team and energize This Crowd Michael Brown Jones in the game for the first time tonight for the Spartans of University of North Carolina and Greensboro as Bentley Joseph gets sent to check in for Miami its going to be a reaching foul on Nigel pack uh Ticky tack foul and Jamie lucky says there is enough there the foul by Michael back first team third look at Poplar takes to see Bentley Joseph A supremely Gifted athlete and Defender checks in for Miami an inbounds pass rattles around at the bottom of the rim on the Baseline Mikhail Brown Jones mind to travel got away with one a spin around jumper is good yeah the Miami Bens not happy with that I thought he shuffled his feet before he was able to put it on the floor but two points for the Spartans eight all five minutes in Brown Jones Langley Kennedy Tracy and Linkedin on the floor with a Spartan I screen for Isaiah Wong Anthony Walker starts right Applause Music raw in the paint creates a little breathing room with that left shoulder and he goes up and gets two thats just what Isaiah Wong does for this team he is such an aggressive playmaker hes always in attack mode and hes able to create something out of nothing that last possession was a pretty solid defensive stand by the Spartans but Isaiah Wong just had better offense and has he shown over the course of four years here in Miami Supreme body control when he gets in the paint around the rim thats a traveling violation on Michael Brown Jones heres another look at Wong there as he started into the paint I mean stagnant offense hes able to penetrate the seams of the defense its four people surrounding him hes able to rise and finish above the D well an excellent job to keep that left pivot foot for Isaiah Wong whos got the basketball in his hands Penny Miami nearly six minutes in to the first half here in Miami tonight and thats going to be a foul on Brown Joe well you know Kyle as we continue to talk about Isaiah Wong we know hes twotime preseason First Team all ACC honoree his name popped up on the naysmith watch list again this year I mean the honors and the accolades will continue for this young man what a gifted athlete and the Jerry award watch list as well nice little touch there for Anthony Walker Isaiah had 16 on Monday one of four hurricanes to appear in all 37 contests start at 36 in Miamis run to the elite eight last season okay and the paint up with the left hand no good rolls off for Tracy and another foul on the floor who are they going to get itll be the senior out of Orlando and the Robert Morris transfer Dante Tracy and both he and Wong got tangled up there in the backcourt well Tracy just ran right into him Music foreign Kyle and we know the gifted athlete he is and the potential NBA prospect that he is as well I think its interesting we have some celebrities in the house this evening some former NBA players tuning in for some hurricanes basketball this evening I bet we got Carlos Boozer to our left former Sensational Miami Hurricane Jack McClinton sitting by his side as well Music Harlan Beverly in for Miami Bensley Joseph hands it off to Isaiah Wong five on the shot clock Isaiah will fire away for three it was halfway down and Pops back out foreign Music s on the floor thats another traveling violation this time its Mo Abdul Salam we talk about the Miami Hurricanes how theyre undersized but what they are doing is theyre making up for that size limitation with their speed and their quickness the way that theyre able to cover territory to hedge out to recover quickly that actually caused a turnover in that last possession you have to really credit the speed not only the offensive end but the defensive end for the hurricanes Bentley Joseph running the point for Miami tightly by Kobe Langley Anthony Walker looking in North chandelier wants the basketball outside at 10 feet finds a wide open Bensley Joseph who goes up do we have a charge or a block its an offensive foul stepping in to take the charge was Mo Abdul Salam the forward graduate out of Nigeria for a nice penetration of our binsley but looks like the defense had two feet outside of that inner circle its going to be a charge just about every time solid defensive play by the Spartans Abdul Salam got there just in time and held his ground both sides with four fouls seven minutes into this game Music Applause Spartans havent scored in two and a half minutes nice crowd on hand finally get at the watsco center here tonight Kennedy works right got double team Langley with a pump fake goes Far Side Right Baseline and hits silky smooth the Southpaw and the senior out of High Point the twin brother of Keyshawn Langley the Langley twins seem to have basketball in their blood I believe its their father was one of their top threepoint shooters by percentage for the Spartans running right hand there by Anthony Walker at a late blocking call on the floor should send Anthony Walker to the line for a pair late call down low in the paint this is itll be Miami basketball I think theyre gonna tell Miami to take it out on the Baseline Anthony Walker pleading Case Case thought he should have been shooting too but it was after the initial shot so itll be Miami ball Baseline out of bounds Nigel pack checks back in for Miami replacing Isaiah Wong Michael Brown Jones will take a seat for the Spartans foreign The Freshman out of Huntersville North Carolina checks in for UNCG Applause Music or Chad omear near the basket contested shot Music only North Chandeliers strong down low and around the basket he was the first hurricane with a 15 rebound game in nearly two years on Monday started really really slow how about that pretty pass and a finish for Langley that was Langley to Langley I believe in that last possession little brother to brother chemistry a little symmetry between those two its almost like theyre on the same page Anthony Walker had to go off of his foot and he doesnt think so but Anthony Walker just dribbled it off his foot its a turnover by Miami lets take a break strength former Sensational player here at um Jack McClinton for fourth stars in the house here in Miami tonight former Sensational player here at um Jack McClinton for four seasons over 1700 points thats good for seventh in Miami program history how about the man to his right hour left Carlos Boozer had a terrific career in the NBA long time NBA ball player a pretty darn good college career as well Miami by two 11 43 left to play here in the half Music Dante Tracy will bring the ball up the floor for the Spartans Jalen white in for the first time here tonight working on the Baseline as Langley has it working left between his legs come back right now Baseline Financial pack tightly contested a floater with a right hand no good North Channel mirrored down with a rebound thats his third hes got four points Music both teams Distributing the basketball and the scoring early here tonight Jordan Miller Baseline Drive gave it right up and into the hands of Donovan Atwell the freshman Music Applause Abdul Salam finds Atwell and thats too strong gets the offensive rebound puts it up and that bucket is good count the foul strong interior play by Abdul Salam in that last possession good ball Movement by the Spartans solid offensive rebound and just powered up the Miami Hurricane fans are looking for the charge but on the interior it doesnt look like we had positioned Joseph outside of that into that interior line there there might have been a little contact but not enough Bentley Joseph will have to take a seat with two fouls Muhammad Muhammad Abdul Salam a forward and a graduate out of Nigeria started all 31 games last season in the post averaged six points for a rebound shot 53 percent from the field the Spartans have a onepoint lead nearly halfway through the first half in Miami tonight Applause Isaiah Wong back in for Miami well get Poplar with the basketball pack aint scared to shoot it there he goes bombs away from the left wing no good too strong off the left side one and done opportunity for Miami back comes UNCG Music range in the corner no good too short Music Sean Langley gave it a shot that time and the other end comes Isaiah Wong nearly coughed it up he slipped gives it back to omir who works down low strong and he finishes a second opportunity or are they going to say goaltending yes they are no bucket goaltending on North Chad omear following his own Miss collecting the offensive rebound that was close question is Megan was it still on the rim and oh I dont think so yeah I thought it looked like it rolled out there listen got right there on top uh I think thats debatable yeah yeah that was really close but strong effort by Norte omir and we love to see the intensity we love to see his rebounding efforts Spartans ball up one Miami threetone three turnovers last two and a half minutes a scoring ground of nearly two and a half minutes for the Hurricanes this is similar to their last outing against Lafayette Miami having trouble with the pace and Tempo not getting up and down the floor in transition Here Comes Miami in transition will the Poplar thats an offensive foul Tracys gonna need a moment still on the deck Applause we like out in the open oh thats another close call did Tracy hold his ground or was he leaning right well local Poplar gets into the paint and it looks like two feet solid as Poplar tries to take off to finish at The Rim Applause checking in for Miami now is the Freshman out of Chicago a fourstar recurrent AJ Casey six feet nine inches tall at 213 pounder a premier top 100 top 100 recruit out of Illinois are out of Illinois rather average 1910 rebounds five assists and three steals along with three blocks per game as a senior in high school had a lot of offers AJ Casey seeing his first minutes here tonight that threepoint opportunity no good but itll stay Miami basketball after it rolled off the fingertips of wogga Poplar AJ Casey committed to Miami over to Paul Gonzaga Memphis Michigan Ohio State among others in other words a big get Applause floater by Kennedy is no good weve got a push on the floor and I think theyre going to call it on AJ Casey fresh into the game he picks up a foul Lets help you take a look at Casey the freshman and he just Towers over all the veterans on this team yeah and welcome the size that he brings to the floor I mean Casey picking up a foul early on but uh hell get settled in and hell get adjusted I think coach laronega is looking for a little bit of size to change the Dynamics of the Interior play thats going to send Boston light to the line for a 11 the Spartans in the bonus nine minutes left here in the half makes the first UNCG leads by two so theyre on a six nothing run theyre over four from their last theyre over four from the field in their last four attempts but a six up and run over the course of the last three minutes you cant stop turn to the basketball over Spartans by three their largest lead of the night and now Jordan Miller calls for a timeout so Miami will have to regroup with 907 left well take a quick break and be right back if I am two minutes and 50 seconds Miamis got five turnovers in the last five minutes they havent scored in over three minutes uh what are you see in here early Megan yeah Im looking at the activity on honestly on the glass I think that UNC Greensboro has done an awesome job of creating Second Chance opportunities and thats really energized their all things theyre sticking to their game plan um and playing a solid first half Miamis also turned the ball over six times Miller hands it off to Isaiah Wong who stops keeps that right pivot foot down itll remain Miami basketball its early in the season Kyle so the team yes we talk a lot about what they did last year but coach Lauren Diego will tell you were focused hes focused on the president and this team is only two games in and theyre still trying to establish their chemistry and work out some of the Kings and I think thats what were seeing early on this first half from Miami now remember how how shaky it looked early in the season last year a nice floating jump shot by Nigel pack he connects they lost the UCF early on last year had a couple games go down to the wire until they really started to form some chemistry in gel and ultimately proved to be a sensational season for Miami to their first run ever to the elite eight in the NCAA tournament in March Madness thats an offensive foul on Jalen white the forward and the senior out of St Petersburg Florida the sixth foul on UNCG theyre in the bonus Miamis committed seven thousands and also I think Kyle Miami is at their best when theyre able to get out in the open floor and transition theyve not been able to do something you have to credit that Spartan Defense but Miamis got to figure out a way to generate faster offense not to get settled into that half court offense which really favors UNC Greensboro so your point Megan Mighty the second best team in transition in college basketball last year Jordan Miller left hand the floater rattles around and down he takes the lead Applause all right take the four nothing run here for the hurricanes Langley Works off the high screen Music lighter down low a bit of a flop on the Block I think coach larenanga trying to get the attention of Jamie lucky longtime veteran official wondering about the no call Music Applause Music Applause Music Applause Music guns are really forcing Miami to execute in their half court offense and as we talked about thats been a struggle for the Kings theyve got to find easy baskets in transition and easy layup for sizuno hes sophomore and the saint Bonaventure transfer Timeout on the floor UNCG rolling a little bit in transition Wong coughs it up the University of North Carolina Greensboro Spartans lead Miami by three not what you want here coach leornega but to overcome those troubles are going to have to figure out how to go back I think and try to establish their interior they had a lot of success early on with omir in the first half I mean in the in the early parts of the first half so well see in some offensive rebounds Isaiah Wong pulls up and he misses entirely Applause Music in addition to the oh for five from threepoint territory the Spartans have nine points off of seven of Miami turnovers they lead by three six and a half left to play for the first half of the watsko center Music Applause Baseline Drive Abdul Salam with the left hand a bit too strong Jordan Miller has the rebound Miami in transition off of Miss swugga Poplar wide open cant connect North Chad omear back on the floor for Miley did he step on the Baseline yes he did listen nortado mirror his energy his effort has got to be contagious amongst his teammates theyve got to figure out a way to energize themselves I love how hes in pursuit of the rebound he needs a couple of his teammates to follow him in that effort Miami trailed 30 to 20 in 28 to Lafayette on Monday night and it wasnt until Isaiah Wongs Rim rattling dunk about Midway through the second half did they start to find a little bit of energy theyre struggling from distance both teams love to shoot the three balls loose on the floor on the deck weve got a jump ball itll remain Spartans basketball but uh youre right I mean somebodys got to inject a little life into this ball Club Music uncgs got a little fire prow power they love to shoot the three after two for seven tonight yeah and with a team like UNC Greensboro were seeing they play a very disciplined style of basketball and obviously Miami is the favorite in this game but you let a team like UNC Greensboro stick around and gain confidence thats the most dangerous thing that you can allow Kennedy dribble drive he walked as a turnover Applause and as were approaching the end of the first half here its not about getting it all back at one time with this Gap Miamis down 18 to 21 but its about possession by possession a stop in a score a stop and a score lets see if Miami youre able to get the stop can they convert on the offense event well the Miami scores on the floor Jordan Miller North Channel near Nigel pack and Isaiah Wong combined to average 60 points last season all four on the floor in addition to Wooga Poplar right now Nigel pack fires away a wobbly shot and a contested shot is no good now in transition Applause boss like to Spartans by five that UNC bench is turned up well go Poplar on the other end look at the athleticism maybe the most improved hurricane from last season throw it away Miami basketball heres another look at that boss dunk in transition Miller and Wong just lost them and they threaded the needle on that assist lets be clear boss is not the fastest player on the floor but what you think what you can control is your energy and your effort and he is given a little bit more and thats something that I think coach larnego is going to be fired up about as halftime approaches and they have a little discussion about that play if not now definitely in film credit Keandre Kennedy The Graduate transfer out of UMBC for the assist right down the scene Music Rises and fires four quick points for Wagga Poplar look how popular is like if you arent ready I am two consecutive baskets by popular hes asserting himself on the offensive end hes an impressive young man the sophomore out of Philadelphia unlimited potential for these hurricanes High screen by Abdul Salam Miami trailing by one heres a three in the corner is good Keandre Kennedy graduate student from UMBC started all 31 games for the retrievers last season now a turnover Kennedy in transition stops and fires is blocked by omir Kennedy has it back Applause the Spartans reset leading by four Music its Kobe Langley with the basketball Tracy will fire away a rainmaking bring thank you 3 30 left to play Spartans quickly back out to that seven point lead theyre playing hard okay we talked about the threepoint efficiency and the ability of Langley on the perimeter something thats going to be a Difference Maker Logan Poplar try to make it seven in a row for Miami hes got the basketball back Jordan Miller for three on the wing and its good first threepointer made for the Hurricanes here tonight Bentley Joseph will check back in the moment for Miami three minutes left to play on the clock its 2925 UNCG over Miami Tracy will pull up a heat check for three no good rattles in and out ball is loose and thats going to be a foul on The Graduate Muhammad Music Beck inside the watsko center 257 left to play here in Miami thats the Spartans out of UNC Greensboro by four over the Hurricanes Miami unable to get to the freethrow line just one of seven from threepoint range out shooting the Spartans in terms of field goal percentage 5748 but theyve committed too many turnovers as well thats absolutely the story the points off of turnovers I mean you know UNC Greensboro has way too many 12 points off of Miamis nine turnovers Miamis first free throw of the night is good Isaiah Wong has now tied John Salmons for top 20 in scoring in program history Junior guard out of Piscataway New Jersey makes a pair mine is back to within two what a player the fourth year Juniors been here at um tested the NBA Waters last saw last offseason elected to come back to Coral Gables heres an alleyoop that was way out of the reach Langley to Langley they attempted that connection again but Keyshawn threw it away Kyle you talk about Isaiah Wong and his NBA prospects theres no question what hes able to do its a talented offensive player but I think hes back to improve upon his ability to defend thats the next level I think on both ends of the floor for him Nigel pack too short no chat or Mir with the offensive rebound pack will fire away again it was halfway down and came back out Music remains a twopoint lead for the Spartans Langley left Baseline Up and Under for bus all right good look nice finish an easy finish Music Applause Music long just got caught up down low in the paint he traveled Music difference for Miami and when theyre playing well when theyre kind of stagnant is when theyre doing less than oneonone basketball so for Isaiah Wong we know what he can do of course he can score one on five but is that the best shot that might not be the best opportunity looking for a little bit more ball movement a cohesiveness in the Miami offense you have yet to find a real Rhythm offensively here tonight 3127 Spartans lead heres a step back three from the corner how about that DeAndre Kennedy into the face of Heartland Beverly that was just better offense I thought Harlan Beverly defended that very well now Jordan Miller for three on the other end from the right wing hes two for two from distance tonight Millers got 12 Miami Trails by four a minute 15 left to play in the half Music Applause Spartans nearly turned it over now down low and eight footer no good off the left side of the iron down with it omir into the hands of Wong under a minute left to play Wong looking hands it off to omir who spins right off the glass a wild shot was no good Music DeAndre Kennedy from the logos too short omir has the defensive rebound 35 on the game clock 22 on the shot clock Miami cannot hold the last possession they can take it down to about 10 seconds left Nigel pact working left wing heres a three Harlan Beverly is good Beverly Monday the off injured hurricane has the Hurricanes within one with six seconds left to play Langley working with the right hand cornered three back up top left wing at the buzzer is no good well go to the half Miami trailing by one big trailed by two on Monday weve got a good one here in Coral Gables tonight Music eight points three of four from the field hes got a rebound for Miami Jordan Miller pacing the way hes got 12 point point territory too many turnovers and theyre not collecting enough points off of the turnovers that they force I totally agree well see a new opportunity with the second half just starting off here and I would say another thing to keep your eyes on a sign of how youre attacking the basket is free throws Miami only went to the free throw line twice in the first half I think they can do a little bit better to help generate some office here in second half lets see if the Spartans can keep up the pressure Nigel pack out of the recess four threes from the wing thats a solid start you know Nigel pack but prior to arriving to Miami he was primarily a two guard hes used to taking on some of those scoring abilities hes very capable like the trapped underneath goes up too strong Second Chance opportunity for Mo Abdul Salam is no good Miamis got to lead for a first time in a long time back to back threes out of the break Music thats the pace in the tempo that Miami needs to be playing with they find the most success when theyre up and down quick shots thats Miami basketball from down one to up five theyve doubled their amount of Threes that they made in the first half thats a push on Old mirror Hotel doesnt like it so Pax starts it from the left wing what a quick trigger nice setup there and then back to back I mean nothing but Ned Poplar wanted to foul nice try young fella contact was a little too late Music well Miras got two fouls hes got to be relatively careful Langley for three quarters both teams heating up from the threepoint line overdue all of a sudden Mindys made five threes Spartans have made six mining five of 12 combining making three to three boy what are those boys drinking the half whatever it is it needs some more of it give it to them for breakfast they have turned it up they hit another one Mike Jones is going to call timeout trying to cool him off Langley with the left hand no good collects his own offensive rebound right out of the claws of omir poplars got the tip they have an entirely different focus and level of intensity that youre seeing from Miami to start the second half Poplar behind the back from the Block no good Miami tried to start the half for four Music Applause crowd after poplars behind the back dribble High screen Langley inside right hand is too strong for Abdul Salam here come the hurricanes in transition pack from the logos to short Millers got the offensive rebound Mike Jones might need a timeout he wants a timeout hes begging for a timeout hes gonna get it UNCG takes a timeout Miami was down one at the half they have come out they have exploded they lead by seven Music can happen it was only a matter of time before some of those buckets started to drop for Miami Miami down one at the half theyre up by seven outscore UNCG by eight an impressive way to start the second half for the hurricane so Mike Jones called the timeout see what he drew up there Spartans back in it defensively UNCG totally took Miami out of the Rhythm in the entire first 20 minutes Tracy underneath to light up and under the right hand is good youre right and Kylie talked about it he talked about the pace in Temple I mean Miami scoring just about 30 some points in the first half I think thats significantly significantly under where they want to be from a point for game total so you know a faster Pace favors the hurricanes Poplar into the corner for Miller fires away no good too strong Applause hes got the rebound he had nine in the first half my ball screened by lighter Tracys double team light up for three on the wing rattles in an hour good luck there for light to the big man who can shoot it from out there now pack will use a screen from omir picking pop back to the rim with the right hand no good foreign s going to push it a little bit Langley Music Applause Music through the paint with the right hand and falls off the left side of the ring for Michael Brown Jones who had to set a good portion of the first half with two fouls now omir will go to work spins Fades away good body control down there on the Block over top Mikhail Brown Jones who was in his face fading away for a bucket oh mirror solid footwork and then just Supreme athleticism to finish that last play it was a lot more conviction to Miamis offense here in the second half and theyre going to get Isaiah walled for a foul that a media the under 16 Miami by seven were carvana the company percentage well as you say its in the blood you know shoot or shoot and its awesome when you have a pair of twins and have gotten the lessons handed down from Dad so hes doing theyre doing Dad proud this evening cool to watch those guys the Twins play with one another Keyshawn number zero Kobe number three just the correct things before we went to break thought the foul was on Isaiah Wong it was credited to Jordan Miller and after we got a look at it during the break it would make sense his left leg connected with Dante Tracy which initiated the trip so Tracy makes a pair from the freethrow line and Miami has themselves a fivepoint lead this 40 left to play in this ball game here in Miami tonight Music Colby Langley back for the scores table to check back in for the Spartans Miller High arcing lefthanded quarter no good gets his own offensive rebound Isaiah Wong 43 Applause a little something different here in the second half Megan there is a different Focus theyre playing with very you know strategic intention I think for Miami theyve turned up and locked up what we saw in the second half on Monday too there was just a different energy Mattel Brown for three next on the other end answers the bell for UNCG theyre back to within five back and forth we go Spartans had a one point lead at the half well this Spartan team is gritty Miamis going to go on runs but UNC Greensboro has really withstood most of the runs that Miami has tried to throw at them Tracy with a foul a little too much with the right forearm there working on Nigel pack Juans got seven Jordan Millers got 14 and six North Channel mayors got six and nine strong second half away from a double double Nigel pack to Jordan Miller for three Applause from Beyond the yard here in the second half Applause Anthony Walker set the check back in for the canes every time the Spartans answer the Hurricanes answer right back Miller leaves his feet inside Brown Jones Up and Under no good fight at The Rim North Chad omear comes down with a rebound takes it into the front court all the way Coast to Coast Lord Chad OMeara cannot connect and now he commits a foul and for OMeara its going to be his third personal with 1404 left thats a tough exchange because merge had a mirror here and the Open Court decides look Im gonna take it oneonone go to the rim he thinks he actually had some contact on the way up but instead he gets the foul on the other end of the play he was indecisive after he got the rebound as soon as he got to the front Court but if he was a little more decisive and just went Coast to Coast to start probably had a better chance to score let the defense catch up with him a little bit mine is by eight its their largest lead of the night after trailing by one at the half Music Langley to Kennedy Kennedy stops and pops for greens Keandre Kennedys got 12 four of seven from threepoint land and the degree of difficulty on the shots that hes been able to convert on I mean it is Elite he has really been in his offensive bag this evening boy will just not go away not go pack inside the threepoint line Beat from the right wing free throw line extended offense is picked up here in the second half the locks go Center and Cole Gables tonight Music Kennedy who he thought about it he thought about it on the left way he stops it pops again a hierarchy three is no good nearly banked at home Miamis got numbers what the Poplar goes up theres a foul theres a block Poplar will go to the line for a pair the foul will be on Tracy itll be his third explosion in the open floor packed to popular that could have gone either way for me I think so it looks like two feet outside the line I actually thought he was swearing up a little with the right hip could have gone either way gonna get three fresh bodies on the floor here for UNCG boss light to will check in Taco makes the first so too will Keyshawn Langley and Donovan Atwell The Freshman out of Huntersville North Carolina I really like the energy that hes brought to the floor hes been a bit of an offensive spark for his team he had that quick fournothing run in the first half that kept Miami in it there was a chance UNCG had a chance to run away with a little bit in the first half and create a real problem for Miami there was a point there where Poplar kind of kept Miami right in it Music so back and forth we go Miamis got a nine point lead thats their largest of the night Langley looking down low hes got brown Jones He spins and fires with the right hand at The Rim nice pretty nifty little move during the pink started right came back left High arcing hook shot there Music popular on Brown Jones gets to the ring thats an offensive foul that was the Freshman Atwell who stepped in that time gets a big high five for Mike Jones well thats what I think the Spartans have done they did well in the first half Miami with a lot of oneonone basketball a solid move I thought there by Poplar but the defense just a little bit quicker to react and pick up the charge Applause Music the worry without Kennedy hes giving fits all night long theyre gonna have to worry about Michael Brown Jones though the junior out of North Philadelphia Pennsylvania in the VCU transfer who put in 54 games in two seasons at VCU hes been a problem in the paint for Miami tonight well I think UNC has an opportunity and Mike coach Mike Jones is honing in on that the interior play of his team has been pretty strong they can pound the ball inside they might be able to find an advantage on the interior I gotta go right back there Harlan Beverlys back in for Miami now Jordan Miller has got himself a takeaway in transition on Langley hop off the glass with the left hand doing it all himself he steals it in the back court sawkiss off the glass Langley brothers are back out there for the Spartans one of them is working on Wong liked it underneath good dish by Keyshawn Langley and the Finesse the touch that he had to finish at The Rim nice play 10 45 left to play Miami by five Music and stapled Jim larenanga motion offense Anthony Walker for three is no good hes had a really really rough go over here to start his season Anthony Walker really struggled to find his rhythm but he continues to be that energy and continues to be a strong teammate Brown Jones with the right hand again no good gets his own offensive rebound and puts it back Music its a game of run so Miami gave a power punch to start the first half but UNT has answered the call theyre punching right back calls the timeout with 1014 left to play in Miami by three for Miami behind the threepoint line here in the second half they connected on three in the first half theyve got five in the second half but were all square how about that UNCG five in the first half three in the second yeah we like to see how Miamis heated up from the threepoint line I think theyre doing a better job of moving the ball around the perimeter and a lot of their threepoint um attempts have really come from quick and their offense come from that transition offense its a threepoint game Coachella called the timeout didnt love what he was watching well see if they draw up coming out of the timeout Isaiah walked 13 feet away cant hit but he gets his offensive rebound now fire away for three second time tonight that Wong has come up totally empty on the threepoint opportunity an air ball from threepoint range this evening UNCG thought even double dribble before he even got the second shot off Tracy checks back in replacing Keyshawn Langley Music Im just going to come down to the wire the Spartans refuse to go away Miami a couple of minutes ago had themselves a nine point lead its right back down to three Applause Joseph out there for Miami probably their best defender and a guy that brings a lot of energy looking him all up in Tracy way atop the threepoint line and theyre gonna get Joseph for the foul I think thats tough I thought Tracy actually pushed off on Joseph not sure what he could do better to defend in that possession look at Joseph moving his feet Tracy with a little hesitation in out I thought that right arm extended hey lets play a little bit both guys are going at it pretty good Applause Music Joseph is right on the right hip Trace Kennedys back in there for the Sparks Tracy right wing Music threepoint line extending now down low Abdul Salam that is a turnover and a shot clock violation good defense by Miami they got the Energizer bunnies out there now between Anthony Walker and Bensley Joseph some guys that could really inject a little life and juice into the offense and the defense theres no child o mere back into the game as well with his activity on the inside I think his Energys also contagious Kyle Harlan Beverly Isaiah Wong will fire for green hes not scared to fire away air ball one a minute ago now he connects on the other end Music I think Wonga subscribes the philosophy is a you cant score if you dont shoot so hes gonna let it go hes got ten hes two for four from three three of seven overall Tracy in the paint with the right hand lost it and now sizano has it the elbow Tracy for three looks good rattles in and out a break for Miami Joseph is looking has Beverly quick trigger three is good pounds his chest looks at Coachella on the bench now they come to life a little bit here in Miami well the bench just erupts from Harlan Beverly we talked about how he missed games last season do a struggle with his with his back injuries but hes come in looking like he has not missed a beat UNCG has wanted to respond to the three all night long down low on the Block Abdul Salam has it taken away three seconds on the shot clock they got a fire away on the Baseline he stepped on the Baseline another turnover by the Spartans Miami leads by nine its a little Grit back here with the watsco center at 6455 Miami has taking that lead back up to nine the most theyve been up in this ball game here tonight or time for the most but uh Megan every time Miami kind of runs a little bit Spartans kind of grabbed that leash and say not so fast were coming back they do theyve been able to absorb whatever runs Miami has thrown at them and from Miami every time they go on a running theres a direct correlation between the intensity that they bring and focus on the defensive end and their ability to produce offense Applause Miami basketball out of the media timeout again their largest lead is nine its at nine right now Beverly up top for Anthony Walker Harlan Beverly for the fifth time in his career has made a pair of Threes here tonight hes never made three omear far Corner Bentley Joseph fourth room but Miamis on fire here in the second half they could not be stopped oh threepoint land Music and its the swag that Miamis playing with it makes him so much fun to watch here we go oh boy a rim rattling dunk for Anthony Walker yes sir thats long overdue for Anthony Walker weve been waiting to see that from you young man all of a sudden Miamis got a 14point advantage Applause and they come to life here with the watsco center Applause Music Tracy on the Baseline its going to be another foul on Harlan or defensively Joseph rather heres the dunk by Walker Applause he cocked back and exploded at the Finish immensely Joseph takes a seat Nigel packs back in omearas got six and 11 looking for a doubledouble Music Applause Lefty shoots and connects Tracy hits I had something to say along the Baseline Music well competitive juices flowing I think for both teams both teams doing some talking on the floor to one another all in good spirit though back lifts misses he aint scared to shoot it cold off the bench on the Baseline 15 feet out oh God here comes Kennedy Miamis got a close eye on Keandre Kennedy whos burned him all night long from distance Mo Abdul Salam gets in but he cant connect right at The Rim hes kind of having his way with Miami down low there in the paint had a really good look at an easy bucket Music just couldnt get it to go North Channel near hands it off to Nigel path Anthony Walker down low weve got a foul Music Abdul Salam his third personal foul as Jordan Miller checks back in for Miami Keyshawn Langley and Jalen white the forward senior out of St Pete Applause back in for the Spartans another good turnout by the student section youre in Miami tonight Isaiah Wong floats one up there and he misses more Channel nearly tipped it right back to him chance for the Sparks to creep a little closer the lead is at 12 for how long a little bit longer as Brown Jones misses the Deep three Harlan Beverly hes never hit three before but he has here tonight its been a long time coming for Harlan Beverly whos been so injury prone over the course of His Four Seasons here in Miami on Monday he connected on his first threepointer in 674 days here tonight for the first time in the Miami Hurricanes career hes made three well hes showing us as his full offensive Arsenal this evening but Beverly stepping into it too and saying you better guard me from out here he can knock it down heres the thing from Miami to Megan theyve never really known within reason what they have in Beverly the fourth year Junior out of Detroit he came out of high school hes a sharpshooter but hes had some debilitating back injuries hes still not all the way back hes not going to be able to give you 25 minutes a night maybe he will at some point this season but he could be a Difference Maker for this team yeah he can be that spark that theyre looking for Off the Bench and listen if youre not sure what he can do he said youre gonna find out tonight Miami leads by 15 now Huang working on Brown Jones heres a three no good a contested three maybe not the shot that Coachella would like to see from Isaiah Wong Langley tried to work it down low to Mikhail Brown Jones it was off the fingertips of a hurricane Applause so it remains Spartans basketball this is very very eerily similar to what transpired here on Monday Miami was down at the half they needed a couple big plays to get a little juice going to the second half which is exactly what theyve gotten and now all of a sudden theyve got a 15point lead now Nigel Paxton get called profound the 15point lead law might be comfortable Miami cannot necessarily relax theres still a lot of time left in this ball game they have to maintain their energy and their focus because weve seen how UNC Greensboro just will not lay down theyre not going away this is a gritty team theyre not going to give up Music oneonone chance for Dante Tracy Vincent Im Joe Peck having a conversation with Jamie Luckey pleading his case just telling him listen Im not doing anything wrong Music all right stop attack Scott two fouls nobody on the court right here for Miami and potential foul trouble Bentley Joseph has four so two does North Channel near nor Chad with four is going to be problematic throughout the season coachellas talked about that hes the guy thats got to stay out of foul trouble you need him on the floor yes he is their primary interior presence wow layup thats pretty a tough finish just kiss it off the glass in the right spot the explosive third year sophomore Electric in the Big 12 at Kansas State the most improved player in that conference last season Tracy will head to the line pack had 16 on Monday hes got 14 here this evening Jordan Miller leading all scores with 19 well Pat came into 40 right on his own to start off the second half is kind of getting the scoring from the the suspects that you would I think would do it for him right I mean Isaiah Wongs got ten a quiet 10 its been a quiet night for Isaiah but Millers got the 19 packs got the 14 omearas been quiet just hasnt played a lot because of the foul trouble hes played 26 minutes but uh hes had to be careful due to all the foul trouble as Tracy hits a pair 7461 421 left to play approaching the under four media timeout oh thats a long inbounds pass by Isaiah Wong that was taken away by Michael Brown Jones and now with three is no good but Brown Jones gets the offensive rebound he misses a couple of opportunities for light up another chance for the Spartan then four or five chances and couldnt get a bucket now Harlan Beverly nearly has it taken away Miami wants to slow things down a little bit but Nigel pack will work in the lane he turns it over with a 13point lead Miamis got all the opportunity here just to slow things down theres a bucket for the Spartans its an 11 point lead really no need to push the ball so quickly in transition when a disc juncture its just a uh a game you can play with time Timeout on the floor Miami by 11 340 left to play 63 Miami lead with 3 40 showing on the game clock here at the watsco center in Miami tonight alongside Megan Perry and Kyle siloff Good To Be With You game number two for UNCG game number two from Miami and playing out for Miami at least so far uh rather similar as to how it played out on Monday slow to start and whats been an electric finish it has been I mean we talked about Miami kind of slow out the gate and both teams really just back and forth back and forth but Miami has pulled away theyve locked into their defense and that threepoint line has been good to them in the second half the media timeout was triggered by an injury to boss lyta the senior has just finally taken the seat over on the UNCG bench but all the way at the end of that bench extending that left leg Harlan Beverly misses from Deep for the first time tonight Music it off to Tracy Spartans are gonna have to do some really quick scoring and that aint gonna help as North Channel nearly came down with a rebound but its its Mikhail Brown Jones who gets it and puts it back up leads back to single digits for Miami plenty of time Spartans need some stops this is about in the game clock management a great test for Miami to see how they respond Music Jordan Miller was fouled by Jalen white the scene Miamis committed nine fouls thats just the fourth foul committed by the Spartans here in the second half 253 left 20 on the shot clock substitution for the Spartans Kobe Langley will replace Jane and white Music inbounds goes Isaiah Wong Applause attack with the right hand in the paint back up to Wong who spins elevates and fires its no good good luck though for Wong he can just hang in the air Applause yeah hes got a good one two seconds in the air before he makes a decision just creates really good looks for himself the three from Langley the Lefty on the way is too strong the back of the iron into the hands of Harlan Beverly Applause Miami can slow things down a little bit with 210 left leading by nine eight seconds on the shot clock underneath pretty play Oh near to Wong Isaiah might have gotten a finger in the right eye but Wong gets a bucket the lead is 11 and that just about puts it on ice for Miami here this evening as they look to improve to 20 in a win over the University of North Carolina Greensboro Spartans out of the Southern Conference Tracy floats one up and he gets fouled got Isaiah Wong off his feet and he the vet and Isaiah Wong he knows better hes shaking his head as he got up Tracy with a little step back through the legs going to trip to the Breather line Music Miami is four for four from the free throw line tonight theyve shot just four free throws this will be the 12th and 13th opportunities for the Spartans their 911 to date Music no good well four for four from the free throw line is a drastic improvement from the other night Kyle in which this Miami Hurricane team really struggled from the line if theyre going to need more opportunities I think with the undersized lineup is they interpreticularly conference play theyre going to need more opportunities to create offense weve got to get more looks from the freezer line Tracy missed them both and the Spartans come into the foul Michael Brown Jones its his third team fifth here comes the full court pressure by UNCG to try to create a couple of turnovers here in the final 90 seconds Music he wont get to the paint now brings it out near half court Applause Music what are you making this one tonight Megan your impressions of both these teams yeah I think that Miami is learning a lot about where their scoring opportunities can come from that they have a lot of weapons on the floor so whats required for their focus and their intensity to do things just like that Isaiah Wong we know what he can do on the floor but I think the question mark is about the other pieces to the puzzle and where do they fit in and what does it take to ignite that offense and they learned a little bit more about the importance of their defense to do so Isaiah Wongs got 15 and for Isaiah Wong he needed 13 tonight to go to number 18 on the alltime scoring list at Miami hes done so successfully its a 14point lead final 30 seconds here in Miami tonight they come to their team at the Wasco Center and Spartans commit a foul foreign scoring there on the left side of your screen a big round of applause here in Santa watsko Center Davon Reed Mike Whitman in front of Wong now Joe Wiley and Willie Allen in the rear view mirroring Music Applause Miami can just about dribble it out shell have to hoist one shot I got a wellplayed game by Miami and I think also deserves a shout out to the Spartans what UNC Greensboro came in and did established themselves early theyve got a bright upside for whats to come for them this season its all the Miami Hurricanes start their season 20 with a 7965 victory over the UNC Greensboro Spartans uh Megan started slow but a flurry of a finish and thats going to make coach Ellen company happy yeah I think they have something to be excited about going into the weekend be able to get another win under under their belt is always awesome to get the W so congrats to the Miami Hurricanes when the solid effort this evening nice crowd and attendance here with the watsco center tonight Isaiah Wong had 15 top 20 in the alltime scoring list Jordan Miller had 19 Nigel packed had 14 Michael Brown Jones led the way for the Spartans along with
