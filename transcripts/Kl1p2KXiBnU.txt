without those two guys so far this year yeah they did that in their scrimmage early on before the season started they did it in their first game of the year and theyll have to do it again here tonight in their first true Road game of the season here in WinstonSalem Ryan young jumps back into the starting lineup for the Blue Devils Kyle filipowski wins the tip Tyrese Proctor at the controls out of the way we go on a big night of ACC hoops and we talked about that road Appleby matchup theres two r d guarding ones here foreign Music ER told us this morning and we started out for D now in his career roach has never been a great threepoint shooter but he is much improved from threepoint range this year do 102 Wake Forest Eaton core I mentioned Appleby to last Monday sprained that ankle in practice and children second leading scorer got his own Miss and the finals with the sophomore Matt Marsh the seven put one big man from England wait thats a lot of opportunities the Duke Blue Devils are an outstanding rebound James again especially with offensive reasons to check out the Blue Devil starters Ryan s for from Northwestern attorneys starts the Duke scoring and boy you think he might need to have a big night for dude thats gonna be a tough matchup for Andrew Carr who now tries to return to favor Lebanon to Delaware transfer on an update missed the button through some contact he wanted a foul 71 and young at 610 harassing him but thats gonna be a tough matchup because philipowski hes seven feet tall but he moves very very well hes then yeah car has given up a couple of inches to it very quick oh nice from Deep around Mitchell but another offensive rebounds he Forbes told us to shoot around hey were not a good rebounding team he was very concerned about that against dude and the post comes up short well defended by Proctor Gilbert in that situation hes just got to find the open man Im not sure that thats going to work very often against Proctor Proctor the six feet five 175 pounds Grizzly has himself mismatched inside against Philip house instead its young going to work uh Marsh young with his first two and young is hes not like Philip ask so positive is really a perimeter player and a sevenfooter spot a young is a back to the basket low post kind of guy very experienced Applause thats got to be the game plan for Wake Forest every time down Bill Ruth has touched the ball handled it extensively and hes taking a couple of shots 44 in the early going just over two and a half minutes in Rose runs off a screen which Im trying to stick with him post entry for young back out Proctor cant connect rebound car he doesnt really look to run unless Applebees the guy at the controls theyre not trying to slow it down theres no slowing that guy down hes never seen a threepoint shot he didnt like he hits six of them in the loss Saturday at Rutgers in Piscataway and hes in the starting lineup with Damian Williamson now coming back off the bench again Mitchell had him poked away and Monsanto does run he throws them up when you talk about running Marsh runs very well for a big guy and they really like to throw him that law John Shire said to us this morning weve got to make Wake Forest a half 14 Carr wrestled it away car hits the deck the loose fall to Monsanto this is where white Drake likes to push but after he gets the ball instead slow things down and set up the offense with hildred see the whole sides cleared forward he loves to post up Kicks it out through the contacts car on a Baseline Drive shut off there Appleby hoists and hes Bound by Roche in the corner as the shot clock was winding down the steal at one end Monsanto poked it away and then the lob up top for Matt Marsh Music ire of course per season at that Coach had a powered conference school and the way the schedule has worked out not just this year but in years past where he is filled in he has seen a lot of Wake Forest as far as ACC phone yeah hes probably looking forward to playing to being the head coach of somebody other than he seems however hes had great success against him we asked him today are you frustrated by the fact that you just had a week and a half to get healthy to get Jeremy roach rested and recovered from the toe injury and now youve got Lively and Whitehead sick and not with the team and they didnt practice the last few days theyre at the tail end of it as opposed to the beginning of their illness and he said yeah obviously were frustrated by it but the good news is like you said earlier theyre used to playing without those guys a little bit as it relates to just tonight wow he may be the youngest head coach in the power conference but hes been around long enough to know that you dont really win anything in November and December its about putting your team together and hes done a really nice job I mean there are only two losses in Kansas and Purdue Music both teams have been exclusively in mantoman whos Jacob grandison anymore hes really a good guy off the bench which misses from the stadium Bradford the Kansas State transfer 20 and white was the rebound and interestingly enough Wake Forest has done her its early but theyve done a pretty good job keeping Duke off their offensive boards Duke is an outstanding offensive rebounder team got switched on to Applebee Applause to tell you the Wake Forest offense operates much more effectively than David Williamson was knocking down threes I know were on the last two and a half minutes so Duke hadnt been able to get the ball inside with the exception of that one play by Young they used to try to get it in there hes calling for it philipowski and stroking from deep and Appleby runs it down and Wake Forest has all the momentum Warner kick for Carr comes out short young whos got to step up for Duke shorthanded well obviously I think the key guy out there is roach hes got to put the ball in Johns hands and he did a pretty good job that time three is in space you mentioned strikes up for free throw line now he kept his pivot foot and but he created some space there with an elbow he hit Williamson and Williamson went down in the middle of the lane and thats why grandison is open and the officials will look at this thats a good pivot by grandison and it turns and uh yeah yeah Im not sure that there was that much contact that didnt seem like a ton did it no no it didnt but remember Williamson is a guy who has been injured he has had a bad back and so even even you know a slight bump there given the way his position on the court that might have been a problem but grandison is a great great guy for Duke to have coming off the bench hes a high energy guy who can shoot it hes a solid rebounder interestingly hes Granderson is 60 of his fuel ball temperature for three thats a tough matchup for Williams and again Williamson has struggled with some back problems now what theyre looking at here obviously Mike is theyre trying to tell whether or not this is a flavored fire flagrant the flavor of wine is contacted is unnecessary and or excessive so they have to decide if there is something here or not theyre clearly was contact Music grandison gets in here and watch him hes looking to pass the ball and suddenly he realizes theres nobody gardening so he takes the jump shot so the officials have decided that theres nothing there in terms of a flagrant or anything and since they didnt call a foul on the play they cant go over there and change it to a common foul which if theres going to be anything thats all thats all that it would have been but they decided there was nothing and theres youre probably the only person unhappy with that is Steve Forbes well on all the Wake Forest fans in the building well count them too hilderth again posting up dishing for Bradford working on young carving out space and he missed the reverse well young did a great job maintaining his position and the Wake Forest players have to do a better job moving to open spots when Hildreth is going oneonone down on in there Applause by Appleby on the entry from philipowski so they reset the shot clock to 20 so far the Deeks have done a nice job setting the half court defense very little for Duke in transition but I really think the Blue Devils have to try to get the ball inside roach in the midrange wakes an offensive rebound and put back a strong move but were talking about Dukes offensive rebounding were necessarily talking about Taylor Blakes Applebee turned it over and now and now Duke runs with picking it up but last touched by Paul Applause uh we chatted with Steve Forbes for what maybe an hour that shoot around today we suggested to him should we mic you up for a game and he said youre not gonna happen he said maybe his last game hes been very successful here and very successful other places hes ever been he comes in after a game in which he told us Ruckers manhandled us he turned it over 22 times they were doing pretty well with the turnovers but the last two possessions they have turned it over and wake has thats one of the places where theyve struggled this year they average almost 14 turnovers a game forced and coming off that Rutgers game some similarities to how Rutgers defends and how Duke defends cause for concern for Street four you can see 14 is the magic number bro a great shooter and he knocks it down thats were talking about Granderson is an outstanding shooter who said 60 percent of his attempts were threes nice job causing the defense collapse and getting Granderson open you can miss its first five threesome Applause we talked about having a dynamic player he is I didnt think it was anything there I have no idea how he got any sort of a shot at all he gets down there in traffic what a great use of a pivot foot and that thats not a play everybody everybody can make really does a nice job of just flipping that ball up there third in the ACC in scoring and Appleby be an early five hes only behind Caleb love and turquavion Smith Music so week by three just about eight minutes in its first half after a text and draws a pound Mike when we were talking about taking to get the ball inside we dont necessarily mean post stuff dudes take the ball and drive it to the basket you can get it inside that way as well and Proctor really does a nice job driving the ball with gold baby on Bradford Applause Bradford well we have seen some amazing fans across the ACC now we need your help throughout the winter ACC Network wants to experience each sport from your perspective theres nothing better take a video tag with a hashtag all the devotion and the social you just might see it on acc Network split at the strike for Proctor and a twopoint game Applause Australian sandwich covers Midway through the shot clock Applause that would be rude I said driving inside and jump up in the air and make those passes pilgrim covered nice and did a really nice job staying in front of Hildreth and then got back to block the show Applause to the corner for Granderson Applause with four open shots quick trigger these last three possessions I think hell take that shot every time absolutely this is for Bradford Applause hes a great delivery by Applebee Bradford actually you should just catch that and dunk it he was very fortunate that he didnt get that shot block because he had to compose himself dribbled before he could get to the board blanks with a quick snap flakes Loops it back out for Mitchell yes theres a line drive stroke but it is effective yeah hes shooting over 40 from out there thats his 10th of the year and particularly when youre going to give him that much room hes going to make you pay Applause full screen from Bradford young showed Hildreth now off the bounce to attend to shoot Williamson drives on Mitchell who didnt bite top followers I mean some of the guys can put some points on the board foreign Applause Music Applause Applause Bradford the gym at one end we do a couple of Threes over these last few minutes so thats out of all their misses how many of them do they turn into offensive rebounds yet thats not the story so far tonight no in fact tonight Duke has missed nine shots they have one offensive rebound so thats not 40 and a half percent thats 11 well done uhhuh how much of that is no Derrick Lamar I obviously Lively is an outstanding rebounder and hes got some quickness that would bother the Wake Forest big guys so certainly some of it is but I think Wade is just playing with tremendous intensity and making sure theyre blocking out and if youre just joining us no Derek Lively no Tariq Whitehead they are sick the roommates did not make the trip I hope theyre feeling better and get back to action soon just his fifth made three The Freshman from Sweden and hes only shooting 20 from out there but Steve Forbes would like him to get more involved little bit more aggressive particularly on the offensive line player in school with Mark Mitchell Granderson missed it weight by six they push and Appleby was addons on the sideline and thats the third Deeps turnover I mean those are just the turnovers you cant make wake has a little bit of a push here suddenly theyre up by six and you turn the ball over and that wasnt really a forced turnover I thought Proctor did a really nice job that time in transition finding Monsanto monsantos very willing to shoot that ball in that sort of a situation 30 and wide at all times foreign Applause Music Applause Applause Music Applause Blakes has really been a boost for Duke coming off the bench roach is back in the game now but roaches started slowly over three from the field no assists played about 10 minutes now but Blakes has really been good taking the ball in the baskets defensively against Appleton this is out Im excited but Applebee recovered 10 oclock below 10 for Davey and Williamson so theres just no place to go roach all over him forces Williamson into a tough shot and a shot clock violation great date really a nice job by the Blue Devils to force Wake Forest to the perimeter I mean thats just Wake Forest theyre killing themselves theyve with turnovers they turn to Dimension they turned it over 22 times against Rutgers have now turned it over five times in this game and when you do that not only do you lose the opportunity to score but lots of times you give the other guys an easy opportunity on the other end and now thats an unforced turnover on Dukes side for the philippowski travel but Philip house key really has good footwork and he does a nice job hes quick enough that he can get around Marsh and he just got a little impatient at that time he thought oh okay Im outside I can go right around this guy and buy four under eight to go first half football Applause fourth assist for Tyrion as philipowski through contact six point lead for Wake Forest here at the Joel and Tyree Applebys and at the control so far in the first half spent his first couple of Collegiate Seasons at Cleveland State then three years in Florida now his first and only year at Wake Forest and when he rolled his ankle last Monday in practice he toughed it out he played on Wednesday against App State and you were here for and after that game the training staff told some Forbes hey we dont think hes gonna play Saturday against Rutgers and we dont think hes going to play next Tuesday meaning tonight against Duke and yet he has not missed the game he hasnt missed the game and tonight hes really been pretty good hes turned it over a couple times but hes got five points hes got four assists hes got two rebounds and his assists and hes also been fouled twice hes really done a nice job keeping the pressure on that Duke defense when he gets past him out on the perimeter the big guys have to step up toward him and all of assists his assists have been to the big guys inside to wait and Marsh is a docking machine so far Kyle filipowski just split so hes got three points Jeremy roach is scoreless those are of course the top two scorers for the Blue Devils Applause the corner Monsanto Strokes it thats what he does how does that specific spots that he didnt pull the trigger right away and he reset his feet Applause largest lead for Wake here its good recognition by roaches hes the big guy on him the ball and tries to go to the basket I think Duke needs to do more of that and I want to settle for the outside shot put some pressure on that wait for his defense he can make the outside shot but For Heavens Sake shes seven feet one maybe try to get a little closer the road adjust the rebound Brooks did a nice job even though he got beat down on the perimeter catching up poked it away and they say last Touch by Rose and it belongs to wake the first thing the ball touched out of bounds was roach and so thats thats why the ball is out of bounds and its out of bounds out off roads this is a good job by roach to try to get in the lane nice defense by Clinton the ball hit roach on the foot as he was standing out of bounds Roger Ayers presiding Applebees such a high usage player missed it tipped out to Mitchell theres a bit of force that Tom that was a really good defense by his Blue Devils theyre six and a half to go in this first half and Winston Salem aint going one of the ACC 210 and a win against Boston College Corner three for Blaze one up first half hes got seven hes really been outstanding theres been a force coming off the bench hasnt been a great threepoint shooter but now it looked good how much higher into that it was important when we chatted with him this morning theyve only been 17 no Christian reads no Jaden shoot and now foul on weight gone around young rebound foreign Music ER has to come down inside and help out against Young Blakes just goes finds and finds the open spot in the corner you dont want to stand there and be a spectator if your guy leaves you go find an open spot keep making get to the ball Music Applause it only scored 10 points his last five games he told me hes got seven here in the first half that was spices and he lost his footing around Monsanto recovery by Roach Applause back to 30 Applause Pacific Mike Wake Forest so far has made four or threepointers and by four different guys and the Geeks can be very effective when they dont turn it over and theyre making three dont need that is a 610 guy 235 find himself not alone Applause but this doesnt for Wing under five to go in the half Elvin spanning snatches it up what a pass for Mitchell Elderton transition smartly backs it out now to Cotton knocked it out but you should have pitched that ahead to Appleton theres Applebee robbed it up Marsh to the corner well Monsanto could make that shot Applause I think actually was a good surprise that the pass came out of there quickly he didnt have his feet set wake has done a really nice job pushing the ball up the court and finding open players open Shooters in transition Applause Applebys going to the bench to get a little bit of a freezing keep an eye on that goes out a sixpoint game can Duke make some Headway with wake star out of the game driving off the shot thing God bless the two bodies to create a space where he could score this is a really important last four minutes I think Wade sort of has the game under control Applause thank you talked about wake and the fact that theyve done a pretty good job on their defensive boards because they did not do that this time and that creates a problem its not a turnover but the offensive rebound draws the foul and the basket Applause the ball to the basket Steve Forbes has to be happy the Duke only has two offensive rebounds and his team has five but interestingly enough his team with those five offensive rebounds only has two second chance points Duke with the their two offensive rebounds has four Second Chance points chance at threepoint play here I was not happy about the foul called it puts Mitchell in position to stamp that threepoint play Tyree Applebys still out of the game hes getting his first breather of the night on the Wake Forest sideline kilgrith attacking Duke wanted him walking with it philipowski blocks him Edward building is now one for six Applause hes jumping up and down on the other end because he was all alone Applause pushed it up quickly so in transition he finally found himself up against roach and he did a nice job making that midrange shot 6 foot 10 Delaware transfer with a lot of skills and every car has seven he has started against their High major opponents to score Applause Young on philipowski philipowski was mismatched inside against Williamson and Williamson left him when he cut across the lane because he thought Monsanto was going to pick it up Montana didnt see him Lively no Whitehead and Jeremy roach hasnt scored yet Duke only Trails by five Music Applause pilgrim age Applause Music continues to be extremely aggressive hes taking more shots than anybody else on wakes team hes now two for seven Phillips too strong Applause weve got a college basketball Music Applause then in Tallahassee Florida State and Notre Dame by the way after this game here top 20 times Showdown for you Virginia and Miami in a really good game tonight Miami has played so well so far this year boy theres terrible thats just thats the kind of a giveaway that you simply cant afford in a game like this costly as Proctor laid it in the Proctor jumped up in the air to pass the ball there was nobody to pass it to Music Williamson behind the back its Applause now Music Robin Williams went forcedure Music the key it in Music bro driving sticky Proctor the mark rebound ripped away from Ryan Young by and head ahead for Williamson with young retreating and a foul will put Damian Williamson at the line car just simply could not make the pass that he wanted to make him thinking traffic didnt get enough move on that ball if he throws that so wins it can catch him in stride thats a layer Clark does a great job wrestling the ball away and he just cant get enough on the pass but what a great job by Young to get back there young is the guy who lost the rebound down on the one end but he sprinted up to the other end he committed the foul prevented the easy basket Brian Young is playing head and then its Super Duke hes in 16 minutes in this first half averages 20 Steve Corps will take a timeout and well take it as well inside the final minute of this first half right back to WinstonSalem Africa course respectively and Purdue with those Road wins its their first true Road game this season thats important to remember theyve lost two games but they both been neutral side games Music they come here theres no students were gonna break here at Wake Forest they first half seven point games in front of the Blue Devil and modern Mike Monaco our entire crew with you from the Joel hits back for grandison from three to get Appleby back in the game for the last 50 seconds of course it was a user to lose it timeout second difference between game and shot clocks youre at the end of the first half theyre obviously going to run down as far as they can that will be off the hop kins his first bound and now going forward its only the 14th foul by the Blue Devils the Blue Devils are done nice job defensively without fouling Jalen Blakes checks into the game he matches up with Hillary Applause its two on blinks well hildren they listed at six feet four 200 pounds he is a guy he really likes to get inside and use his body in there hes a hardnosed competitive guy sophomore from England this guys folks here today down on the left dads having a good time Mom on the right Music Music the clean fade Music Matt Marsh also from England his family here as well Music and its the largest lead of the half for the Demon Deacons all right with car switched on here kolpowskis matched inside against Appleby S2 comes up empty and as loud as this place has been all night and sends us the halftime Music ninepoint lead for Wake Forest on number 14 Duke lets go to the studio with Luke Hancock heres down in that first down and they have to lead to the deacons when Monsanto has only made one shot hes one for four from Beyond The Arc usually they play that theyre at their best when hes making those dreams organized look because I have bounds to begin the second half well I mean with your Wake Forest given their turnover history Music seven turnovers in that first half right on that Aboriginal team we told you about right on cue at Applebee and Monsanto cant connect early on there he came off short and then roach founds Hillary and theres thats sort of the first half in a little capsule right there Mike that was a very bad pass by Appleby youre throwing the ball across like that Monsanto cant come up with so they get the turnover but they cannot convert that was great defense in transition by Hill Griffin all he did is prevent Proctor from getting past him Applause weve seen that a couple of times and its been successful when young ran the court he was wide open and missed it Applause first down four points three assistski struggled in the first half seven on the roll cant handle the catch from Proctor another turnover drives Laughter its very easy to say that you have to keep Appleby in front of you and its a very hard thing to do but once Appleby gets by you he can be so dangerous and creative that time I like him to take it to the basket himself Forbes told us he wanted to see Appleby getting back to the free throw line Rutgers was really physical with him Steve Forbes said on Saturday what happened hes not like a huge guy they listened at 61165 and Rutgers has big physical guards to 11 figured out offensively here foreign but in doing so he gets all the way to the basket he doesnt score but hes in there for the rebound he chases the ball down himself the old Moses Malone you miss it you get the rebound Music yeah get to the goal dont settle for those threepoint pass because hes a good threepoint shooter but he was over three in the first half pilgrith on the back cut stocks and hits is not afraid that was a really good stop and rather than take it to the Lane he just tried to float it up over the big guys in there but thats the right idea but its the wrong approach dont try to bowl your way by this is a nice job by Monsanto moving his feet and filipowski throws that arm up out there making it easy absolutely official but you take that dribble if hes there you pass it back out Im trying to yes Force things and make something happen Music without the cross Appleby on a road you cant defend that so nearly took it away Mitchell on the pivot to become exactly where they need to go Mitchells got just got size advantage on the inside too what great Patience by missile theyre not panicked when that ball got knocked away so youre not going to catch up math is pretty simple we can handle that car back out for hildred Music to pivoting foreign special breaking down all the recruits all the highlights about starting of the one hour show ing Music well the Blue Devils only attempted five free throws in the first half and thats already three form here in the second half so thats a good sign being a little bit more aggressive on the inside and having to go pick it up on the defense again trying for the first time since 10 days ago its Maryland Eastern Shore and the Bates took it away from Appleby and eternal now blinks dribbled the ball into trouble there and Wake Forest very fortunate that they get it back now theyll get 30 seconds on the shot block because the ball was they recovered the ball in the back one Music in Wake Forest high ball screens they did a lot of that against Duke two years ago with the hammer on top of Ryan Young the Applebee is so effective throwing that pass and youre right Mike you set that screen in the middle of the court and its hard to bring defensive health young tries to react to Appleby to stop him and gives him just enough room to turn that pass to Marsh and young is a little too far away to get back although Marsh is a very poor free throw shooter quick take to the Cup by roach back down to 10 thats his first basket first points for Jeremy Rose Applause sound out that Maryland Eastern Shore game with the television he was fantastic at the Garden against Iowa foreign shadowed by Mitchell tend to shoot Mildred off the bounce gets into the post Applause was interesting that roach didnt drop down inside to help out he was staying on the opium side with Monsanto gotta do that yeah oh theres Mitchell back for Rhodes directing things lots of ball screen from Young snakes in roach lost the hand car pushing Appleby weather its a knocking foul you have to give that ball to Appleton somehow you have to figure out how to get it to him Music throwing lobs and knocking down free and Salem in the Joel and this is a Dukes team under Steve Forbes that had dropped three of its last four coming in and the only win during that then you were here for when wake needed some help from Appalachian State to get that one point win and samandra Carr heroics Forbes got good tonight and we still have obviously a lot of time left to go but their offense has been running for more here at the second half theyre four for four they havent missed any shots high percentage shots as far as the dunks go car get on the first two the foul was on Jalen Blakes whos third he stays in for John Shire well half will be you cant ask him to do much more hes got 10 points hes got six rebounds hes got two hes got six assists three rebounds Ty does have six turnovers but Wake Forest hasnt really been hurt as much by the turnovers today as they have been in some of their other games roach lost it grandison doughed for it and its right back to the demon defense and one of the reasons is that Duke has turned it over as well wakes turned it over 11 times but thats the 10th turnover for the Blue Devils so the blue Devils not having a big advantage in the turnover department and we mentioned weve mentioned a couple times Duke and outstanding offensive rebounding team but they only have four tonight five lose ten turnovers in these first five minutes out of halftime for John shires bunch R sets the screen for Hildreth to switch from tilapowski hildren Ducks inside for two more hes got a dozen and the biggest lead tonight for wake in 15 really warmed his way in there slithering on through phillipowski answers I you know I just dont think Id wait for it to Wake Forest is anybody down to the inside of the guard in the festival Applause Music Applause wanted him to trigger Music heldrick Applause another offensive rebound and Hildreth is bumped and fouled by grandison in his first and how about that offensive rebound by Hillary he got up off his back side to chase that ball down Music so it retains possession for wake and John Shire is trying to find answers so he goes to Jadens shoot 14 in blue freshman from Yorkville Illinois playing in his sixth Collegiate game known for his incidentally shooting hes only played 43 minutes this year Apple be on a step back rebound to Young and shoot three for three from three last game for Duke against Maryland Eastern Shore there hasnt been a lot of breathing room but he has really caught some contact in there hey hey its a Wake Forest defense has been pretty good creating difficult opportunities for Duke particularly keeping him out on the perimeter Applause shoot off screen well you got to guard somebody in there and shoot oh good footwork for Ryan young weve talked about the fact that young is a very skilled back to the basket post guy and you saw it right there great footwork of the year foreign defensively Music Applause Bradford backs down on Young and Bradford scores and that was that was a good good pass but Bradford I dont think really helped him Hildreth very much on that particular play Music its really nice job inside the great pivot you know the whole thing is he didnt try to dribble it too much in there just to Pivot and then Bradford you know he just uses that physical size down on the interior I thought he could have cut to the basket and made that an easier play but wait for us to take the basket anyway homeboy 70 pounds a lot away shoot cut too strong on a floater and a player is still down and thats Cam Hildreth when he got in the way he chests theres a lot of stuff going on Steve Forbes always talks about that Music Applause Applause hes trying to stay in front there see really what happened it looked like he was holding his hand and tried to catch himself as he was going down its very uncomfortable his shoulder through the way his arm is drooping there Applause I hope hes okay Monsanto no nice and a pushup on Bradford on the rebounding action there with Phillips and thats 40 on big Davey on Bradford now thats a break for the Blue Devils because Monsanto was wide open this many of those Applause one for five for davari Monsanto from threepoint land tonight but I guarantee you hes not going to stop shooting Applause margin 13 shut up shoot a good cut slicing on Khan Applause really good attack by the Duke Blue Devils at that time the defense kicking it back taking advantage of the defensive rotations Music Applause college basketball double header for you tomorrow night right here on acc Network and the ESPN app first up 6 30 Eastern its Virginia Tech in college and then Florida State and Notre Dame its X off to a very nice start this year Virginia Tech has played very well with Virginia Tech and Miami probably the two biggest surprises in the ACC so far Applebee draws a grandison fact but you try to get in front of this guy and he just keeps going Music now theyve taped up hildreths wrists on the bench the trainer taped it up and Hildreth without talking to anybody walked past the coaches and went to the scores table the coach said no no get back and sit down so they taped up his wrist and here he was gonna put himself back in the game Music quite literally salivating to get back in an interesting point here weve got 12 minutes and 10 seconds left in the game and the Blue Devils that was their 17th team foul so the Deeks are going to be able to get to the line here the Geeks have 16 fouls so the next foul by Steve Forbes guys the Blue Devils that would be getting to the line so we might have on a free throw shot here in the last 12 minutes tonight hes got a dozen to go along with those six assists approach on the Baseline grandison cots moves for Mitchell to knock it down Mark Mitchell second three hes got 14 points you know he doesnt shoot a lot of them but he picks his spots with those three but its a good one stroke problems for weight Rutgers with turnovers for the Deep Monsanto way too much space cant give him that much room and now traveling calls and this place is Applause knocks it down and he gives it away the first time but when he gets it back no doubt what hes gonna do Music today youve got a nickname for him as well damari Monsanto whether hes hot or not hes going to keep shooting it and you know its very funny talked about Monsanto theres the sunliners BFA 81 there are the Oceana based uh Fighter Squadron for the Navy but their motto is any time any place and I believe thats monsantos motto as well among your fight worth a 40plus year career in this industry oh yes we dont want that theres another turnover seven this half now you saw Monsanto his threepoint shooting numbers and twopoint shooting numbers were much better than the sunliners but they they dont really shoot very many two points and threepointers so theyre shooting different things not their focus no different but different mission sorts of space three before break 14 point game still long way to go long way to go and remember Wake Forest has had turnover problems Duke trying to pick up the defensive pressure and normally when youre behind in the game you start your comeback on the defensive end Applause Music Young on the bench right now this is a shot Sunliner wanted battle on and then Bradford and Philadelphia get wrapped up and Kyle phillipowski gets tagged for the fouls his second Applause but that was a pretty good response Bradford because he kind of was one arm because Phil bouncy had to buy the other one all right hes fortunate that he didnt drop that one down here has really struggled to know just has never been able to find a rhythm and roach roach has turned the ball over four times Music Roshan philipowski two best players this season theyve combined 12 Duke tournament getting ready to come back in for John Shire Mitchells been good tonight bounces for young philipowski passed up the three this time and then Appleby trying to pick it filipowski saved it Proctor Rises and hits boy that is a big big shot for the Duke Blue Devils Tyrese Proctor coming in only a 24 threepoint shooter and for the Blue Devils to avoid that turnover and then make a three thats a big basket lets see if that can get him going bucking of the night Monsanto bounces for Brantford he walks with it indeed Applause Music Apple becomes so close to getting that one but what a great play by philipowski to get rid of the ball when hes laying on the ground and then the penetration by Blakes creates a wide open threepoint opportunity Bradford to the bench Mars replaces him in the front court for the Deeks Duke trying to trim this to single digits Midway through the second half theyve only LED for 19 seconds in this game the first couple of minutes if youre just joining us back again Lakes he connects hes got ten and how big is Jalen Blakes been Purdue Steve Forbes wants a timeout and Jalen Blakes is cooking on the road foreign Applause steals hes got a block shot he only has one turnover and this is the closest the Blue Devils have been in the second half a month ago we were sitting at Cameron and John shires said to us again Alex has turned around games for us not early in the season they do it here and here in which Duke is trailed by as many as 15 during the second half and they wrap up Monsanto but its about against the Pluto three on phillipowski Applause Monsanto now this is something you dont see very often Monsanto going to the freethrow line this is only his fourth trip to the three from free throw line this year twice he was fouled shooting threes once he had three shots the other time he made it and then he had on and one Applause and the other time he was in the Rutgers game he was the victim of the flagrant foul and he had two shots so this is very unfamiliar with territory for tomorrow about Santa I can tell he fascinates you well just some interesting statistical anomalies the guy never hates shows up there here in the second half and he made both 10point lead nine to go I think those were two pretty big points waiting for you to do something to stop that momentum extra pass philipowski too strong and hes still dragged from Depot with four now youre not going to get better look than that great ball Movement by the Blue Devils they did everything but make the basket now the guy have to get a defensive stop Applause yes Applause draped all over what defense from Jeremy Road Applause Rose does a really nice job cutting him off and Applebee tried to sell that one as the ball bounced off roach but it did not Applebee can be loose with the basketball sometimes but you know you take the good with the bad with him hes got seven turnovers all right Applause sets the screen for Tyrese Proctor bounce back for Blaze that was with a hand in his face and just you just feel a little bit of energy from the Duke Blue Devils now games a little easier when the ball starts going to the basket Applause answer whats that the fourth time weve seen that tonight how good is this shaping up to be down the stretch Mitchell no fat Monsanto pushes Appleby horse cant hit young tries to save it and it squirts out the car oh Griffin Carr slow it down for the deeps much Applause flipped it up no young clears it is Applause a careerhigh 13 a careerhigh 33s hes feeling it backs it out on Appleby and now directing traffic Blake skips it heres Proctor spins it out theyve missed a couple of wide open looks from three but again Proctors not noted for his threepoint shooting prowess 24 in this freshman season the call and that is four on Jalen Blakes with six and a half to go flakes at one end and Marsh and the Deeks at the other John shires young team on the road down by nine eight straight road wins all of that last season you see the longest active streak in the country and then wake been really good here at home at the Joel under Steve Forbes the this is an extremely important game for Wake Forest I mean they got throttled up at Rutgers and then they have this game then theyve got Virginia Tech and North Carolina that is a heck of a stretch flip side for Duke we told that they last played 10 days ago they play here then they dont play again until New Year so they played 12 games in 33 days no power Conference team in the country played more in that time and now they play one time in 20 days well its just a weird quirking schedule the first break is exams the second break is the holiday break foreign Music Blakes he is still out there with his four fouls with six and a half laps you can see if Ray can take advantage of them oh young is the buddy you see now Proctor is going to guard half of it lets see if Wade tries to post Hildreth up against Blake Applause hes got that right wrist wrapped fall as the other hoop earlier this half Pilgrim short slapped out of there by Blakes the proctor Mitchell cant hit offensive rebound and Blake threw a foul on Appleby and thats two on Tyree Appleby Music I hope you did exactly what we thought he was going to do take the ball down inside I think hilders was surprised that Blakes fell down because hes sort of sort of shortarmed that one with Blakes on the offensive end even with those four fouls he continues to be extremely aggressive Applause stripped to the line the line first well have another special ACC PM for you tomorrow afternoon with the crew in Charlotte for the second night of the inaugural Jumpman Invitational latest from around the conference and then the Tar Heels against Michigan theyll preview that one coverage starts for Eastern right here on accnemouth ESPN app today Music Applause scored in double figures and his in his two years in Durham hes got 15 tonight to lead all scorers straight on Aaron uh Steve Forbes is claiming that young got a piece of that but the officials dont agree foreign again Applause Music Applause March back into the game for the Demon Deacons young good adjustment by car got a hand on that was a layup if Carr doesnt get his hand on the ball nice pass by Young some big men rocks are from the corner you cant connect Applebee the rebound stays and nine coming up on five to go Music roach switched on to hildred Proctor again on Applebee Hildreth goes to work Hildreth down the lane for two hes got 14 but hes had some kind of performance two points in timeout early in the game we showed you hildras folks from England over here visiting and hes putting on a show for him he gets past roach and then pulls up with the little floater doesnt try to take the ball all the way to the basket where he might get it blocked Marsh does a nice job in there setting the screen for him just getting in the way foreign on the right how cool is that family coming over from England to watch him here around the holidays sophomore has put on put on a performance and now playing through pain and he showed you a little earlier before he fell on that wrist and that was a problem that he did puts the trainer David up and he tried to put himself back in the game there you go right by Steve Forbes 14 points eight rebounds poked it away blinks recovers bounces for filipowski no Marsh secures it thats a really good rebound by Marsh he just now fought young for the ball and again philipowski had a wide open shot Applause Overstock stumbling against rose that is Tyree Applebys eight turnover well he was he was looking for the foul right there Applause you know hes trying to throw his body into roaches and I think he just knocked himself Appleby comes to help and use the last to touch it he stays with Duke terms not at 100 on his bad angle phillipowski got tied up somehow got that out for Blake who slashes and finishes but theyre sure glad they brought him tonight trying to singlehandedly Keith Duke within Striking Distance down the stretch awake has had answers Applause Music not foreign Applause Music after this wow this is where hes done most of his damage hes been able to get the ball in the lane make the short range jump shot sometimes against much taller players and he just he just hasnt really forced anything ever since early in the game early in the game if he was trying to post up and made a couple of mistakes he has three turnovers and most of them came early so heres the two guys who have led the way tonight foreign Music Applause Music only three points for Jeremy Rose John Shire told us this morning that yesterday was the first time that roach practiced fully its a toe injury that goes back for Thanksgiving weekend out in Portland against Purdue s ever had a problem Applause to even move around much less play basketball hes got four points seven point cushion for weight with a basketball Monsanto no and a rebound Mitchell thats why you take that shot Monsanto make that shot most of the time can make it a twopossession game yeah expensive foul and Hildreth took the charge but if you if you want a tough play Then Hildreth is your guy this is just a great job moving his feet now remember hes got that wrap on his wrist and it looked like he put his hands down again and hes holding his wrist right now he fell on that wrist earlier and he just fell on it again together the land game warning Then followed on Jeremy Roach and then commits a foul on Appleby along the sideline right in front of the Duke bench thats a risky play by Appleby he was really looking for the foul right there and thats how far on boats so Roaches for Blake says four Music and a 310 left and thats thats sort of a problem because youre gonna need your cards to be aggressive trying to defend the way ball handlers this is not the guy you want to foul like no no Applause what did Steve Forbes tell you that he wanted Applebee to get to the line more well this works absolutely paying attention Granderson pop three back iron climbs for the board great block out by Marsh tough with the basketball but you dont want to lose your aggressiveness youre trying to thread that needle here Pilgrim on the steps now thats the first time hes gone all the way to the goal I think he confused the Blue Devils young response Applause hes got a big night as well eight points and rebounds three assists for Ryan young and Hobart have been stopping short midpost every time and had to move pull up again you dont want to get overly conservative here Applebee Vermont Santo attacking the closeout in the midrange inside of two minutes roach at the rims and John Shire takes a quick timeout with 154 to go ninepoint game thats really a good play by Monsanto hes a guy whos not noted for stepping inside for 39 and shooting the jump shot and you know Steve Forbes was Batman didnt play him in that App State game because then he didnt like his practice habits and Monsanto has responded very well he sets the screen then hes got a chance to shoot the three but steps inside Blake and the twopoint shot hes not going to take the ball all the way to the basket thats not what he does but thats a really good play by Monsanto and hes made a couple of Big Shots tonight yeah hes only two of eight from three but the gravity that he forces because of his shot making ability and you said it a guy they didnt play in that one point game against half Steve Steve Forbes told us today I dont do very well with energy drainers at practice Monsanto has received the message and now monsantos been but Steve Forbes a long time came to them from East Tennessee and so you know they know one another pretty well Applause but that was a really good play by Montana and how helpful when still sorting through that back injury for the last month Hildreth went tumbling out of control car bails him out Applebys got it still 20 seconds to soak here on the shot clock Applause does a really nice job at his size being able to stay in front of perimeter players but you know the guards havent been able to stay in front of Applebee tonight thats a big ass quickness and speed two of the first things that Steve Forbes talks about with Tyree Appleby and it just causes so many problems I mean who really for long stretches tonight has been able to stay in front of him well nobody enough for long stretches and you talk about his ability to attack the basket and monsantos ability to stretch the defense when wake is playing well those two guys are in the middle of it of course Hildreth just gives you that toughness you have to have if youre going to be a good team 90 seconds to go the lead 11 for the Demon Deacons against the number 14 team in the country grandison no young cleans it up back down the single digits now ideally youd like to try to keep the ball out of Applebees hands a dribbling from the marimon Santo into a double team theyve got a trap and a timeout taken by Hadith timeout was was called before the foul there was a foul called but I think the timeout came before the foul both teams next well Mike was talking about what a big game this is for way Sports because they they got throttled by Rutgers and thats a Rutgers is a really good team and thats a really tough place to play but after tonight look at this schedule they got to play Virginia Tech North Carolina and then of course you got to go to Louisville Florida State and have Boston College but this was a huge game for the demon defense well see Louisville on Thursday night theyre over at NC State adorable by the way at home tonight they lost to Lipscomb 7567 at the Young well theyre theyre coming off a twogame winning streak there but Louisvilles has struggled all year by the way if youre looking for Virginia Miami we will get you to that as soon as this one is done well take you down to Coral Gables with Jay alter and the coach Seth Greenberg Applause and if they do get blaze hes done Applause the Blakes fouls out with a minute to go after doing yeomans work for a shorthanded Duke team tonight Applause Marsh comes in the game and waves and goes out hes in there for defense you dont want Mars in there when you have to shoot free throws Applause car makes the first he doesnt go to the line a lot but hes a 71 free throw shooter hes got a good looking stroke Applause weight players and double figures Proctor checked in for Blakes so Lebowski drives to the rim and doesnt get the roll altered by Martian Carr Marsh actually got a piece of that one foreign Applause game and what a performance for Wake Forest and particularly coming off a a tough loss to Rutgers just this was a gut check for the Deeks and they responded what a heifer 8170 the final and Winston Salem and for Steve Forbes in year three and weight his first win over an 18 top 252 how about that really really the good team effort by Wake Forest I thought keyed by their defense and even though they turned the ball over a lot they made enough shots
