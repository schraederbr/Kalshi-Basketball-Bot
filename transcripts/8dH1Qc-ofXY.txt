as we get set ticket underway and FSU wins the opening tip as we started off here in Greensboro Applause FSU getting a handle to Mills topped for warley and heres Darren Green 65 Junior left fly rebound knock three back to green Junior and a second effort here for the Knowles Clevelands been their best player this season a misfire there comes in averaging 148 but you got the looks for your two gods that you want to get shots from if youre Florida State on that first possession green whos their knock down threepoint shooter in Cleveland as you mentioned hes been their best player all season long Corner jumper here by Terry hes gonna switch that one in its 40 percent there hes 40 and hes also playing 40 minutes a game right now Josh Pastor shortened the rotation Lance Terry often was to spend the entire game on the floor never taking a break okay the Mills running the show there along with Cleveland for Leonard Hamilton no not one player in either of these game one rosters whose name to any of the ACC first second or third teams or honorable mention as Cleveland drops in one I thought he might be a guy who would play his way on one of those teams yeah team success had a lot to do with and of course as you mentioned in our open Florida State losing 22 games this season a program record so going to be difficult to make it when your team hasnt had the success but Matthew Cleveland has made a strong improvement from a season to go gentlemen Franklin handling the ball a 67 senior he can be a lot of fun to watch hes a tremendous Defender Kelly will kick it out and the second three swished in that one by Sturtevant and this is the area of improvement for Josh pastners team theyre shooting the basketball so much better than they did really to start the season the first 20 games of the season with a struggle for them to score green turns and fires and too strong with that one and a battle for the rebound Yellowjackets Come Away with that now they just were never a very good shooting Team all season long talking about Georgia Tech 42 percent overall 34 from three that was really the thing that stuck all season long that was but over the last nine games they have been a much better offensive team we mentioned averaging over 75 points per game in their last nine scoring 90 against Syracuse where they knocked down 18 threepoint field goals no good effort there by Terry to keep that one alive the 62 seniors as you say is making 47 from three over the last in nine or ten games and they have won three straight coming in that ties to their longest winning streak of the year thats how they began the season Applause on the drive warley and a sweet scoop shot for two yeah nice take by Jalen Worley who continues to develop at the point guard position but when we get an opportunity to look at the numbers for Georgia Tech coming in the last three games 83 points against Louisville at home and then on the road 96 at Syracuse and 73 at Boston College which is a very good defensive team so Josh pastner and his offensive group much better Franklin on the drive and hell take the hit and go to the line opening minutes here of the very first game of the ACC tournament in Greensboro Josh Pastor year number seven took the yellow jackets on a fantastic run in this tournament a couple of years ago to win it its in an NCAA tournament bid and up against one of the great men in college basketball Leonard Hamilton absolutely a mentor a father figure to many in a pretty good basketball coach alongside with that when you think about the fact over 600 career wins and often destinations that many people did not want to often happen to come in and rebuild the program not just taking over great success stories its been a huge part of what I think is a Hall of Fame worthy reputation and resume for sure that ability to come in and build programs that nobody else really wanted a part of and take them to the NCAA tournament whistle in the lane here at 16 39 to go just fascinating as you look over the last five seasons Leonard talking about the learning experience of this year he felt like he got caught by surprise with a couple of guys leaving the program who he said it isnt your time yet to do that he coached them not to go but they did they did they made those decisions to go and you look at what Leonard Hamilton and his staff have been able to do at Florida State the last five seasons prior to this one and you remember 2020 ACC Champions 2021 they were playing on the same floor against this same team in the ACC tournament Championship so theres been a lot of success in Tallahassee prior to this season Yellow Jackets real young as far as division one experience one of the younger teams in the country as far as games played at D1 sturdivance hit a big three early on nice pass over the top but no finish there by Franklin who has serious hops man Cleveland spins that one up and then but no basket he wants the basket but its not forthcoming and a foul still demanding the hoop I dont think hes going to win that battle but again I dont mind the attempt from Matthew Cleveland second foul there on Miles Kelly by the way nice move by Cleveland Applause to get to the rim is the Finish but he must think hes already in the NBA if he thinks hes going to get continuation on that one not going to happen here itll stay on this end man did he hit a shot against Miami though and that incredible come from behind but yeah he wants that NBA basket yeah the continuation not going to get it but does get the second foul on Miles Kelly whos the ACC player of the week but Josh pastner doesnt even Flinch about taking Kelly off the floor Kelly scoring about 20 a game the last five games the big rebound there by Franklin senior from Little Rock Arkansas who gets in the air and he gets up fast he absolutely does it hes really been the difference making Josh Pastor going small and playing Franklin at that five spot we see another steal from Jalen wooly with a career high four steal Saturday at Virginia Tech gets another as Kayla Mills is able to turn it to a bucket defense to offense yes went end to end there after the turnover and FSU up by one Yellow Jackets the 13th seed FSU the 12th seed and still to come weve got Boston College in Louisville at 4 30 with West Durham and Jordan Cornett coming your way number 10 against number 15 and what will be the second game of the day is Coleman straight on too strong good look for Devo Coleman A young man who can definitely knock down the three ball but he struggled to shoot the basketball this season Worley backs it out Applause back to warley on the perimeter shot clock down to nine green trying to step into one will jump and fire heres Cleveland underneath the follow wont go batted away from Corin th and here come the yellow jackets we mentioned a smaller Yellow Jackets team but still Scrappy on the glass and Franklin won the best at 15 rebounds at Boston College last time out his third comes up with the foul Caleb Mills pushing the basketball thats Florida State style and one of the reasons why Leonard Hamilton lets us know that every available waking moment of the day Im sick to my stomach for not being prepared for the unexpected you cant imagine how determined I am to clean this up great lessons for for coaches to learn from always be prepared for the unexpected OB I believe hes prepared now all right believe it too you do anything CC Network basketball is brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times through Cleveland still looking for that basket absolutely Im with me too OB however hes not gonna get it not in college basketball but right now Florida State coming out with the one point lead and they were able to get that lead using their defense turning it into offense Georgia Tech knocking down their first two shots since then over five from the Field Cleveland had 21 in the first meeting against Georgia Tech so hes very much the man to keep an eye on and also you have to remember that his family has a lot of ties with Georgia Tech of course both parents going to Georgia Tech they thought that Matthew Cleveland was going to be a guy that ended up playing there shows Florida State instead is green to launch yes On Target and well off that threepoint line yes he doesnt need to be anywhere close to the line 88 83 pointers coming in to the ACC tournament this year which tie for first in the ACC and hes been a knock down shooter his entire career getting close to 300 May 3 so its some nice ones 24 against Pitt 20 against Notre Dame 23 points against Purdue he can really get rolling beyond that Arc shot clock a factor down to seven Sturdivant trying to make a move can its batted out with 41 on the clock Sunday night nine oclock Easton right here on acc Network at the ESPN app are nothing but Ned mens and womens selection special breaking down the brackets and previewing all the games with Kelsey Riggs as the host to be kicked outside for a long one just grazing the iron off Target by Terry Applause thats FSU by four early on great to see the whole nothing but neck threw in the building and I got Luke Hancock of course Carlos Bruiser Joe Berry and my little sis Kelsey who always continues to forget my name but you know what I wont take it personally over here and trying to get inside how do you forget Corey the great Alexander ooh that one is deep right there Miles Kelly thinking okay well Dan Green can do it I can do it also and Kelseys just messing with you you think so I think so Ill tell you what Music came over to Dave chorus our stats guy theres the crew thats a good looking group let me tell you about Kelsey though best shoe game in the building no question about it anytime shoe game her Jordans on point she might have more might be more Jordans than Mike Im not sure but shes got a large collection football and everything theres rarely a time where shes not eating or drinking something when I see her yes yes I I have Ive noticed that I do not know how she does it I have noticed that strong metabolism on on Kelsey incredible metabolism and the shot clock down to one Greens gonna get a shot in the air in the spin rebound comes out high and Georgia Tech will let it roll out yeah I mean heres another look at this always got something going its not one its like a couple coffees its usually a whole plate of food I dont know how she does it yeah I mean again you know its a gift lets just say that she has a special talents its a gift youve got the same thing I must I bust you on it all the time but my results arent quite like Kelseys my metabolism I dont believe is quite as hot and knocked down a nice one from the wing there by Coleman to cut it to a onepoint game great to see Debo Coleman stepping up knocking down the threes Im sure thats a positive sign for Josh pastner coming into Greensboro it was their first field goal in a little over six minutes uh knocked out with 11 45 to go here in the first half there they go I can tell you right now that Trio right there OB me you and those three we can win some games they dont know what theyre talking about Im not mad at them for any of these I think they got three of the six correct however Im not gonna argue with them this time because I dont really think there was a lot of Separation this season as far as the ACC players in the war I would agree it felt like with several of the major Awards if you voted for the guy who finished second or third you still would have gotten it right agree I agree with you wholeheartedly on that one and then you think about you know of course I thought Jeff Capel was a shoe win for coach of the year I thought that was great I had Jordan Miller so the fact that you know a Miami player won the AC player of the year Im not mad at that at all but I thought it was the wrong Miami player sure I thought that Jordan Miller was the guy today congrats to Jeff capels heck of a job bringing Pittsburgh back almost a complete reverse of their one lost record from a year ago yeah when you considered the fact that you know Pittsburgh was able to not only win in finishing the top five the ACC this season had a chance to be a regular season Champion going into Miami but difficult to win in Colgate the number five seed will get the winner of this one tomorrow afternoon at 2 30 in transitions tournament with a kick out Terry beyond the three Applause Sturtevant lets fly shorts and you dont mind that look and start of it but Im sure thats one Josh Baxter would have preferred from Lance Harry to just take it after third victim the opportunity for him on the fast break I mentioned BC and Louisville coming up at 4 30 and then later on tonight seven Virginia Tech and Notre Dame the 11 and 14 seeds with Wes and Jordan coming your way is Cleveland got a pretty good look rebound comes right to the seventh form a cloud and gets two and those are the type of moves that encouraged under Hamilton that nahim McLeod can be a God that can be that Center that they need him to be but oftentimes those plays are a little too far and through between so when you think about that they need to see more consistency from McLeod if you so often theyll pop off and have a good game like 16 against Syracuse it has a feeling of coming out of nowhere at times but hes capable he absolutely is capable and has shown tremendous improvement over the last couple of seasons tournament no Battle For That by Franklin and a foul on the play 9 56 left in the half this is a pretty nice little move here this is one that makes our you know super producer Kim Belton proud Kim used to get it done on the Block like this of course not quite as tall as McLeod but still more effective but right now when you see a young man making a nice lefthanded jump hook going to the off hand you know post players rejoice when they see moves like that being made in todays game thats Cleveland and youre kind of writhing in pain there and right now significant discomfort he is slapping the floor oh see the right ankle on Cleveland Landing hes going out to contest a shot of Terry and looking back that right ankle just rolling on the landing oh boy and Florida States just dealt with so many injuries this season hard to watch another young man be down for the Seminoles and their best player so the six seven sophomore the young man from Atlanta and what has become a very quiet building going down here twisting that ankle and needing help to get up and he had been in frustration slapping the hardwood after he went down boy you do hate to see that and well get you an update on Matthew Clevelands status and condition as soon as we can but obviously a huge blow to the Seminoles hopes today but more importantly you just hope hes going to be okay and its nothing more serious than an ankle sprain but we will find out exactly whats going on Corey in fact is going to leave the table and try and get a couple of answers here as they play on with 9 56 to go Georgia Tech the inbound trying to get it in and that one off of Millard and then three seconds going off the clock there and Jamie lucky going over the monitor as Cleveland has taken back toward his locker room and 19 went to 19 on the clock Applause looking to get it in over the top Kelly playing with some foul trouble hes got a couple here in the first half Applause Terry on the drive with the kick not a little too strong by Kelly to get a second chance Coleman in tight and he gets hit he draws the foul Debo Coleman the 66 sophomore as we check out the bracket now this is game number one 1213 FSU in Georgia Tech the Hokies and the Irish coming your way itll be after Boston College in Louisville and round two tomorrow at noon begins with Syracuse and Wake Forest and rounded out for Coleman hell get another opportunity Applause so the Pitt Panthers getting set to get active in this tournament is the number five seed and that will be tomorrow the winner of this game Chandler Jackson in now for Leonard Hamilton The Talented freshman Applause Mills gave up the dribble Applause Mills finds it opening hell lay it in thats one of his favorite moves that scoop shot to the basket low scoring first half but Florida State on top 1410 however they have lost their number one player to a leg injury Matthew Cleveland were efforting to find out anything we can beyond what we showed you as he obviously twisted and turned that ankle looking for a wrap around behind the back pass there that is off Georgia Tech and out Miles Kelly were at the turnover Yellow Jackets trying to make it four consecutive wins that would be a season High for a Georgia Tech if they can pull it off here today Applause foreign back out for Jackson Applause Miller Applause looking to make a move swooping into the paint and bakes it in Toby thats one of the reasons why theres so many NBA Scouts coming in the early game first game to be able to see Bob Miller see what he can perform Matthew Cleveland of course another one of the guys that many of the Scotts wanted to see out now with the injury and well get word on his update on him after the timeout hopefully yeah middle of 611 freshman a world of possibility tough catch and heavy traffic there by Moore and he will lay it in Moore is really the only guy that will get minutes off the bench for Josh pastner throughout this game the rotation has been cut down to six players and Josh Pastor liking the six guys he can put out there with the kick out heres Jackson on target for three and Jackson is growing up on the Fly OB the young man who had injury issues early in the year but hes coming off a couple games where he scored double figures for Leonard Hamilton and now starting to become a main Cog in that rotation so FSU despite losing Matthew Cleveland has opened up a seven point advantage eight out of 19 from the field and you look at the Yellow Jackets as you mentioned seasonlong problem not shooting the ball very effectively at all Terry gave it up and again in traffic they do get it outside for Kelly too strong thank you Applause so FSU working on a sub point lead heres Miller too strong the cloud keeping that alive green cant drill it Applause Terry the senior you got a body up on him from threepoint legs its 47 percent the last seven to eight games the cloud with the block inside Florida State getting good minutes out of McLeod here down the stretch without Cleveland on the floor theyre going to need someone else to step it up and yes an offensive theres been a number of players thus far OB nahim McLeod is one of the guys as vfc Matthews Cleveland rolling desk right ankle hopefully well have an update for you when we return Music Subway keeps up in the gate with the subway series an AllStar movie Florida State Seminoles sports information director Chuck Walsh going back trying to get us an update on Matthew Cleveland I went to that same door Obi I got denied but Chucks got a different level of access around here than I do and thats what happens when youre a Hall of Famer like Chuck Walsh is one of the best sports information directors that youll find in the business in fact Chucks getting a National Honor at the final four in Houston this year for excellence as a sports information director one of the greats in college basketball and right now the concerned look on his face as he goes to the phone well fortunately when he goes to the phone that means were going to get something on our phones relatively soon and that will be the update on Matthew Cleveland whether he can come back and continue in this one or weve seen the last of them here today so FSU leading 1912 Georgia Tech trying to cut into that Coleman will swing up top here for Terry senior from just outside Atlanta hes harassed with seven on the shot clock early all over him this tournament with a pullup long one cant bury it rebound torn down by FSU and Camerons corn an update on Matthew Cleveland as the nice fine from Mills to Corn inside right now xrays being taken so no update as of yet but of course Chuck will keep us up to date on everything that Florida State related meanwhile Florida state has their biggest lead of game one and often happens OB and of course you know youve been covering Sports much longer than I but one man goes down the next man up mentality happens with the team and never more prevalent than with Florida State when you think about the way that Leonard Hamilton likes to play their style to play theyll go play 13 guys no hes had a bunch of injuries this year and of course you know some guys who they thought would be back with their program that were not this year so theyre playing younger guys no spots but they have enough bodies to be able to still go out and be effective orally with the foul to put Franklin at the line Applause 68 percent Saturday afternoon some of the top lacrosse teams in the nation Im letting our triple header start with number 13 Notre Dame women taking on number two Syracuse at noon then number eight Ohio State the mens squaring off against number two Notre Dame followed by number one Virginia hosting Towson green wall weights rebound Tim Franklin had it knocked away from him house had it rejected by Franklin showing hes more than a threepoint shooter but give house a lot of credit getting in there coming up with the offensive rebound and finding a teammate for the second chance points Terry rang right into a wall torn Away by Jackson green again and Georgia Tech forcing it right now Greens got a number of good looks just unable to knock him down youre talking about a 40 threepoint shooter on the season had to adjust got it to go we came on air talking about Georgia Tech and their scoring and theyve averaged over 75 points per game to the last night only 16 points having almost played 16 minutes here in this first half so its been a struggle for Georgia Tech how short for that jumper a freshman out of Dayton Ohio either side waiting around are they no they are not it was thats one of the differences with this Georgia Tech team in the last nine games of the season they are taking shots much quicker in the shot clock than you would see them take early in the year good defense there by Franklin hes one of the better defenders in the league thats a tie up on the play possession there will take it to the other end 2316 FSU as a manager Im here every day opening up the New York Life ACC tournament underway our top four seeds Duke Blue Devils coming in at number four maybe the hottest team in the tournament right now coming in Clemson the number three then when you think about the Virginia Cavaliers making their interest into the ACC tournament on Tuesday and of course the top seed Miami Hurricanes who has a plethora of offensive weapons when they arrive in Greensboro so fans of all the schools Gathering here for the sessions getting a chance to see who might be an opponent down the line 354 to go here in the first half and OB fortunate news great news for Florida State Seminoles no structural damage with Matthew Cleveland and theyre going to tape him up and hopefully see if he can return in the second half thats about the best possible news all I can say to that its great to be young great to be young I would still be on the floor right now if that happened down the floor for about six months but you know as high as he was that was the really scary thing and he hasnt returned yet but its incredible to think he might Terry for the line driver short one of the things that were seeing right now from Georgia Tech most of their shots have been short and we go back to the fact that this is a sixman rotation these guys have played a lot of minutes over the last stretch of basketball for the ram the rep FSU by the way came right from their last game right here last game Saturday came down from Blacksburg and have been here in Greensboro working on their opportunities remind to the fans to download the ACC threepoint challenge app presented by New York Life to help benefit the local Boys and Girls Clubs score points for your school and after the tournament local Boys and Girls Club will receive a donation from New York Life based on their Affiliated ACC teams final ranking oh and the topic of threepointers now you and Randolph at dinner last night going back and forth about a whole Myriad of skills that both of you had both great players you guys were one oneupping each other all night long I mean starting with the appetizer and the entree the dessert and then you had another dessert you had to throw in the multiples it was remarkable but you two are a lot of fun but over you tell the family business about our designs but again thats okay you can do that you can take that back no ones paying any its thats okay but again we had a great a great time last night of course you Kim myself from Jay billis Randolph childrens Jordan I mean we had to hold through its great a great time yeah its a terrific way to kick off the ACC tournament for us it was lightweight for me and Randolph last night Norman gets much more heated than we did we try to act civilized you know in the restaurant guys are great friends another man down as Kelly made the basket Miller on the floor now holding that right ankle weve saw weve seen uh Matthew Cleveland already exit with the injury by Bob Miller sliding there goes that right ankle turning still on his back 611 freshman grew up in Spain 246 to go and a half and well see if Baba can get up here and get back on his feet but the second apparent ankle injury it was number one both of these for Florida State boy thats just its scary watching that replay yeah when you see Matthew Cleveland immediately just sit down to not put any pressure on that right ankle and then Baba Miller turning it stepping on someone foot which is a very common injury in the game yep well well take a break here well be back in 30 25 18 FSU Obama Miller on his feet and the scene we just saw several minutes ago an FSU player being held back to the locker room to have an ankle checked out and this happens so often in basketball stepping on either teammates foot or an opponents foot and rolling the ankle yeah thats a full roll from Miller as well we saw with Matthew Cleveland the ankle was put rolling completely over same thing with same thing with Miller so hopefully we have opportunity to get both these young men back on the floor in the second half but sure there will be some testing maybe a couple images done on Baba Miller before that decision is made so a couple of key men outs for the Seminoles and yet theyre on top 2518 as far they have withstood these problems and OB we have to go back to our quote we read the Leonard Hamilton earlier in the game this even though unexpected Leonard Hamilton prepared for this hes learned to prepare for any of the unexpected all season long green with a Nifty hook pass and a slam by Cora and the big freshman and thats what you get when other guys Step Up so FSU continues to be the sharper team whistle on the Baseline with 206 to go in the first half first round of the ACC Tournament game number one Darren Green Jr attacking the basket the nice fine for cam corn who finishes with authority over the rim Terry bottled up and theyre going to call that a hell ball and thatll turn the ball over so Florida state will win it back with the defense and right now weve seen a lot more energy for the Seminoles throughout this game Leonard Hamilton told us early in this season he could say okay look Im just going to cut the rotation play the guys that have experience and slow things down but he decided not to do that he want to play the Florida state way and theyve done that and allowed the guys to be able to gain experience and its showing up here right now Applause Jackson over the top green cant handle that but knocked away from him with seven on a shot clock and this is Mama Miller whats another really good sign as he is now running on that to be young I would I would sing it like the old Coming to America days Im not going to do it our listeners do not deserve that to be indestructible I pull up pop there but Worley hell knock it down so 10 players of log minutes for FSU a couple of them have gone back to the locker room with ankle injuries and they both may be back before the game is over Kelly cant finish it slapped away and a nice save there on that sideline got it free to Debo Coleman and official timeout Jamie lucky stopping play with a minute 15 to go and Jamie lucky looking to see if the shot clock should have reset if Florida State actually had possession of that basketball and great to see Baba Miller coming back out of the tunnel and joining his team once again Joseph one 15 to go well take another break here for 30 Florida State despite the injuries on top 2918 Music next up the Cleveland will return a chance Florida State Worley Cleveland for the win its good Matthew Cleveland stuns Miami I think Matthew Cleveland may have called game he just looked at the fans and said time to go home and Florida doesnt go because Glenn he is on the floor look what hes capable of absolutely capable of Big Time plays and three buzzer beater wins for Matthew Cleveland to his credit only a sophomore at Florida State he has three games already where hes made the final shot to get his team a victory I dont think I ever had one in my college career over he didnt have one not one while its milk coming up in minutes ago before the break Kelly yes hes touched there 38 beyond the three encouraging sign for Josh pastner getting Miles Kelly going the ACC player the player of the week averaging 25 and a half points in the last two Row games which will both wins for Georgia Tech coming in today Jackson over the top again and its tipped in and Cory got his fingertips on it not a friendly roll and you speak of freshman camcord has been a very good freshman throughout this season but he continues to get better you see him stepping up playing that role as the five men at Florida State which normally is reserved for someone at least seven feet tall but cam corn is doing a great job filling in this year Applause straight on Sturdivant got an excellent look he was wide open rebound batted around itll go the other way 14 and a half seconds to play in half number one McLeod 74 Junior from Philly getting ready to check back in so another 30 second timeout and well keep it right here with Florida State leading 3121 they would have been forgiven given the season theyve had at nine and 22 with two of their better players going out with ankle injuries gonna fold up a little in the first half anything but really but one of the things youve seen as Leonard Hamilton and Stan the Man Jones whos drawing up something right now for this last second past 14 and a half before Florida State they continue to coach this team and theyve talked a lot about were not necessarily coaching the things that weve coached in the past were going back to Bases were teaching the basics once again that we havent had to do with experienced teams over the past five six seasons but right now I believe its going to benefit this program for these guys getting this major experience throughout the season well to their credit they havent hung their heads theres still a lot of energy theres still a lot of enthusiasm he mentioned yesterday in their practice amazing to see these guys remain positive after the season that theyve had Worley bringing it across Applause seconds to go in the half Morley looking to make a move pulls up that ones sailed on thats how the first half comes to an end Florida State in game number one behind Leonard Hamilton and a lot of guys who got in the game no shot there they lead 31 bite a couple of injuries Florida state has had the better of it its looking like a man who needs to play right now yeah I mean and its its amazing that you could have an injury like that and come out of the locker room and still the tip to play in the second half says a lot about him as a young man in his character but more importantly the leadership that hes showing about how important this game is for his team that just shows you how important this game is to Matthew Cleveland and to the Seminoles for the second foul by the way so is the theory hes flowing get some you know blood flowing through that ankle and hopefully it loosens up for him even more as the game action goes along sort of a nice little jump shot to get the yellow jackets on the board here in the second half and again this is game number one of the day Boston College and Louisville coming up at 4 30 and then Virginia Tech and Notre Dame tonight at seven West Durham and Jordan Garnett will be on the call right here from the Coliseum heres Cleveland now he kind of left him wide open to shoot that one but he cant bury it yeah Georgia Tech in the zone right now not getting out to Cleveland but again hes an improved shooter and thats one you dont want to continue to give him those type of looks again he had 21 points and a first goaround against Georgia Tech earlier this winter sort of been pounding it inside thats a traveling violation Applause so this was right at the beginning of the second half and this did not look like a man who is ready to play it did not but weve seen him go up and down the court a couple of times already here in this second half and he looks even better than he did then so maybe the ankle is starting to loosen up some for Matthew Cleveland but definitely not his normal effective self hes showing you some serious toughness early on the drive a reach in here and the officials getting together theyll keep it on this end good crew here Jamie lucky Tommy Morrissey and Jerry heater you chatted with Jerry heater a little before the game did you ask him did he have a big fastball he has to I mean at the end of the day if your last name is heater youve got to throw the heat absolutely 98 heres Worley too strong he told him I knew a guy that was connected with the Red Sox you know if he could really hit the heat I might be able to get him a shot yeah if he was still throwing that hard all these years later he could use the help anybody could 3123 Coleman will bounce here for Franklin Franklin a dynamic Talent hell draw a foul on his way to the cup 67 senior from Little Rock Arkansas last nine games hes been averaging a doubledouble and thats one of the areas why hes been so successful and Josh pastors group has since theyve gone small putting Franklin at the Five Spot is because in their prison offense when youre putting the basketball into the hand of your fiveman Franklin has the ability to beat his guy off the bounce Music just getting an offensive rebound dinner you know just how really hard in a great rebounder thats the bigger concern well the thing to watch I think certainly for Cleveland is explosiveness will he show you any of that because its a big part of his game hes gonna drive it here and kick it back out Mills will fire Cleveland went for the rebound came up short on that now Georgia Tech trying to cut into the lead they have been trailing most of the day here in game one ACC tournament round number one Kelly all the way through with that left hand Miles Kelly of course from Atlanta as is Matthew Cleveland Im sure this is the first time these guys have met at the rim throughout their entire careers but both have made tremendous jumps during this sophomore season Worley from the corner the cloud got the rebound came right to him at a whistle here I mean 1708 to go in the first half in the second half the first half the big story was the injuries for the Knowles and yet they overcame those foul number three on Miles Kelly played through those 2000 the first half for a long period of time and Josh faster has always been one of the coaches who does not subscribe to the take you out once you get two fouls hell play guys with even three fouls in the first half green stepping into a three and drills in and even stepping in he was still about 30 feet away he likes it out there he does again in your Georgia Tech youve got to know hes capable of knocking down threes from well beyond the threepoint line a couple of steps inside mid Court in Franklin with a kick for Terry and he returns the favor but you can see right now Josh pastor wants to put the basketball in the hands of Franklin especially with McLeod guarding him hes already gotten corn in foul trouble and see if he can make plays for his teammates Applause long distance yes and sweet touch there from Matthew Cleveland and the one thing that Cleveland will be able to do effectively with the the engine ankle right now is stand and shoot if youre Georgia Tech great point high for that although in your seven Florida State opening up the lead what weve seen great initiating throughout this game many young people will walk away from not a lot of meaning in a 1213 matchup but you can see how important it is to Matthew Cleveland and to the Florida State Seminoles two for seven and six points you know theres another side of it too and that is should he be out there you know hobbling around on a on a bad ankle and at times shes looked like hes coming around again other times not so much well one thing I would say to this is you know when you have this game an opportunity to be able to play it I missed the ACC tournament my last two seasons in college because my ankle was broken so with no structural damage if he can go play I say go play enjoy yourself because you never take these opportunities for granted man is that a pretty shot by Miles Kelly on the drive sweet little reverse Miles Kelly sawing off a little bit of his offensive ability which weve seen a lot of throughout these last nine games for Georgia Tech averaging over 20 points per game throughout the stretch goes on the Baseline McLeod that close you got to shoot that one over here okay maybe not 40 to 31 FSU sturdament quickly down the other end big rebound Franklin McLeod with the block well hes certainly capable of doing that yes Cleveland letting him has to be happy with the Productions hes got now that Five Spot between McLeod and cam corn throughout this game offensively and defensively Music Applause and the Mills theyre reaching a foul Kelly was on him give you a look at who is showing up here that is the Louisville Cardinals theyre coming up against BC at 2 30 here the ACC Network as the tournament rolls on were just getting started ACC Baseball game of the week coming up on Friday night number 19 NC State Miami squaring off first game of a threegame series at Alex Rodriguez Park in Coral Gables right here at ACC network coverage begins at 7 Eastern I hope Ive been that guy out there playing pickup in the park many many times I can tell you right now if I turn my ankle Im not playing anymore that is it for the day its like every weekend in those pickup games I was turning my ankle shutting it down in about five minutes meanwhile Matthew Cleveland continues to play We Know Leonard and we know Stan on their bench very very well theres no way theyre letting him play if its going to you know cause a further injury or if theres any kind of structural damage forget about it no chance in the world absolutely not and again of course thats one of the things that Leonard Hamilton has talked so much about that he learned from Lake Kelly believes the assistant coach for it Austin P his first coaching job was how to love on his players how to take care of his players and protect them and again hes protecting Matthew Cleveland and his by allowing him to play with so many Scouts here to see him now tightening up a little bit 40 34 FSU Applause back outside for Sturdivant cam Corin 610 freshman for FSU playing in foul trouble getting ready to check back into the game shot clock is at five Franklin hands off heres Kelly hes got a heaven up there Applause FSU a couple of times has had a lead as high as 11 today Worley Nifty Spin and fouled Applause so he got hit by Debo Coleman thatll be number one on the 66 sophomore from Memphis and well put Worley at the line Morley recently lit up Pittsburgh for 23 points hes had some big games this year and against getting into the starting lineup after the injury to camera fletzer another injury that Florida state had to deal with throughout this season Fletcher was really playing his best basketball probably the best player for the team when he was injured in that game at Virginia but it allowed Jalen Wally to be able to get into the starting lineup and Floridas taking off to a pretty good start in ACC play now theyve lost nine of their last 11 games we got off to a good start in the first part of ACC so the rebuilding for FSU 922 most losses in school history theyre not used to this used to being very competitive you know a couple of years ago coming here before the tournament was canceled they looked like a final 14 absolutely and theyre not used to playing this many young guys Leonard Hamilton is used to having guys who have been in the program for two years and now ready to step up into a different role so its been different for the Seminoles this season having to play so many guys that are inexperienced within their system you believe though with a couple of these injured guys whove been out most of the year as Kelly drives it oh man stuffed in by Franklin who talked about the Hops hes up over that ramp we saw that one coming he got a free run down the lane and once the basketball came off the rim it was over for anybody other than Franklin hell grab the rebound theres a foul there on Miller trying to slow down Applause came on Franklin look at this look at that you can hear it that is going to get it Jayvon Franklin going well above pretty much got to move the throw out the way he got a little fro working right now he had to move it out the way before he messed up his hair on the rim Miller with his second personal foul and 12 41 to go and the officials going to the monitor but Baba Miller tossing Lance Terry down I believe the officials are going over to look at that and see if there was any type of hostile acting Matthew Cleveland fearful of sitting down thats one thing when youre playing with the injury oftentimes you sit down and stiffens up so of course very intelligent young man smarter him to stay up and keep moving especially during these breaks to make sure that ankle doesnt get stiffer last years ACC Sixth Man of the Year over the past years not this year but many seasons sort of a rite of passage for Florida State they have pretty much you know taken over that award ever since Fiona cabelli was the guy that did it first and ever since then its been the Florida state award is what they were looking at as they went to the monitor and theyve just ruled a common foul here you see Miller and Terry getting involved in the mix right there the foul will go on Baba Miller but not much there but we have to mention Georgia Tech making this a sixpoint game now opportunity to cut even more into that lead Miles Kelly knocking down the three and Franklins dont just like that making this game much closer the pressure in for Terry Music dont forget coming up at 4 30 Boston College in Louisville thats the 10 seed in the 15 at seven oclock Virginia Tech and Notre Dame the 11 against the 14 Mike gray every game he coaches in Notre Dame could be his last shot clock at six Franklin again and too strong thats not something you see a lot of from Franklin hes not the guy Norm hes going to shoot the jump shot attacks the basket most of the time on the offensive end but pressed up against the shot clock sturdomen trying to slow down Mills that is a tough task and he commits the foul of course Mike Perez also said he wants to keep coaching its going to end in Notre Dame but its not going to be the end of his coaching career yeah but were going to miss him in the ACC though one of the best coaches sure not just on the floor but also off the court to be able to tell us to have conversations with like terrific coach immensely entertains a great success at Notre Dame close to Duncan it was a whistle before that with 11 56 to go the foul on Coleman will be his second Boston College inside their locker room theyre getting ready to take the floor Makai he cut the hair I didnt even recognize him yesterday obvious got a new look for us I have a structured settlement at this point going down the stretch but my Cinderella team and when I say Cinderella that means a team that is not starting in the quarterfinal somebody that starts on Tuesday or Wednesday Im going with the wolf pack Kevin Keats in his group blown out at home one senior night by Clemson jarkel Joyner to quavion Smith and DJ Burns will be very motivated coming into the Greensboro Coliseum green Junior for sinking that free throw NC State playing late tomorrow night the winner of Virginia Tech and Notre Dame takes on the wolf back there the number 60 thats at 9 30 tomorrow night and weve seen in the past know very well that the wolf pack faithful can turn this into PNC part two Mr Franklin once again rising up for a slam he only has seven points it feels like a lot more than that because he has 13 rebounds but hes got loud points though you recognize it whenever hes scoring you sure do fun to watch Jackson Kelly stuck right with him that helped Force the turnover Applause Yellow Jackets want to hurry up is Terry from the corner Applause Baba Miller good to see him active again Applause who werent with us in the first half FSU lost a couple of guys including Matthew Cleveland for a while because of ankle injuries Miller in and out Applause Music and he batted away itll stay right here Cleveland still staying on those feet and talking about the Hops uh Franklin yeah Franklin just finding his way on to the highlights whenever he gets his hands on the basketball just the degree of difficulty of that dunk he makes it look easy that is far from Easy youve got to be big time athletic to do that Jackson denied Music Applause Darren Green with a fall away and Franklins got another rebound hes been a monster on the glass yeah he had 15 rebounds in there win at Boston College to end the regular season and its creeping right back up there again may go above that here this afternoon yeah its 14 and a whistle here stopping play at 1016 to go Georgia Tech creeping back into this thing once again draws a big win from Leonard which is not a typical thing to see from Leonard Hamilton hes normally locked in hes normally pretty locked in during the game so but as he mentioned this has been a learning year for him so hes learning to enjoy it a little bit more he looked amused 4338 shot clock down to six Kelly doesnt shoot it Sturtevants gonna have to on the heave Yvonne Tipton controlled by the Knowles Applause youre talking about Leonard Hamilton High holds basketball says it is my Ministry this is my calling to help young people fulfill their dreams hes been doing that for an awfully long time he absolutely has and again he was that young person and he had people ministering to him and basketball allowed him to fulfill his dream so hes paying it forward has been doing it for over 50 years now Cleveland back on Applause Sturtevant by the way with his third foul for the yellow jackets under 10 to play Chandler Jackson The Freshman to get it in Cleveland pull up pop well that ankle looked pretty good there its amazing the way hes been able to move especially when hes got the basketball in his hands so you can limp when youre on defense but when he gets the ball in his hands he looks just as quick as he did before he went out with the engine the lip kind of disappears hes shot himself a jump shot of it on a tough drive with some contact Franklin finishes another one Franklin last nine games averaging a doubledouble he recently had the fifth triple double in Georgia Tech History it was against Syracuse 14 along with 15 rebounds and 10 assists Hobie there have been three triple doubles in the ACC this season as Chandler Jackson gets to his spot and is able to knock it down two of them against Syracuse I know that makes you feel great you know a little pain thanks for that a little bit of a wound there jaquel Joyner got a triple double at Syracuse but Syracuse did win that game it was different Javon Franklin he was able to get in trouble double and to win Kelly way downtown and and hold on to play in the act of shooting the three foreign sophomore moving off the ball you see him moving off the ball hes got a little more speed to him when he knows hes going to get it and then once he gets it in his hands I didnt see the limbo Im just saying Im not saying he doesnt exist but I didnt see a limp when he was getting to the Sweet Spot oh it definitely is there I mean we saw the ankle injury in the first half and that was really frightening it really was because he had jumped so high and when he came down thats when he turned it youre all thinking well I dont know lets say right now when he gets that ball in his hands going to get a bucket hes not thinking about that limp hes not thinking about the ankle hes only thinking about two points and weve seen him do that heres the second half meanwhile the Seminoles fouled the wrong guy in the act of attempting a three because Kellys 89 and drains him so its a fourpoint game its the closest since FSU LED it 1612 and give Georgia Tech a tremendous amount of credit specifically Javon Franklin hes been the guy thats really LED them with their energy their effort coming up with the offensive rebounds the putbacks and doing it defensively as well Applause Music Applause Cleveland Zips the pass here for Miller shot clock at 10 Applause Jalen Worley he spins he dishes and its knocked away and of course whos the guy Daniel in the spot right there Javon Franklin coming away with the steal Kelly not waiting cant hit the three dont mind that three however though for Kelly thats a shot that Josh Pastor is comfortable with him taking Applause Music so Florida State will call a timeout 7 45 on the clock 4743 Matthew Cleveland still getting it done a moment of change coming Matthew Cleveland our got a spotlight where he was able to get a couple buckets early but then turning that right ankle contesting the shot of Lance Terry goes to the locker room xrays come back no structural damage so of course he does damage when he gets back on the court knocking down the three and then getting on the move running for the basketball getting to a sweet spot being able to raise up over top of Terry knocking down the bucket Matthew Cleveland has been a moment of Change by himself for Florida State yeah hes not sitting down is paid off over the top of the slam for Mellow so out of the timeout terrific play lines up a stuff for the 611 freshman we have Bob Miller Another young man we saw have to exit in the first half turning that ankle but now has a career high seven rebounds and contributing offensively as well can corn with nine rebounds thats also a career high for another Seminole he is Franklin to hook that one but it wont fall you know you see Bob Miller out here getting significant minutes you got to remind everyone he missed the first 16 games of this season due to a NCAA suspension so it hits really you know Midway through for him hes just now starting to try to figure things out Applause Cleveland took a look at the shot clock its at six Applause its going to go the other way with 6 43 to go those are 39 on the clock oh its going to be a foul on Clevelands first you notice how much more significant Olympia is after a turnover Ive done that so again I know that trick about new Cleveland Ive done that before Ive been guilty that Ive turned the basketball over oh man my ankle really hurts right now Florida State cooling off a little bit here in the second half big reason why this game is tightened up Terry to penetrate great job coming over by corner I think he was trying to dunk that thing a nice attack by Terry but cam corn had something for him waiting at the basket green with a onehander too strong rebound by corn at a whistle time now from Food Lions Food For Thoughts last 10 Champs the ACC tournament rarely would you find a league throughout the country that has this type of diversity in the teams who have represented the ACC as the ACC Tournament champion eight different teams over the last 10 years have won a title some highly memorable runs through the tournament including just last year Virginia Tech I felt like the Hokies came out of nowhere and just swept right through this thing and thats one of the areas and again when you talk about this league this is the reason why I feel the ACC is the best conference college basketball comps in the country now have they had the best season this year no but at the same time traditionally year to year youve got the best coaching youve got 15 different styles of play in this conference and which is the reason why you have you see the evaluation of the ACC last season you see Duke in North Carolina this season Virginia Miami Duke so many different teams always Rank and then you think about of course last season the seating in the NCAA tournament look at this year you still got those same seats its only five teams right now projected in the field but last season three teams in the elite eight two teams in the final four no other conference does this OB it doesnt happen anywhere but the ACC what youre talking about that opinion is based on year after year after year not any one particular year like this year no question the big 12 is the best conference in college basketball I would give the Big 12 the nod but I can tell you this right now the ACC has 15 teams the Big 12 has 10 Im taking my 10 teams from the ACC we can go toetotoe with any conference Big 12 sec it doesnt matter who it is Im taking the top 10 teams out of this conference I like our team man I would not disagree you and I cover this conference every week would not disagree for one second Worley looking to penetrate lost it for a moment recover nice pass as well and another stop for Corin Music Applause big rebounding day for Corin with 10 5145 coming up on five minutes to play Kelly pulls up and switches into three miles Kellys impressive over this young man can shoot the basketball he can score The Rock him being the ACC player of the week the last week the regular season no fluke for Miles Kelly Music Miles Kelly showing off his ability to shoot the basketball off the bounce lining it up with three knocking it down you know and lb we talk about this team and when you think about lets look at these two teams on the floor right now we mentioned that they both have beaten the number one seed in the ACC in Miami how different of styles of contrasting play do you have with Florida State who switches everything defensively Georgia Tech Josh back they play an amoebalike Zone you never can figure out what theyre doing these styles of play are very difficult for other conferences other teams to be able to match up with but in the ACC theyre the 12th and 13th seed that would not that doesnt happen in any other conference that shows you the level of depth of this and the differences coaching and its a little I think education into why maybe the ACC goes deep in the NCAA tournament absolutely because you cant prepare for the Syracuse Zone with your scout team in practice you cant prepare for what Josh bassner does with your scout team and practice over Leonard Hamilton does thats what makes this conference so great its the guys who lead the conference from the coaching standpoint under five to go in a threepoint game first game of the ACC tournament nice fine corn again downstairs tough to move him there a big athletic guy his dad played at Georgia for the FSU Hall of Famer Hugh Durham no shoe Durham in both the FSU and Georgia Hall of Fame great question I got to believe he is I mean I would think so he was a great coach at Georgia and Florida State one player two won the only SEC Championship for Georgia right 1990 that one tapped up but there is a foul there as well with 421 left its gonna be number four on Franklin has been such a key man for the Yellow Jackets today yeah thats a big foul Georgia Tech this season has only had three players foul out that would be a record for the Georgia Tech the lowest theyve ever had the season is five so again we we dont want Javon Franklin fouling out messing up any records pretty amazing though just three all season long Ley to the line Applause Music and connect on number one Franklin with the save Obi this is a game where Franklin may put up a 20 rebound effort good terrific offensive rebound as well and thats it and one what a great Drive and its Terry going strong takes the hit as well and for those at home watching hopefully you didnt turn your head because if you did you come back and recognize this is a one possession game after the strong attacks from Lance Terry getting downhill taking on the 611 Baba Miller Millers third personal Terry makes 81 percent at the foul line dont look now its a twopoint game and Josh Bassett once again switching it up defensively extending the Zone mobile one three one look out the half court and part of the problem when youre playing against it you never know what type of Defense Georgia Tech is in meanwhile Matthew Cleveland fsus best player right now remaining on the sideline I wont say on the bench because hes still standing and now Georgia Tech with an opportunity to Tire Take the Lead Coleman with an open look he hits it and he ties the game at 53 and give Georgia Tech a lot of credit things were not going their way early in this game they continue to battle and right now we have a reset 5353 328 remaining weve got a game with our hands here OB vious on the ACC Network basketball is coming your way brought to you by New York Life over 12 000 agents there to help guide you through lifes happiest and most difficult times Music there are all kinds of products in this world Applause Music we welcome you to the ACC tournament Applause spokes Applause continues his turret Pace at the plane Applause hey the nothing but net crew will have pregame halftime at post game for three firstround games today theyre working hard highlights and Alices complete breakdown she can only get one place right here on acc Network and the ESPN app Music Im not going to call what booze is doing right now working hard I mean again Im not calling you that working hard speaking of not working hard boom might not be working much longer Obi his son hes got twins but I can tell you right now those young guys can play his oldest son that doctors not older I think Cameron might be a one minute home one minute is the best player in high school basketball regardless of class and hes a sophomore right now how about that if they change the age limit in the NBA I dont think hes going to make it to college on the spin oh nicely done by Jackson got right into that spin cycle to make it 5553 FSU and thats a necessary answer right there for Chandler Jackson to be able to come up with a big bucket after Georgia Tech tied this game Franklin rolling to the hoop but no tough angle for him to be able to catch that one and finish it athletic enough to give it a great attempt but that was a tough pass to be able to hand it hes working on a 17 rebound game got to get another Point only nine points you got to have a dump if you just have two rebounds youve got to have a double they have to by default Corinth has to work for it but gets it when he gets positioned boy its tough to move him cam was an ACC rookie of the week in January and right now he goes to work when he catches the basketball interior and you see him move Miles Kelly out of the way catches the basketball great footwork the strength to be able to finish and through all that he got a strong talking to by coach Dan Jones Jenna Worley whistled for a foul here and that puts Sturdivant on the line for Georgia Tech and shooting a 11 with 227 to go Yellow Jackets a couple of times looked like they were on the verge of getting knocked out they have fought their way back Sturdivant 67 percent at the foul line use the yellow jackets assist leader the transfer from the University of Southern California Applause Kyle of course is his Godfather is one Damon stottlemyer whos associate head coach for the Boston Celtics right now NBA rookie of the year 1995 and Kyle said Damon told him a lot about this game Applause FSU with a basketball now clinging to a twopoint lead coming up on two minutes to go green gives it up for Mills shot clock at seven hell fire it up and hit it a threepointer huge bucket by Kayla bills where the threepointer is not necessarily his strong suit a capable score from Beyond The Arc normally does most of his damage getting downhill but stepping up and knocking at a big three and not long ago at 27 against Boston College though heres Kelly with the answer well that one you expect you do expect that and you expect from Miles Kelly to step up and make big shots during this time of the game remember Georgia Tech coming into the ACC tournament on a threegame winning streak and they played in the second half the way Josh passett was expecting them to play an entertaining game here the first game of the New York Life ACC tournament between the 12 and 13 seeds Jackson Applause trying to get something done here against Coleman Coleman great defense on him its going to roll in but wave that off in the foul will go against Georgia Tech and a strong defensive possession by Debo Coleman offensive here take a look yeah you get opportunity to see two guys getting the job done Caleb Mills thinking about it should I attack maybe he has to just pull up from three and knock it down but on the other end of the four miles Kelly with the answer Kyle start with the penetration and great job by Kelly moving to the open spot and knocking down a true long distance three so twopoint lead here for the Knowles as we approach one minutes ago Sturdivant on the dribble the pullup and yes it drops and we are tied at 60 Kyle started but seems to do his best work when the game gets tight at the end weve seen him do that a number of times for Georgia Tech this season orally back for Jackson 40 seconds to go Applause nine to get off a shot green on the dribble five to shoot it way downtown kidbury rebounded Away by the yellow jackets in Kelly with 22 seconds to play and a tie game Applause and right now Josh Pastor not going to call the timeout does not want to give Florida State an opportunity to switch their defense under 10 Applause the drive the cut and it wont go heres the following foul as Franklin got hit with point two on the clock he draws the foul as he went up for a big board Obi Im not sure that Georgia Tech has had a lead at all in this game and here we are with 2 seconds remaining they did have one lead at six five with 1537 left in the first half and that point two now opportunity to win this game theres nothing you can do with 02 seconds you cant catch and shoot you can tip it but its going to be difficult to tip from 94 feet away Jim on Franklin 68 percent at the foul line and makes the first run 19 rebounds Franklin thats the most by a Georgia Tech player ever in the ACC tournament a timeout he has been incredible on the glass and did it at clutch time too he absolutely has done it at clutchtown that point gets him to the double double and more importantly maybe gets his team a win the timeout right now from Josh pass as you see on the last possession Kyles tournament with the nice fine to Lance Terry who does the right thing by trying to dunk it going aggressive to the rim but as Franklin has done all afternoon long pursuing offensive rebound opportunities and it looks like right now Georgia Tech is going to continue their winning ways here in the ACC tournament 02 showing on the clock he has another foul shot to come but Jovan Franklin has really been the man for the yellow jackets in all honesty at this point with only 02 seconds remaining the only thing that you can do is tip the basketball in you dont have time to catch and shoot if Im Josh faster right now Im telling Miss because as soon as he misses it and the ball is touched the game is over if you give them opportunity to somehow throw a 94foot pass to the rim someone Taps it in then you could possibly tie this basketball game thats the only opportunity that you have well an exciting finish here to game number one between the 12 and 13 seeds cash password and Jerry heat one of the officials with an exchange is there on the sideline Franklin back to the line Franklin again 19 rebounds the rest of the yellow jackets have a total of 10 rebounds today and Josh Pastor calling his team over Im not sure what the conversation between he and Jerry heater was about but calling his team back over 02 on the clock and a onepoint lead for the yellow jackets of both teams going over to their head coaches Seminoles going over to Leonard Hamilton and coming up itll be Louisville and BC as soon as they can get it going the winner of this game between Georgia Tech and Florida State takes on the number five seed the pit Panthers at 2 30 tomorrow right here in Greensboro missing to see Louisville how they approach this game this is another team that started out you know had a rough year but they have picked it up as The Seasons gone along playing against a team and Boston College whos had a number of big wins throughout the season interested to see if whether or not Clinton hosts the accs most improved player will be able to play in this ACC tournament after its tweaking the injury early against Georgia Tech last time out only playing three minutes in that game so Wes and Jordan will have the next couple of games coming up here from the Coliseum meanwhile Jayvon Franklin the senior back to the line and point three on the clock not point two so you do actually have time to catch and shoot at this point and he did Miss on purpose heres the he by Farnham that is the game Big finish for the yellow jackets particularly on the backboard for Franklin he was the hero when they needed him the most he made the foul shot to win the game as well he absolutely was and of course you see Matthew Cleveland with the sprained ankle unable to really have the type of effect he wanted to have on this game in the second half but speaking of having an effect on the game Devon Franklin
