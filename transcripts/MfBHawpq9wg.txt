happy with the defensive effort against noted aim on their last time out so they were to make sure that they cleaned that up of course defense is the calling card here in Charlottesville Notre Dame shot 70 from the floor in the first half last time out against a Virginia Defense that is historically significant just underway Louisville with the basketball first Here Comes Tyler Johnson at the point number four in Black be it inside to Brandon Ley Hatfield and he starts quickly a young man with three consecutive double doubles has the first two points tonight Brandon H Hatfield has been spectacular for the cards as of late averaging over 18 points and over 11 rebounds as you mentioned the last three games and its starting to become a focal point of this offense and you see Kenny Payne wanting to get the ball inside the H well Huntley Hatfield spent his first year at uh Tennessee and and he has talked openly about the fact that as somebody who was young when he got there a young 18 he battled confidence issues and trying to play grown men in the SEC is tough for anybody let alone an 18yearold and he is still working on that and its a process with Kenny Payne UVA has its first two on the shot by Jake grow keep an eye on Mike James whos limping down the floor Ron gr having a conversation with him making sure that he is able to keep going and Louisville can not afford to lose anybody else we know for sure only seven scholarship players available for the Cardinals tonight there may be a little more leeway on that triple by sky Clark from the corner 52 Louisville Lille very well prepared for the double team as Hunley haill dribbles out and finds yanovich coming down the lane who a nice kick to Scott Clark with a corner three ball yeah Dono yvanovich making his first career start for Trey white who yesterday Y at practice tweaked his groin and during shoot around earlier today he was unable to PR participate they had still held out hope that maybe hed be able to play tonight but he is among those not available at least at the moment for Applause Louisville JJ trainer did make the trip but he did not do much during shoot around either he is dressed significant loss for the cards when you think about the experience that they have the majority of it is with a guy like JJ train in this fourth year in the program and were not likely to see Emanuel aor for off the turnover Here Comes dun can he track down the ball and save it he does reestablishes back on this side of the Baseline and U sets up catch and release Andrew roie for three good sign for the whos early Andrew Roy taking that shot early in the shot clock however confidently stepping up and knocking down a big three hes just a tad under 30 on the year shooting has been an issue for UVA outside of Isaac mcney and Jake grow Johnson spotting up a little strong Huntley Hatfield got a hand on the ball but it comes to Applause Virginia Ro skips it back out to be mcney being hounded by Applause Clark good drive by Johnson to set up the open look but Mike James missed it badly both these teams try to settle in a great start offensively now the defense has started to pick up a little bit over the last couple possessions this is where you look for ree beakman to make a play play for Virginia trying to crack that paint create a shot for one of his teammates he is the ACC leader in assist 5 and 1 half per game into the lane puts it up and in Virginia on top seven5 my favorite route and create a shot for himself I like that even more Reese beakman as Tony Bennett told us pregame trying to find that balance between being a facilitator and a scorer and on that one takes the point his own shoulders to get a bucket yeah averaging over 13 points per game how is he doing with that balance this year having a bigger role Cory I believe hes doing a great job with that balance the difference is teams recognize how important he is to the success of the Virginia Cavaliers so therefore often times hes playing against double teams theyre trapping him doing whatever they can to get the basketball out of his hands forcing someone else to make a PL so much on his plate this year for last years ACC Defensive Player of the Year shot clock down to six to the corner yanovich good box out by Jack roges such a good box out that the Virginia bench is standing up applauding the box out recognizing of course taking care of your defensive boards is so important for the hoos Jake Rose the grant transfer from Oklahoma roie up to Groves off the back iron James with a good box out at this end to keep done away from the glass and it appears Mike James is doing okay with his game watching him get through these first 5 minutes of the ball Applause game foul on the penetration its going to go against McNeely and that takes us to our first media timeout 5 minutes in the whos up by two Tony Bennett where the radio analyst for the whos alongside my partner then Dave Kane whos now with the Milwaukee Bucks and thinking back to that time time where jpj wasnt full no and Virginia was getting booed going into the halftime locker room after only scoring 15 points against Iowa State on December the 30th of 2010 and you find yourself wondering what would have happened if the Virginia athletic department the Virginia fans had treated him in a manner as to which Im seeing is happening with Kenny Payne right now Virginia would not have a national championship they would not have a coach on the cusp of being at Hall of Famer moving forward so I would like to employ the Louisville Cardinal faithful to have a little patience with my guy Kenny Payne over there I believe hes going to get this program headed in the right direction Ro misses the three offensive rebound for Virginia beakman always looking for somebody T Murray this time off the bench for Virginia picked up his dribble in a tough spot beakman pulls up give him four early points its a fourpoint Virginia lead but Cory its 15 years later the world of college basketball is a different place plus the fans in Louisville are more accustomed to winning at such a high level than the Virginia fans were 15 years ago so its isnt it apples and oranges its been a long time since the Louisville fans were been accustomed to winning if you go back and you think about once Rick patino exited the building the Louisville Cardinal fans have not been used to winning and so when Kenny Payne took over this program he made it very clear that the program was broken it needed to be fixed and when youre dealing with one of your own as Kenny Payne is of course national champion at University of Louisville you also have to understand that there are many recruits watching how do you treat your own and that is a big thing moving forward because I can tell you for certain as we see tame Murray coming off the screen knocking down at dick freeball there are Elite high school basketball players waiting to see how this goes with Kenny Payne to whether they sign up to play for the cards or they move elsewhere and when you say one of your own of course Kenny Payne was a terrific basketball player at Louisville was a freshman on Denny crumbs National Championship team in 1980 and was a firstr draft pick played a number of years in the NBA and it has not gone the way they would have liked a 9 and 35 record as head coach at is Alma moner sky Clark buries the three but I can tell you also when the gym was half full back in 2010 2011 it wasnt going the way that Virginia fans wanted it to go either there was no embrace the pace as we see Blake Buchanan off the beautiful dime from Reese beakman finishing it off the first time Buchanan has scored in the last four games so an encouraging sign for the first year yeah I asked Tony Bennett before the game whats different now for Blake Buchanan than the first time I saw him in the Florida game in Charlotte way back in November when he was so good and it just sounds like its the usual course for freshman thats it confidence thats what it is and as a as a freshman youre going to be up and down youre going to have those es those flows and Tony Bennett knows that they made the commitment this summer they were going to give younger players a try they were not going to go out and I mean they brought in some transfers however theyre going to give Blake ukan an opportunity to play Elijah gertrud whos checking in he will get an opportunity Leon Bond whos checking in he will get an opportunity they knew they were going to be a younger team they were going to have to battle these es and flows of a season and dealing with youth and this is part of what happened you have those games where you go to Notre D and the team doesnt show up in the manner that you were expecting however theyve responded very well here this even and again these are two programs that in the last 11 years have won national championships the expectations are to win and win at a very high level theres coach Bennett in his 15th year in this particular matchup between these two schools UVA has dominated in recent years having won the last seven times and during coach Bennetts tenure hes 172 against Louisville yeah they have had Louisvilles number during that stretch even when the Great Rick patino was coaching at Louisville Virginia was still able to win that match up pman up against the shot clock had to shoot it Leon Bond pulls down the offensive rebound this is Elijah gertrud see Louisville going to the Zone on this possession more difficult to come up with those defensive rebounds as we get second offensive rebound opportunity for Leon Bond theyre going to stop that the shot clock did not reset I mean did reset and it should not have whether it hit the rim or not Oh I thought it hit the rim I thought it was a good reset back to 20 theyre going to figure it out now well take a break here on the ground the second ever ACC player to have a triple double in their first game game along with Dennis Scott and we come back and that was actually not a shot clock reset so the officials went over and cleared it only 2 seconds for Virginia coming in up turning it over on the inbounds Play Tyler Johnsons pass goes out of bounds off the hands of Caleb Music Applause Glenn tomorrows Pack 12 basketball game on ESPN of the app Caleb love and number 10 Arizona look to bounce back from there New Years Eve upset loss to Stanford against KJ Simpson and 112 Colorado at 930 Eastern 630 Pacific from the male Center in Tucson the Buffs sit at top the Pack 12 and have won six in a row and Cory you have seen the Buffs firstand turned Miami over 20 times in a game yeah that was a uh impressive performance by the Buffalo and they did that without their star freshman Cody Williams who still hasnt made his return to the lineup but Arizona has been one of the best teams in the country this year and you mentioned Caleb love playing great basketball Andrew roie around and out good look for RO on that ones already knocked down one three shooting it with confidence and thats the one thing if youre Tony Bennett you want to see Sky Clarks Miss is grabbed by Ryan Dunn its one thing for certain every time Scott Clark shoots it its going to be with confidence he doesnt care at all about a missed before hes going to let the next one go inside to Dun ball knocks out of bounds along the Baseline and itll stay at this end yeah sky Clark had a chance to meet him before the game today and asked him why he wears the number 55 you know why dont you uh I do not his guy white chocolate Jay will so apparently he knows him because his dad knew him in Central Florida got to meet him but obviously Skys not old enough to have watched Jason Williams play in real time but with video you can go back and watch anything of course and that is his guy so you when you talk about him playing with confidence Jason Williams white chocolate certainly played with confidence I played against Jason Williams a many many of times I absolutely saw it firsthand was unbelievable to a lot of things that he would do in the game that many of us would only do in pickup games there goes sky Clark traveling I asked him if there was a significance to his first name having two ys at the end of it he said no its just what mom went with but its Sky y sky Clark Hometown Los Angeles family moved to Tennessee when he was an 11th grader in high school then to Atlanta where they are now and after spending his freshman year or part of his freshman year at the University of illinoisillinois has found a home at the University of Louisville but Scotts really like a a first year this year he only played seven games in Illinois last season so when youre talking about the youth of this team as Isaac mcney lines up the three and is able to knock it down you know both of these teams are relatively young you you remove Reese beakman from the lineup and Jacob Groves this is a very young Virginia team youre talking about a bunch of first and second year guys playing significant minutes and the same is the case for the cards their sophomore is a transfer xan Payne has come into the game the son of Kenny Again Louisville playing with only seven scholarship players tonight because of injury the pass was kicked by Clark so UVA will keep it and you do know why its xan pain corre Alexander there you go just making sure you know there is xan talking to his dad on the way out gave his dad a few seconds few good seconds Id like to think Zan is a seconde grad transfer after spending four years at Kentucky Town where he grew up of course Kenny Payne spent 10 years as the top assistant coach for John caliper done off the sweet lob pass from beakman and Virginia looking very well prepared for the Zone weve seen Louisville mix up their zone between a 23 and a 131 that time in a 131 Zone with the screen and roll action no one to defend ree beakman from getting into the paint six different Cavaliers have scored including all five starters now Huntley Hatfield shaping up gets double team skips to the corner James rising up for three rows with another physical rebound and Huntley Hatfield is down holding his left hit and there is number five walking his way back down to the other end of the court but his left hip is what he landed on there yeah and you can only imagine right now Kenny Payne coming into this game with only seven available scholarship players and the last thing they can afford is have the injury to Brandon Hunley Hatfield who has been their star over the last three games and Dennis Evans the sevenfooter did not make the trip still recovering from a shoulder Applause injury thats a nice pass sure is you got to make that one when Ro throws a pass like that thats one youve got to be able to drop that down Clark another offensive Rebound in the stick back by Dono yvanovich that snapped a 4minute scoreless drought and has the Cardinals back within Music five Tony Bennett talked to us pregame about how teams are starting to Zone up more so you can see virgin put a lot of work into their zone offense and Ryan dun knowing exactly where to go on that possession finding Ro in the corner knocks down his second three of the even in and out they go from the nail to the corner found the open man he its an eightpoint UVA Applause lead Clark back to Ivanovic wide open the Southpaw leaves it short done with another rebound hes 10th in the league in that category beakman drawing a crowd defensively finds Groves Applause roie on the quick back UVA with its largest lead up by 10 great recognition by Ryan Dunn seeing Hunley Hatfield go over as a shot blocker knowing that if he doesnt get the basketball its going to be an offensive rebound opportunity mcney whistled for the foul Virginia operating on all cylinders early offensively Ryan Dunn finds Andrew roie in the corner is able to knock down the three ball and then its roie going off the glass unable to finish but Ryan done there to finish it up to help out a teammate Notre Dame Virginia made only two threepoint shots all game two for 11 Cory theyve already doubled their makes here tonight a great start home sweet home Virginia getting back on the home floor and shooting the basketball extremely well 40 to start the game four of 10 and as the cards have Zone Virginia theyve had Zone Busters to start this one Isaac mcney with the three and of course Andrew Roy with two threes already here in this first half well McNeely is the guy fourth in the country coming in at 48 and he was number one on the scouting report for Louisville defensively and when he gets that kind of attention Virginia needs the other guys to make open shots and you consider the fact that McNeely is only five of his last 20 from three imagine how high he was on that chart had identical 228 for1 field goals 6 for8 threepoint games back to back against Syracuse and North Carolina Central since then its not scored in double figur so good sign to see him going early Tyler Johnson has his first two The Freshman from Brooklyn snaps a 102 Virginia run and Tyler Johnson has has settled this Louisville team he started the season coming off the bench with skot Clark at the point guard position but since he got into the starting lineup and became the primary ball handler hes been a guy that settled him down offensively Buchanan left his feet Virginia fortunate to keep it roie with the Miss Long rebound grabbed by grov grov has been great on the glass throughout this game already both offensively and defensively as we see Groves and Buchanan on the floor together its not a combination you see often for Applause Music Virginia well what has having Tyler Johnson in the starting lineup at the point done for skot Clark its given him opportunity to be able to get off the basketball and find shots Scot Clark went two consecutive games where he had zero assists and nine turnovers and so its helped Louisville as a team to calm down the turnovers but also be able to free up their best shooter yanan had it knocked out of bounds Virginia will keep it what a womens college basketball triple header we have for you Sunday afternoon it all starts at 1 eastern SPN with number one South Carolina hosting Mississippi State then Angel Reese and number seven LSU take on Old Miss and we cap the afternoon on ESPN 2 with North Carolina number 16 Notre Dame in South Ben and you see the Caitlyn Clark effect all the way here in Charlottesville did you see the step back from the beak of the Hawkeye last night everybody in the building knows shes going to get the shot she gets the ball has a step back from whats that 30 ft 35t I won at least 35 wow 515 remaining first half here at John Paul Jones Arena with Virginia alumnus Cory Alexander Im Doug Sherman an hour before tip off Tony Bennett said that the one thing theyre most working on offensively and really at both ends of the floor getting good shots and not allowing good shots through the first 15 minutes what have you seen in that regard Cory as they allow a slam dunk along the Baseline by Mike James but that was a even though Mike James got the dunk it was a contested dunk so you want to see your guys in there I think Virginia done a great job early in this game of getting good looks on the offensive end of the floor so good and theres another one as Ryan dun gets an opportunity to get downhill they have taken Kenny Payne and the cards out of the Zone because theyve been so good shooting the basketball as we see a nice interior passing from Huntley hafi to Mike James cutting across the Baseline was able to finish it over two Defenders tell you what its nice to see Mike James healthy after the Achilles tear and then also a hamstring injury last year he was not 100 at all last season following his medical red shirt year hes lost some weight he just looks so much better this year really does and Ive had a chance to talk to his high school coach Steve Reese whos my guy coaches the Florida rebels of the Nike ebl and Reese has talked about how much Mike James loves playing for Kenny Payne and is excited about what this program is going to be moving forward and knowing that he has a lot of responsibility in doing that to make sure these guys go out and compete each and every day out of Oak Bridge in Orlando and Mike James is really kind of the deao captain this year so far Kenny Payne is not named captains but he told me this morning he does plan to name at least one Captain but he said he thought he made a mistake last year naming guys before they had earned it so he wanted to hold that until later in the season and that is still to come but do you have info that its going to be Mike James no but he was clear about saying at this point that man has been our number one leader well right now he has got backto back buckets for the cards and he is competing and thats the one thing that Kenny pay wants to see out of this team regardless of how many guys they have available if you step on this floor then you compete to try to win a game he leads Louisville now with eight points as uvl back to within six Rose feeds the post beatman always looking for a cutting teammate and that leads to a foul against Buchanan Mike James starting to get it going going oneonone against one of the best perimeter defenders in the game and is able to finish it off the glass Tax Act doesnt sponsor any cool no coach I wouldnt get frustrated you know what I would do I would just shoot it and say hey if youre open that means if I miss theres no reason you shouldnt get offensive rebound you only get a couple of chances when youre the guard going in there dropping it off to the big you got to finish those otherwise youre not getting in the next one and Coach you knew the answer to that question Ryan Dunn with a chance for three but thats the way you finish Ryan Dunn got his number called on the underneath out of bounds play giving him a chance to go oneonone against Brandon Hunley Hatfield who they feel he has an advantage against off the bounce Brian Dunn paying it all for his coaches drawing it up calling his number dun is a perfect four for four from the floor so far tonight free rebounds his first Miss comes from the free throw line how would you rate the progression on offense you have seen out of Ryan Dunn as a second year I believe that I would give it I mean are we am I grading it what am I giving it a number and you ask I rating it what we doing well lets do a b c d f with the pluses and minuses oh thats not Applause good just a collective gasp in this building anytime you see ree beakman go down keep an eye on that to make sure that hes not going to be ginger on the ankle leg whatever it may be hes got going on right now you know thats kind of what hamper Virginia season last year Virginia was playing great basketball until ree bman got injured y in the Michigan game where he had 15 first half points and it really threw the whos off for the majority of the Season until they were able to get it back going late in the year well theres that defense for Virginia to force the air ball by Williams 10th forced shot clock violation this year coming up tonight at 10 Eastern 7 Pacific over on ESPN well have another NBA match up for you the Heat and the Lakers square off at cryptocom Arena Lakers on a home stand got to get things going the inaugural NBA inseason tournament champions have struggled 3 and8 since they poed the trophy in Vegas do you think they expended too much energy for that and they are now paying for it I do not uh I believe that anytime you have an opportunity to win a trophy you go after it with everything that you have and I believe they did a great job of doing that and NBA season is a very long season you got to go back and look at the 3 Anda record the majority of that was on the road so thats why you think theyve lost eight of their last 11 yes I do more so the schedule than anything else I believe thats the case I believe thats why Virginias lost a couple of their last games cuz theyve been on the road because in this building makes a difference they are a different team and this guy is a different player this year Reese bman getting downhill understanding the time to score the time to pass the time to facilitate but at all times hes been a leader for the hoop no doubt as always good with the basketball 31 assist to turnover ratio always among the best in the league at that rate first in the league in steals per game first in assists per game to go along with 13 points every time out Reese beakman only has 23 turnovers on this season wow 10 of those came in those two Row games were talking about at Memphis at noted a thats 10 of his 23 turnovers on the year simply because they put so much pressure on him to do everything and make some you know to take him out of the game and make someone else have to make a play right that number is even more impressive because of his usage rate James apparently beat the threepoint shot clock buzzer and weve got a held ball and the possession arrow belongs to Applause Virginia beakman roie Buchanan dun and Groves the five Wahoos on the floor for Virginia Williams goes out for Louisville yvanovich back in sky Clark Mike James Tyler Johnson and The Freshman Caleb Glenn Native Sun from right there in Louisville back on the floor pakman for three uvas fifth made three of the night now five of 12 and this is what Rees pman does best getting his team out in transition off of Defense the beautiful five to Ryan dun these two guys together are a Min both defensively and turning defense into offense well its a different night theyre not in South Bend Indiana anymore this is Charlottesville Music Virginia at Granger we know dealing with the unexpected is part of your job description and you made a promise to keep the line running to power through the downpour to be the one who always gets it done and our promise is to help you do it with professional grade supplies for every industry plus same day pickup and next day delivery on most orders because you cant predict the future but with the right partner you can be prepared for it call click rangercom or just stop by Granger for the ones who get it Music done Virginia with a 90 run to take this 15point lead and they have had their best player in the midst of all of it Reese beakman knocking down the three and this is all after he goes to the bucket and gets a threepoint play off the steel he gets out into transition finds Ryan dun whos able to finish it off and excitement is back in the building especially when you see these two guys get together and piling up stocks you know what stocks are by now right I do okay you talk about it every time we do a Virginia game and I think this is our third game together Steals and blocks combined and uh those two guys are very good at both this Virginia Defense has been very good so far tonight yanovich now with 22 points for Louisville that matches the lowest points allowed this year and a half by Virginia can beakman get off the shot hes fouled before the shot Louisville with a foul to give actually several fouls to give and so that was a smart foul to get in before he got to the basket absolutely was and Kenny pay now going to get skot Clark out of the game over G to get yanovich out of the game to get another defender on the floor hercy Miller Junior from Los Angeles has come in well step away with a Timeout on the floor here at John Paul Jones Music Arena two stories remaining as unbeatens Collide for the title the Wolverines are looking to finish the mission while the Huskies hope to write their perfect ending the Final Chapter to Crown a new playoff Champion number one Michigan number two Washington May the best store Music win all right Cory if youre Louisville do you just keep fouling here uh if you find yourself in a position to where you can do it before Virginia gets a good look at a shot you do but you also dont have many guys on the floor or many guys available so you dont want to get yourself in foul trouble 39 Tony Bennett calling the timeout trying to draw up his action you may want to take one on the catch here pman with the responsibility gets it into McNeely Miller all over him it doesnt matter Isaac mcne among the best threepoint Shooters in the country makes it a 16 Point transfers and Groves and Ro playing at a higher level than theyve ever had to play before and again these guys have battled with their confidence Corner three by Mike James is Off the Mark that Virginia Defense continues to clamp down that is now nine consecutive misses for Louisville only two made field goals for the Cardinals in the final 5 minutes of the first half and this Virginia Defense has been good all night long and offensively Dunn and beakman have led the way theyve combined for 19 of the 37 Virginia points and I feel like if those two guys give them that sort of offensive production in the defense is the UVA defense theres pretty high ceiling for this team I believe Rees and Ryan will always give them that type of production the difference is going to be can they get others to step up can Ro make shots can McNeely get his looks and be effective and thats going to be the difference for this Virginia Team all season long I believe they can get a consistent effort from Ryan Dunn and Rees beatman those two guys are good enough to be able to do that on a nightly basis the question is are the guys around them able to do it that was the sixth turnover on Louisville tonight meanwhile Virginia has only one turnover they turned it over 11 times last time against Notre Dame thats one of the numbers that is usually very very good in the favor of the Hoops yeah Virginia Elite only turning the basketball over 88 times a game which is good for third naturally and no one pace to be under that here tonight beatman steps into a three missed it off to the right Huntley Hatfield on the rebound Here Comes Louisville once again Dono yanovich making his first career start for Louisville tonight as James draws the foul and will head to the line to shoot a Applause pair third foul on mcney well coming up Colorado and Arizona the 10th ranked Wildcats on Thursday a featured game 930 Eastern Time on ESPN in this last go round for the Pack 12 Conference as weve knowned tell you what its been a positive go round for the Pack 12 in football however Washington playing in the national champion ship game against the University of Michigan I tell you what I was not in favor of Florida State not getting in however we had two great games in the college football semifinals Im not going to say the committee was right but I cant say if they were wrong either well we may never really have a good answer to it because of so many guys for the NS sitting now as you and I talked about last week the idea was going into that game theyd have an opportunity to beat the twotime defending national champs and lay claim to what they think would be a share of a national championship even though officially it wouldnt have been that but uh when you dont play a third of your roster its kind of hard to beat the twotime defending national champs I agree with Kirby schwar something has to be done regarding the opt outs the transfer deadlines everything that goes into that or theyre going to have to try to find a way to get this done earlier now with the college football playoff expanding to 12 teams thats going to be difficult to do but its something that has to be addressed with college football you need to have your guys making the bowl games of some type of Applause importantance Hunley Hatfield they moov the basketball very well and get a threepoint opportunity from their big man and they have nice ball movement and playmaking from Mike James whos able to manipulate the screen and Applause roll and find Hundley Hatfield in a position to where he can just go up and score right over top of Grove and right now Louisville with a little bit of energy to start this second half Virginia has yet to score and now the cards with an opportunity to have four points here in the second St from Brandon Huntley hfield said I trusted that KP Kenny Payne knew what I wanted and he devoted himself to helping rescue my family such a big part part of the reason why Kenny Payne was put in place at his Alma Moder and he and bhh had that kind of relationship and Kenny Payne has that type of relationship with pretty much every player that hes ever coached I actually sat with Kenny in Dallas with Julius randles mom Carolyn who just flat out loves Kenny Payne and thats what Kenny Payne did for Julius Randle he helped him rescue his family Julius Randle signed a deal for over 100 millionar because of the work that he put in coming with John caliper and Kenny Payne at Kentucky and that thats the reason why Kenny Payne is a connector hes a networking guy he understands his relationships hes got so many great relationships throughout this game but most importantly these young men who play for him love and respect him he signed a very good class five members of the 2023 ESPN 100 but going forward with the questions around his job security to try and recruit going forward its a lot more difficult but you have to consider the fact that Kenny pay took this job not even understanding what Louisville was going to get as far as probation whatever it may be is you can see the emphasis is try to get the ball inside to Hunley Hatfield we talked about Virginia doesnt foul much as a team you can and picks up the foul there but Kenny pay took over a program that was in you know rough shape I mean to to be honest it was in terrible shape and again trying to fix this program is not something thats going to happen in two years if you had those type of expectations thats wrong for you having those expectations pman gives to roie youan to The Cutting done and the onehanded Hammer is Virginia a 4126 lead you know what were seeing right now is Ryan done with the ability to play the three Tony Bennett has Buchanan and Groves on the floor together with push Ryan dun on the perimeter and of course when you get Ryan dun cutting to the basket with a free run youre going to find yourself in a highlight we may see that on Sports Center Music tonight go with the low hanging fruit and say Tom Brady no I KN it was he was a backup to GRE ah greasy okay okay okay get that so thats coming up Monday night and I wonder also is it going to be Jim Harbaughs last game as Wolverines head coach as he off to the NFL if Im Jim Harbaugh Im absolutely gone to the NFL forget this college football stuff and all the politics and everything that are involved Buchanan was blocked by the point guard Applause Johnson Applause foul on the entry pass and that takes us to our first media timeout of the second half whos up 15 here in Charlottesville W he certainly had all of the requisites to get this jot as one of their own and now trying to make it come to fruition as head coach of the Cardinals and you and I work together you know during the Chris Mack Mike begees year and when Chris Mack stepped away Mike begees took over I said on air then I know who the guy is but the timing was not right when the if if when all said and done if Mike PES had coached Louisville The Following season they would have kept a number of their transfers their players they would have been able to go in and find out exactly what the ramifications of probation would be etc etc then if you go get Kenny Payne now hes coming into a program that is going to be a lot easier to rebuild of course you want to get your guy when you get your guy and they got him but this same man that was celebrated for coming back and getting his degree in 2003 is being much maligned right now by his you know the faithful at University of Louisville and again he took over a very difficult place and is trying to get it back together beautiful find from tame Murray off the back cut you see the difference in when you have Ryan Dunn cutting to the basket making himself available and put himself in scoring position as he did on the last possession where he got the dunk well Cory last two games the man at the free throw line is 12 of 16 from Flor and you would find it hard to believe that anything positive came out of the noted aim game however when you look back at the way that Ryan Dunn is playing offensively and how well hes shooting the basketball that was the one positive he was the he and REE beakman were the only two guys in double figures in that game for Virginia 4228 Brandon Hunt Lee Hatfield now with seven points again hes coming off of three straight double doubles for Applause Louisville beatman from the post and Dunn is fouled by James Ryan Dunn continues to me to be a fascinating player for Virginia the upside seems Limitless and if and when it comes together I mean the defense is without question if the offense catches up to the defense how good can he be I mean he can absolutely be an NBA player I mean I think thats without question but its all going to boil down to how well he shoots the basketball from the perimeter you think about you know the NBA line is another two feet behind the college basketball line and thats the one area where Ryan hasnt truly shown that he can do on a consistent basis I think as he adds that to his game he becomes even more dangerous well hes only four for 21 this year but Ive said on the air before to me his shot doesnt look broken its not broken thats far from broken and youve actually in here with me when hes knocked down two in the game and so two of those four on the season hes shot right in front of us so when you think about it we know that he can make shots but I dont know if hes had the he has the confidence to be able to take those shots on a regular basis well he works on it more often than not when you come to work a Virginia game and go to a practice go to a shoot around Ryan Dunn is out there working on many things including his threepoint shooting and thats the biggest concern he will work and if you can find a guy that will work with his athleticism and his natural ability thats the guy Im Taking My Chances with and the ball comes to him the 10th leading rebounder in the ACC has another that is his seventh tonight Nifty shot by tane Murray the third year from Auckland New Zealand T Murrays giv Virginia good minutes tonight as well knocked down a three in the first half now going off the bouns not something you see often from Tay Murray but thats one of the things for Virginia theyre going to have to have more guys that can make plays especially without reee beakman having to create all the offense for the entire team Williams silences the crowd hes had a couple of air balls and the fans have been letting him hear it after having missed a dozen threepoint shots in a row Williams finally able to find the range for the Cardinals this is a 13point game I mean Virginia has a little separation but not really try been able to separate themselves and just run the cards out of the building T Murray of course respected as a shooter gets a lane and is able to get to the basket going reverse layup and able to finish but you look at this Virginia lineup tame Murrays a guy that can also provide shooting for Virginia but someone else that Reese beakman has to be able to create opportunities for and now you look at the lineup no point guard on the floor M nearly taking over so well have to see how Virginia operates with beakman on the bench well its going to be down to Dun the turnaround from the Baseline goes just before the horn sounded well we havent mentioned the fact that Dante Harris continues to be sidelined with an ankle injury and there still is no definitive timeline for his return and that is an important piece for Virginia when you think about the way that Tony Bennett has had success throughout his tenure especially over the last 10 seasons with Virginia its always been multiple ball handlers on the floor you go back to the National Championship is K Clark and Ty jome you go back before that youve got Malcolm brogen and London pares its always Dev Hall in the mix so many different guys who handle the basketball for Virginia and right now Virginia has been faced with playing with really one ball handler in reese beakman simply because of the injury to Dante Harris off the inbound clean look misfired by Williams another offensive rebound for the Cardinals Glenn the contact rebound McNeely Orion Dunn has matched his career high with 15 Applause points tame Murray getting to the basket again tame Murray showing Tony Bennett I need more minutes coach going off the bouns getting to the rim the second time weve seen him attack the basket and Applause finish yanovich thats Ryan dun thats why hes so spectacular because he can guard his yard and then block the shot Johnson to the rim and beats the buzzer Tony Bennett so frustrated on the Virginia bench they defended for 29 seconds and then still gave up a late while Im over here celebrating R defensive well you thought he was going to get the ball and go the other way did I mean again you know normally he comes up with those but again it may have been asking a little too much for all they already done mcne you give many space and hes going to knock that Applause down first virgin made three in the second half theyre fifth of the game Groves fou Huntley Hatfield left all alone theres another rebound for dun and hes fouled by yvanovich thatll send us to bra its been the second year class of Virginia taking over Ryan dun is the shot clock going down the fade away nothing but net and then Isaac mcney from way downtown yes right Bang Music looks like he won something there with an impressive 20point win last night over Syracuse the orange able to hang for 25 minutes but then the Blue Devils in the second half eight for eight from Beyond the threepoint line and with Tyrese Proctor back who to me is the best player in the league they continue yeah I didnt say hes the player of the year oh wa whoa hes the best player in the league yeah tyres brocker yeah with him back in the fold Duke looked really good okay Im still trying to get over you thinking that Tyre I love Tyre tell the best player in the league do you realize how well RJ Davis and and TJ Hall are playing yes those two are the leaders for Player of the Year in the ACC but best player so so KY filipowski his teammate is is not as good a player youre making it out Im saying bad things about other people Im trying to say good things about Pro oh no Im not diminishing anybody else as far as Im concerned I will U agree to disagree with you on on the Proctor prognosis thats okay Im going to be watching I would be interested to have a list of guys that I can tell you two guys right now I think that on Virginia team I think theyre better than tyres Parker okay you want to guess those two guys oh I I wouldnt need three guesses I would get it in one and two McNeely with another triple hes got Applause 11 under 9 minutes to go Virginia has been comfortably in front since Midway through the first half the who have been shooting it better now seven of n this their largest lead of the night so Applause far James the extra pass to Williams give Williams a lot of credit sticking with it as you mentioned shot a couple air balls early but it hasnt deterred him from taking the next shot and again as a shooter you have to have a short memory re bman continues to get rest Tony Bennett putting the ball in the hands of Andrew Roy to run the offense as T Murray also gets some extended Applause minutes throw will head to the free throw Applause line the ball movement for Virginia has been excellent all night bond out of the double team finds mcney and those are the right hands to get it to as hes knocking down another Music three look at the numbers for Virginia Saturday two of 11 from three and throughout this one seven made threepoint field goals in this game and you look at the number I mean taking a lot more threes a lot of that has to do with Louisville coming in and playing the Zone but once you start getting a couple to go you feel better about things all right 7 20 what is it quick mat oh my goodness you had to look to the sky its 35 35 yes all right oh thank you for new house at Syracuse you guys do no math there corre okay its a communication there you go just make it sure all right Rose makes the first and you mentioned roie getting extended run at the point you know he played point guard some last year at St Thomas so you know hes a 66 Wing but its not completely foreign territory to Applause Music Applause him Johnsons pass deflected by McNeely James thats a twopoint shot Mike James continues to have some success offensively he scored 24 points against Virginia here last year in his red sh freshman year so whenever you have a big game against a team you come in to play against him the next time with confidence perfect switch off the finger ERS of Jake Groves Groves has been spectacular on the glass throughout this game both offensive boards and defensive boards but continues to show that shooting touch one of the few guys that Tony Bens been able to rely on consistently from Beyond The Arc yeah mcney came in at 48 of the year but grov not far behind at 46 so his three makes it a 19point Virginia lead as we head to break and it continues to be great ball movement for the whos here at home at jpj the knce find to Groves in the corner and well say hes grooving Music it back at jpj Virginia has been in control throughout Over Louisville 594 your score weve talked about it at both ends the things that Tony Bennett wanted to see tonight and going forward get good shots not allow good shots and Virginia with only two turnovers has gotten great shots throughout this game initially against the zone and then after that a lot of Ryan Dunn attacking the paint and on his way to a career high and still continues to do the job defensively another block for dun that is his second tonight the only two for Virginia in the score sheet dun Groves roie McNeely beakman back on the floor with under seven minutes to play in regulation mcney off the bounce boy if he can continue to do that in addition to knocking down the three he is a really tough guard but you see the difference in confidence for McNeely for Groves for Roy here at jpj in comparison to when you watch them playing on the road and thats the really going to be the challenge for Tony Bennett and his staff throughout this season is how do you get this level of aggression when you get away from this home crowd how pervasive is that and how do you correct it you cant correct it its about mentality and the thing is like for Virginia I was a guy that loved to go win on the road Tai jome is a got to love to go win on the road Kyle guys a got to love to win on the road you want to go in and push the other teams crowd Im not sure outside of Ree beakman and Ryan dun who those guys are that go out and do that on the road but we know that McNeely can get them on their feet here at jpj well he has refound his stroke tonight he was so good first 10 games making 55 previous three before tonight he got a little sideways but no trouble tonight with the 16 points in counting Lefty layup by Curtis Williams so the challenge for Virginia we saw it on one of our promos next up for them they go to NC State where Kevin ke is going to pressure significantly understanding that that is the what has caused Virginia problems throughout their losses this year and so its going to be important for guys like McNeely and roie to be able to handle that pressure and still make shots for Williams has overcome his slow start three threes here in the second half after a couple of air Applause balls not how you start its how you finish you always like to see a young man respond that way when he does have success early to stick with it keep it going and hes another one of those top 100 recruits for Kenny pay in this freshman class thats theyre trying to build around oville as a team has made its last four threes mcney with a little step back along the base line mcneel is feeling it right now hes got it going everything that he is putting up is going down and its affected the way that hes defending as well the former H do you love saying that now with 18 points shout out to my guy Charles rocking the also polka dot from West Virginia who was the only person that knew your reference as this polka dot Isaac mcne has gotten busy here especially in the second half continues to run the numbers up and now gets a break and if youre McNeely youre this hot Im thinking hey coach 440 thats a little too uh too early for me to come out I got it going right now and now do you think when mcne gets back in the locker room he checks the Miami box score to see how wga popper is shooting tonight cuz they are neck and neck for best threepoint shooting percentage in the league Im going to go with no thats not going to happen the beautiful five for ree be on the back door to T Murray no I was here for T Murrays career how he had 14 points against Iowa but he did his damage from Beyond a threepoint AR I would have to say this is definitely a career high points in the paint for Tame Murray throughout this game seen him score three baskets in the paint I cant say that Ive ever seen that from him in a Virginia game before yeah nine points made a three to start but then as Cory said got into the basket three times in a Applause row Louisville in transition and roie called for the foul final 349 ahead as the whoos look to improve their league record to two and one wo Music Paul Jones Arena without the students who are still on break still a terrific environment tonight for the Cavaliers who have been leading pretty much throughout Louisville had a brief lead early on but the cards have not been able to hang and among the calling cards for Virginia is that they defend you and do it without fouling and sending the opponent to the line yeah Virginia eighth nationally fouling only only 13 times a game and so Louisville coming in one of the top free throw attempts team in the country normally getting close to 26 free throw attempts and that has been a struggle for them to get to the line tonight so give Virginia a lot of credit for defending without Applause Music fouling this is Tyler Johnson The Freshman out of our savior Lutheran in New York City tar had a nice homecoming he did and and when he went back played in the garden November 19th against Texas a game that Louisville should have won yeah it makes you wonder how that loss changed the trajectory of this season you know I I said the same thing I was actually in studio that night watching the game and nothing against Texas but rooting for the cards and that was the thing and I I was putting myself in Kenny Paynes shoes right there and where many people were talking about wow the great effort from Louisville based upon what had happened with them the season before only winning four games Kenny Payne was not thinking moral Victory hes thinking exactly what you thought what that wi if they would have gotten it would have done for the confidence of his players and that would they probably will find themselves in a completely different scenario right now now one thing we have to make sure that we JJ trainers not playing Trey Whites not here I mean hes not playing Lille is dealing with a number of injuries to very valuable core players in their rotation so that cannot be understated we talked about you know Dante Harris missing for Virginia when youre doing that without two and three of your guys who are in your rotation it makes it extremely difficult Brandon Huntley Hatfield makes just his second three of the season thats actually Williams who knock that one down off the path pass from Hy Hatfield double team and hes handled the basketball extremely well once hes gotten trapped down in the corner under three minutes to go Elijah gertrud back into the game for Virginia number 12 in Music Applause white tan Murray having a night tan Murray is earning playing time right now you know one of the things weve seen from Tony Bennett going with the lineup with both yanan and Roes on the floor together has opened up opportunities for other guys and REE beakman doing what he does best driving and kicking finding tame Murray in the corner who knocks out his second threepointer of the evening fourth time this year Virginias made 10 threes in a single game now 10 for 23 tonight including those two by Murray whos up to 12 points Off the Bench let me see those games would be Texas AM Syracuse North Carolina Central and tonight is that right I dont know well see youre the UVA guy you have all these stats committed to memory but when you but when you throw out something like that Im expecting for you to already know those games it was our wonderful statistician Richard Simmons who just handed me that sheet and tried to make me sound smart and I did until you just pulled the rug out from underneath Rich Richard knows you need help he understands now being that we talking about you smart uh I need for you to clarify your your tyr Proctor statement where you said that he has the highest ceiling yes okay pleas please tell that is absolutely my thought when I said what I said okay all right because when you say best player Im thinking the guy who is moment at this moment you you feel as though he has the highest ceiling move for yes that is how I should have said it okay and I still feel that way okay and like I said he is not a front runner for ACC player of the year or even First Team all confidence but I do think he has the highest ceiling great job right there standing is ground by Blake Buchanan coming up with the block shot and this is a game I think that get some some confidence going for Buchanan was able to get a bucket early doing the job defensively blocking a shot and the small moments for a first year for a fresh to be able to come on to the floor I mean he had a huge game against Florida we talked about that the 18 points for him but its been a struggle for him ever since in a game like this against an ACC opponent is something that can boost your confidence especially knowing that youre going to be in conference play for the next 17 games yeah if you can in 611 225 a lot of tools young man out of cordelan Idaho averaging under four points per game now Jordan Miner is checked into the game the 68 grad transfer from Marram herud off the feed from Applause Murray thats the guy Im excited about Elijah gerre he is going to be really really good and again the growing pains right now was supposed to have red shirted this season they pulled the red shirt off once the injury to Dante Harris happen and Tony Bennett uncertain as to how long Harris was going to be out realiz that they were probably going to need Applause gertrud got a look on the 64 freshman from Jersey City New Jersey went to Hudson Catholic High School play for my guy Nick Marinello but now Ill tell you the other douge fresh okay Doug Smith number 11 who was my backourt partner he takes a lot of credit for Elijah geru being here okay yeah hes hes a hes a Jersey City guy hes in Jersey City we get a look at the numbers tonight 10 of 24 for Virginia from Beyond the threepoint Arc in comparison to two of 11 and I believe thats a game that the who can put behind them at this point they recognize having to going out on the road this Saturday theres going to need to be a lot of improvement in the way they handle the basketball and handle pressure and compared to what they saw at Memphis where they did not handle that very well Virginia was picked fourth in the preseason poll a did you think that was fair then and B do you think its appropriate now I think its fair its appropriate Im not sure if they will be in that top four when you think of top four in the ACC youre talking about teams that get the first the double Buys in the ACC tournament as we and as we look at that its going to be important for Virginia to be able to win Road games to do that and Im not sure that this point theyre prepared to do that I think there are four other teams that may be a little more prepared to do it I know Virginia will continue to hold serve here on their home court certainly at this point youd think Clemson Duke and Carolina have played the best maybe Wake Forest well no again although Miami has the two big losses that is a team that is going to be dangerous when its all said and done and they get one Health Blake fanan with the layoff shot clock is off and Louisville will dribble it out and the folks still at John Paul Jones Arena rise to their feet and appreciate the effort tonight by the Wahoos and give the fans a lot of credit made a lot of noise in the building with without the students here an opportunity for a few other people that dont normally get to sit in the student section to be able to hang around four players in
