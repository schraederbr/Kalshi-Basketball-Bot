Christ on super Tuesday and we can only hope we will have a finish here at the castle like we just had in Nashville what a finish and what a game between Texas AM and Vanderbilt and weve got two teams that played a close one as you can see the last time they met in Tallahassee last month it came down to the wire a threepoint Florida State win Virginia Tech has lost three in a row Florida state two and four in their last six so John contrasting Styles between these two teams and also two clubs that really need a win they need wins and both teams have found it at times whatever it is I think we all know what Im talking about they felt it at times but theyve struggled to find that consistency so far for Virginia Tech I I think what theyre forcing is fouls to be called you got to fight physicality with toughness you cant fight physicality with physicality then youre the team that gets called for fouls good job I mean hunter Couture his attack went down we thought he might have hurt his left elbow hes fighting through it but padulla fighting through the physicality with toughness to get to the free throw line a couple of things to get you caught up on Hunter Couture went down hard on his left arm holding his left elbow he is fighting through the pain has stayed in the game and obviously that is something that Virginia Tech needs leaning in using the window and getting the friendly rle as jir Watkins in Florida State tonight you could see wearing the turquoise uniforms as they are honoring the seol Heritage that is their name sake and these are sharp looking uniforms really dig 1 three already went down for Darren Green Jr that one from NBA range comes up short and heres sha padulla padulla picks up his dribble at the elbow the length of Florida State can be a problem he finds an outlet in Robbie Baron he cant hit it bounces to Couture he thats a really big shot you know Hunter cout came out very first possession of the game he brings the ball up the CL little ISO situation gets a jumper from about 15 to 17 ft he goes down on that elbow then hits a good three on a second chance opportunity thats a good side Watkins Fades away yes got tough I mean both sides good defense better offense better offense typically wins but both sides really locked in physically on the defensive side what makes Florida State defensively so hard to play against a t well great length number one but also theyre very good at switching a lot of teams switch but arent very good at it thats the problem thats a part of their culture not just what they do switching length theyre disrupted with that length they get their hands in passing Lanes but they dont Gamble and put themselves in bad situations and plays according to their culture and their identity and I think thats what makes them so dangerous for Virginia Tech to take care of the basketball for 40 minutes by still being aggressive and dynamic thats the great challenge well for Leonard Hamilton it can be like there are line changes that can take place and already hes got cam cor and Primo Spears on the floor Im sure well see Chandler Jackson before long Taylor Bol Bowen is on the floor for the first time as well so three Subs during that last timeout and that is not unusual for the noise no and the thing is theres variety to it as well I mean Primo Spears is a different guard hes going to be different than anything else that someone like sha padulla or Hunter Couture have had to cover Hunter Couture is really hugged up on Darren Green hes got gravity youre not going to leave Darren Green but Primo Spears can get where he wants with the basketball thats another challenge for padulla around the perimeter Tyler Nicholls checks in as well for the hokes replacing Robbie Music Baron he wants to shoot shot clock winding down for Darren Green Jr and that goes off the foot of Couture and out of bounds this is obviously a night to watch two coaches do great work youve got of course Mike Young on one sideline but Leonard Hamilton the winningest coach in Florida State history on the other and these are two guys that are true tacticians they are tacticians in their own way and I think thats what makes the matchup so fun shot clock just about out of time and it is a shot clock violation shot clock as trying to find the loose ball was cam Corin Stripped Away at the last moment and the timer hey Im with Sean padulla on that one no dont give us the shot clock violation youre going to allow them to pick up and now Ive got to deal with them for about 70 ft at at least on a steal youre R and running and then Florida States in Chase mode until you get settled looks like coutur has been able to shake off the left elbow injury as well hell F that one later though trust me thats he fell Applause hard tour needs some help a lot of dribbling gets tripped up and thats a tough luck foul for Darren Green J this a great possession defensively cuz heres the thing I mean its easy to look at that and say yeah a lot of dribbling and youre right problem is theres nowhere to throw the basketball because you got hands and passing lanes and because of the great L theyre able to take both a pass away and a back cut away thats something Leonard Hamilton talked about he said were not going to gamble but we are going to get our hands where a ball can be passed Darren Green Jr the UCF transfer thats 354 Collegiate threes that just sat down on the bench with his second foul Couture kicks one to the corner nichel hits from the perimeter knocks down a triple and Virginia Tech has the lead there are so many times you see Virginia Techs going to run action to create what they call Double gaps right openings in the defense you attack that double Gap and the skip is often there cuz it brings that backside Defender over last thing you want to do is give up a double Gap skip three jir Watkins draws the foul against MJ Collins this is kind of masterful thats really good basketball and for padulla you need to see more of those plays for padulla now the question is if they dont overh help if they dont come over whats next right if they recover where does padulla go with the basketball cant leave your feet against Florida State so the pass has to be there on time yes good shot high high percentage three but if its not there it cant be something that leads to a tough situation in a turnover thats MJ Collins second so he sits down and Chandler Jackson Off the 17point performance against Virginia on Saturday is in for the NOS for the first time Spears has a thrown right back at his face five to shoot Spears creates space thats short offensive rebound that was ripped down by Corin loses it though and back the other way comes padulla Mano Spears causing Havoc itll stay with Virginia Tech I mean it its like take a breath later type of offense right like I hate to say it but its almost like you could take more breaks on the defensive end against Florida State than you can on offense youve got to work hard to get open youve got to work hard to create an opportunity off the bouns and then you sure as anything have to work hard to finish really interesting in the age of the portal yeah and now nil and how much change there is in college sports and college basketball to hear you and Le Hamilton having that kind of philosophical conversation today about how he puts together a team as padulla with 5 Seconds on the shot clock gets it to nickel and the shot clock winding down and it goes to LY kid has to put one up that grazes the front of the rim I always say i Id rather know how they think that than anything specific about a game and and he really shares a lot and I love the conversations we get to have with coaches who really just share perspective right we dont have near the perspective as what they have many years as theyve been head coaches its a very unique perspective and to hear how he built programs hear how hes developed culture and how hes challenged to sustain that culture I I think theres a vulnerability in there its okay to accept that a long two that hit the backboard first for Spears so one piece to his game if he develops a very good midrange game which I think its close there but the threepoint shot if he develops a threepoint shot with his ability to get to where whatever wherever he wants off the bounce Primo Spears is dangerous adulla Corbin caught on a switch but the length creates the turnover Spears protects the ball with the right shoulder and draws the foul as he just about went Coast to Coast put the left hand and it did indeed create a Virginia Tech bump 1 Florida States just theyre just all over here3 pulla going up I think he thought he was going to get the foul and theres not much there its the second reaction right the initial contact Remo Spears kind of caused the initial contact thats fine but when you react to it you always get fou the foul call its Coutures Applause first Soft Touch wont go for Chandler Jackson its good defense youre just playing angles at that point force him into the tough angle shot nichel picks up his dribble and again a deflection nickelberry back the other way for Florida State that pass deflected though and padulla escapes goes to the bucket and gets fouled and it looks like this will be a foul in the act so Shawn padulla will go to the line to shoot a pair as were coming up on 4 and 12 minutes for Florida State without points we havent really established a good flow I mean turnover have been really disruptive for both offenses I would say virgia Techs gotten better shots they just havent done a good job by sitting down when they get the ball in the paint and making a good patient disciplined decision we have a terrific college basketball Saturday for you on ESPN it tips off at noon Eastern featured matchups ninth rank Duke will take on these nlls and then its number six Kansas and number 25 Oklahoma that game at 4 Eastern and then well wrap things up in the SEC Kentucky and Auburn at 6 Eastern thats a Sonic Blockbuster should be another great afternoon of Hoops it begins at noon after game day and then all day long on ESP thats one of those days where you feel like a failure when youre not working hows the part where you ask me if I have a game dont ask by the way got a game no Ill be Ill be talking somewhere on Sunday I think though there you go I have to fire up the DVR Ive got Bruins Kings at 1230 got it over on ABC so sticks and pucks to start the day but then you know what as soon as that Gs over race back to my TV and catch the triple header after that its like Hallmark movies you know how its going to end thats how I watch games I I like to watch them back after I know how they finished right its more peaceful theres actually a philosophy behind that you learn how it happened nickelberry created space the easy rebound for Couture the other thing I want to point out is how difficult it is to play against Florida State because you cannot simulate their length and intensity I mean you can talk about that all you want you can say dont throw the ball away but the reality is at some point youre going to have to face it Florida States calling card right I mean theyre they are going to try and beat you with their depth its not even balanced scoring its balanced defense right its balanced contributions in every possible way thats what makes them so tough and I told you at the break Im stressed out just thinking about playing offense against that length but its also the intensity and the discipline in there I me we dont want to take that away either back in with two fouls is Darren Green Jr abama Miller in the post gets to the front of the rim thats good recognition of the matchup if if you get it in there quickly you can attack it the longer you wait the more Virginia Tech defensively can adjust to that matchup and take that easy layup away so good recognition early in the offensive Applause set to her thought about a three Rex Steiner tries it instead and burries it its all shot preparation right there from re Steiner uh Couture thought he had the shot the defense on re Steiner backed up just a hair just enough took his hand out of the passing Lane Rex Steiner got shot ready before the ball Applause arrived some might say thats coaching I would agree green Jr picks up his dribble some might say that was a travel and I would agree Jan warley bullets a pass inside the BMP plus the foul terrific pass as Jaylen warley looked underneath and found Jaylen gainy and just like that a chance for a threepoint play for the NS so the the difference here is length right length takes that pass opportunity away you dont even think about it because you have hands in your face hands in the passing lanes that thats kind of the the point were trying to make about how difficult it is to play against this Florida State Defense for 40 minutes youve got to adjust to it and then youve got to adjust to what theyre taking away and adjust to the things that counter the things that theyre adjusting to again we talk about Chess like this this really will be a chess game throughout the course of this Applause one and I think they have a foul called on Robbie Baron for possible lane violation thats going to give another opportunity now they got the foul it is a lane violation and not taking advantage is gaining its interesting because they looked at Watkins on tape and said on foul shooting blockouts he likes to stay behind and then slip underneath and I think Roby Baron tried to take the underneath away and in doing so Applause foul Rex Steiner throws one into traffic deflected and gathered by niichel how many times you think youre going to say that today in and out from the elbow throws one into traffic ly kid fought for the loose ball Baron thats off the side Rim another offensive rebound though for lin King shut down underneath is Baron but a second effort and he is able to convert around Miller Robbie Baron was a really good pickup for Mike young I mean he understood what he was getting with Robbie Baron I think if anything coming here to Virginia Tech Robbie Barons able to play a position that more suits him better times at Northwestern I saw him at the five battling with guys like Hunter Dickinson and Kofi cober God bless him for for being able to play more of a three four role here basine three for Darren Green Jr his second triple thats that two pass away doesnt matter hes the best shooter on the floor you cant let him get a catch and step into it that becomes a high percentage Rhythm three Aaron hounded out near the midcourt strike by gainy Rex Steiner the lob kid the catch in traffic puts it up D it with left another good good recognition again these are the things you go through in scouting report theyre going to switch everything thats fine then we have to punish them for switching they get it right inside to kid and he does his work against Darren Green where he has the advantage ly kid was in Clemson as a freshman he barely played but he has blossomed here at Virginia Tech 16 games in double figures this year jir Watkins plus the foul by Watkins does he he makes a lot of tough physical shots and I felt like At first I thought this was pretty good defense still think it was pretty good defense second for number threea at 13 to leave me hanging on that youre not going to have an opinion on it do you think cylinder foul cylinder foul I like the cylinder violation I knew thats where you wanted to go Id be going for those all day B Miller sits down Deontay green back in for the seminal to get that call you really have to remind the officials that they have to call it cuz its its a rare one threepoint play completed by jir Watkins hell go to the bench Chandler Jackson is back in as is primo Spears you know how you get the cylinder foul call is you turn it into a point of emphasis they make they make the call all the time if its a point of emphasis for officials and Its just tough to get the ball in at time Florida is why if you get a rebound just get it over half court for trying out loud even dead balls on the Baseline are a good thing for the Florida State Defense and when theyre tired five more will come in Mulla back in to run the point plays bre Steiner spin move tied up foul so padulla will go to the free throw line as it looks like the reach in will be called on Primo Spears so one of the adjustments you have to make if youre a guard hero spin dribble like that you cant spin weak right you cant just kind of be weak you cant be loose with the ball youve got to spin tight almost like uh almost like a running back running through the line you cant keep the ball loose you keep it tight be strong strong legs good base the South Carolina women the nations only undefeated D1 team highlight our Thursday basketball double header a square off with Ria Jackson and the lady BS in Knoxville coverage begins Thursday at 7 Eastern number one on the road to take on the lady boxer you imagine an undefeated team in the mens game this year with all the someone say uh yeah its parody on display I was like no its inconsistency like did you expect free agency of the game youre going to have in inconsistency green waste no time and cant hit that time Darren Green Jor just off to the Applause right Mulla down low kid lost control that was a good probe by Pula too patient head up waited to throw the pass Spears fed the lane now they green couldnt Applause connect mullah step back three off the front rim way up in the air for the rebound is Darren Green Jr and a foul I think has been called K will step aside twopoint lead for Virginia Tech 715 to go in the half where does a box out cease to be a box out and where can you go too low and create a dangerous play where it should be a foul to me I think you got to give consideration to the fact ball dont lie I guess um give consideration to the fact that theres upper body body contact in the back so whats going to happen youre going to get kind B over it youre going to push back and the finish hanging from the rim was Taylor B bow and terrific find by Spears terrific find and thatll be frustrating for for Mike Young and the staff who sits there say guys we looked over these things were multiple youre multiple passes away this isnt something you allow if youre ly kid youre just up theres no real help theres no headge youre not denying that youre not taking that away in any way and not enough ball pressure so youre allowed to pick out your pass now a tough spot to inbound from as Jade young was able to catch the inbound pass stay in bounds adulla with Applause space Couture picks up his dribble on the Baseline he needs help seven to shoot lobbed inside over the head of ly kid coast to coast and drawing contact is jir Watkins hell go to the free throw so so just the the cumulative effect of that possession you can barely get the ball in bounds by the time you get it up to half court you really cant stop and take a breath youve got to get into some action and then Coutures got to know better thats not a place you could pick up the basketball against Florida State youre kind of in know mans land just bring it back out let everybody space theres going to be 7 8 seconds left on the clock give your a chance at a shot again the nlls wearing their Nike seminol Heritage turquoise uniforms for the 28th Time dating all the way back to 2013 when they first started to wear the tribute uniforms celebrating their seminal Heritage and they are sharp they are they are really cool I I grew up a big Florida State football fan I love Bobby Surah Charlie Ward Tomahawk Cho was Heyday there how about Charlie Ward having a better NBA career right was wild when the Heisman Trophy and then ever play in the NFL just heard Sam Cassell from the voice in my ear I forgot Sam Music Cassel MJ Collins with a couple of personal fouls back in the game for Virginia Tech this Florida State team just seems like the type of team as nickel Rises up and connects you need to have multiple guys handle the ball because you just get exhausted if you tried to be the lone point guard against this defense all night you look at Ps line against Florida State right 26 points great 34 minutes 34 minutes of this there a reason why he had two assists and four Applause turnovers coren finds the cutter and the floater is there for Chandler Jackson really cant fall asleep on on the opposite side C man C Ball there are principles that are Timeless right there are so many simple principles C man c c basketball is one of them same thing kind of happens nowadays on the offensive end C man see ball why cuz everythings reading reacta try to pocket pass it becomes a turnover Spears the other way gives it up for the flush by Corin and a timeout called by Virginia Tech identity its something Leonard Hamilton talks a lot about we dont have a style we have a culture and part of that culture is doing it for 40 minutes knowing that you dont have to do it for a full 40 you really got to give 20 to 25 minutes of just max effort and the more you buy into maximizing efficiency and effort in 20 to 24 minutes the better this program is going to Music be thats like usually me to simulate Watkins good luck another good hands by Primos Spears shot clock at 10 as now Virginia Tech has to hustle padulla from the elbow connects last couple shots theyve got have been in the M midrange so if you attack hard Get Low stop a little step back maybe a little chicken wing not too much dont extend the hand extend the elbow you get away with it but use the midrange to soften up defense they start getting to the basket they start getting fouls size on the floor right now from Spears off the feet from Miller lost it on the way up padulla out to the wing Couture for three yes thats Virginia Tech basketball when theyre at their best thats a terrific response out of a timeout Mike young calls the timeout cuz he felt the moment this was a bad moment in the first half you want to come out finish strong to get to that under four and they responded with a midrange jumper and then a transition three with little pressure applied from Florida State Watkins with a shot fake and he draws the foul on nichel on Virginia 23 Ty I just think this is its just a game where you have to adjust to the game youre not even adjusting as much to what a defense is doing youre adjusting to the way the games played the length the disruptive nature of everything the intensity and the more you can get quick shots in transition youre going to soften that defense up I I always heard coaches say like oh were going to play for a full 30 second shot clock make them defend for a full 30 what what if you walk the ball off the court for 15 seconds thats not a full 30 push it up the willingness to take that early three in transition will make it more difficult to defend for 94 ft jir Watkins now in double figures for the 10th straight game J Jen young back in along with Elijah btit sitting down replaced by Lyn Applause kid the only ACC player leading his team points rebound assists and Steals and I guess in a way that compliment acts as an announcer Jinx yes as jir Watkins tosses up a brick right on Q how am I doing why does it seem like that actually happens were not that important but hes a 79 free throw shooter too hes tough to jinx that hit the backboard first for padulla theres a rebound for Watkins keeps on stuffing the box score fall about a three hell try one and connects again he was yelling at he knew I jinxed him on that free throw and Florida state has responded theyve got the threepoint lead with he really does he impacts game in every way and he he added versatility allows you to switch can play against the big cover guards can shoot from the perimeter hes going to get offensive rebounds hes really good offensive rebounding particularly when hes coming from the perimeter the VCU transfer and he has made an impact in Tallahassee I think thats a good culture to culture transfer too kind of what Mike rhs did with that program I think he fit in very well here under Leonard Hamilton I feel like thats the future of it too and its the Freshman J able to knock one down I think thats kind of the next step when youre looking at transfers youre really going to want to look at whos coached them and do you trust where theyre coming from I think thats a big piece of it is it consistent with what you want to do and who you want to be I think those things matter more more than we maybe thought it mattered coming into the last few Applause seasons on the corner its Spears rainbow three he buries it by 23 the way he looked back at the bench the Virginia Tech bench Im sure something was said like non threat or something like that thats what we would say Cur quick shots quick shots against Florida State might be the best shot you get eight straight games now in double figures for Hunter Couture as he has 11 and he is three for three from downtown two minutes to go in the half Miller goes right at nichel and draws the foul thats the second foul called on Tyler Nicholl flid State doing a good job moving the basketball from the paint you suck in the defense a little bit force a close out from a smaller Defender but Couture is really starting to feel it here if youre going to Sag off a Couture youre going to get beat I mean thats the one guy you know you cant beat you know cuz made shots become Rhythm builders for Shooters I can promise you that as a shooter when you see one fall when you see two fall you see three those are Rhythm Builders now it seems as everythings downhill for a shooter it gets easier and easier both teams over the limit so Baba Miller only a 50 free throw shooter at the line one and one and nickel the rebound other thing is you look at Team shooting percentage given to the tough defense the physicality weve seen I mean shooting percentages are high all above 50 both threes and twos for both teams padulla up under its the front rim but draws foul on jayen warley one one of the things I was talking about in shooting round saying against Florida State The Duel has got to use footwork more than ever before and be patient with it youve got plenty of time if youre in the paint you got three seconds if youre outside of the paint you got five just take your time just probe with footwork see if you can use head fakes ball fakes to create an opening in the passing Lanes or maybe an opportunity at a basket or a foul shot our next NBA Wednesday double header starts in Cleveland with Donovan Mitchell and the Cavs hosting dear D Ro and the Bulls at 730 Eastern and then Steph and the Warriors against kawhai Paul George and the Clippers our coverage tips with NBA Countdown at seven on ESPN and the talk about a basketball family as well Sean padulla hes got eight siblings two of his brothers and one sister won State Basketball Championships in high school yeah theres like how about those driveway pickup games but how about the fact is like oh scholarship thank God thank God another one thank God like dont I know it you got five yeah and none of them are winning State Basketball Championships I think anytime soon got a runner hes helping five to shoot Watkins gives it up do they realize Primo Spears finally does and knocks it down from Steph Curry range did he get it off theyre saying he did not get it off theres still a half second on the shot clock that thats really interesting that there was a half second on the shot clock first but they called the foul they called foul okay thats frustrating called foul on Jaylen gainy away from the ball and now it looks like another foul is going to be called this one might be on Spears fouls on Florida stays 23 this this is interesting I think Virginia Techs playing very well they theyve responded very well to just the toughest physicality length disruptive nature of Florida State they have theyve settled in this game now the question is when you go into halftime how do you sustain a that attention to detail right that intensity that discipline for a full 40 because you know thats what what Florida States going to bring its been a well played game with both sides few few extra turnovers here and there but shooting percentages are high Spears becomes the sixth player each team with three with two personal fouls so neither team has a player with three fouls here in the first half but there could be some foul trouble strategic decisions theyll have to talk about the second half oh theres the foul yeah whats on the screen rolling to the basket kind of anticipating the shot clock going off Im actually to give that to padulla I think that was smart play by padulla to just kind of stand in in the way and take the hit Leonard Hamilton is going to call the timeout you cant take with you Love is in the loated minutes from uptown at exit 79 108 to go here in the first half Virginia Tech with the fourpoint lead Babble shoen here with John Chrisman on super Tuesday as the hokes again come into tonight having lost three in a row and Florida State theyre two and four in their last six so both teams need a win and a 70 run over the last last minute Plus for Virginia Tech has put them on top I feel like the hardest thing for college basketball teams to do is find and maintain consistency its just been Applause hard sometimes the team you prepare for shows up and is a lot better that happens too spin cycle nickelberry hell go to the free throw Applause line its going to be a challenge for Virginia Tech if Florida State can create space just given that the guys they have off the bounce that they can get to the basket be very physical around the rim and then send multiple offensive rebounders Jaden young called for his first fifth year senior Josh nickelberry spent a couple of years at Lal and a couple of years at Louisville so circling back to the ACC to finish off his Collegiate eligibility how many times have you seen guys three or four schools all the time happened to that one time transfer they did away with that rle yeah that was like a recommendation or a suggestion yeah thanks ly kid back in as potit goes to the bench Music out to the wing Camden cant connect offensive rebound kid he gets rejected inside rising up was Watkins I really like that three shot opportunity cuz it almost put you in a in a two for one situation which I love not a lot of college teams take advantage of that good find from padulla about a 3 and 12 second differential so Spears tribes it down now T to Applause shoot Spears splits the defense cruises in for two no no we need a dead ball so we can see that again here comes padulla quickly out to the wing young for three no good the tip follow wont go and we are dead locked at 39 at half time okay watch the move this is remarkable I talk Mulla right to the basket through one up and the Finish By ly K well he aint tired yet uh that was awesome a good pressure in the back court but got extended too much and padulla the right decision to throw it up its good Music start warley around padulla bumps and draws the foul on Baron hell go to the line thats the third on Robbie Baron he becomes the first player with three I mean this was just a good read by padulla kind of lifted all the defense good lav up kid kid good recognition of that ball going almost saw it too late what a way to start you can draw it up all you want and that might not happen I thought you said every single time you were in a film session with your coach or on the dry a race board when they drew it up it worked perfectly oh yeah again like we if it worked perfectly we wed win 150 to nothing like the reality of the game today is its so much different right I think it when I played it was was a lot of it was run sets you execute we do this when they do this its so much more fluid right now that that its so much more read and react you have to adjust on the fly so ultimately youre teaching how to play basketball more than how to play against other players that are going to do this that the other thing cuz always say Youre Building anti fragility anymore s needs some help by the way Worley is now the 11th player who scored for Florida State well they come at you in waves and now jir Watkins fouls Hunter Couture come at you and tsunam I mean thats the thing like its theres the teams that can keep coming with fresh bodies but do they play this way do they have this length and physicality do they extend their defense for full court for the entire game I think thats the other part that we leave out we talked about it in the age of the portal and nil and so many kids transferring all the time as Couture cles in for two for a coach like Leonard Hamilton how hard is it for him to get players that immediately come in and theres an offensive foul called on jir Watkins and then he can immediately assimilate into the system because he likes to play so many guys well theres like good fit guys that are out there say youre program wants to shoot the three and space out so you got to get guys that can shoot it space and have an understanding of how to maintain space on the floor good job outter now that was padulla taking that one but theres good culture guys too and I think thats where you go back to where a guy came from what does he value you know is he coachable theres all those things because if hes not coachable then hes not going to be willing to play 20 minutes and be significant in those 20 minutes hes going to feel entitled to more so I think Leonard Hamilton really does a good job staying true to himself knowing what works I think Kelvin Samson does the same at Houston like that find and a three goes from the wing for Tyler nichel as MJ Collins with a good find a quick trigger at the other end thats off the side rim no good for green Jr and the rebound found by ly kid that depth for Florida State will now be tested as their leading scorer jir Watkins on the bench with three fouls a good Step Up by Jaylen warley gets the steel and draws the foul on padulla Virginia Tech rec something and went over this in film right you deny that screen right just just attack the basket you know theyre going to switch why come off and get the switch the reason why Mike young loves that because it means people are listening like how many times coaches get excited when a play or at execution works its because its been taught and the fact that theyre executing it thats one of the most rewarding things for a coach its like Im teaching and theyre learning Chandler Jackson back in as the sub jir Watkins and Jackson has been a microwave of late offensively warley off the window no good nichel pulls down the rebound padulla that pass deflected by Darren Green JR out of bounds who all I saw was a pair of legs and those legs belong to Deontay green they have to check make sure hes okay Applause its very nice of the Virginia Tech training staff to bring a towel after a fall like that can I go back to that play let me say look if you can attack instead of coming off the screen playing against all sorts to help defense switching defense attack that open Gap and force that Baseline guy over make the skip pass before he fully commits to the ball where all his momentum say oh gosh H Hunter Couture was wide open at the last second and turning to call loss for Virginia Tech when youre trying to crawl back to at or above 500 but the 18 points that Couture had on Saturday he needed 11 threes to make four well in this game hes already three for three so that much more efficient as leaning in with the left hand the scoop wouldnt go for MJ Collins MJ Collins shows flashes like that but we havent seen it really sustained I think the Duke game he was good here at home but hes got to find a way to just sustain sometimes simple basketball added to some of the kind of fantastic playmaking he can put together that was a terrific steal he just made Couture his pass stolen green Jr had it ripped out of bounds but theyll say it is off green Jr as Couture got a hand in after nearly turning it over really think playing against Florida State its a sit down when you get to the paint sometimes you can kind of make the pass you anticipate it theyre so active with their hands Le on Hamilton really teaches that drills that home active hands take Vision away wheres the vision well they anticipate where youre looking and where youre going to pass which a good defense should its like a safety in football down five you wonder how long Jamir Watkins sits a take back from ly kid as it looked like that might have been a cam cor and steel padulla lost his balance keeps his dribble that was har glob TR huh yeah right padulla with the left hand the tip follow wont go and it stays with Virginia Tech this is pretty wild this pretty good this is Curly Neil exactly right presence of M keeps his head up and gets a match ups he he can attack oh pump fake Up and Under just cant get it to go couldnt get the second chance opportunity thats frustrating for a defense particularly Florida State typically rebounds well and Florida State plays a lot harder defense than the Washington generals oh really so that was even more impressive well you know Bob their job was to lose they did it well padulla airball loose ball hustle play Lyn kid knocked it out of bounds yeah thats a tough empty good possession right you know good possession in the sense that you created some Second Chance opportunities you overcame bed play tough way to end how long you think Leonard Hamilton sits jir Watkins with the three fouls yeah I I I feel like you bring him in with a rotation theres no real reason to force him back into the game you just use him as as the next rotation and they ask him to be wise Jaylen warley misss Point Blank Range another run down by Lin kid which I feel like asking Watkins to be wise takes a little something out of it nichel line drive three off the Feet Again from padulla n you got to be aware of in transition particularly when he runs flat to the corners that really messes with your transition defensive uh principles really wow really thats exactly what Bob B Miller probably would respond yes really I can shoot it from here and he connects on a big three thats a judge the outcome type of decision right there the No No Yes shot yes quick trigger Couture his first Miss from behind the AR dark but a foul call this has been fun I really Ive enjoyed this game I think physically it was incredibly tough back and forth early later earned an NBA from Xavier and he was a true Trailblazer here at Virginia Tech their first black scholarship basketball player back in the game jir or Watkins and that substitution for Leonard Hamilton pays immediate dividends its a great story by the way you know verified by Sports illustrator I understand we live in a world of questionable sources but I I by thats an awesome story I actually I want to look that up when I saw that earlier in the day like can you picture that situation no its amazing hey go ahead and try to hit me by the way Im Muhammad Ali and who would like I would try but I would say are you going to hit back first off and if you said no i like all right I got to get this this could be good now Mike Tyson said it i be like no thanks nickel again that one a little too strong but the rebound run down by padulla he has a lane to the basket gives it up to poti theal is there for Nichol I thought they might have gotten a goal 10 it sure looked like it may have been a goalen but you know what as you said earlier the ball knows B dont lie nichs had a really good game too I think hes had a very quiet 13 five to seven from the field three of four from threepoint line hes a good spacer gets to the open space which is one of the most important parts of scoring off the ball Watkins will go to the free throw line after putting MJ Collins in the spin cycle and Collins is called for his third hes a really tough cover particularly when he likes his matchup right and they just space they do a good job he just continues to fight theres not much more MJ Collins can do honestly you got to play a lot more oneonone the way the gamees played these days you got to cover the ball around the perimeter and you got to play post 101 even the guards you got to learn how to play post 101 its not about stopping the shot right youre not going to win 15 to zero its about forcing the toughest shot possible oh there we go into the teeth of the student section for watus oh does that count that did not count oh no Baker As Miller and Couture being talked to by the officials dont worry folks thats a rhythm disruptor theres a good chance he misses Ill take a sleeve of bacon last time you went grocery shopping thats nine bucks oh got it he quiets The Crowd Oh I love this game he made the third opportunity count Florida State back within four Collins on the drive kicks it out to the wing Couture off the front rim and the rebound a strong one at that for Jaylen gainy gy in the post bumped by Pote now sets the screen way outside biller NBA range again he had made his 20th three of the season the last time he tried from out there but that time a little too strong hes got a really right nice release I I think shot prep is is so important especially with bigs with footwork around the perimeter how about 2 to 11 in offensive rebounding Virginia Tech has been great getting on the offensive glass kulla draws the foul and what that tells me is theyre doing a good job keeping this Florida State Defense spaced theyre being patient theyre waiting letting the play develop stay in space when the shot goes up theyre anticipating it well theyre getting on the offensive glass and obviously doing a good job rebou on the defense end that foul on Primo Spears his third for you feel like these are two good teams though like I Im watching this and Im I see two good teams these teams with consistency are NCA tournament teams and dangerous at that given what they they offer which is a difficult matchup the athleticism length ability to defend you all 95 ft for Florida State and the threepoint prowess of Virginia Tech there theres no doubt these two teams in the ACC tournament could pull off off one of those Thursday upsets that no one saw coming but I would argue that theyre even more dangerous on a short prep in the NCA tournament where you havent seen this team again you cant simulate what Florida state does in any way unless you got a team of NBA guys that are that length and depth well right now theyre not even on Joe Lenards radar based on say the first four out next four out in consideration as Spears cant hit from three so both have a lot of work to do between now and through the ACC tournament to have a chance to make the NCAA tournament Im going to say in the coming years were going to just change the metric because were going to see teams that look bad in November December that all of a sudden January February March are like wow they could win a National Championship thats just the reality of bringing guys together on a short shortterm basis and and out for padulla if you want Ill just choose the field lose a lot of friends hell make some yes Watkins dumps one down low for an easy flush by Court Watkins we talked about his impact right we look at his stats but then you think impact well his ability to just do that put it on the floor with his head up and make a play but also make the shot also get the offensive rebound defend the point guard defend the big fills every hole coutur behind the back lost control of the dribble but cam corins going to be called for the foul its just good play recognition right youre reading defense reading defense whos picking me up well its going to be kid whos going to be open its the rle man right basketball looks super complicated and fastpaced but if you make the right decisions you write the right reads its pretty simple game I also think a lot depends kind of like the football mentality you have a role you have a responsibility it may not be to make the player score but its to create the opportunity for someone else you can do that as a decoy in the corner right now Hunter Couture is just space it out thats going to give your team teammate an opportunity because of the gravity he has with his ability to shoot adulla throws one back up top the extra pass to Couture shot clock winding down creat space cant finish and back the other way comes Music Applause Spears Corin throws it down again as he slipped past Lin kid G Techs got to be careful and maybe adjust some of their ball screen coverages theyre helping up a little too high staying with the basketball and the length able to pass over the top of the defense for those short rolls and Applause rolls one once was an eightpoint Virginia Tech lead is down to one medulla tries to stretch it and it does with a deep three its really big thats a big moment in the game right there I mean Florida State climbing back getting what they want on the offensive end to hit that shot soften the Music blow Spears around padulla and Drew the foul thats the fourth foul on Virginia Tech yeah hasnt been a ton of runs in this game but really theyve been Pockets where both teams get hot St Florida state has shared the ball tonight as they have assisted on 10 of their 18 made field goals and we wondered which Trend would break threepoint shooting for Virginia Tech or overall shooting for Florida State neither has really broken yet and were Midway through the second half two to shoot beer from NBA Reign has to force it up that comes up short ball Bowen though with a hustle play through traffic to get the offensive rebound Jackson was tied up back to bulbo and short for three and it drops to Collins very good defensive possession and ultimately it was nickel nickel kept coming over and taking that roll away and he was there early showing his presence so it just denied any thought of it Collins turns it over take away by Primo Spears goes right down the lane fouled by Rex Steiner Primo Spears will go to the free throw line to try and cut the lead down to two I feel like that might have been more of an outcome foul than an actual foul and and Spears does a good job of that hes very choppy and I dont know how to describe hes got a weird wiggle to him strong base he changes speeds and directions really well but he got up in the air I dont know how much he got hit could be wrong and Miss for Spears what a college basketball Saturday we have on tap on ESPN the games tip off at noon Eastern and here are some featured matchups number nine Duke taking on the noes at two Eastern and then its number 6 Kansas against number 25 Oklahoma and a top 25 match up as well between Kentucky and Auburn and a Sonic Blockbuster itll be another great afternoon and evening of Hoops on ESPN how much bacon do they get they seem pretty excited about it doesnt seem like its like added bacon to a club sandwich or something or a bur seems like its a significant out one package per person the voice tells me thats Ill take that I hope its thick cut how could it not be with the left hand Lin kit a really good spin dribble keep that defender on your back Lin kit holds his seal you kind of spin that thing out little English on it good execution its just playing basketball Spears tries to cross over nickel and lost control of the dribble Applause Applause theour lucky to find the ball as nickel Berry had his back turned Couture Fades away short and there is another rebound for Taylor balen J cin starting to stress out the fans behind us every time hes throw a pass like who like got to watch hands in the passing lanes and he got his too he turns it over Collins the steel stumbling and drawing the fou is LIN kid I feel like thats what Collins can do though like theyre ties for you like no no no just make the simple play but then he makes terrific plays its finding the balance right and you know at time sha padulla has had some turnover issues problem look at this line change this is a hockey moment for Leonard Hamilton he sends five new players out to hop the boards as all five players on the floor were replaced and by the way that foul on Primo Spears he becomes the first player in the game with four he probably wont come in for another five minutes is that they roll Collins for three need it need it thats big this equals the largest lead for Virginia Tech pushed back to eight also give MJ Collins little confidence shooting the Music basketball every make is a rhythm Builder Watkins size Advantage draws the foul on padulla and theyll say that foul was on the floor MJ Collins hasnt really been able to do much to impact this game hasnt had a lot of shot opportunities I mean Defender slides down and going to take away the post cuz youre playing with two bigs we got two bigs on the floor so theyre both trying to take away way any bigs when theres a kind of a its not a dead ball situation but the ball kind of stops so you want to get back to guys that youre comfortable with and you lose a shooter around the perimeter in MJ Collins both teams now out of fouls to give a thrown ball away for jir Watkins so we still have 8 and 12 minutes to go and itll be free throws the rest of the way that three hit the backboard first for Collins numbers for Florida State Baron behind the play but Watkins pulls it Applause out oh theyre going to get it on padulla padulla is called for the foul thats his fourth I dont know what you do Id love to see it back up good slowmo second time as a as a mouse whos been in the house um I dont know what I dont know I I I dont really understand how thats a foul in padulla if anything its a play on I I got nothing for that I mean theres nothing you can do if youre Shan padulla except just let him catch it and dunk it like theres nothing there thats bad ball on line although padulla is on the bench now with four fouls 100 that certainly impacts things because now Brandon Reiner a true freshman trying to protect an eightpoint lead will run the point heres the thing if that happens early in the game Im saying okay lets deal with it were going to get one back because thats not a foul in Shan padulla and Ill make sure the officials know re Steiner Off the Applause Applause Mark Applause bab Miller nice find and the Layin is there for cam Corin big man to big man yeah B tell Baba Miller hes a big man the way hes handling the basketball and shooting it and that pass that pass is recognition and the recognition is seeing what a defense is doing seeing whos going to be open its big time Tam Corin looks like commits the foul he is four and you saw way to defend Florida States got some foul trouble to worry about as well Primo Spears has four so that is an energy player that right now has to sit for Leonard Hamilton but hes got some three foul players to worry about as well as Watkins warley have three yeah but then hes got 10 other dudes that have like one or two so its like they just keep coming he does have weapons but the difference is sha padulla this is a guy who had 26 last time time they played hes got 15 now not the most efficient shooting night but hes 10 to 12 from the free throw line that matters the most down the stretch so you shouldnt impact the game with calls and that thats I think why it bothers we got a good game shouldnt be impacted by that green Jr thought about a three five to shoot puts it on the deck on Couture contested shot is good for Darren Green Jr j Collins may have a contact hes got to throw in get some solution dont just toss that puppy in Darren Green Jr hit a couple of early threes he had been scoreless since he now has eight now we have to make sure we can see SJ Collins might have to head to the bench for some s Lead yeah I would say so right Derek Greens the tough cover because of what he can do from the threepoint line but I thought Hunter Couture did a great job they wanted to force him to bounce it right put it on the floor make him make a tough shot he just made a really tough shot in a way you can live with that thats good defense you got guys in rebounding position you force the toughest shot let alone have you get used to it let alone have it fall on the floor and grab it throw it back in is pink eye still a thing it exists yes I have children I do I have three boys under four Im sure Ill learn about its coming get ready and when one gets it get ready for the rest Collins lost his footing time needs help and the timeout not granted or called the possession arrow belongs to Florida State I just think thats an important possession where you might want it I guess you only have two left if youre Mike young with padulla are you just trying to get to the under four before you bring him back I think so but youre also just feeling the situation they no absolutes in this game so it could be that Florida State goes on a run and you call timeout and say lets get a good possession and maybe play a little offense defense if possible but youre also going to ask these guys to to hold their ground right be smart have good possession take care of the basketball here you trust Hunter Couture with the ball too I also like when they cover him with a big use him as a Music point hell try a three Applause yes thatll buy some more time on the bench for sha padulla as the lead is up to nine the largest for Virginia Tech if theyre going to switch everything you can get a match up you like its going to be barren see look at this with Hunter Couture if theyre going to get switches and you find a match up youre like got to trust Hunter Couture to make a good decision to make a shot now a shot thats missed is better than a turnover at least you get a shot up and a shooter like Hunter Couture in the night hes having hes 6 to 12 from the field four six for three put it in his hands and his game off the bounds has really developed I got to give him a lot of credit he was more of a onedimensional shooter now hes really playing long hard Closeouts attacking remember is one of the first plays in the game where he attacked and he went up there with bad intentions and he took a tough fall landed on that elbow and he fought through it he has 16 jir Watkins leads all scores with 17 hes the only player for Florida State in double figures four double figures last time they played this team and truthfully they have 11 guys who have scored so thats pretty impressive in a non blowout 18 for Watkins now 19th time hes been in double figures this season the lead at seven with five and a half to go oo deflected ball in the back court that allows John Camden to then draw a foul with five on the timer on jir Watkins thats his fourth foul thats another very important player to pick up his fourth foul but thats not a smart one if your Watkins you know pressure you have a nonball Handler 40 ft from the basket just pressure get wide get your hands wide that being wide will disrupt any pass going anywhere just going to dribble and the shot clocks going to go out with a bad shot time and score presence of Mind situational awareness John Camden only averages about 6 minutes a game this is only the ninth game this season he has played in and then you stick him at half court with Watkins pressuring him with 6 seconds left on the shot clock have fun with that but he steps up like a veteran and knocks down two big free throws there had to be a part of him when he got fouled there was like oh God thank Music God foul on Camden holding Baba Miller so that will put Miller at the line Virginia number 11 second Music first just not sure about that one you I didnt see it all but but sometimes when youre watching the whole play you you can feel when there was a foul right you just kind of you see things move out of place right someone knocked a chest piece over wasnt much going on there theyre really cleaning it up in the paint down there Camden didnt argue much its like its an initial argument hok highlighted ACC Network triple header Saturday as they square off against number 7 North Carolina at 2 Eastern followed by Miami BC and then Louisville pit Will cap off the night thats your triple header on the ACC Network coming up on Saturday just found my wallet on the floor that could have been a disaster apologize for the stream of Consciousness yet again its just nice to have a little window under your life Hearts get beat Rex under five minutes to go again padulla still on the bench with the four fouls and Rex Steiner needs help Nicholl bails him out and drives it good sit down the extra pass Collins for three rebound pulled down by Watkins Nickles playing a really good game green Junior fires and hell have three free throws coming as he was bumped by Rex Steiner there are times when when the dont shoot it dont shoot it type of shot right the not really a good shot is hard to not foul a guy cuz youre kind of scrambling back and then turning your body and then just getting over a screen there yeah I mean its contact with the shooter its the right call so Darren Green Jr made two early threes and wasnt heard from for a while but had a big twopoint bucket a few possessions ago up to nine I would almost wonder about getting pulla back in in this possession I would wonder I dont Applause know for Florida zandler find the guy maybe niichel has two I think find the guy and say you know what heres what I want you to do I want to get badulla in want a good possession nichel youre going to foul the worst free throw shooter its probably a terrible idea but I just like the idea of it theres a different urgency right now and its not a a confident sense of urgency I think Coutures got to get the ball back in his hands and you got to get nickel to space hes been really good getting Music Applause Corners cross over for Collins Rex Steiner gave it away warley rounds it off but hell shoot two another foul on Rex Steiner Ong Im not Im not Im not kidding about what Im feeling and what Im feeling is Virginia Tech is a little out of sorts some calls that havent gone their way some offensive possessions where they had nothing going its why I say something ridiculous like maybe get padulla back in the game for an offensive possession and foul a p free throw shooter a Miss for warley who shoots 69 thats his first Miss hes now two for three far as they not really doing themselves any favors from the free throw line 7 of 26 for the game and theyve been able to get there maybe theres some bacon in this one theres the bacon they do miss two but they get the back clap and a fumble by Corin out of bounds as he was found by Baba Miller alone under the basket well that was just a positive outcome all around for Virginia Tech fans here but you need a good possession and again I want Hunter Couture with the basketball hes got a different Poise about him where hes not really sweating this moment again if youre unfamiliar with the castle of a player in the second half misses backtoback free throws everybody gets a voucher for a local ser of bacon does that include us why not we were here that could be Applause goenda Tech John chrisen on bab shoen eightpoint lead for Virginia Tech 343 to go and now you get padulla back in the game 340 left was out with a fourth foul green Jr too strong padulla runs it down and now You think Virginia Tech might want to work some clock you know its like theres work some clock but not for the purpose of just running clock right work the defense and use some Music Applause clock SOA sets up kick the jump hook wont go Aaron green Jr the rebound spin move Watkins with the left hand comes up short gets his own Miss draws a foul and MJ Collins cant believe it Watkins has a really tough spin move I saw it on tape but its a its a physical spin into you and then its just kind of presence of mind thats not a foul either that looked like a lot of basketball thats the fourth on Collins I to be clear officiating is not easy I mean these things are happening so fast and you want to be fair we see it in slow mo and complain Applause about check it back in for Florida State this is tough Watkins is one of those guys that any team in the country would be like Ill take that guy like he just could play any role for you hes Applause tough and hes now a hit at least for 20 for the third time this season watch a trap kadulla floats one to Nickel gets it across oh and Collins gets trapped and out of trouble now Niel was almost in that no you take it situation like best to get it back out want to get it back into Padulas hands but nickel Fades away tough shot foul called on Darren Green Jr going for the rebound flid state did a good job keeping it out of Padulas hands so he was never really able to initiate anything they never got into offense rega Tech lucky on that foul the rebound its a good defensive possession with the full court pressure including the trap on the initial Music pass for Darren Green Jr thats his fourth and not surprising youre going to have fouls pile up weve had 41 fouls called in this game in total and we now have three players on each roster with four yeah this this somewhere along the line started to feel like a midnight finish game its what fouls called I the physicality down the especially when possessions down the stretch start to matter more 10 points and 15 rebounds now for ly kid try to put Primo in a situation to attack the duel with four fouls Miller its not a bad option either there right at Robbie bar and immediately a timeout called by Leonard Hamilton Topsy Turvy night in night out have fun if your Joe lardy no one feels badly for Joe for Music Joe trap Nicholl throws it down why not that was nice play right out of the Trap and attack punish pressure 15 for Tyler nich offensive foul called on Baba Miller sets a moving screen he was moving too fast and and Primo Spears was moving too fast but how about nickel right out of the double just tag he gave a little look away as if he was going to make the Applause pass how was that foul Baba Millers first in this game hard to believe play it from the threepoint line I guess I guess so he moves like a pro too padulla Line Drive wont go tipped kept Alive by Lyn kid and was a foul call nope theyre just going to say out of bounds on Florida State its almost as if it was like oh wait Watkins how many fouls do you have four N Out of Bounds with no real foul there feels like a must stop for Florida State and now theyre going to go to the monitor it looks like and take a look at the cont really turn the heat up without giving up something easy go attack that yep and theres the foul and that fouls out Spears so he is now done he becomes the first player to foul out that is Applause five Che number one J War this has been a tough game like if a basketball game could be Freebird this is it yes I mean this is something else I mean thats 43 combined fouls that have been called on the two teams still with 135 to go in regulation time and now that puts ly kid at the line now I dont know about giving your fifth foul on LY kid he shoots 89 at the line when I said attack him I meant pressure make him dribble make him make a Music Applause pass hes third best in the ACC at the free throw line so he almost gave you that Jinx business right there too I couldnt even Jinx him nope so Primo Spears fouled the wrong guy and a turnover padulla ridden by Miller picks up his dribble and finds Music nichel good Poise good Poise handling the pressure now you got a foul good shooter and that puts Couture at the line he shoots 88 so Virginia Tech as you would expect well coached by Mike young theyre getting the ball to the guys that they want to have fouled I think theyve seen the pressure throughout the game too so theyre starting to see whats there theyre getting their head up and and managing the on ball pressure a little bit better and thats an adjustment you make throughout the course of the game and in a way its growing comfortable with the most difficult thing at the start of the game I think you get comfortable with it but you just manage it better 18 for Couture and a little mock chant from the student section as theyre doing the tomahawk chop as the clock winds down for Florida State theres a three a rainbow for Darren Green Jr that will get Leonard Hamilton to call another timeout still an eightpoint lead for Virginia Tech with 566 to go Daren green when you watch him shoot dude shot the ball really well theres a that strength for Virginia Tech at this point they do not have a bad free throw shooter on the floor you know it doesnt matter where the ball goes as padulla dribbles the clock down theres the foul by Miller padulla is the worst free throw shooter of the five players on the floor and he shoots 78 dare he and hes 10 of 12 yeah I does it say not the day where hes 78 so he knocks a couple down here and its a 10point lead with 53 seconds to go you wonder if Leonard Hamilton even has his team commit any further fouls I think we got to say padulla has had a good game hes really dealt with a lot the the foul trouble becomes an issue right the inconsistency In and Out playing the role that he plays the responsibility he has and Carries as the point point guard but also a guy that needs to score this is not an easy matchup theres a three for jir Watkins and another foul given on Hunter Couture by Miller his third yeah look you make a three you foul you want to extend this basketball game but its tough when you have so many good free throw shooters on the floor this free throws are points right theyre giving you an opportunity to get a point you realize how hard you have to work on offense to get two well Virginia Tech is now 25 of 29 at the line as a team and I think part of thats been the aggressiveness with which they played they they really attacked on offense pulla does a great job getting inside pump faking really used his footwork well today which is something hes needs to continue to work on rebound by padulla and Baba Miller gives another foul and a ninepoint game with just over 30 seconds to go I dont want to be too cliche and say like he needs to be like a villain over guard like Colin Gillespie but there are aspects of that game that you want to watch and mimic the post play the strength in the paint thats something he can really work on and improve because when his footworks good and hes strong with the basketball he makes better decisions and when he makes better decisions his team shoots a higher Applause percentage an 11point lead for Virginia Tech so they are going to break their threegame losing streak and theyre going to send Florida State to their fifth loss in their last seven games as Miller comes up way short its saved off of nickel by Watkins with 19 seconds to go Millers got a good shot earning the step back from 2530 something Applause Music else Watkins from the corner its another three bask by number two its into Couture theyre going to call him off and now they will finally wave the white flag and Virginia Tech Will dribble down the last 10 seconds and win it 8375 it a good performance by Virginia Tech I give him a lot of credit this is a tough match up for Virginia Tech they ran great stuff on the offensive end got good looks nickel was terrific Hunter Couture was
