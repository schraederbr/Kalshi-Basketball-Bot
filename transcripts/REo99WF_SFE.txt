that you know you look up and you dont think hes done all that much but all of a sudden hes got 20 and 10 every night thats the way hes been and pitt off to a good start well horton knocks down his first three and a young man had five threepointers in that game against virginia tech on wednesday so you know this pittsburgh team is coming in confident but one of the things they struggle with is handling prosperity after a big win but normally its a lesser opponent that theyre playing against this time they get the top team in the acc and you see the energy level is here to begin the game Applause of pittsburgh seeking wins over ranked opponents in backtoback games and the ball loose and scooped up by the cavaliers virginia rebounded from a loss to virginia tech to beat nc state on wednesday 6457 a hardfought victory inside the conference heres hauser hell give it up shot clock inside 10 again here for the cavaliers bowser swings it deep into the corner in the jumper by clark off target and you see right now pittsburgh is going to give kihei clark reese beekman the opportunities that they want from beyond the ark but they are going to make sure they give houser huff and murphy extra special attention because they feel as though those are the three guys that make this vaughan virginia offense go averaging over 71 points per game jim penny rolling in ever so smoothly to make it seven to nothing for the panthers and a slow defensive rotation for virginia you know as much as their offense has been talked about their defense is not the same as what tony bennett has gotten used to in charlottesville and right now you see a slow rotation allowing justin champagne to get a relatively easy layup by hauser thatll go down for two actually a threepointer for sam hauser the 68 senior but now you see why jeff caple is going to give sam hauser extra special attention he doesnt need much space at all to be able to get a good look from beyond the arc and when you consider the fact that hes shooting over 41 on the season hes going to be aggressive in trying to find his opportunities from beyond the arc cavaliers of course under tony bennett they are still the reigning national champions because we didnt have one last year and they won it in 2019 murphy with a long one that wont drop trey murphy with a miss well obi ill take my analyst head off for one quick second and as a uva alum i will say you dont Applause five minutes in a good start for the panthers very choppy start for virginia you see theyre one for six and just not hitting right away as clark will line it up and on cue he will knock it down but obi the difference in that threepoint field goal shot by kihei clark in comparison to the first two that hes taken in this game there was no thought process it was simply catch and shoot with confidence and thats what key has to do hes a capable scorer from beyond a threepoint arc oftentimes i think he gets caught up as to whether he should or should not take that shot beekman reaching in commits the foul so 14 37 to go first half 96 the panthers in front even though there is so much against us college basketball i personally believe that you need to have 6 000 college basketball kay cunningham got in foul trouble of course im watching that game because its kate cunningham whos one of my guys versus another one of my guys matt coleman you know for texas playing against each other and cade is on the bench you know five minutes into the game but when you think about the freedom of movement and the ticky tack fouls are now called in college basketball you got to give guys six fouls otherwise the big time players that you go to watch oftentimes are going to be sitting on the bench for the majority of the first half no doubt about it an air ball right there at the horn never got to the iron so it goes back over to virginia and pitts lead has been sliced down to three jeff cable in his third year at the helm for the panthers he said before this season began this is the year pitt has to win turn things around and win nine and five coming in five and four in the conference and it played a lot of close games corey they have but this is a team obie that after a duke win at home was sitting at four and one in the acc and then lost three straight games you know they gave wake forest their first win of the season you know right afterwards so you know jeff caper trying to find a level of consistency with this team and maturity that they show up each and every night and play the way that theyre being coached to play also with the level of intensity that will allow them to be successful tell you what early both teams are having difficulty with the shot clock and getting it off in time orton will lift and itll stick well thats not just a stick thats a wedge that is a big time wedgie that is a wedgie and again from a a knock down shooter in horton but it was a great pass from champaign out of the trap and if youre virginia youre going to double team someones going to have to get to horton because hes not the guy you want shooting open opportunities in the blue uniform heres johnson whos coming off a great day 32 points coming off the bench in the victory over virginia tech my thought is if it if you get a wedgie like that you have to give up the basketball forget about the possession arrow you give it up if it sticks like that are you with me on that no question its embarrassing enough isnt it in a pickup game yes and a pickup game yes i will stick with the possession arrow but i do understand your your premise behind that and im with johnson nice dish for champagne and thats where xavier johnsons at his best of course he knocked down four threepointers versus virginia tech but when hes getting downhill into the painted area hes not only able to score for himself but find his teammates thats where hes most dangerous one of the reasons why he leads the acc and assists at over six a game and another reason why justice champagne is the leading scorer in the acc because hes been a beneficiary of a number of nice fines from johnson just like a nice look from sam hauser off the dribble there and he he shoots it the way you like it best hobie he doesnt mess around with that rim its strictly net when he puts it up there on that the pretty way you know dont mess with the iron if you dont have to if you have that kind of touch his audis tony he comes in at 15 points and six rebounds hes going to draw a rare virginia foul they hardly ever foul just 13 per game which is number two as far as the fewest in the country with 1207 to go yeah virginia only fouled 88 times per game im sorry i take that back thats the turnovers so its only 88 turnovers per game in their 13 fouls again yeah but when you look at it theyre they dont give you many opportunities thats the one thing about tony bennett coach teams they dont beat themselves they dont turn the basketball over they dont foul you unnecessarily and give you easy ways to score which is one of the reasons why theyre parentally one of the best defensive teams in the country right such a clean team you know in so many ways on the penetration good defense there and denied by caffarro as he knocked it thats nine on the shot clock and the timeout we have 11 55 to go in a quick moving first half and virginia down by three pit getting out in front quickly with a hot hand but the cavaliers starting to cut back into it as you mentioned they are number one nationally and fewest turnovers per game they are number seven in scoring defense averaging just 60 points per game lasty last years team led the nation allowing just 52 you talk about you know the championship a couple of years ago and theres still the reigning champs 2018 ncaa tournament first one seed to lose to a number 16 c man did that motivate the team the following year and talked about it incessantly assemble this and set up this matchup really very much on the fly which has become the norm and professional in college sports these days it has been the norm and of course we commend the acc as well as these coaches and players and jeff cable now 3941 during his career at pittsburgh coming off their biggest win of the season as you mentioned vs virginia tech and oftentimes they struggle in that next game but theyre playing down to their competition this time playing up when you talk about playing against the best team in the acc to this point and right now pittsburgh has had a great energy and great effort to start the game horton a very dangerous threepoint man for the panthers 37 will settle for two and drop it in and pitt has a 138 advantage on virginia and weve gotten used to see horton do the majority of his damage from beyond the threepoint archer right there showing that hes more than just a threepoint shooter going off the bounce to the midrange to give pittsburgh the fivepoint lead virginia early on here corey really settling for a lot of threepointers and he missed a bunch of those early on one of the reasons theyre trailing here theyre two for eight beyond the arc so far trying to get inside here and a rebound picked off by odically when you remember when you mentioned those numbers you have to recognize the fact that kia clark has taken four threepointers already for virginia that plays into the hands of what jeff cable is asking sam hauser is one for one from beyond the arc but its casey morrisell and trey murphy all both all those guys owe for one so if coach cable can keep j huff sam hauser and trey murphy from getting those looks hell live with the other guys taking the threes because virginia is almost like an inverted lineup where their best shooters are their five theyre four and theyre three man in their starting lineup one of those guys coming in averaging 14 the seven footer knocking down a long one there to make it a twopoint game pit coming in nine and five theyre five and four in the acc played a lot of close games 14 games eight of them decided by 10 points or less and a turnover picked off by the cavaliers and here comes virginia and thats the one area if youre pittsburgh you do not want to have high turnover numbers versus virginia possessions are so difficult to come by when you play especially here in charlottesville and virginia normally takes advantage of those opportunities as they do here with jay hubs driving it and the opportunity for the hand one and hobie j had to make sure we were on espn before he got started he didnt want to do his business on espn news he knocks down the three as soon as we go to espn and then of course he you have to pay him so much attention from beyond the threepoint arc but a skilled big man who has the opportunity to put the ball on the floor and finish through contact now with an opportunity for not only the and one but also to give virginia the lead and like most of the guys on the virginia team he is a tremendous foul shooter naturally he misses there but 89 and as a team if you shoot 80 and youre a cavalier youre bringing your teams percentage down because theyre 82 one of the best in the country in those close games they are money thats no pressure no pressure at all sweet touch there by champagne the accs leading scorer in rebounder the nice move by championing but more importantly championing not getting teamed on that possession and give him you know the opportunity to recognize when you dont see the double team that its this opportunity to go and be aggressive trying to score hauser from the corner cant find a range early on hit up by two virginia just three for ten outside the threepoint line johnson cant hit xavier johnson hes coming off a great game 32 points and he did that off the bench against virginia tech hes a guy who started almost every game throughout his career hes a junior now he found that ten minutes before the game he was coming off the bench and it worked beautifully as did that jumper from beekman yeah jeff caple said that he needed to shake something up in the lineup and that shake up was xavier johnson and if theo horton both those guys who had a great practice on the tuesday prior but an awful practice on monday so jeff capel going with a difference and it paid dividends for his team especially for xavier johnson who came off the bench for the first time in his pittsburgh career and that was 79 straight games that he started coming off the bench in game 80 for him which happened to turn out to be a career high well the turnover by pitt but youve got to make sure you have eyes in the back of your head when champagne is on the floor with you because that was an outstanding pass to simply mishandle hauser goes in strong for two and virginia now picking it up on the offensive end of the floor got off to a slow start but now you see the guys that tony bennett wants to take the shot sam houser j huff starting to get involved in the offense and its worked to their advantage but give cooler volley credit for going j huff on j huff getting a little payback jay huff took him to the basket on the earlier possession coulibaly coming back with a nice move of his own yeah i think that got under his skin a little bit not a big scorer but every once in a while he can help you out way downtown it wont drop for beekman and knocked out of bounds itll go the other way when we come back from the timeout 7 24 to go in the first half virginia by one penny the twin brother of justin is a star in his own right as st johns in fact he leads the big east in scoring well justin leads the acc you talk about getting stuff done absolutely you think about the household i wonder what those conversations are like after games for justin and julian but i can tell you right now julian is waiting for justins game to be over so he can call him and let him know hey i had 24 today verse providence and by the way we won six straight at st john so uh im sure julian is checking his twin brother out today and seeing if he can have a similar performance as he did as on his own no question and justin averaging 19 and 12 rebounds a game hes one of the great rebounders in the country heavy traffic thats deflected out yeah well justin has the advantage over julian when you talk about the rebounding when you look at these last three brothers to average 193 plus points per game and you look at the top of the list my boys the curry brothers and then marcus and jordan howard getting it done when you think about justin and julian champine and obie i was looking at the notes there were a set of brothers at indiana back in 1964 that both averaged over 20 a game and they played on the same team obviously they shared the sugar i mean oh absolutely i love it got that done but when you think about that i mean thats over 40 a game two brothers and they did it back to back years thats impressive murphy lets fly hes off to a chilly start pit back on top by one here in charlottesville itll launch a little too quickly six minutes to go in the half and pittsburgh has been notorious and not you know say that word not lightly because since you are the notorious dob you know about this but pittsburgh has been notorious for having slow starts especially in acc play so jeff cable has to be happy not only with the offense but the defensive defensive effort as well getting over taking the charge from his team thus far because hes a believer in this as being a much better second half team after theyve had a chance to really feel their way through with the opponent so right now you look at jeff caple with his 201st career win versus virginia tech on wednesday and they started the season at 82 that threegame slide after a big win versus duke kind of changed the fortunes of this team right now but still trying to find a way to get back into the ncaa tournament huh horton with a quick dish inside for two an outstanding pass that led to another pit bucket theyre on top 21 to 18 kula bali with eight he came in averaging only five points and four rebounds but he had a 15 point game against wake forest earlier this season so every once in a while he can really help the offense for the panthers and going to be a turnover here by the cavaliers hit on top 21 to 18 and we have another full day of college hoops across all of our networks later highlighted by north carolina duke in a sonic blockbuster at six and a border battle between number 11 tennessee and kentucky at rupp arena both of these games on espn and the espn app gulabali again and knocked away by huff who was the top shot blocker on the team they have what 58 blocks he has 35 of them well jay huff trying to inch his way into the top five all time on the virginia career list for shot blocks and you know i believe he will definitely do that before the end of this season but jay huff is special when hes having to guard on the post area the struggles for him this year have been having to guard on the perimeter another miss but now to follow by trey murphy the 69 junior and he said after tony bennett kind of called the team out for not being tough enough two games ago he said i did not want him saying that about me so he played particularly well against nc state but he said you take those things personally as an athlete he certainly did and came back and played much tougher and trey murphy who is the leading threepoint percentage shooter for virginia on this roster which he has some strong competition in the front court but he provides a dynamic on the offensive end of the floor that makes virginia unique shot clock violation Music with 3 57 to go espns exclusive president the way they defend theyre out puffing virginia right now all right gentlemen thank you very much we look forward to it at halftime here pitt leading by one at john paul jones arena corey alexander dave obrien from our homes lying considerably colder than corys down south the sweet jumper by hauser and were starting to get that back and forth as virginia goes up by a point we are and i love the point that lafonzo ellis made regarding having to make kihei clark more of a scorer but youve seen an adjustment from tony bennett already in this game which hes one of the best in the acc at virginia runs that middle pick and roll as hortons able to knock down another three off a beautiful find from champion out of the trap but if theyre running on this possession you see how low well huffs not in the game right now but you see how low they set that screen key clark is going to have to be more aggressive trying to score but its going to have to be attacking the basket not settling for threepoint shots clark was a big factor in their win last year against him he had 17 points as clark cant hit there comes in averaging 10 points four assists per game the point guard and one of the two point guards along with beekman that tony bennett can put on the floor up and in sweetly done by xavier johnson against virginia tech again coming off the bench he had 32 he also had a 27point game against drexel 23 against syracuse he can be a serious offensive weapon and hobie i know this i know you know this because you are the notorious but however im not sure everyone recognizes that xavier johnson has a little extra pep in his step in this game hes a third year point guard as is kihei clark xavier johnson was all rookie team in the acc when he came in kihei clark that year won a national championship when you come in in the same class as another point guard you compare accolades and right now these two guys have had a battle last year kihei clark has 17 points johnson had 16 virginia won a close game at pittsburgh but right now xavier johnson has never beaten virginia hes from the state of virginia this is a game that he has a little extra pep in his step and wants to come away with the win you know about that yourself i mean going headtohead with other guys from virginia in terms of your own success at the university of virginia where you were all acc 2625 pit by one but about 90 seconds to go in the first half and boy coming off the bench well the 10 side has filled up a couple from long range and walter tenzai scored 14 points when we had virginia against clemson where virginia just routed clemson beat him by 35 and you know had little john coliseum but obi that was his first point since then he had gone four games and only played 21 minutes those four games but four straight games where he had not scored and now virginia locking in defensively as champ penny has the turnover but championing caught in no mans land on that one as we see walter tenzai with the step back and the three and he comes in the game hes a hired sniper hey hes make shots or come sit down and right now walter tenzai knocking down his first look a pit with seven turnovers here in the first half virginia jumping into the lead 2826 and the ball here inside the final middle of the first half in charlottesville putting it to the deck slamming on the brakes clark gives it away and the slam by murphy we saw a lot of that from trey murphy against north carolina state but most of it was off of nice passes from jay huff this time murphy catching the ball on the block and finishing on his own showing off his athleticism as virginia has built a fourpoint lead on an eightnothing run Music murphy the third ascending and making sure and pittsburgh has done a great job of keeping trey murphy off the threepoint line only one threepoint field goal attempt for him but this is about as easy as you can get for an athlete like trey murphy the easy bucket and just a gamble that turned out negative for justin champagne on the defensive end of the floor but when you look at it right now pittsburgh going to try to bring this down and not give virginia much time going back down probably keep this for the last shot of the first half as three seconds separate the shot clock but they dont want to give virginia much time to go down and get an opportunity on the other end before happening this is the biggest lead of the ball game for the cavaliers by the way gives you an idea how tight its been johnson looking to penetrate slapped away still loose he races back to pick it up five seconds to go and reach in and a foul with 43 showing on the clock and thats a break for pittsburgh johnson over penetrating and sam house doing a great job helping but reece beekman coming in and theres theres a rule of thumb that if theres a foul the basketball goes up in the air if its not a foul and you got the ball then the ball goes straight down because if you get the basketball theres no way the ball can go up in the air correct this this little pickup game rule right here hobie so that to me looked as though respect but probably got some risk since the ball flew up into the air oh to count it one of two time to get a heave up in the air theyre gonna be well short so thats our score at halftime virginia with the 30 to 27 lead here in charlottesville over the pit panthers the jeep halftime report coming up with reese seth and fonz that it is going to have you with us look at our ally first half stats pit started the game hot and took a seven nothing lead virginia started to chip away they ended the first half on an eighttoone run threepoint shooting been a problem for pitt not necessarily a strength much bigger for virginia and they got that going late in the half making six out of 15 threes so set for the second half here in charlottesville at john paul jones arena virginia ranked number 14 in the country pitt trying to pick up back to back top 20 opponents it had been a couple of years since they beat anybody in the top 20 now theyre trying to do it against virginia tech and virginia in consecutive games and the cavaliers begin the second half with the basketball from a tendency standpoint pittsburgh is a better second half team they average 83 more points per second half than they do in the first half virginia hasnt been great in their last two second half so well see how this one goes down between these two teams as kihei clark misses from up close and clark took five three pointers in the first half and right now looks as though pittsburgh is going to try to make him more of a scorer than facilitator tony bennett giving kihei clark an opportunity to take his man to the bucket early but hes unable to finish it off he can do it he had 19 he was a bright spot in that loss to gonzaga early in the season champagne and thats how the ball game got underway with a play like that as he drops in his first basket of the second half but that is what you like to call sharing the sugar right there nice and xavier johnson got doubleteamed he just gave the ball up easy to cool the ball he was able to make a nice fine to champion putting sam hauser in a tough spot clark on a nice scoop got an excellent screen there from hof the seven footer hobie that was one of the areas where i saw saint tony bennett make an adjustment in this game alone if you look at the middle screen and roll action between jay huff and kihei clark that screen is being set about the free throw line because they dont want kia having to run the screen and roll out past the threepoint line because that pittsburgh is not honoring him out there so they make that a lower opportunity so when he gets in the painted area hes in scoring range already you know pittsburgh just sharing the basketball is avery johnson with a nice feed through the double team and then kula bali finding sam penny but see how low that screen roll action is normally you see that well beyond the threepoint line but once ka clark comes off that screen hes already in scoring area so i like the adjustment by tony bennett recognizing that jeff cable is going to force keeh clark to be a scorer hither horton driving and taking that foul hes the panthers number one threepoint threat another guy who jeff cable elected not to start in the victory over virginia tech and man did that work out well i always think thats a bit of a gamble when you bench a couple of guys as beekman has to go to the bench with three fouls could be very big for the cavaliers one of the two point guards heading to the bench for tony bennett but it was a gamble that certainly paid off for coach cable well he got their attention i mean remember now pittsburgh was coming off of three consecutive losses after a big win at home over duke he told his team they needed to grow up they had to be better they had to mature and they did not do that going on the road and losing to wake forest right after that duke game so as jay huff is able to come off and ke clark continues to be aggressive attacking the basket but if you go over to try to block his shot youre giving jay huff easy opportunities if he doesnt finish but you know that move by jeff caple worked because he got the attention of both xavier johnson as well as ethiopia horton both those guys came back and had big performances against virginia tech and they win at home for champagne shot clock inside 10 taking it to the paint chasing his own miss and on the line so it goes back over to the cavaliers and kihei clark continues to operate in the paint another low pick and roll and although hes unable to finish now thats the one you got we got to see was that a pass obie yeah was that was that a okay i think im gonna give him an assist 3431 i know what the conversation is back in the huddle when they go to a timeout man im glad you saw that coming that was my best pass of the year ill tell you this hobie the official stat keepers called it a shot yeah because he had four first half assists and he still has four assists so just call that a shot i want to call down let him know hey wait a minute no that was a pass thats a number of those in my career where you know ball might not hit the rim somebody follows it up with a sweet touch as you said as we came on the air sam hauser does not worry about the rim oh and a tough drive johnson takes the contact too you talk about a determined effort into the lane when determined because what we talked about in the first half movie this matchup for xavier johnson is personal one is personal against kihei clark two is personal against his home state team hes from the state of virginia hes northern virginia guy and hes playing against the university of virginia who did not recruit him and recruited kihei clark so again not that virginia was wrong for recruiting kihei clark who has a national championship ring and an allacc performer but xavier johnson uses that as motivation coming into this game xavier out of woodbridge virginia the 63 junior and virginia on top 3634 and the basketball here in charlottesville back for clark shot clock to six clark giving it up is murphy gonna let fly and an ugly looking shot and trey murphy is a great shooter not just a good shooter but a great shooter but he has to do his shooting off of catch and shoot and right now xavier johnson and his pittsburgh team picking it up in the second half similar to the way they started the game but they are a better second half team and you can see right now they have just a little more bounce in their step coming out playing with a lot a large level of confidence and a steely eye too whenever xavier johnson is on camera inside for a house going up strong and hell draw the foul so sam hauser will be at the line 15 58 to go here in the second half all tied at 36 espns exclusive presentation of college basketball is brought to you by progress slender lead 5149 look at the point totals over 100 meetings and we do this every year we roll the you know this kind of a graphic but its still pretty amazing corey well and duke swept the series last year so if you go back it was 4949 so you know before that when you think about these two teams and you hear it its so cliche but you throw out the records it doesnt matter whos ranked what whos not ranked when they get together it is a flat out brawl and its always entertaining and i hear people say it all the time duke north carolina always delivers bit off to a good start shooting it in the second half although a misfire here by johnson they had made three out of four virginia by two in a game that has the feeling of one that goes right down to the wire virginia preseason number four right now 14 fascinating that duke in north carolina neither team is ranked going into the matchup tonight heres off to let fly and hit a threepointer and he is such a problem to defend because when you consider seven feet in his ability to be able to score around the rim especially catching lobs and offensive rebounding but when you have the ability to shoot the ball from beyond the arc as j huff does it really you know is a distraction to your defense because most bigs are used to being in the painted area theyre not used to having to go out and guard a guy 22 feet but jay huff is special from beyond the arc tight defense there by hauser all over champane may have forced a shot there coming in 19 points 12 rebounds a game justin champagne and eight double doubles well see he really gets firing here in the second half virginia on top 4136 more pickandroll action and again kihei clark attacking but once again jay huff spacing the floor and knocking down another three most seven footers will be rolling to the basket for a dunk not j huff number 30 finding behind the arc like another and jay hawkins corey and jay huff is such a problem simply because he shoots 62 from the field but yet he shoots threes and when youve got a seven footer that can space the floor this way it puts so much pressure on your defense especially for big men who are used to having to help and recover but when youre recovering out of the 22 feet that makes a difference you look at j huffs improvement throughout his four years really five years at university of virginia he was a red shirt his first year and right now is continuing to get better and better each year and to me obi hes playing at a firstteam allacc level when you consider what he does not only offensively but defensively as well second in the acc and field goal percentage second in the acc and block shots per game jay huff putting on in his fifth year at virginia he got married last september to fellow virginia student lindsay and jeff caple right now not delighted the game started out quick for his team he was very happy then very different look on his face but the turnovers contributing 4436 virginia and that look from jeff cape was because he knows how difficult it is when you allow virginia to start stretching the lead with many teams you can make a comeback which pittsburgh has done multiple times this season but with virginia the later you get into a game and the further that lead comes is so difficult for them to to get them to give up that lead because as we mentioned before they dont turn the basketball over much and they make their free throws so its hard to make comebacks against team as such so right now coach cable trying to find a way to keep this game close well attention at the line 65 senior from italy tony bennett fourtime acc coach of the year trying to win for the 13th time and trying to improve to nine and one which is number one right now 81 in the acc so virginia into double figures with the lead jordan on the wing champion hes got to get rolling into the lane he goes strong tried to bank it but not there for him and give sam hauser a tremendous amount of credit you know houser and huff have struggled at times this year defensively notho murphy into that mix as well but sam hauser accepting the challenge of guarding justin champagne one on one especially when theyre not double teaming which they havent done here in the second half and hes gotten the better of champane in this game thus far on both ends of the floor sam hauser the marquette transfer leading virginian scoring rebounding in threepoint attempts he starred at stevens point high school in wisconsin and thats where tony bennett was destined to play had his father not taking a college job at wisconsin green bay but of course if you look through high school records all over the state of wisconsin youll see bennetts everywhere in mens and womens basketball yeah tonys sister actually did attend stevens point bowser straight on yes as he buries a triple and now to your point just about 90 seconds ago corey its getting away its a 13nothing run for the cavaliers it is and i sure hope we had a camera on my young god chase coleman under the basket right there throwing the threes up letting everyone know that as soon as sam hauser caught the basketball with that much space it was going to be good chase coleman who tony bennett refers to as the coach on the bench and he challenged chase coleman to coach up the guys on the bench and make sure they have their energy on a gamebygame basement basis and a lot of respect for chase coleman from tony bennett gives him a lot of freedom not only as a player but as a coach for this team oh it is uhoh time for the pit panthers virginia starting to run away 5236 hauser once again nothing but net second half no problem for the whos so far kihei clark finding getting his coaching lesson on right now and when tony bennett has given chase coleman an opportunity to be almost as part of the coaching staff for this virginia team and chase coleman got minutes a year ago when they did not have a true backup for kihei clark reese beekman taking those minutes now but chase coleman really has been challenged to coach the bench and only bennett talked to us yesterday about the fact that after practices you know or even during practice he will see chase coleman pull one of his teammates aside and basically show them what they should be doing what they should not be doing during a certain play on a certain defensive set or whatever it may be and he has not asked him to do that he takes that upon himself to do it he loves the fact that chase coleman is a leader amongst his group even more importantly the fact that hes not getting minutes but not moping about that just going out doing his job doing anything he can to try to help this team win and of course his family right now is at home not hearing this because his brother matt is in the midst of a 65 to 65 game against oklahoma state so they will be tuning back into this one soon theyre going to watch it on replay not necessarily in the moment and we forgive them for that by the way virginia had bolstered their lead to 52 to 36 before the triple champagne grabbing the rebound on the baseline and that wont fall tony out battling everybody back to champagne hell draw the foul with 1106 to go to my girl b coleman last night whos also a virginia alum class of 1995 and asking her about what she would be doing in this game or during this game time when texas played at three virginia played at f4 how they would go about watching it and she says well both games will be recorded we start with that but we go back and forth flipping back and forth throughout the game her only wish is that virginia and texas make it to the final four as we see the coleman family cheering on matt and texas and chase and virginia at the same time but you know when you look at the reference of this coaching staff and its not even though chase is going to them hes actually the coaches are coming to him talking to him about strategy and what they need to be doing in this game i love it he came to virginia he had opportunities to be a division one player in many other places he chose to come to virginia because he had that much respect for tony bennett wants to be a coach and wanting to learn from coach bennett i mean you know if youre of that kind of a player where you you want to be a head coach one day well the ten side fighting for tony hitting the deck great hustle there and a tie up on the play with 10 49 to go i mean if you can if you can get into some of these schools youre talking about you know virginia if you can go to duke you go to north carolina yeah i mean learn at the feet of coach k or or roy williams or tony bennett but i mean it sounds like this young man is going to be a head coach one day well and thats the plan and ob i will tell you this because i was involved in his recruitment process the one place that he would have gone in comparison to coming to virginia to play was yale and when he did not get the opportunity to go to yale he said i want to go to virginia but i mean i know for me personally at age 18 theres no way i would have made a decision looking that far forward into my future you know most teenagers are microwave society instant gratification theyre thinking hey let me play let me get to the nba do whatever i can but this young man simply said i want to be a coach and i want to learn from the best and had built a relationship with tony bennett because of the recruitment of his brother and had that much respect to but also to follow mom now this is moms alma mater he wanted to make sure he followed bomb as well im sure they had a lot to do with it last note on him because chase has gotten way too much tv time in this one he wears number 12 which im thinking is from you know his older brother me but he then told me now my dad wore 12 so im kind of like forget that big answer there by will intensity whos done that throughout the afternoon here back to 55 43 it yeah wellingtons uh we mentioned hadnt scored in four the last four games but the last time he scored he had 14 points versus clemson in a game that you and i did ob and then of course he has 11 in this one so maybe its us you know maybe we didnt think about the fact that maybe we bring him this level i wont call it luck of opportunity of course enough well he had some really bright spots a year ago too he had 18 in a gamewinning shot against carolina but he is sizzling here this afternoon and into the evening well hes a capable scorer no question about a knockdown shooter made seven threes versus louisville a year ago as justin champagne went down the officials going to call the timeout to make sure hes okay with champagne letting everyone know im not going out of the game as you see walter tenzac coming off the screen and champion getting clipped by cafaro i tell you what that hurts for both guys but the fact that francisco caffaro didnt even flinch yes i mean he took the knee on the inside i mean banging knees is about as painful as you can get for about a 30second span and caffaro never even flinched no you run into him seven footer from argentina youre going to feel it for a week and champagne has to go out for a moment coming up on the nineminute mark here in charlottesville nice spin move and up and in for two load of cali the 65 freshman showing you a little something there with that bucket hello to cali was actually got a start last time out for pittsburgh weve talked about xavier johnson not starting the game and hes been productive in giving pittsburgh very good minutes heres a freshman hauser little fall away and two more for him hes been lighting it up here in the second half he is eight for nine from the field right now three for four from beyond a threepoint arc it doesnt get much more efficient than that and you throw in if you know three rebounds as well and an assist and sam hauser having himself a pretty spectacular afternoon and you know you and i talked about this before when you talk about justin champagne whose team right now is five and four you know and really ahead of expectations for where they were picked to be this year leading the acc in both rebounding and scoring does he get a nod because of his numbers over sam houser who is the best player on the best team and being very efficient right now and going to the mid post and then the nice somewhat dream shake right there but the turnaround jumper to finish over the top and right now virginia just all over pittsburgh in the second half 77 from the field they cant miss in fact theyve made seven consecutive shots five out of six from threepoint land you bring up a point that you know especially if you have a vote for an mvp or player of the year or the best player in the league which way do you go the guy who puts up the best numbers but maybe his team doesnt win as many games great defense inside on the interior here by virginia that jumper catches nothing but air and a whistle right there on the baseline or do you go with the guy who has a terrific gear maybe not statistically as good as somebody else but his team wins well talk about that when we come back Applause cable at the horn that was to force overtime that was not a game winner yeah we talked with with jeff about that yesterday as we get an opportunity to look at jeff and jason cable both the brothers and their records during that series and neither one of them very good and i can remember jeffs win i know his one win came in 9394 when he and grant hill led duke to the 1994 final four and which means that he lost everyone after that but for jason and really they were at duke in north carolina respectively at the times where the other program was really really good not that either those programs have ever been bad but when you consider the times they were there the other team was really really good during those series well virginia making it look a little too easy this was a very close game for the longest time back pit got off to a great start as tony floats one in and takes the hit as well 6247 and this is the forgotten guy for pittsburgh rds tony who does the job defensively but not getting credit really around the league for being a 157 rebound per night guy right his his production and improvement has been significant throughout his career and you have to remember he was one of the guys that came in as a freshman along with xavier johnson and jeff cape was first year and was you know and grew up kind of on the fly got a lot of minutes early but give pittsburgh jeff cable jason k from milan brown someone told those guys a lot of credit for their development and what theyve been able to do at pittsburgh thus far i agree with you tony certainly one of the most underrated players in the acc hits a big ad 22 against duke he can score it he can rebound 6247 in a game who is tied at 36 back to our earlier conversation about which way would you vote for acc player of the year sam hausers in a conversation championing right now probably the oddson favorite 19 points 12 rebounds again which way would you be choosing right now that is tough for me because i am a firm believer that when you take a player of the year most valuable player it is the one guy that had to do more for his team to be successful and right now justin champine is having to do more for pittsburgh to be successful he had 3114 rebounds burst duke hes had eight double doubles this season im sorry he averages a double double on the season and hes had eight 20 and 10 games as we get a look right now to see what actually happened the officials are yeah this is a trey murphy stepping on to the floor yeah so six players on the floor for virginia six yeah tony bennett tried to get him off the floor quickly but thats going to be a technical foul so six and a half minutes to go and too many men 6247 virginia really opening it up they went on a 16 to nothing run but at this point if im trey murphy i might want to sit down because right now theres still six guys in the screen and so the damage has been done but its probably a time to hey go have a seat and not be in a scenario tony bennett tried his best to get trey murphy back off of the floor not sure what the conversations about regarding right now but tony bennett the great point guard noticing it but a little too late where the officials had already noticed it as well so the technical foul johnson at the line treys a little bit difficult to hide away at six nine so that wasnt going to work well heres the conversation there heres other problem with the new covid benches which understanding what they are but look how far trey murphy is away from the court so to be involved in the action look where his chair is so to be involved in the action you know in granite weve seen chase coleman who has the best seat in the house right underneath the basket but trey murphy just trying to be involved in the action cheering on his team and taking too many steps onto the floor he wasnt as though he was trying to be in the game just lost track of where he was right its not like he went you know and checked in just lost track of where his seat was so pit unable to convert inside and virginia oh stolen away from behind by johnson johnson on the drive hell lay it in so he converted that in a heartbeat and this pittsburgh was in this scenario in their game against wake forest got down double figures in the second half and made that a game to where xavier johnson missed an opportunity at the buzzer to win the game so you cant put it past pittsburgh to be able to come back and make this a game but theyve got to find a way to get stops virginias shooting 75 now in the second half of this game ka clark the beneficiary of a nice pass there the cavaliers absolutely sizzling in what was a very tight game until the early moments of the second half back to the last basket on a nifty spin underneath by clark and theres no quit in xavier johnson recognizing jhope trying to handle the basketball and then getting to the rim with a nice finish to put points on the board but right now virginias still holding a 13point lead as jave huff has now picked up his fourth foul and he has been special here in this second half pittsburghs had no answer for him but does this give pitt a bit of momentum now that he has to go sit down and they dont have to worry about trying to guard the center from beyond the threepoint line xavier johnson to the line an 80 percent foul shooter but misfires on that one pressure on hauser of course in 2019 and a stunning decision both hauser brothers sam and his younger brother joey announced they would transfer from marquette initially they were expected to come to the same school but sam chose to come here to virginia joey pick michigan state both sitting out last season because of ncaa transfer rules and rebounded away by champagne and you can see kihei clark thinking about his shots hes a much better shooter when hes just instinctive and catches the basketball and shoot he sighs that last one up and missed terribly went in strong there a foul on the play and going to be an offensive foul on kihei clark and kihei clark getting out in transition and this is not something you see from him often and xavier johnson his feet look very close to that line maybe he moved forward and got in front of that line at the last second but im not sure if he got there in time before kihei clark gathered into a shot long distance shot wont drop for horton but a rebound up and in and you know pitt continues to work at this thing only down by 11 champion he was 16 so hes right on top of his average and still within striking distance just under four and a half to go well the tenth side thought about it he has been absolutely on fire clark trying to baseline in contact and another offensive foul hes picked up his second one and this is not something that is characteristic of kihei clark backtoback turnovers on offensive fouls and as important as he is to virginia now with three fouls he finds himself and i wont call it foul trouble but hes getting close and virginia now with eight second half turnovers has been the only thing that has stopped him pittsburgh hasnt stopped them when theyve gotten their opportunities but virginia has had a number of selfinflicting wounds to allow pittsburgh to stay stick around champion cant hit there torn away by hauser and a whistle there with 350 to go not a great idea to put virginia at the foul line they hit 82 64 53 the cavaliers five hour energy helps you get stuff done and now when you purchase armando bait cut big double double last time north carolina and duke met 17 minutes away from tip off now we check out the acc standings virginia number one at eight and one fsu running into a lot of covet issues lately theres six and two but duke and north carolina square off tonight its much bigger for duke to win that game than north carolina is it not corey would you fall on that end of that argument well i would say that it would do duke better justice to win that game it would help them more because a loss to north carolina really solidifies that they have not performed the way that they need to to be involved in the ncaa tournament this year north carolina is hanging on theyre one of those teams thats in the mix to be able to get a bid but if they lose to duke that may knock them on the outside that bubble so big game for both teams a lot to be you know gained from a win and loss for both teams that also the fact that youre eight miles apart is the biggest rivalry in college basketball that plays a part too theres that too yeah three and a half minutes to go here in charlottesville virginia with a 6453 lead pit not out of it yet they need a hot hand thats usually justin champagne number 11 they got the matchup they wanted with the switch for champagne Applause over the shoulder pit a very good rebounding team their second in the acc and total rebounds over 40 per game and they get it done on the offensive board as well and also remember jay huff on the bench with four fouls is a difference makers virginia unable to handle the pressure and giving pitt another opportunity to finish and now we turn around obi this is a seven point game you know this is a 122 run for pitt and to close the gap to 6457 a lot of turnovers in the last six and a half minutes for virginia thats very uncharacteristic yeah seven turnovers in that span as you mentioned so right now virginia trying to find a way to operate offensively and theyre doing it and oftentimes you know when you have one of your guys out things can get a little discombobulated as they have thus far you take jay huff off the floor and now youve got hauser operating at the five position and murphy operating at the four and just like that we see jay huff back up into the huddle we may see him back soon we got a timeout 6457 north carolina duke coming up in our nba saturday primetime matchup on abc and espn stefan warriors playing the second of two games in dallas against luca and the mavs part of a fourgame texas road trip and theyll play the spurs monday and tuesday our coverage begins with nba countdown to eight eastern five pacific puff getting ready to check back in the 71 senior in foul trouble but pitt on a charge here late cory and pitt has been able to do it with some offensive rebounding off the miss you see horton getting inside and the reverse layup but then the defense turning into offense xavier johnson getting in the passing lane and audis tony getting out in transition able to finish through the contact pittsburgh then able to pick up their pressure full court and what really uncharacteristically key hey clark has had the turnovers in the second half went into halftime with zero turnovers said four second half turnovers and hes the guy thats normally shorthanded with the basketball in his hands for the wahoos virginia without a point in about four minutes and will draw the foul in the lane with 2 14 to go reece beekman the 63 freshman has been pretty quiet but has moved into the starting lineup fouled on this play and hell be at the line and they look at virginia 82 at the foul line number two in the country have not spent a lot of time there today well see if there changes down the stretch been missing the free throw shooting 84 in acc play 2125 going to the line goes one for two and now eight point game 2 14 remaining more than enough time for pittsburgh to try to cut deeper into this lead they need champagne in a big way here in these last two minutes he gets a touch and deflected away by virginia so pitt will retain possession here with 202 to go jeff caple going to match virginia get cool bali back into the game with jay huff on the floor kula bali has given them good offensive production as well as doing the job defensively in the painted area he struggled trying to rotate out to jay huff a number of times johnson quick dish what a difficult angle by champagne he could not get it to go yes anthony got behind the backboard tried to go back and put some touch on it to get a bucket but hes actually had to force a couple of shots but were not used to seeing from him but give virginias defense a tremendous amount of credit for that happening today but a foul from behind on kula bali as he reached for it north carolina and duke coming up at the top of the hour 6557 virginia as they look to hang on and go to nine and one in the acc in first place in the conference 143 to play and hop at the line where he shoots 89 percent oh for one so far today mentioned that he got married in september some of the guests were wearing masks with his full beard on them which was a nice touch not a nice touch of the line for him today over two for jay hulk as you mentioned shooting 99 but over two and missing the front end of a one and one and more importantly gets split on the double team doesnt end up being damaging for virginia but thats not something you see often versus virginia defense as if horton was able to catch that clearly the officials actually going to go look at this because horton did actually reach for the basketball gives us an opportunity to look at it as well under two minutes you can review but you see xavier johnson split and we know that trey murphy hits it but did horton actually touch that on the way out ruled pit basketball but did he lunge and horton actually touch it at the last moment you can see put his hands up Applause see murphy get a hand on it but right there is a question as to whether or not horton actually touched that basketball going out of bounds and none of the angles that we have seen have been able to validate that and the basketball doesnt change directions on the second attempt i believe thats going to remain pittsburgh basketball indeed it will with a minute 33 to go so the panthers have it looking for their 10th win of the season coming off their best win of the season as they knocked off number 16 virginia tech on wednesday night in pittsburgh to snap a threegame losing skip off for tony back to the big man and a block attempt and a foul there on hauser as he tried for the defensive stop but committed a personal and jeff capel was against the review at first but after they got the review and get the ball back it gave him an opportunity to draw up some great action and get kula bali an opportunity at the free throw line but more importantly if cool ball is able to make both these free throws not only does he cut into the lead and make this a sixpoint game he can allow jeff cable to set up full court pressure which virginia has struggled with over the last few minutes one of two and hauser with the rebound 6558 of course virginia with two point guards on the floor with clark and beekman looking to run some clock here churning toward the one minute mark on the drive beakman lays it up off the iron and its going to stay on this end i believe the officials are going to go look at this one as well maurice meekman with a nice drive just unable to finish it off going to the left but getting back involved in the play and that looks like it went off championing uncertainty and virginia going to keep this basketball an opportunity to burn 20 more seconds off of the game clock crucial opportunity here for pittsburgh to be able to get a stop ill take another look see champane coming in to rebound getting a hand on the ball but right there you see thats justin champagnes left hand taking the basketball out of bounds reece beekman had a hand up but got his hand out of the way at the point well i tell you what obi the more we look at it Laughter isnt that always the way did beekman actually get a finger on that basketball after it hit sam pennys hand and do you have enough evidence to see that i think thats going to be the biggest key beekman on our original look got his hand out of the way but i believe thats what the officials are looking at right now to see if beekman did touch that basketball last which it looked clearly off of champagne at first 6558 virginia pretty good comeback here for the pit panthers they look dead and gone about seven minutes ago yeah i dont believe there was enough evidence there to overturn that one so it will be virginia ball as you mentioned an opportunity to really burn down some more of that clock for the cavaliers they havent been as good today at the foul line as they typically are but they can win games at the foul line like nobodys business so kihei clark to put it in for the cavaliers up top for huff 50 seconds to go and although hes had some miscues here in the second half hes the guy if youre virginia you want to have the basketball to make a play in crunch time clark delivers once again tony with a quick strike on the other end clark trying to get free out of the double bowser with a loose ball got it free and a whistle with 271 seconds to go with kihei clark with a huge hoop for him and this is how hes built kihei clark is built to make big plays when his team needs him most regardless as to how things have gone for him over the past seven minutes kihei clark not afraid of the moment and being that guy that his teammates can rely on to go make a play when they need it trey murphy 88 foul shooter Applause 69 junior from durham north carolina and has another one coming for the cavaliers virginia just had their 15game acc winning streak broken last weekend and after that loss tony bennett questioned his teams toughness his team seemed to hear that because they came out played much tougher against nc state murphy was the guy who said i want to make sure hes not pointing a finger at me and the slam by champagne 19 seconds to go and a seven point lead for the cavaliers in a timeout kenobi i would have to take it even further and say virginia has exhibited you know a tremendous amount of toughness in this game as well because this pittsburgh team is a very tough team physically and mentally but virginia was able to match that in this game especially when things were going not in their direction and turned it around and most likely turned this into a win so 19 seconds to go as jeff cable burns his final timeout virginia with two remaining and a sevenpoint lead north carolina and duke still to come next on espn and hobie i want to make sure that we get a point across that jeff cable mentioned to us yesterday when you watch college basketball and when you hear people like you and i commentators talk about these young men young women and what theyre doing on and off the court we need to be reminded that they should be commended for what they have done after playing the sport this season with all the extremes that theyve had to deal with with covet with the social injustice everything that has happened this year each and every one of these young people need to be commended for going out and putting on the effort regardless as to what the performance on the floor looks like they deserve applause for being out there and really just participating at this point well they are in the arena and competing so hard to students as well first and foremost and a tie up on the plate and good defense it turned out to be a great defensive stop absolutely virginia will have the ball but give pittsburgh credit for not fouling been seeing the basketball expose audis tony getting his hands in there forcing the possession arrow and you would expect to see that again in the next track hauser again doubled up and another whistle 134 showing and so itll be hauser at 81 heading to the foul and again line as a team at 82 and sam hauser almost never hits the rim with anything ill tell you what he has been special here this evening 22 points eight for nine from the field three for four from three continues to make his free throws six rebounds only one turnover for hauser in this game and a great job defensively as well against possibly the acc player of the year and justin champion so virginia 7165 with about seven seconds to go and another foul to slow down kihei clark but does not appear its going to be enough to slow down virginia tonight as they are churning toward their 13th victory and their ninth in conference play when the cavaliers will go to 91 first place in the acc hey clark thats 75 you make 75 on this team and youre on the second rung as far as the foul shooter is concerned yeah they tell you you need to stick around after practice and get some more free throws up yes you do well pitt with a fine battle here and down the stretch they close the gap but with two seconds to go virginia can start celebrating the win jay huff and company well the tough victory against the pit panther team was trying to make it back to back wins against top 20 opponents as huff fouls out of the game with 13 points but i dont think that jeff cable can be disappointed with his teams effort in this game weve talked about how do they respond after a big win well this is probably the best team theyve had to play on that second game and they came in with the right level of energy they approached the game the right way they had a stretch in the second half where they allowed virginia to build a 16 point lead but they fought their way back into this to make it a game and im sure coach cable is happy with the effort his team has given here tonight but virginia will pull this one out and win again theyre now 133 91 in the conference for corey alexander im dave obrien thanks so much for joining us right now to dan shulman and jay bilas with tonights sonic blockbuster north carolina and duke obie thank you and welcome to saturday primetime presented by h and r block this is the acc on e
