14 career victories second alltime behind Coach K yeah I mean you know theyre honoring the 2003 team whos National Championship team here hes in the naysmith Hall of Fame not a lot left for him to do as far as accolades are concerned just winning ball games Applause taking the program to the final four five times came home with that National Title against Kansas at all three and well certainly be talking about that through the course of the afternoon mince with the shot too strong Edwards got a piece of it back to mince Edwards over Carr really got to clear out inside that time a kind of a broken play now car a good Defender at his size but nine personal fouls in his last two games so hes had some issues staying on the floor Jesse Edwards averaging a doubledouble for the orange over 14 points per game and the 10 rebounds theyre going to see different people in that at the top of the uh in the middle of the zone They had Hildreth that rotation that his car his shot was deflected to hildred Benny Williams came over the top to knock it out of bounds well stay at this end of the floor look at the shot clock Mike 21 for Wake Applause heres a look at our four keys to the game with Mike jaminski yeah real quick wake forth they need to create easy offense for Syracuse defend the three which has uh been the problem for them the last four games yeah Mike on Tuesday against Georgia Tech the yellow jackets set a program record making 183 pointers and as you mentioned the last two games opponents have attempted 81 threes against the orange as it bounces out for Williams well I mean you know the zone is that you want to encourage that but theyve just run into some incredibly hot teams teams have averaged 15 made threes in the last four Williamson cannot find the range from threepoint territory and you know with with Monsanto out Williamson who had a very good game against BC uh theyre gonna rely on him for threes Gerard to Edwards fouled on the play that was Clinton who hit the deck for Wake Forest so look I mean Edwards loves to work on that right block and still very good nice under control Music 74 from the line on the season for Edwards you know its just funny Steve Ford was telling us today before shoot around that in his entire coaching career hes never played a team the last game of the regular season but he had never played before that year and the ironic thing is theyre going to play Mike next week at the ACC tournament well the game film will be fresh yeah for both of them well just see what the small number in front of each team is going to be on the second day of the tournament thats amazing I still use the term game film when uh that film I know possessing the Wake Forest Applause s Applause foreign Applause Music Applause calculating the angles Music on the other side but uh you know again this was a its a smaller backcourt for Wake forests are taking advantage Gerard had 11 points on Tuesday against Georgia Tech was two of six on threepoint attempts now wake is over four on threepoint attempts Mintz runs it up trying to slice through the defense couldnt spin it off the glass car up to Williamson trying to beat Gerard to the rim and he will problems nobody rotated back defensively for Syracuse now Applause thank you Applause everybody Applause apologize for two shots will be Jesse Edwards Music thank you substitution for the demon Defense number 33 Matthew Marsh into the lineup Applause Applause 15 Applause help the field goal for Tyree Applebee Music Wake Forest four Music its here Ford truck month fall is brought to you by Toyota visit your local Toyota dealers today Toyota Lets Go Places and by CPI Security CPI home security that protects what matters most and by Continental Tire the smart choice in tires before seniors honored prior to the game cymer Torrance Jesse Edwards and Joe Gerard well the good news for Syracuse is that wake has started out cold from threepoint line 04 and two baskets they did get have been in transition which we thought would be a strength for them today Tom yeah Wake Forest is old for four from threepoint real estate real estate as Mintz brings it up for the orange Williams trying to go over Clinton and he came up short getting some room to operate on that side good defensive possession for Clinton Wake Forest is 18 and 12 on the season 109 at ACC play three and six on the road in the ACC they work it around the perimeter Williamson attacking the glass Edwards stares it out of the air Betty better jobs by Benny Williams to get out and cover that corner has been exposed in the zone from three he did a nice job forcing the two Gerard once again trying to work on Williamson he was successful the first time doing this Marsh came over with a health defense and the ball goes out of bounds Edwards could not save it on the Baseline its not too often that you see a point guard in the post get double team but Marsh came over to help out that time and worked they got the turnover Coach Boeheim the most seasons at a current School the most wins on an alma mater played here assistant coach head coach starting in 1976 Clintons got three and hes the guy whose role is expanded in the last seven eight games Steve Ford costs are very highly of him and his role and hes also a guy who can make threes 42 on the year you know its going to take your breath away when you come out here whenever that day comes and Jim Boeheim and thats it on the sideline Syracuse Joe Gerard with a three for the orange a good start for him and uh that that is really going to help him settle into the game get past the senior day ceremonies hes made both of his shot attempts and now up to Five Points for the leading scorer for Syracuse and sixth in the conference and thats the thing Appleby over the last three games Monsanto out has taken more threes than he normally would Monsanto leads the ACC in made threepointers Joe Gerard is tied for third thats being hurt hes missed the last two games and now this game and it was a noncontact injury for Monsanto making a move at NC State and just awkwardly twisting his knee and hes out for the season yeah those those noncontact injuries usually dont end up well and its you know I just hate that for him he worked so hard to come back from his Achilles injury and then now having to deal with this Applause 15th year overall for Steve Forbes came from East Tennessee State University out of the Southern Conference passing around the perimeter against the zone Mildred dropping in low to March for the yellow that alleyoop is there against this Zone and thats a terrific feed right there I mean thats Marshas strength hes throwing ball to rim to let him finish he is now 70 of 77 on field goal attempts this season now he doesnt make enough to meet the minimum to be amongst the stat leaders in field goal percentage or else he would be Far and Away number one in the league Gerard on the pivot Edwards with a volleyball but it goes to Appleby back to Carr lining up with three Marsh on the offensive glass high up High upward for two I think they might have slipped out of his hand a little bit good finish for him and the thing about Carr though also hes got that wrap on his right hand hes not thats really affected his shooting Wake Forest Final on number two Cameron Hildreth his first Hildreth has the foul for Wake Forest is first you see right there zoom in you know obviously not maybe affecting him a little bit on the defensive end as well but uh you know when thats your primary hand very debilitating to have all those wraps on Carr is one of those impact transfers that Steve Forbes has gotten in the last couple years and Williamson is down he collided with Gerard and he got the worst of it and the foul his first yeah heres the collision and that thats a function of how closely they want to guard Gerard and really kind of stay in his shirt good to see that both players seem to be okay after that Collision Gerard trying to free himself up lets it go for three par with the box out pretty nice job chasing by Williamson chasing Gerard around Lucas Taylor coming out of that corner and now Williamson Farr on the offensive end over the top is Bell on the ground and uh offensive rebounding now start to be in an issue with uh with Syracuse four offensive rebounds in the first half for Wake Forest Applause saw Copeland coming into the game for the orange Applause to try to feed the ball hit the Baseline and then Malik Brown ended up in the photographers row trying to save it those are times when Appleby he gets caught up in the air like that very fortunate that they didnt get a turnover 12 seconds on the shot clock hes better off making a mistake up on the rim than letting him get her offensive rebound entry to car with a turnaround and a shot like that is not going to affect be affected by that hand at all and he dinged up his right leg a little bit on that play he is a doubledigit score for the season Andrew Carr 111 points per game and the leading rebounder just under six thats Gerard with the jumper and a little follow away in touch making some tough shots so far in this game off the dribble Applause monsantos inquiry Lucas Taylor in the game now has seen his minutes go up shot clock is down to 10 for Wake Taylor Edwards another rebound Applause Music teams right now Mike are two of 14 from Beyond The Arc Vince with a dazzling dribble trying to finish it off tournaments and that was about as well as Taylor could have played him defensively what a fabulous righthand finish some magic from mints Applause one of the top freshmen in all of the nation Hallelujah to Marsh they could not execute it and they were probably would have been better served coming down with that one and then going back up Music mince in traffic draws the contact Applause Lucas Taylor picking up the foul for Wake Forest the freshman judaments a magical move up the glass for the orange Music Carmelo Anthony basketball royalty in the house with Chancellor Severide taking a few pictures he was here for the presentation last night where the O3 team watched the game well get into that as the game progresses heres the Blue Cross Blue Shield of North Carolina upcoming schedule and its Greensboro GMan thats the destination for the 29th time in the history of that tournament yeah I mean I you know getting nostalgic myself very special place for me all four years uh the tournament our teams played there and so very very special place for me Im glad to see it back there couple of ACC tournament titles for ug man in the game three times right yeah three finals two titles lost to North Carolina my junior year Dudley Bradley having a fabulous game in the finals like it was yesterday well it was it was a much shorter Affair back then true 27 and seven teams then and in my senior year eight teams when Georgia Tech came into the league Syracuse into the league for the 1314 season and while no team has come out of Tuesday to win the tournament yet the teams have come out of Wednesday so good news for both of these clubs being the 89 game and last year Virginia Tech seventh seed going on to win defeated Duke of the title game in Brooklyn New York Wake Forest has won four ACC tournament titles and its story in history the last one coming in 1996 also one in 95 steel mints trying to go all the way Apple we might have got a piece of that one its out of bounds and to the orange when he gets running downhill it is awfully tough to stop him and they were able to at least get a recycle on the underneath out of bounds you know this is a game and Mintz loves to operate in the paint with his size its really going to be an advantage for him Vince has four points so far Midway through this first half to ride leads away with seven fact hes the leading scorer in this game on the glass copen on the other side a couple of golden chances for the orange and it goes out of bounds and Brown was right there on the doorstep Mike had missed yeah you got a couple guys who arent big time scorers in there good job on the glass Applause car spinning in the paint Edwards the closest Orange player and his first personal yeah and thats a tough one you know and he really yeah hes Jesse Edwards got to be selective with when he uses those fouls I think that was one he could have saved and just bothered the shot Andrew Carr 77 percent from the line for the Junior from Westchester Pennsylvania struggled in that loss at home against Boston College my car just three points and three boards and only took three shots he started and played 28 minutes Applause you know a very good score but a double figure rebounder nine times this year and uh right from the start Steve Forbes liked him defensively Copeland trying to shake Appleby they got it to Edwards Quick Pass from brown to Edwards nice job everybody keeping the ball alive that time a lot of and uh Steve Forbes getting hit with a technical foul weve seen a lot of technicals called this year Applause and all the assistant coaches have kind of rallied around Steve Forbes to try to keep him from getting that second one hes calmed down so he was really upset with the no call there on the last play Applause so Gerard handling the technical free throws that is not the guy you want to see at the freethrow line if youre the opposition 86 percent to lead the teams Applause fourth in the conference with that 86 percent for Gerard and Coach Forbes still storming up and down those sidelines once again the winner of this game will be the number eight seed at the tournament next week single by in the 89 game the loser the nine seed Applause so far in half court wake has had trouble with the zone now I mean theyve got 10 seconds on the shot clock and not even looking inside Appleby hell just fire away see and you know with the zone at the end of the clock he cant do the things and break down people bending the rim at the other end Malik Brown and a timeout Wake Forest the orange start the break mints up ahead what a pass the brown its a 121 run Syracuse thank you Music foreign little big 2114 Syracuse here with the first half Tom wormy Mike Kaminsky are outstanding ACC college basketball production crew with you from the Dome and Jim Boeheim Court a lot of that time out Im sure was addressed that how theyre going to attack the zone Hildreth lifted away tried to get at the car who is down behind the play had a shot right there but was looking to pass this is Edwards great position inside direct pass with two feet in the lane its going to be converted Edwards is three of three from the floor hes got eight points Applause stolen by Mintz drops it down low and in Rhythm Brown to the rim and another timeout thank you how about Judah Mintz who leads the ACC and steals finds his teammate for another two minutes from the 2003 National Championship team including Carmelo Anthony who had this message for the current team two guys is carrying the torch so never get discouraged never get mad at what this man is saying he just know that hes going to talk and hes going to yell and hes going to scream but at the end of the day he got nothing but love for yall and we got nothing but love for yall and we support yall and Carmelo Anthony in attendance for our game this afternoon that 03 team will be honored at halftime it was an emotional night Mike and Carmelo said that was the first time he watched that national title game from start to finish yeah and you know I think the program and the people the fan base needed a feelgood moment and they certainly had one last night and seems to have carried over into this game today so far the words of inspiration for the current orange group now they made it they made it known they didnt want to walk out of here having witnessed the loss great evening they played the game in its entirety on the big screen and the players from that team offensive foul against the orange had some running commentary along with Coach Boeheim of course Hakeem Warwick and Jerry McNamara will have their jerseys retired after the game today so its just the complete weekend of festivities and celebration of orange basketball Wake Forest is trying to upset all of that this afternoon trying to get their first win ever in the dome theyre 05 but right now to this point in the game theyve looked really disjointed offensively especially in the half court thats just a couple of passes on the outside and Clinton getting a contested three Wake Forest will maintain possession by the way Mike wake today one of 12 on threepoint shooting and they are a good threepoint shooting team 38 of the Season second best of the ACC ENT its a departure from teams in the last four who have not been very proficient threepoint Shooters but have really shot above their level now wake makes almost 10 per game the last opponent inside the Dome on Tuesday Georgia Tech but a lot of that was Monsanto who talked about him leading the you know makes per game and total overall makes a yellow jackets made 18 threes on Tuesday and a winning effort they go inside to Marsh defense collapses got the shot away off the backboard for Appleby theyre going to take a look at that I dont know why Marsh didnt turn around and just scoring I mean it was Point Blank Range and he had nobody around him right there I mean he goes up with his right hand and heres the thing I mean we dont see the clock in that situation and uh theyre gonna count it and that was a huge bailout and to this point Tom bid kept Appleby under control 6 40 enrolling here in our first half of play 13th alltime meeting that is mints along the Baseline so right now Appleby leads the way with Five Points bailout three to get to get to that point thats a three from the corner thats Taylor and hes a guy you know coming in limited uh I mean two of five from three that you get your opportunities with injuries and lets see if he can step up and make a contribution its just the eighth game this season where he has seen action the sophomore probably of course North Carolina Edwards up high for the board on the offensive class and Clinton might have got a piece of them second on Clinton so Edwards is going back to the free throw line 204 from the line in the game learn to come back in with Marsh and theyre going to lose Clintons ability to shoot from the perimeter Edwards also has five rebounds in the game Coyote Tractor from my experience if you work the land you got to be a jack of all trades you got to have a little bit of optimism a whole lot of getgo soft roll inside the Dome Syracuse trying to snap a fourgame losing streak at the end of the season and one three in a row prior to that losing streak Mike against NC State Florida State and Boston College and thatll losing streak before that so theyve been very very streaky its a wild pass by Appleby theyre trying to throw over the top to Marsh as much as they can Copeland with a spin and the fish just came off the rim for brown and Edwards lost it brought it down Appleby was able to get the strip Applebee threepointer ripping the ropes for Wake Forest thats his game you know this and wake us look so much better when theyve been able to get out in the open floor and run Applause deacons started the game one of 12 on threepointers theyve made their last three threepoint tries Gerard let the defender Go On by Brown tried to follow Williamson grabs it inside of five minutes to go in the first half Applause intercept admits on a lot of their turnovers have just been careless passes mints Brown Edward a correction Copeland file on the floor passing in tight quarters oneonone situation seven steals now for the orange Applause 10 turnovers in the half early you know still four minutes two and a half minutes to go Appleby picked up the foul his first Goodyear Copeland at the freethrow line The Freshman from Philadelphia Pennsylvania Applause did not score in the game against Georgia Tech played six minutes off the bench Applause Tyree Appleby had a gamehigh 23 points in the loss to Boston College at home on Tuesday for Wake Forest foreign Catch and Release and he hits a three thats their last four made from threepoint real estate for Wake Forest yeah and uh Williamson again a guy who can step up give them a little uh added Firepower from the perimeter could have found fouling right finishing left that time just does so much with the ball off the dribble assistant you know he gets the foul because he brings it right back into the defender right in there takes the body and theres not a lot that Williamson is going to do right there second foul against Williamson to put Mintz at the freethrow line 75 percent for the season top freshman score in the ACC ENT 162 points per game weve got Edwards Gerard mints with uh 26 or 27 of the 32 points orange is led by as many as 11 in this first half Applause passing tight quarters bounces away mints defender on his hip finds Gerard unleashing a three I tell you what wake is really lucky at this point to be down only six as sloppy as theyve been Alby make that three made its last five threepoint attempts Applause 11 points for Applebees the first player in our game to get the double digits good Hustle by Appleby couldnt save it out of bounds itll be orange basketball when we come back this threepointer belongs to Appleby way behind the line for three for Tyree Appleby Music Applause 3229 orange with 360 to go in our first half of play coming up at halftime the 2003 national champions from Syracuse will be honored here inside the Dome I dont I dont know if theres ever been one freshman whos had as big an impact with the team as Carmelo Anthony had with that club I mean you could look at the Kentuckys one and done National Championship in Dukes too uh you know a bunch of like you know freshmen doing it but what a special year Jerry McNamara is running mate also a freshman national champs in 2003 defeated Kansas at the Louisiana Superdome what a run it was through the title Mike they were unranked to start the season 130 games Edwards of the alleyoop a little bit behind him twisting to try to get that ball up on the rim it goes out of bounds and stays with Syracuse another reason why I dont put too much in preseason polls now you know I dont know that they could have projected the impact those two guys would have on the season it was interesting last night they said they started the run in Boston then went to Albany and both of those places felt like home games for the orange as judamins hits it as fouled it really has been fun to watch his game expand I mean I think everything is slowed down for him which it takes freshmen a little while for that to happen especially at the point guard position despite the Miss mints fifth in the nation in freshman scoring just over 16 points per game its got 11 tonight four of eight first Miss from the free throw line moments ago by Judah Mintz 240 to go on the clock Edwards steps to the passing Lane deflects it away Mintz leads the break just inside throw line with the soft touch mints just hes really gotten downhill and gotten deep into the paint off of the break the Wake has really got a zero they got to chip in with somebody else on him and try to stop him Applause looking for a safety valve in Applebee car tracks Down The Long rebound closing in on two minutes to go in the half you know its got to be fascinating to talk to former players because the one constant has been through this time has been uh Jim Boeheim in this zone so to see you know come and see get guys opinions on what the what these guys are doing out on the floor because theyve all been there Forest had made five threes in a row prior to the missed by Appleby on this possession traveling violation and back to the orange Applause seven point game with 157 remaining in the half from Wake standpoint that turnover a dead ball turnover so they can get back and get set defensively wake has lost three of its last four as well both of these teams looking for some momentum headed to Greensboro next week where they will oppose one another Gerard misses Marsh goes high for the rebound Appleby crossed it over and lost it open up ahead Gerard Carr gets back in the play and fouls Gerard second personal foul on Carr Music and that just uh Applebees just completely lost the basketball and actually you know Gerard I think he just he gave up on completing the play but he did a nice job of drawing the foul the senior from Glenns Falls New York about 160 miles due east of Syracuse High School Legend on the football field and basketball court 122 straight starts Mike it is 124 games played in an orange uniform and uh you know a lot of them at the point guard position and I think are much better suited this year moving off the ball with mints coming in double double figures 24 times this season for Gerard Williamson both sides of the rim Marsh couldnt complete the play mids got caught in midair and Taylor picked it off its got Appleby to his right leans into a three Gerard Williamson had it for a moment and now Appleby takes it from Mintz does anybody want the ball Williamson along the Baseline and he lost the handle sometimes the ball has a mind of its own erratic play that was crazy 14 turnovers by wake and got a bit of a wardrobe malfunction there GMan the bottom of Gerard Shu has come dislodged and there you see there you see the pit stops and getting some fresh tires do you flashback to Zion Williamson when he stepped out of his shoe or threw it rather interesting I dont know Joe is that quick its a little smaller too thats Edwards the big man on the class over Applause so well Gerard makes a pit stop and changes athletic footwear we play on with 30 seconds to go in the half and Edwards has been really efficient in this half 11 points eight boards for him four of five from the floor for Edwards as well and he blocks that shot of Carr hands it off to mince see nice guy thats what I talk about the maturity Mints not forcing the action right there soy didnt have numbers let everybody come and set up mints Applause tough Fall Away on the Baseline too strong and thatll end the half a 10point Advantage for the orange Music going just one of eight from threepoint distance but its Syracuse to the locker room in any kind of histrionics on the floor because that whistle is running a little hot right now technical foul right at the end of the first half here we go with the second half lets Crank It Up from the Dome Syracuse New York wormy jaminsky in our upstanding ACC college basketball production approved Peter Francis Award winner Mike tominsky well and I thank you to you and our crew for surprising me with that and you all make it very very special so thats Clinton reaching in for his third person my only regret is I dont have a wildclad coat to wear to the skeeter was famous for those you could wear like one of those jackets with a Crest on it if you want or something and you win the award you can do whatever you want saved by Wake Forest I can throw it into the crowd when Im done thats true I hope you get it back and dry clean Applebee through the defense aerial pass milfords been quiet in this game Mike Applause Williamson is open for a three and hes going to hit that more often than not and uh you know he couldnt have scripted a better start five points for Wake right out of the shoot and that technical foul gives them a little bit of momentum six of their last nine threepointers made this is mints getting created too strong that would have been better giving that one up he was in a tough position yeah I think the silverth has not really had his opportunities against the zones hes been very widened and hasnt done much out in the open floor either hes over two shooting in the game Edwards now Mike with his 13th DoubleDouble of the season thats Gerard Applause Gerard with 12 into double digits 25th time this season and the 82nd time in his Syracuse career Clinton over the shoulder and really nice pass by Appleby that time they got little man principle against the zone They screamed up top let apple b get into the paint and he finished it off for a teammate four assists for Appleby in the game I tell you Clinton is going to be a really nice player for this Wake Forest team in a congested area got fouled Applause Malik Brown has committed the game for the orange Applause I think theyre trying to get clarification on who that was on I too am seeking clarification Mike Kaminsky arent we all on a number of life in general yes absolutely and you notice uh coach boeheims warmup jacket there thats the old logo from old three Mike that s through the basketball what they wore in the Run his third personal so they they gave it to Carmike thats his third this is Gerard Edward somehow got his hands on the ball got tangled up with Carr and hes picked up another thats number four on car and I think the reason he got that is he was actually almost face guarding Edwards they were tangled up I thought the call could have gone either way but theyre gonna have to come in with Marsh picked up the last two fouls this is the first one right there trying to tie up mints and it looked like Clinton actually had it first and then he filed Edwards going for the rebound and weve got a wedgie luckily almost an atomic wedgie not Atomic yeah heres that second foul as Carr and Edwards got tangled up Edwards by the way 11 points 11 boards the DoubleDouble card of the bench with the four personals Mike and thats you know weve talked about a car limited with that hand injury but not as mobile as or much more mobile than Marsh tree has bothered him from him for the last several games heard it on the road at BC Applause Williamson that might have been deflected and it was Brown yeah closing quickly Mike Applause Torrance senior right here in Syracuse and a transfer from Marquette you know with bell and brown out there theyve got the length on the wings to get out and bother shots Gerard Lawrence got it back Edwards demanding the ball trying to make the move against Marsh and the News out of bounds and will stay with Syracuse I cant remember a game where theres been less positive control with the basketball than this one its been all over the place how about 15 turnovers for Wake Forest still in this ball game 4136 over the top Clinton Applebee and youre underneath out of bounds and you throw it back to the half court you are just inviting that play talk about life Clinton has that Gerard I had to kick it back out Bell one dribble and Fire Applause okay from three but no hesitation in looking for his own shot there double team in the corner on Williamson live Bell and Edwards a great job bottling him up Music likes what he sees with uh both Brown and Bell out there on that back part of the zone Bell had not played in the last two games Mike didnt get into the lineup fight for the rebound one by Edwards Applause 12 boards now for Edwards Gerard back to Edwards for the jam and he was fouled right in this thing we talked about it with Gerard theyre really jumping out hard on him just leaving Edwards completely alone the backside late getting in defensively terrific pass whats up such an awesome look from right behind the backboard inside the Dome thats just thats just a just a senior play by Joe Gerard knowing that theyre going to really jump him hard try to get the ball out of his hands well they did and led to a dunk despite the Miss 13 points in the game for Edwards defending Hildreth forces up the shot and creates contact and that was cam Hildreth really trying to get into the offensive flow inside the Dome Warwick was a player of the year in the Big East and this is The Fresh Market discover the best side by side McNamara and Warwick and I tell you you know it used to be 1 000 points in your career was a benchmark you get two guys on the same team scoring 2 000 points in their career youre youre doing a lot of work Jerry McNamara fourth in school history on the left current assistant coach for Jim Boeheim Hakeem Warwick fifth in school history with his point production Jerry McNamara 400 career threes thats a School record was the player of the year in o5 a big East Champion and the tournament MVP hes currently a gleague assistant with the ignite Hildreth at the freethrow line for Wake Forest at his first point just got his call up from the Pistons as well so hes on the uh hes on the big roster I will say there were two other big Ovations at the event last night when buddy sent the video message and when Jimmy sent the video message you recall a youngster in those pictures of the national title with Coach bayheim holding his hand that was Jimmy Bell Edwards out leaping everybody did a nice job getting positioned that time anticipating the long rebound Edwards Powers his way in and the follow for two Willie Brown on the tip Ill tell you Bell and brown not only doing well defensively but also giving them a little lift on the offensive end Music Applause the lead is eight for Syracuse right there I mean thats usually a place that you can attack the Zone but nothing happening for Clinton Williamson on the attack Marsha to send it back out shot clocks down a two for Clinton Marsh knocked it away from Edwards the orange has it mince will cross it over one on four I think Ill pull it back waiting for reinforcements Bell and brown have combined for nine points got the switch shot clock running down as well nice job by Mars playing that switch though Williamson had to reel it back in well Bell recovered quickly into the corner talking about thats been a soft spot over the last four games for uh this Zone not so much in this game shot clock inside at 10 for Hildreth flipping around the edge Edwards put up the roadblock three seconds on the shot clock Applause Gerard up against Marsh absorbing contact and scoring I like that didnt complain about anything just dusted himself up got any other floor but a nice job concentrating through contact Applause 14 points now for Gerard heres Clinton tees up the three side rim and out of bounds and weve seen a lot from Gerard in this game Tom and hes taken what the defense has given him hes gone inside he scored off the dribble hes posted up a couple times in this game Applause I got a chance to talk to Gerard Mike prior to the game and he took those words to Heart from Carmelo Anthony last night at the event Carmelo looked up into the second mezzanine and directed his comments at the current team thats Edwards going up the ladder from mints the back line falling to sleep poor Wake Forest so both Clinton and Carr on the court with four persons hilltrip he was just really aware of where Edwards was the threat of his shot block force that Miss saw Bell and Gerard Collide now Gerard feeds it off to Edwards tried to follow his Miss offensive golden he was up on the cylinder two Forest basketball the different feel to the effort of the orange Mike is compared to Tuesday when Georgia Tech came in and made 18 threes a School record well and its its the looks that wake is not getting and thats the big thing is put this up this Zone has been active theyve recovered the shooters and uh its been at the end of the shot clock in a lot of possessions for Wake Forest in the half court one of the first times theyve gotten that pass over the top five points for Carr the lead back to 10 with 12 30 to go and rolling in our second half of play I think you know Bill I think Syracuse will sacrifice that a little bit to stay at home on those threepoint shooters commence Scoops it up shot clocks in 10 its going to be a foul on Taylor inside second on Taylor Applause fifth on the team for Wake Forest in the second half Gerard wants it right back lost that handle Defender fell down got it back heres Bell Barr gobbles it up gives it to Applebee and then he got tangled up and Appleby went flying hes okay right in front of our broadcast position theres a pretty nice hustle I mean that was a little bit of a careless pass its just good hustle clean play by both players Bell was going for the Steal Applause for the jam and the rim rocker on the Elliott second time Applebys gotten that play theyre getting that little screen he gets into the lane and makes things happen on the LOB six assists for Appleby is average best of the conference 62 per game Tyree Appleby Edwards free throws coming and that could be number five on Carr OT and it is so Andrew Carr going to the Wake Forest bench on a permanent basis Wake Forest 44 chucking in for the despite the protests from Steve Forbes Hakeem Warwick will be our very special guest when we come back inside the Dome as we celebrate the national title from all three so sweet so its an eightpoint lead for the orange here in the second half final regular season game it is a day to celebrate orange basketball weve

this is pretty much its like a format the same guys the same length and athleticism and so Im always watching the game and and watching and critiquing in uh in O3 you guys start youre not ranked the beginning of the year was there a game that you or a time in the year when you when you all felt like hey weve got something special here uh I think for me I knew we were going to be a special its just that that first pickup game playing with carmelo and GMAC but if it was a game that I felt that we could possibly win it all it was uh I think we need fit at home uh they were ranked the number one team and it was a come from behind Victory the fans rushed the floor and uh with them being the number one team I just felt like we can be number one then I mean we can beat anybody what were your first impressions when you saw Carmelo Anthony and Jerry McNamara uh because they were the freshmen coming in they were the first one um so when I first saw them Im looking at like this they hype about these two guys like Melo got that little puzzy pudgy did not like the strongest looking guy uh GMAC he dont look like hes going to be out there giving people 30 um but as soon as they start playing I knew right away they were special how long does it take you how long does it take a player in this system to really understand the zone defense and how to play it the way Coach Boeheim wants to play uh it takes a while because its not your normal 23 Zone um especially like coming from Kyle Im in high school and AAU uh a lot of the time teams they play zone because they they want you to shoot they want to keep you out the thing for the good Syracuse Zone we we try to take away those those shots and great moving side by Edward Applause Edward 2003 you had that incredible moment where you blocked the shock from the corner preserved the threepoint win against Kansas but youre at the freethrow line prior to that and I like what you said last night at the viewing event of the O3 national title game you were very honest about those free throws that could have maybe sealed it prior to your defensive play yeah definitely uh I never thought that type of pressure before especially after Ive been missing that that first one um so thats why I knew I had to make that play and make that block and I was just glad I was able to get out there and get a hand on it okay I asked you about the Zone how long does it take a freshman to get used to coach bayheim still working on it I mean it depends on the player his son and some guys have never been some guy that took four or five years but with me uh I think coming into my sophomore year he would try to yell at me and I just would be like nah you need me now Im just going Im not gonna let it affect me as much but he he definitely uh Applause until your senior year but I think he wants you to stay on the air with us because theyve gone on a little bit of a run Edwards again Music again thank you so much for your time congratulations on all your success and to your teammates 03 number one in the nation thank you man thanks for having me its here Ford truck month your day to remember no doubt about that its been efficient all game long nice job on the rebound very active inside very quick Wake Forest has not been able to match his agility inside hes coming up on a big boy DoubleDouble time 16 rebounds to go with his 23 points 2020 game for him maybe be a nice way to go out here at home we will see Edwards has the last eight points on the 80 Run Jesse Edwards fifth time this season hes gone for 20 points or more double figure rebounds 15 times this year and remember Mike he missed the good part of the season last year with a wrist injury against Boston College I thought that thats when this team season really took a big hit with with that injury so important uh although you know what its its good to see that um Chris Brown or Malik Brown and Chris Bell have been rewarded with their defensive effort in this Zone Jim Boeheim has stayed with this lineup for a good 10 minutes now Edwards also has five steals to tie a career high and two blocks hes got another rebound just rips it away from Wake Forest and uh you know youre going to settle for youll youll love Appleby settling for that shot mince on the handle wake is just one of nine on threes in the second half which is Edwards getting creative that ones spun around the edge of the rim in clockwise fashion counter or wooden fall form everything else is falling though Applause shot clock to 10 for Wade gotta get busy right back to Appleby hes got the range see at least then though they got a touch at the freethrow line collapsed a little bit and apple be able to catch in rhythm better look at the three 18 points for Appleby Edwards had the ball on his hip and lost it flicks it out to mince inside of eight minutes to go in the second half Steve Forbes really upset that his team didnt come up with that Aaron pass Gerard turns around Applause us back at the end of the clock to be making things happen but Gerard did that off the dribble Applause Taylor for three Edwards just cleans the glass one more time yeah there hasnt uh well I mean with Carr and with Marsh not in the game theres not that offensive rebounding presence car has fouled out for Wake Forest Applause Gerard against two Defenders Applause just you know Jesse Edwards is just hes just covering every shot on both ends of the floor Zach Keller is in there for Wake Forest number 25 in Black shot clock at 10 turn around Taylor big Collision Keller came flying in and collided with bell is first personal you want to stay tuned for the fast break its presented by your local Ford dealer will look at gmans seasonending awards in the ACC the orange out in front of Wake Forest senior night in the final day of the regular season foreign Applause 6247 late in the second half Wake Forest and Syracuse time for the drive presented by Defender yeah weve talked about him getting downhill and that going right finishing left love to get to that right hand and so very tough to keep him from getting where he wants to go oh 13 points for Mintz one of three doubledigit scores in the game of the orange Edwards has 23 Gerard has 16 two of the four seniors honored prior to the game Edwards and Gerard Applause trying to go out with a victory GMan inside the Dome and snap a fourgame losing streak at the end of the season back at 03 the orange went undefeated inside the Dome on their way to a national title Syracuse has left some points at the freethrow line uh 12 of 20 now in the game Appleby elevates and rattles it home well and we saw this at the end of the first half that Wake Forest came alive from the three points for Appleby as Mintz hits the deck and got five and Lucas Taylors got to be careful he cant be going like that with the referees already havent blown two technicals sophomores dont get that kind of latitude third on Taylor puts mints at the freethrow line Applause a freshman from Fort Washington Maryland out of Oak Hill Academy in Virginia Applause just on the team and assist best of the league and steals started every game this season in an orange uniform for the Freshman trying to get around the screen Appleby puts up the three Gerard poked it away and that ones saved by Brown all right Applebee hadnt had the best shooting day today Tom but the thing is hes gotten his numbers uh they made him work for him but he hasnt had any help out there offensively he is five of 12 on threepoint tries nine made threes for Wake Forest Gerard was online but misses orange just two of 13 on threes Williamson Williamson knocks it down and this is uh you know a couple of sleepy possessions for Syracuse and a couple of Threes all of a sudden things tighten up a little bit Applause demon beaks the best at making threes in the regular season in the ACC ENT trying to climb back into this one Gerard and Williamson Gerard with a twisting shot he hit the deck Edwards cleans it up 25 points for Edwards got another rebound 19 hes one away from a 2020 game mid stumbling got it away Applause Miss from Bell and now Edwards has the 2020 game GMan with 25 points 21 boards one short of his career high which he set against Bryant this season Keller inside fights for weight Edwards has been everywhere both ends of the floor its a fabulous game for him but uh a little too early for Syracuse to go into Victory Trot right now Jim Beam wants to talk things over Timeout on the court 11 Point difference just inside of four minutes to go in regulation foreign by 11 time for our Coyote Tractor turning point in this second half Syracuse trying to send those seniors out with a victory Mike yeah and its been in the Tomb and that have been terrific today in uh Edwards Applause just loves working on that block and Jim payheim is really liking what he sees with uh with brown and Bell in there for defensive purposes so hes got three scores on the four Jesse Edwards 25 points that leads everybody thats too shy of his career high of 27 that was at BC this season what a game for Jesse Edwards what a way to finish up in the dome in all likelihood and so the last time somebody put a 2020 game together you go back to 09 and that six overtime Victory against UConn 2920 for Paul Harris to the Big East tournament poked away from Gerard into the backboard and Jesse Edwards has done it in about 35 minutes yeah Edwards grabs it Wake Forest basketball you know in that situation again if Minsk gets something up on the rim Edwards has got great position inside offensively Applause Williamson missed the mark the officials say it was not touched despite his protest yeah and actually I mean Brown got nice pressure on the shot but he was the first one to say I didnt touch it Applause Gerardo Brown really nice fine four assists for Gerard Applause now were inside of three minutes to go in regulation hildren strong move to the basket and that was against Edwards too the best shot Blocker in the conference but thats the strength of ildruth and hes been hes been quiet in this game four points for Hildreth now Mintz trying to beat Hildreth to the buckets too strong to Clinton thank you Keller Applause Wake Forest time out after the Keller basket I think youre you know I think Steve orb only has one left and the lead is down to single digits with 210 to go as we go around the ACC Virginia locked up the number two seed Mike with that win North Carolina and Duke second time this season Duke won the first meeting in Durham and for the number one seed pit against Miami for the top seed next week in Greensboro and you look around and those two are really coming off some head scratching you know Miami losing at home the Florida state with time Cleveland hitting that half court bomb to win the game and then pit had things in their hands and they go to Notre Dame but very emotional last home game for Mike Bray and that group they come out of there with the win so that sets up this game for the number one seed and a share of the regular season 6859 the orange in front after leading by 10 after the first half Tyree Appleby 21 points leading scorer for Wake Forest is five of 13 on threepoint tries wake has made 103s Mike theyve attempted 37 which is really par for the course for most recent opponents against the orange trying to shoot over volume Style well and its its just been a better offensive effort for this team uh for for Syracuse gotten to the freethrow line having left a few points there 14 of 22 from the line for the Orange shooting 41 as a team Syracuse really running clock in this possession Edwards up on the rim how about the pass from brown two really nice LOB clintonman too strong Hildreth on the weak side and thats Keller for the jam tell you what Zach Kellers come in and done a nice job with car fouling out and Marsh having issues Applause so Edwards has tied his career high with 27 points in this game youre going to see a 3020 maybe he is one rebound shy of his career high Applause Jesse Edwards leaving it all on the floor this last regular season home game he wants it again weve got Rim but not enough ball final minute Applause nine point game Appleby kept his footing Hildreth from Appleby went out dungeyman no no and then Steve Forbes waving his team up Applause coach Forbes does not have a timeout to work with as Hildreth picks up his second personal foul well Steve Forbes had to burn those timeouts to keep his team in the game and move 44 seconds right there Music so mints at the line in the bonus situation Applause 448 seconds to go perhaps this orange team Mike inspired by the words of Carmelo Anthony last night with the national title game watch event inspired or threatened a little bit of both yeah Applause the orange men hat on because that was the nickname back in the day Applause I think he misses hits the court orange basketball with Gerard Steve Ford is calling everybody back and its going to be a home win on senior day for this team and Jesse Edwards have an afternoon 27 points 20 rebounds five steals two blocks only turned it over twice and played the entire game and the fourgame losing streak is a distant memory so Syracuse will be the number eight seed Wake Forest the number nine seed they will meet in Greensboro on day two next week at the tournament and theyll have a rather fresh game film to review this was their only meeting in the regular season Now Syracuse 60 against Wake Forest in the dome against this defense I think it really helps Wake Forest playing them this soon afterwards Music as the Syracuse head coach Applause Gerard Edwards and mints the double digits and Edwards LED everybody with
